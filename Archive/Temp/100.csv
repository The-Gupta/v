Erythropoietin (EPO) is currently used in low-risk MDS, where it successfully corrects anemia in 50-70% of patients. However, some MDS patients are refractory to this treatment and little is known about the exact molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of EPO in these subjects. Here, we investigated the role of inositide pathways in low-risk MDS treated with EPO, mainly focusing on the Akt/PI-PLC (Phosphoinositide-Phospholipase C) gamma1 axis, which is activated by the EPO receptor, and PI-PLCbeta1/Cyclin D3 signaling, as Cyclin D3 is associated with hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation. Interestingly, EPO responder patients showed a specific activation of both the Akt/PI-PLCgamma1 pathway and beta-Globin gene expression, while nonresponders displayed an increase in PI-PLCbeta1 signaling. Moreover, in normal CD34+ cells induced to erythroid differentiation, PI-PLCbeta1 overexpression abrogated both EPO-induced Akt phosphorylation and beta-Globin expression. Overall, these findings suggest that PI-PLCbeta1 can act as a negative regulator of erythroid differentiation and confirm the involvement of Akt/PI-PLCgamma1 pathway in EPO signaling, therefore contributing to the comprehension of the effect of EPO in low-risk MDS and possibly paving the way to the identification of MDS patients at higher risk of refractoriness to EPO treatment.","['Follo, M Y', 'Mongiorgi, S', 'Clissa, C', 'Paolini, S', 'Martinelli, G', 'Martelli, A M', 'Fioravanti, G', 'Manzoli, L', 'Finelli, C', 'Cocco, L']","['Follo MY', 'Mongiorgi S', 'Clissa C', 'Paolini S', 'Martinelli G', 'Martelli AM', 'Fioravanti G', 'Manzoli L', 'Finelli C', 'Cocco L']","['Cellular Signalling Laboratory, Department of Human Anatomical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120518,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (beta-Globins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phospholipase C beta)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclin D3', 'Erythropoietin/*therapeutic use', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Phospholipase C beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Phospholipase C gamma/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'beta-Globins/genetics/metabolism']",2012/05/19 06:00,2013/02/13 06:00,['2012/05/19 06:00'],"['2012/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012133 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.133 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Dec;26(12):2474-82. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.133.

It is now recognized that telomere length maintenance or extension is indispensable for carcinogenesis. The early oncoproteins E6 and E7 are the main malignant transformation factors of HR-HPVs and they maintain telomeres by different mechanisms, of which E6 protein activating telomerase is well documented. Reports showed that E7 protein utilized an alternative lengthen of telomere (ALT) mechanism to restore telomere length, yet the underlying molecular basis remains largely unknown. We propose that degradation of tumor suppressor pRb family member p130 plays an essential role in E7-regulated telomere extension by ALT. ALT is a mechanism based on homologous recombination (HR) between telomere sister chromatids, and a number of proteins involved in the HR pathway, such as MRN [MRE11 (meiotic recombination 11)-Rad50-NBS1 (Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1)] complex are required for the ALT pathway. Rb family member p130 could inhibit ALT by interacting with Rad50, while HPV E7 could activate ALT by degrading p130. We will make E7 mutants which are defective in p130 degradation to test whether these cells have a limited life span. Besides, immunofluorescence assay will show an ALT-related promyelocytic leukemia (PML) body (APBs) in E7-expressing cells. Although cervical cancer usually has high telomerase activities since the expressing of HPV E6, the anti-telomerase therapy will be unavailable for cervical cancer since it may activate E7-induced ALT. Our hypothesis not only enrich the knowledge of the regulation of ALT, but also indicate that p130 may serve as a potential suppressor of ALT, and gene therapy of p130 may be used in cervical cancers.","['Zhang, WeiFang', 'Tian, YongHao', 'Chen, Jason J', 'Zhao, WeiMing', 'Yu, XiuPing']","['Zhang W', 'Tian Y', 'Chen JJ', 'Zhao W', 'Yu X']","['Department of Pathogenic Microbiology, Shandong University School of Medicine, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China. zhangweifang@sdu.edu.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120516,United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,"['0 (BCAR1 protein, human)', '0 (Crk-Associated Substrate Protein)', '0 (Papillomavirus E7 Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Crk-Associated Substrate Protein/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological', '*Models, Genetic', 'Papillomavirus E7 Proteins/*genetics', 'Telomere/*genetics', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*genetics']",2012/05/19 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/05/19 06:00'],"['2011/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0306-9877(12)00193-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mehy.2012.04.028 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 2012 Aug;79(2):178-80. doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2012.04.028.

The discovery of a variety of somatic spliceosomal mutations in haematological malignancies, including myeloid neoplasms and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia has pointed to a new leukaemogenic pathway involving spliceosomal dysfunction. Theoretically, spliceosomal mutations can lead to activation of incorrect splice sites, intron retention or aberrant alternative splicing occurring in patterns generated by mutations of individual spliceosomal proteins. Such events can produce a defective balance between protein isoforms leading to functional consequences including defective regulation of proliferation and differentiation. The observed pattern of occurrence of highly specific missense mutations, coupled with the lack of nonsense mutations and deletions, implies a gain-of-function or better gain-of-dysfunction mechanism. Incorrect splicing of downstream genes, such as tumour suppressor genes, may result in haploinsufficient expression through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Thus, spliceosomal mutations may, depending on the pattern of affected proteins, lead to similar functional effects on tumour suppressor genes as chromosomal deletions, epigenetic silencing or inactivating/hypomorphic mutations. The prognostic value of the most common mutations and their phenotypic association in the clinical setting is currently under investigation. It is likely that spliceosomal mutations may indicate sensitivity to spliceosome inhibitors applied in the form of a synthetic lethal approach.

Therefore, CLO-CYx4 can be considered a salvage therapy for adults with RRALs, and warrants further investigations.","['Zeidan, Amer M', 'Ricklis, Rebecca M', 'Carraway, Hetty E', 'Yun, Hyun D', 'Greer, Jacqueline M', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Levis, Mark J', 'McDevitt, Michael A', 'Pratz, Keith W', 'Showel, Margaret M', 'Gladstone, Douglas E', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Karp, Judith E']","['Zeidan AM', 'Ricklis RM', 'Carraway HE', 'Yun HD', 'Greer JM', 'Smith BD', 'Levis MJ', 'McDevitt MA', 'Pratz KW', 'Showel MM', 'Gladstone DE', 'Gore SD', 'Karp JE']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120518,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Clofarabine', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy/methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2012/05/19 06:00,2012/09/22 06:00,['2012/05/19 06:00'],"['2012/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2012.09142.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2012 Jul;158(2):198-207. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2012.09142.x.

However, severe pancreatitis sometimes occurs in patients receiving ASNase, because of an unknown mechanism. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between ASNase-induced pancreatic injury and plasma amino acid levels in patients undergoing ASNase therapy. METHODS: A total of 29 children aged 1-13.25 years (median age 4 years; male : female ratio 19 : 10) with ALL, who received induction therapy according to the Tokyo Children's Cancer Study Group L04-16 protocol, were studied. Levels of plasma amino acids and serum rapid turnover proteins (RTPs), pancreatic enzymes, and pancreatic protease inhibitors were measured before and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 weeks after the first administration of ASNase. RESULTS: Plasma asparagine levels were significantly lower after the first injection of ASNase (p < 0.01) and had almost recovered 2 weeks after the last ASNase injection. At 4 weeks after the first ASNase injection, serum aspartic acid, trypsin, and pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI) levels remained significantly higher than those before the first ASNase injection (p < 0.01), and serum levels of prealbumin and transferrin remained significantly lower than those before the first ASNase injection (p < 0.01). Plasma amino acid and serum RTP levels gradually normalized after the last ASNase injection. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of serum trypsin and PSTI were elevated during the 2 weeks after administration of ASNase, which suggested the presence of subclinical pancreatitis. This period is similar to the time period in the present study when the levels of plasma amino acids changed, thus suggesting that ASNase-induced pancreatic injury could be caused by the imbalance of plasma amino acid levels.","['Minowa, Kei', 'Suzuki, Mitsuyoshi', 'Fujimura, Junya', 'Saito, Masahiro', 'Koh, Katsuyoshi', 'Kikuchi, Akira', 'Hanada, Ryoji', 'Shimizu, Toshiaki']","['Minowa K', 'Suzuki M', 'Fujimura J', 'Saito M', 'Koh K', 'Kikuchi A', 'Hanada R', 'Shimizu T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. kei.miowakei@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,New Zealand,Drugs R D,Drugs in R&D,100883647,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (SPINK1 protein, human)', '50936-63-5 (Trypsin Inhibitor, Kazal Pancreatic)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amino Acids/*blood', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Pancreas/drug effects/enzymology/physiopathology', 'Pancreatitis/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Protease Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Trypsin/blood', 'Trypsin Inhibitor, Kazal Pancreatic']",2012/05/19 06:00,2012/10/30 06:00,['2012/05/19 06:00'],"['2012/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2165/11632990-000000000-00000 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs R D. 2012 Jun 1;12(2):49-55. doi: 10.2165/11632990-000000000-00000.,,,PMC3586115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the extent to which in vitro neural specification recapitulates in vivo neural specification remains to be fully established. We previously demonstrated that in the mouse embryo, activation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling promotes definitive neural stem cell (NSC) development through the upregulation of the transcription factor Zfhx1b. Here, we asked whether Zfhx1b is similarly required during neural lineage development of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Zfhx1b gene expression is rapidly upregulated in mouse ES cells cultured in a permissive neural-inducing environment, compared to ES cells in a standard pluripotency maintenance environment, and is potentiated by FGF signalling. However, overexpression of Zfhx1b in ES cells in maintenance conditions, containing serum and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), is sufficient to induce Sox1 expression, a marker found in neural precursors and to promote definitive NSC colony formation. Knockdown of Zfhx1b in ES cells using siRNA did not affect the initial transition of ES cells to a neural cell fate, but did diminish the ability of these neural cells to develop further into definitive NSCs. Thus, our findings using ES cells are congruent with evidence from mouse embryos and support a model, whereby intercellular FGF signaling induces Zfhx1b, which promotes the development of definitive NSCs subsequent to an initial neural specification event that is independent of this pathway.","['Dang, Lan T H', 'Wong, Loksum', 'Tropepe, Vincent']","['Dang LT', 'Wong L', 'Tropepe V']","['Department of Cell and Systems Biology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120627,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Fgf8 protein, mouse)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (ZEB2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Zinc Finger E-box Binding Homeobox 2)', '148997-75-5 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 8)', '93586-27-7 (chordin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/genetics/metabolism', 'Body Patterning', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 8/physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/physiology', 'Mice', 'Neural Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Up-Regulation', 'Zinc Finger E-box Binding Homeobox 2']",2012/05/19 06:00,2013/03/02 06:00,['2012/05/19 06:00'],"['2012/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2011.0593 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2012 Oct 10;21(15):2838-51. doi: 10.1089/scd.2011.0593.

TPMT activity exhibits an interindividual variability mainly as a result of genetic polymorphism. Patients with intermediate or deficient TPMT activity are at risk for toxicity after receiving standard doses of thiopurine drugs. The aim of this study was to determine the TPMT genotype and phenotype (activity) and investigate the correlation between TPMT genotype and enzyme activity in 43 Polish children receiving 6-MP during maintenance therapy in course of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), in 16 children with ALL at diagnosis and 39 healthy controls. TPMT activity was measured in RBC by HPLC method. Patients were genotyped for TPMT *2, *3A and *3C variant allelesusing PCR-RFLP and allele-specific PCR methods. In the group of children with ALL during maintenance therapy, median TPMT activity (29.3 nmol 6-mMP g(-1) Hb h(-1)) was significantly higher compared to the group of children with ALL at diagnosis (20.6 nmol 6-mMP g(-1) Hb h(-1), p = 0.0028), as well as to the control group (22.8 nmol 6-mMP g(-1) Hb h(-1), p = 0.0002). Percentages of individuals heterozygous for TPMT variant allele in respective groups were: 9.3, 6.2 and 15.5% (p > 0.05). In all the study groups heterozygous patients manifested a significantly lower TPMT activity as compared to the wild type homozygotes (16.7 +/- 2.1 vs. 31.2 +/- 6.8 nmol 6-mMP g(-1) Hb h(-1), p = 0.002, in children during maintenance therapy, 11.9 +/- 2.7 vs. 24.6 +/- 9.5, p = 0.0003, in the combined group of children with ALL at diagnosis and controls). The results present that commencement of the thiopurine therapy caused an increase in the TPMT activity in RBCs by approximately 20%. All patients heterozygous for the TPMT variant allele revealed decreased TPMT activity compared to TPMT wild-type patients. Since decreased TPMT activity is associated with higher risk for toxicity after receiving standard doses of thiopurine drugs, pretreatment determination of TPMT status, with phenotypic or genetic assay, should be performed routinely, also in Poland.","['Chrzanowska, Maria', 'Kuehn, Marta', 'Januszkiewicz-Lewandowska, Danuta', 'Kurzawski, Mateusz', 'Drozdzik, Marek']","['Chrzanowska M', 'Kuehn M', 'Januszkiewicz-Lewandowska D', 'Kurzawski M', 'Drozdzik M']","['Department of Physical Pharmacy and Pharmacokinetics, University of Medical Sciences, Swiecickiego 6, 60-781 Poznan, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Acta Pol Pharm,Acta poloniae pharmaceutica,2985167R,"['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocytes/enzymology', 'Female', 'Genetic Association Studies/methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Methyltransferases/blood/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*enzymology/*genetics']",2012/05/19 06:00,2012/07/18 06:00,['2012/05/19 06:00'],"['2012/05/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Acta Pol Pharm. 2012 May-Jun;69(3):405-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondary PRCA can be associated with various haematological disorders, such as chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The aim of the present review is to investigate the infrequent association between PRCA and lymphoproliferative disorders. PRCA might precede the appearance of lymphoma, may present simultaneously with the lymphoid neoplastic disease, or might appear following the lymphomatic disorder. Possible pathophysiological molecular mechanisms to explain the rare association between PRCA and lymphoproliferative disorders are reported. Most cases of PRCA are presumed to be autoimmune mediated by antibodies against either erythroblasts or erythropoietin, by T-cells secreting factors selectively inhibiting erythroid colonies in the bone marrow or by NK cells directly lysing erythroblasts. Finally, focus is given to the therapeutical approach, as several treatment regimens have failed for PRCA. Immunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy are effective for improving anaemia in the majority of patients with lymphoma-associated PRCA. Further investigation is required to define the pathophysiology of PRCA at a molecular level and to provide convincing evidence why it might appear as a rare complication of lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Vlachaki, Efthymia', 'Diamantidis, Michael D', 'Klonizakis, Philippos', 'Haralambidou-Vranitsa, Styliani', 'Ioannidou-Papagiannaki, Elizabeth', 'Klonizakis, Ioannis']","['Vlachaki E', 'Diamantidis MD', 'Klonizakis P', 'Haralambidou-Vranitsa S', 'Ioannidou-Papagiannaki E', 'Klonizakis I']","['Department of Haematology, Second Department of Internal Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Hippokration General Hospital, 546 42, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120419,United States,ScientificWorldJournal,TheScientificWorldJournal,101131163,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*complications', 'Plasmapheresis', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/complications/*immunology/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Splenectomy']",2012/05/18 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/05/18 06:00'],"['2011/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1100/2012/475313 [doi]'],ppublish,ScientificWorldJournal. 2012;2012:475313. doi: 10.1100/2012/475313.

Accessory signals from the microenvironment are critical for the survival, expansion, and progression of malignant B cells. We found that the CLL stroma included microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) expressing BAFF and APRIL, two TNF family members related to the T cell-associated B cell-stimulating molecule CD40L. Constitutive release of soluble BAFF and APRIL increased upon engagement of CD40 on MVECs by CD40L aberrantly expressed on CLL cells. In addition to enhancing MVEC expression of CD40, leukemic CD40L induced cleavases that elicited intracellular processing of pro-BAFF and pro-APRIL proteins in MVECs. The resulting soluble BAFF and APRIL proteins delivered survival, activation, Ig gene remodeling, and differentiation signals by stimulating CLL cells through TACI, BAFF-R, and BCMA receptors. BAFF and APRIL further amplified CLL cell survival by upregulating the expression of leukemic CD40L. Inhibition of TACI, BCMA, and BAFF-R expression on CLL cells; abrogation of CD40 expression in MVECs; or suppression of BAFF and APRIL cleavases in MVECs reduced the survival and diversification of malignant B cells. These data indicate that BAFF, APRIL, and CD40L form a CLL-enhancing bidirectional signaling network linking neoplastic B cells with the microvascular stroma.","['Cols, Montserrat', 'Barra, Carolina M', 'He, Bing', 'Puga, Irene', 'Xu, Weifeng', 'Chiu, April', 'Tam, Wayne', 'Knowles, Daniel M', 'Dillon, Stacey R', 'Leonard, John P', 'Furman, Richard R', 'Chen, Kang', 'Cerutti, Andrea']","['Cols M', 'Barra CM', 'He B', 'Puga I', 'Xu W', 'Chiu A', 'Tam W', 'Knowles DM', 'Dillon SR', 'Leonard JP', 'Furman RR', 'Chen K', 'Cerutti A']","['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120516,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (TNFSF13B protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['B-Cell Activating Factor/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CD40 Ligand/*metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA Interference', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor Cross-Talk/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13/*metabolism']",2012/05/18 06:00,2012/08/15 06:00,['2012/05/18 06:00'],"['2012/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1102066 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1102066 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2012 Jun 15;188(12):6071-83. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1102066.

Here, we investigated the nature and the dynamics of their release in functional cell studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Leukemia blasts were exposed to the intrinsic inducers of apoptotic cell death, cytosine arabinoside (AraC; 10 mug/ml) and etoposide (50 mug/ml), and cell death markers lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the nucleosomes were measured in the supernatants at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after drug application. In addition, HepG2 cells were exposed to extrinsic apoptosis-inducing tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL; 0.5 and 1.0 ng/ml) and the nucleosomes were measured in the supernatants after 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Finally, neutrophils preactivated by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) were co-incubated with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in the presence of collagen (type I; 8 mug/ml) for 15 or 30 minutes at 37 degrees C, and the nucleosome release into the supernatant was quantified. RESULTS: During treatment with AraC, cell viability constantly decreased. LDH and nucleosome levels increased at 24 h and peaked at 48 h after exposure to AraC and etoposide. While LDH declined after 96 h, the nucleosomes' levels were still elevated. Similarly, nucleosomes increased dose-dependently 24 h after exposure to TRAIL and reached a peak at 48 h. After 72 h, the nucleosomes' levels decreased again. While there was only a minor release of nucleosomes from PMA-stimulated neutrophils, co-incubation with PRP resulted in a strongly increased nucleosome release after 30 minutes. CONCLUSION: Nucleosomes are released from cells stimulated intrinsically or extrinsically to undergo apoptotic cell death in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Further mechanisms of release may be their active secretion from stimulated neutrophils when co-incubated with PRP, as may be observed during bacterial inflammation and thrombosis.","['Holdenrieder, Stefan', 'Kolligs, Frank T', 'Braess, Jan', 'Manukyan, Davit', 'Stieber, Petra']","['Holdenrieder S', 'Kolligs FT', 'Braess J', 'Manukyan D', 'Stieber P']","['Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Munich-Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.

In our previous study, safrole promoted phagocytosis by macrophages and natural killer cell cytotoxicity in normal BALB/c mice. The cytotoxic effects of safrole on HL-60 cells were investigated by using flow cytometric analysis, comet assay, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, western blotting and confocal laser microscopy. The obtained results indicate that safrole induced a cytotoxic response through reducing the percentage of viable cells and induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner. DAPI staining and comet assay also showed that safrole induced apoptosis (chromatin condensation) and DNA damage in HL-60 cells. The flow cytometric assay showed that safrole increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca(2+) and reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential in HL-60 cells. Safrole enhanced the levels of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX, inhibited those of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 and promoted the levels of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (Endo G) in HL-60 cells. Furthermore, safrole promoted the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), growth arrest- and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (GADD153) and of activating transcription factor 6alpha (ATF-6alpha). Based on these findings, we suggest that safrole-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells is mediated through the ER stress and intrinsic signaling pathways.","['Yu, Chun-Shu', 'Huang, An-Cheng', 'Yang, Jai-Sing', 'Yu, Chien-Chih', 'Lin, Chin-Chung', 'Chung, Hsiung-Kwang', 'Huang, Yi-Ping', 'Chueh, Fu-Shin', 'Chung, Jing-Gung']","['Yu CS', 'Huang AC', 'Yang JS', 'Yu CC', 'Lin CC', 'Chung HK', 'Huang YP', 'Chueh FS', 'Chung JG']","['School of Pharmacy, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (DDIT3 protein, human)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', 'RSB34337V9 (Safrole)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cyclin E/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA Damage', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*drug effects', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*physiology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Safrole/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/metabolism']",2012/05/18 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2012/05/18 06:00'],"['2012/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']",['32/5/1671 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2012 May;32(5):1671-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In hematopoiesis, the two major bHLH factors are stem cell leukemia (SCL) and lymphoblastic leukemia-derived sequence 1 (LYL1), both identified more than 20 years ago in chromosomal translocations occurring in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. SCL was termed the master regulator of hematopoiesis following the observation that SCL knockout mice die from complete lack of blood formation. However, once established, SCL is no longer required for maintenance of hematopoiesis. Pull-down experiments together with add-back experiments in SCL-null embryonic stem cells and generation of mice carrying a germline DNA binding mutation of SCL demonstrates that most of SCL function is mediated through the formation of a large DNA binding multiprotein complex with both repressor and activator potential. Recent genome-wide binding studies in a hematopoietic stem progenitor cell line suggest that SCL and LYL1 preferentially bind target DNA sequences as components of a heptad of transcription factors. LYL1, a paralog of SCL has been the forgotten sibling until recent mouse studies demonstrated that LYL1 replaced the function of SCL in adult hematopoiesis. Why LYL1 can replace the function of SCL for the maintenance but not formation of hematopoiesis remains a fundamental question. This review will compare and contrast the roles of these two transcription factors in hematopoiesis focusing on recent functional and genome-wide binding studies.","['Curtis, David J', 'Salmon, Jessica M', 'Pimanda, John E']","['Curtis DJ', 'Salmon JM', 'Pimanda JE']","['Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. david.curtis@monash.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology']",2012/05/18 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/05/18 06:00'],"['2012/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.1093 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2012 Jun;30(6):1053-8. doi: 10.1002/stem.1093.,['Copyright (c) 2012 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore attempted to identify the up- and down-stream events involved in the activation of the E2F1-dependent pro-apoptotic pathway. For this purpose, a amonafide analogue, 7-d (2-(3-(2-(Dimethylamino)ethylamino)propyl)-6-(dodecylamino)-1H-benzo[de]isoquinol ine-1,3(2H)-dione) was screened, which exhibited high antitumor activity against p53-deficient human Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) K562 cells. Analysis of flow cytometry and western blots of K562 cells treated with 7-d revealed an appreciable G2/M cycle arrest and apoptosis in a dose and time-dependent manner via p53-independent pathway. A striking increase in ""Comet tail"" formation and gamma-H2AX expression showed that DNA double strand breaks (DSB) were caused by 7-d treatment. ATM/ATR signaling was reported to connect E2F1 induction with apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Indeed, 7-d-induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis were antagonized by ATM/ATR signaling inhibitor, Caffeine, which suggested that ATM/ATR signaling was activated by 7-d treatment. Furthermore, the increased expression of E2F1, p73, and Apaf-1 and p73 dissociation from HDM2 was induced by 7-d treatment, however, knockout of E2F1 expression reversed p73, Apaf-1, and p21(Cip1/WAF1) expression, reactivated cell cycle progression, and inhibited 7-d-induced apoptosis. Altogether our results for the first time indicate that 7-d mediates its growth inhibitory effects on CML p53-deficient cells via the activation of an E2F1-dependent mitochondrial and cell cycle checkpoint signaling pathway which subsequently targets p73, Apaf-1, and p21(Cip1/WAF1).","['Li, Yiquan', 'Shao, Jin', 'Shen, Ke', 'Xu, Yufang', 'Liu, Jianwen', 'Qian, Xuhong']","['Li Y', 'Shao J', 'Shen K', 'Xu Y', 'Liu J', 'Qian X']","['State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering & Shanghai Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, #268, 130 Meilong Road, Shanghai 200237, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0', '(2-(3-(2-(dimethylamino)ethylamino)propyl)-6-(dodecylamino)-1H-benzo(de)isoquinol', 'ine-1,3(2H)-dione)', '0 (APAF1 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Naphthalimides)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '1Q8D39N37L (amonafide)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caffeine/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Comet Assay', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Gene Knockout Techniques/methods', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Naphthalimides/*pharmacology', 'Organophosphonates', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",2012/05/18 06:00,2013/01/08 06:00,['2012/05/18 06:00'],"['2012/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.24194 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2012 Oct;113(10):3165-77. doi: 10.1002/jcb.24194.,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) has been reported to be expressed variably on leukemia cells, but its expression patterns in leukemias with different differentiation stages and its relationships with clinical parameters remain to be elucidated. To examine the KLF4 expression pattern in human leukemias and its clinical significance, RT-PCR and real-time PCR were used to detect KLF4 expression in 9 leukemia cell lines and 96 pediatric leukemia patients. KLF4 mRNA expressed in 5/16 (31.25 %) of AML patients and 11/28 (39.29 %) ALL patients, significantly lower than that in control (9/11, 81.82 %, P < 0.05). The expressions of KLF4 mRNA were much lower in ALL (27/52) compared to AML (25/52) (P = 0.019), AML-M1 to other subtypes of AML (P = 0.001), C-ALL to Pre-B ALL (P = 0.004), Pro-T ALL to T-ALL (P = 0.048). Observation on leukemia cell lines showed the similar pattern. The relative expression of KLF4 mRNA was inversely associated with CD34-positive rates (r = -0.296, P = 0.037), but it was not associated with the blasts percentages in bone marrow (r = -0.222, P = 0.137) and the WBC counts (r = -0.058, P = 0.679). KLF4 mRNA expression level was not related to the overall survival (r = -0.063, P = 0.670), and the median survival times for the KLF4 (Lower) and KLF4 (Higher) groups were comparable (28 vs. 25 months, P = 0.265). Furthermore, no difference was found in KLF4 mRNA expression levels whether in leukemias with normal and abnormal karyotypes (P = 0.180), or in leukemias with normal and abnormal molecular cytogenetics (P = 0.591). We conclude that KLF4 translation level is associated with the differentiation stage of different leukemias and is independent of other parameters of risk stratification.","['Guo, Xiaoping', 'Tang, Yongmin']","['Guo X', 'Tang Y']","[""Division of Hematology-oncology, Zhejiang Key Laboratory for Neonatal Diseases, Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, #57 Zhuganxiang Road, Yan-an Street, Hangzhou, 310003, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120517,Italy,Clin Exp Med,Clinical and experimental medicine,100973405,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'K562 Cells', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'U937 Cells']",2012/05/18 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/05/18 06:00'],"['2012/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10238-012-0187-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Med. 2013 May;13(2):99-107. doi: 10.1007/s10238-012-0187-4.

However, supraphysiological doses may cause suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. HPA axis suppression resulting in reduced cortisol response may cause an impaired stress response and an inadequate host defence against infections, which remains a cause of morbidity and death. The exact occurrence and duration of HPA axis suppression after glucocorticoid therapy for childhood ALL are unclear. OBJECTIVES: To examine the occurrence and duration of HPA axis suppression after (each cycle of) glucocorticoid therapy for childhood ALL. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (in The Cochrane Library, issue 3, 2010), MEDLINE/PubMed (from 1945 to July 2010) and EMBASE/Ovid (from 1980 to July 2010). In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings and ongoing trial databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: All study designs, except case reports and patient series with fewer than 10 patients, examining the effect of glucocorticoid therapy for childhood ALL on the HPA axis function. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently performed the study selection. One review author performed the data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment, which was checked by another review author. MAIN RESULTS: We identified seven studies (total number of participants = 189), including one randomised controlled trial (RCT), which assessed the adrenal function. None of the studies assessed the HPA axis at the level of the hypothalamus, pituitary, or both. Due to substantial differences between studies, results could not be pooled. All studies had some methodological limitations. The included studies demonstrated that adrenal insufficiency occurs in nearly all patients in the first days after cessation of glucocorticoid treatment for childhood ALL. The majority of patients recovered within a few weeks, but a small amount of patients had ongoing adrenal insufficiency lasting up to 34 weeks. In the RCT, the occurrence and duration of adrenal insufficiency did not differ between the prednisolone and dexamethasone arms. In one study included in the review it appeared that treatment with fluconazole prolonged the duration of adrenal insufficiency. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available evidence, we conclude that adrenal insufficiency commonly occurs in the first days after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy for childhood ALL, but the exact duration is unclear. Since no data on the level of the hypothalamus and the pituitary were available we cannot make any conclusions regarding those outcomes. Clinicians should consider prescribing glucocorticoid replacement therapy during periods of serious stress in the first weeks after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy for childhood ALL, to reduce the risk of life-threatening complications. However, more high-quality research is needed for evidence-based guidelines for glucocorticoid replacement therapy.Special attention should be paid to patients receiving fluconazole therapy, and perhaps similar antifungal drugs, as this may prolong the duration of adrenal insufficiency.","['Gordijn, Maartje S', 'Gemke, Reinoud Jbj', 'van Dalen, Elvira C', 'Rotteveel, Joost', 'Kaspers, Gertjan Jl']","['Gordijn MS', 'Gemke RJ', 'van Dalen EC', 'Rotteveel J', 'Kaspers GJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands.ms.gordijn@vumc.nl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20120516,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Adrenal Insufficiency/*chemically induced', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Glucocorticoids/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*drug effects', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System/*drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",2012/05/18 06:00,2012/08/02 06:00,['2012/05/18 06:00'],"['2012/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD008727.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2012 May 16;(5):CD008727. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD008727.pub2.,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2015;(8):CD008727.

In the present study, we were able to demonstrate both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses against NPM1(mut). Ten peptides derived from wild-type NPM1 and NPM1(mut) were subjected to ELISPOT analysis in 33 healthy volunteers and 27 AML patients. Tetramer assays against the most interesting epitopes were performed and Cr(51)-release assays were used to show the cytotoxicity of peptide-specific T cells. Moreover, HLA-DR-binding epitopes were used to test the role of CD4(+) T cells in NPM1 immunogenicity. Two epitopes (epitopes #1 and #3) derived from NPM1(mut) induced CD8(+) T-cell responses. A total of 33% of the NPM1(mut) AML patients showed immune responses against epitope #1 and 44% against epitope #3. Specific lysis of leukemic blasts was detected. To obtain robust immune responses against tumor cells, the activation of CD4(+) T cells is crucial. Therefore, overlapping (OL) peptides were analyzed in ELISPOT assays and OL8 was able to activate both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells. The results of the present study show that NPM1(mut) induces specific T-cell responses of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and therefore is a promising target for specific immunotherapies in AML.","['Greiner, Jochen', 'Ono, Yoko', 'Hofmann, Susanne', 'Schmitt, Anita', 'Mehring, Elmar', 'Gotz, Marlies', 'Guillaume, Philippe', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Mytilineos, Joannis', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Schmitt, Michael']","['Greiner J', 'Ono Y', 'Hofmann S', 'Schmitt A', 'Mehring E', 'Gotz M', 'Guillaume P', 'Dohner K', 'Mytilineos J', 'Dohner H', 'Schmitt M']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany. jochen.greiner@uniklinik-ulm.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120516,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/genetics', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/immunology/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*immunology/physiology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics']",2012/05/18 06:00,2012/10/26 06:00,['2012/05/18 06:00'],"['2012/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46530-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-11-394395 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Aug 9;120(6):1282-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-11-394395.

Cancer-derived iPSCs are expected to provide a novel experimental opportunity to establish the disease model. We generated iPSCs from imatinib-sensitive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patient samples. Remarkably, the CML-iPSCs were resistant to imatinib although they consistently expressed BCR-ABL oncoprotein. In CML-iPSCs, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, AKT, and JNK, which are essential for the maintenance of both BCR-ABL (+) leukemia cells and iPSCs, were unchanged after imatinib treatment, whereas the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)5 and CRKL was significantly decreased. These results suggest that the signaling for iPSCs maintenance compensates for the inhibition of BCR-ABL. CML-iPSC-derived hematopoietic cells recovered the sensitivity to imatinib although CD34(+)38(-)90(+)45(+) immature cells were resistant to imatinib, which recapitulated the pathophysiologic feature of the initial CML.

Little information has been published regarding the coping process of this population. Understanding how they cope with this life-threatening disease can assist healthcare professionals to provide holistic care. PURPOSE: This study was designed to elicit the coping process of adults experiencing acute leukemia who underwent HSCT therapy. METHODS: This longitudinal qualitative study and grounded theory took place during 2009-2011. Ten adults with acute leukemia scheduled for HSCT were recruited from Shariati Hospital in Tehran, Iran. A series of pretransplant and posttransplant interviews were held in the hospital's HSCT units. Final interviews took place 2-6 months posttransplant in the hospital's outpatient clinic. RESULTS: The five categories that emerged from the data included perceived threat, suspension between fear and hope, rebirth, contextual factors, and coping strategies. Although patients vacillated within the coping spectrum (i.e., the ""buffer zone"" between fighting and acquiescing), ""finding meaning"" was identified as the final outcome of their experience that indicated effective coping. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE: Each patient perceives leukemia and HSCT therapy uniquely. This life-threatening disease can significantly affect patient perception and change patient lives both temporarily and permanently. Nurses can apply effective interventions to help patients cope with their unique situation, find meaning and hope, and allay fear and stress.","['Farsi, Zahra', 'Nayeri, Nahid Dehghan', 'Negarandeh, Reza']","['Farsi Z', 'Nayeri ND', 'Negarandeh R']","['Faculty of Nursing, AJA University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China (Republic : 1949- ),J Nurs Res,The journal of nursing research : JNR,101128757,,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Attitude to Health', 'Fear/psychology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/nursing/*psychology', 'Holistic Health', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Iran', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*psychology/therapy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Marital Status', 'Middle Aged', 'Nurse-Patient Relations', 'Qualitative Research', 'Religion and Psychology', 'Social Class', 'Social Support', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Time Factors']",2012/05/18 06:00,2012/08/24 06:00,['2012/05/18 06:00'],"['2012/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/jnr.0b013e318257b5e0 [doi]', '00134372-201206000-00005 [pii]']",ppublish,J Nurs Res. 2012 Jun;20(2):99-109. doi: 10.1097/jnr.0b013e318257b5e0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article reports results of a study of TMI combined with higher intensity chemotherapy regimens in 2 phase I trials in patients with advanced acute myelogenous leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (AML/ALL) who would do poorly on standard intent-to-cure HCT regimens. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Trial 1 consisted of TMI on Days -10 to -6, etoposide (VP16) on Day -5 (60 mg/kg), and cyclophosphamide (CY) on Day -3 (100 mg/kg). TMI dose was 12 (n=3 patients), 13.5 (n=3 patients), and 15 (n=6 patients) Gy at 1.5 Gy twice daily. Trial 2 consisted of busulfan (BU) on Days -12 to -8 (800 muM min), TMI on Days -8 to -4, and VP16 on Day -3 (30 mg/kg). TMI dose was 12 (n=18) and 13.5 (n=2) Gy at 1.5 Gy twice daily. RESULTS: Trial 1 had 12 patients with a median age of 33 years. Six patients had induction failures (IF), and 6 had first relapses (1RL), 9 with leukemia blast involvement of bone marrow ranging from 10%-98%, 5 with circulating blasts (24%-85%), and 2 with chloromas. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Eleven patients achieved complete remission at Day 30. With a median follow-up of 14.75 months, 5 patients remained in complete remission from 13.5-37.7 months. Trial 2 had 20 patients with a median age of 41 years. Thirteen patients had IF, and 5 had 1RL, 2 in second relapse, 19 with marrow blasts (3%-100%) and 13 with peripheral blasts (6%-63%). Grade 4 dose-limiting toxicities were seen at 13.5 Gy (stomatitis and hepatotoxicity). Stomatitis was the most frequent toxicity in both trials. CONCLUSIONS: TMI dose escalation to 15 Gy is possible when combined with CY/VP16 and is associated with acceptable toxicities and encouraging outcomes. TMI dose escalation is not possible with BU/VP16 due to dose-limiting toxicities. Future efforts will focus on whether further dose escalation with CY/VP16 is safe, with the goal of improving disease control in this high-risk population.","['Wong, Jeffrey Y C', 'Forman, Stephen', 'Somlo, George', 'Rosenthal, Joseph', 'Liu, An', 'Schultheiss, Timothy', 'Radany, Eric', 'Palmer, Joycelynne', 'Stein, Anthony']","['Wong JY', 'Forman S', 'Somlo G', 'Rosenthal J', 'Liu A', 'Schultheiss T', 'Radany E', 'Palmer J', 'Stein A']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010, USA. jwong@coh.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",20120515,United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*radiation effects', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Liver/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organs at Risk/radiation effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Stomatitis/etiology', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Young Adult']",2012/05/18 06:00,2013/02/21 06:00,['2012/05/18 06:00'],"['2012/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/10 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0360-3016(12)00430-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2012.03.033 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2013 Jan 1;85(1):148-56. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2012.03.033.

HHV-6 infection has been implicated in the etiologies of cancers, including lymphoma and leukemia; conditions with brain involvement, including epilepsy and encephalitis; and other disorders. HHV-6 is also the only human herpesvirus that has been proven to integrate into the chromosomes of a proportion (1-12%) of infected individuals. Because several traditional genetic association studies have failed to identify a variant that can account for the established relationship between family history and glioma risk, the possibility that chromosomally-integrated HHV-6 (CI-HHV-6), as a heritable factor, may explain a proportion of familial glioma cases warrants evaluation. To test this hypothesis, the prevalence of CI-HHV-6 in familial glioma cases and related and unrelated cancer-free control groups should be compared. Among glioma-affected families, the inheritance pattern of CI-HHV-6 could be evaluated by constructing pedigrees. If CI-HHV-6 is found to be associated with familial glioma risk, this knowledge could potentially lead to the future development of novel therapeutic and preventive approaches, including vaccines and immunotherapies targeted at the HHV-6 sequences.","['Amirian, E Susan', 'Scheurer, Michael E']","['Amirian ES', 'Scheurer ME']","['Dan L Duncan Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120515,United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human/*genetics/*virology', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/epidemiology/genetics', 'Glioma/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Prevalence', 'Roseolovirus Infections/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",2012/05/18 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/05/18 06:00'],"['2012/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0306-9877(12)00198-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mehy.2012.04.033 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 2012 Aug;79(2):193-6. doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2012.04.033.

METHODS: Childhood cancer incidence was analyzed from the data from the Brittany child tumor registry. Crude rates, world age standardized rates and cumulative rates were estimated for all cancers and for each diagnosis group. Standardized rates were also estimated for each of the four Brittany districts. Poisson regressions were performed to estimate trends in annual rates and to compare incidence rates between 2000-2005 and 1991-1999 periods, and between districts. RESULTS: Between 1991 and 2005, 1176 incident cancer cases were recorded in children younger than 15. Age standardized incidence was 169.5 cases per million of children per year. The most frequent cancers were leukemia (30%), central nervous system tumors (24%), lymphomas (12%) and neuroblastomas (8%). For the period 1991-2005 in Brittany, the risk of cancer diagnosis among children aged less than 15 years was 1/459. No significant increase trend was observed over the 1991-2005 period. There was however a significant or close to significant increase in incidence for lymphomas (RR: 1.38 [95%CI: 1.00-1.93]) and central nervous system tumors (RR: 1.24 [95%CI: 0.99-1.56]) between the 1991-1999 and 2000-2005 periods. A significant decrease trend was observed for renal tumors over the 1991-2005 period (Estimated Annual Percent Change=-7.6%, P=0.02). There was no significant difference of incidence between the four districts of the region. CONCLUSION: For the period studied, childhood cancer incidence in French Brittany was lightly higher than for the whole country. Although increases in lymphomas and central nervous system tumors coincided with increasing use of a standardised data collection system for medical information, the data collected provided no evidence in favor of more complete data collection following implementation of the system.","['Gagniere, B', 'Tron, I', 'Guillois-Becel, Y', 'Gourvellec, G', 'Le Gall, E', 'Gandemer, V']","['Gagniere B', 'Tron I', 'Guillois-Becel Y', 'Gourvellec G', 'Le Gall E', 'Gandemer V']","[""Cellule de l'InVS en Region (Cire) Ouest, 6, place des Colombes, CS 14 253, 35042 Rennes cedex, France. bertrand.gagniere@ars.sante.fr""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20120515,France,Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique,Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,7608039,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Age of Onset', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Geography', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/classification/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Time Factors']",2012/05/18 06:00,2012/10/30 06:00,['2012/05/18 06:00'],"['2010/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0398-7620(12)00075-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.respe.2011.11.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique. 2012 Jun;60(3):213-20. doi: 10.1016/j.respe.2011.11.002.

The bulk tumor is continuously regenerated and sustained by rare leukemic ICs that proliferate slowly, thus resulting refractory to chemotherapeutic agents targeting highly proliferating cells within the tumor. Therefore, a complete eradication of the bulk tumor may depend on efficacy of therapies that target IC. In spite of the improvements in the treatment of AML, the difficulty to eradicate completely the disease incites research for innovative therapeutic approaches. In this regard, the role of cytokines in the treatment of AML has been investigated for many years, and some of them have been tested in clinical trials as a result of their immunomodulatory properties. Furthermore, recent preclinical studies highlighted the ability of the IL-12 superfamily cytokines as potent antileukemic agents that act directly on tumor cells and on leukemic IC, thus opening new perspectives for leukemic patient treatment. Here, we review the current knowledge about the antileukemic effects of cytokines, documented in preclinical and clinical studies, discussing their potential clinical application.","['Ferretti, Elisa', 'Cocco, Claudia', 'Airoldi, Irma', 'Pistoia, Vito']","['Ferretti E', 'Cocco C', 'Airoldi I', 'Pistoia V']","['Laboratory of Oncology, Department of Experimental and Laboratory Medicine, Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120516,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/immunology/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/immunology']",2012/05/18 06:00,2012/11/01 06:00,['2012/05/18 06:00'],"['2012/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/01 06:00 [medline]']","['jlb.0112036 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0112036 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2012 Sep;92(3):567-75. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0112036.

Two large randomized trials demonstrated superiority of chemoimmunotherapy combining fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (FCR) over fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) alone in first line and relapse; this lead to establishment of FCR regimen as new gold standard in younger and physically fit patients. However, elderly and/or comorbid patients may not tolerate such aggressive approach due to high risk of unacceptable toxicity. To date, no randomized trials in this patient population have improved therapeutic results over chlorambucil; therefore, this agent remains the backbone of treatment against which the new protocols should be tested. Indeed, several currently running large trials investigate whether addition of an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab, obinutuzumab, ofatumumab) to chlorambucil yields better results. Performance status, biological age and number/severity of comorbid conditions should be incorporated into decision-making process with regard to intensity of treatment. Other emerging treatment alternatives for this patient population include fludarabine-based regimens in attenuated doses as well as protocols containing bendamustine or lenalidomide. Highdose steroids combined with rituximab might be a promising in relapsed/refractory CLL but infectious toxicity is serious. Finally, ofatumumab has been recently approved for the treatment of fludarabine and alemtuzumab-refractory patients.

The disease has a highly variable clinical course. CLL is subdivided into two disease subtypes, whereby leukemias with hypermutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) genes have a more favorable prognosis than those with unmutated IGHV genes, which tend to show advanced, progressive disease, adverse cytogenetic features and resistance to therapy. The current view is that both CLL types derive from antigen-experienced cells. Based on the finding that the IGHV repertoire is highly restricted and biased, as compared to the normal adult B-cell repertoire, it has been hypothesized that CLL cells are selected by some sort of antigenic pressure. Hereby, either autoantigens or antigens derived from apoptotic cells or pathogens are essential to trigger CLL pathogenesis. Although different cytogenetic aberrations were shown to contribute to CLL leukemogenesis, it remains unclear which abnormalities are primary events. Very recently, whole-genome sequencing identified genes that are recurrently mutated and provided novel insights into the mechanisms of oncogenic transformation. Because of the impact on prognosis, it is important to unravel the role of antigenic selection in CLL. Interestingly, B cell receptor (BCR) signaling is aberrantly increased in CLL and expression of tyrosine kinase ZAP70, which is able to signal downstream of the BCR, is a prognostic indicator. In this context we discuss the functional significance of antigenic selection in CLL and describe emerging agents to target BCR signaling that are currently being tested as a novel therapeutic strategy for CLL.","['Kil, Laurens P', 'Yuvaraj, Saravanan', 'Langerak, Anton W', 'Hendriks, Rudi W']","['Kil LP', 'Yuvaraj S', 'Langerak AW', 'Hendriks RW']","['Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*physiology']",2012/05/18 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/05/18 06:00'],"['2012/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['CPD-EPUB-20120510-2 [pii]', '10.2174/138161212801227041 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2012;18(23):3335-55. doi: 10.2174/138161212801227041.,,['10-0562/AICR_/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, PNAs induce apoptosis which is the end-point of their action. Older PNAs, pentostatin (DCF; 2'- deoxycoformycin), cladribine (2-CdA; 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine) and fludarabine (2-fluoro-9-(-D-arabinosyl)-adenine) were approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of hematological malignancies.

In contrast, the results of the treatment of HCL-V with PNA are rather poor. There are also several reports indicating activity of PNAs in PLL and large granular lymphocyte leukemia.

Despite detailed studies of clinical features and chromosomal abnormalities in CLL, molecular details underlying disease development are still not entirely clear. In the past several years, more and more such mechanisms have emerged. Recent studies clarified mechanistic details of how activation of TCL1, a critical molecule in aggressive CLL, initiates this malignancy. In indolent CLL characterized by 13q14 deletions, MiR-15/16 targeting BCL2 and MCL1 and DLEU7 targeting TNF pathway were proposed as tumor suppressors. Analysis of CLL coding genome identified NOTCH1 as a frequent target of activating mutations.

This can result in effective treatments being limited by infectious complications, particularly in the elderly who comprise the majority of patients with this disease. Immunotherapy potentially offers a way out of this dilemma, due to its improved specificity and ability to enhance immune responses to both the tumor and infectious agents.

An overview of the putative drugs that could be employed to target specific molecules involved in CLL cells/tumor microenvironment interactions is also proposed in the closing chapter of the review.","['Dal Bo, Michele', 'Bomben, Riccardo', 'Zucchetto, Antonella', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Deaglio, Silvia', 'Efremov, Dimitar G', 'Gattei, Valter']","['Dal Bo M', 'Bomben R', 'Zucchetto A', 'Del Poeta G', 'Gaidano G', 'Deaglio S', 'Efremov DG', 'Gattei V']","['Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano, PN, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",2012/05/18 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/05/18 06:00'],"['2012/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['CPD-EPUB-20120510-1 [pii]', '10.2174/138161212801227078 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2012;18(23):3323-34. doi: 10.2174/138161212801227078.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We used next-generation exome sequencing to identify somatic mutations in CTLs from an index patient with large granular lymphocytic leukemia. Targeted resequencing was performed in a well-characterized cohort of 76 patients with this disorder, characterized by clonal T-cell-receptor rearrangements and increased numbers of large granular lymphocytes. RESULTS: Mutations in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 gene (STAT3) were found in 31 of 77 patients (40%) with large granular lymphocytic leukemia. Among these 31 patients, recurrent mutational hot spots included Y640F in 13 (17%), D661V in 7 (9%), D661Y in 7 (9%), and N647I in 3 (4%). All mutations were located in exon 21, encoding the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, which mediates the dimerization and activation of STAT protein. The amino acid changes resulted in a more hydrophobic protein surface and were associated with phosphorylation of STAT3 and its localization in the nucleus. In vitro functional studies showed that the Y640F and D661V mutations increased the transcriptional activity of STAT3. In the affected patients, downstream target genes of the STAT3 pathway (IFNGR2, BCL2L1, and JAK2) were up-regulated. Patients with STAT3 mutations presented more often with neutropenia and rheumatoid arthritis than did patients without these mutations. CONCLUSIONS: The SH2 dimerization and activation domain of STAT3 is frequently mutated in patients with large granular lymphocytic leukemia; these findings suggest that aberrant STAT3 signaling underlies the pathogenesis of this disease.

The incidence of t-AML after acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), all-transretinoic acid (ATRA), and anthracycline-based therapy is rather low. However, because of the high remission rates and long-term overall survival achieved with current APL treatments, late complications related to antileukemic therapy should be taken into account, giving priority to efficacy agents with the lowest potential of leukemogenesis, despite individual genetic susceptibilities that are not well known. Here, we report two cases of t-AML observed in two young women who achieved a rapid, complete molecular remission (CMR) of APL and who were still in CMR when t-AML was diagnosed. These t-AMLs shared some clinical and biological features such as poor-risk cytogenetics and a rapidly progressing, unfavorable outcome.

This study determines the efficacy and mode of cell death of Bt 18 parasporal proteins against 3 leukemic cell lines (CEM-SS, CCRF-SB and CCRF-HSB-2).Cell-based biochemical analysis aimed to determine cell viability and the percentage of apoptotic cell death in treated cell lines; ultrastructural analysis to study apoptotic changes and Western blot to identify the parasporal proteins' binding site were performed. Bt 18 parasporal proteins moderately decreased viability of leukemic cells but not that of normal human T lymphocytes. Further purification of the proteins showed changes in inhibition selectivity. Phosphatidylserine externalization, active caspase-3, cell cycle, and ultrastructural analysis confirmed apoptotic activity and S-phase cell-cycle arrest. Western blot analysis demonstrated glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a binding protein.

METHODS: We evaluated the differential WBC count performance of the Hematoflow. 101 blood samples from patients were selected for comparison analysis. RESULTS: The methodological comparison of the WBC differential parameters of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and eosinophils showed good correlations among 4 different analyses. More than 1% of blast cells were counted in 30 of 101 samples. A good correlation for blast cell counts obtained by Hematoflow was found with the reference manual method (r=0.9637, P 0.0001). For blast B, Hematoflow shows good correlation with reference method results but did not identify blast T. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the Hematoflow has a comparable performance with the Sysmex XE-2100 and indicate that B cell lineage ALL can be identified by the use of the Hematoflow in an initial evaluation of acute leukemia.","['Kim, J-E', 'Kim, B-R', 'Woo, K-S', 'Han, J-Y']","['Kim JE', 'Kim BR', 'Woo KS', 'Han JY']","['Departments of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, Dong-A University, Busan, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120517,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Eosinophils/cytology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*instrumentation/methods', 'Hematology/*instrumentation/methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count/*instrumentation/methods', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/diagnosis', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/diagnosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Young Adult']",2012/05/18 06:00,2013/02/13 06:00,['2012/05/18 06:00'],"['2012/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1751-553X.2012.01432.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2012 Oct;34(5):547-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2012.01432.x.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the significance of the c-Abl/PKC-delta/Fli1 pathway for the establishment of the profibrotic phenotype in lesional dermal fibroblasts from patients with localized scleroderma (LSc). METHODS: The activation status of the c-Abl/PKC-delta/Fli1 pathway was evaluated by immunoblotting and chromatin immunoprecipitation using cultured dermal fibroblasts from patients with LSc and closely matched healthy controls and by immunostaining on skin sections. The effects of a platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitor AG1296 and gene silencing of c-Abl on the expression levels of type I collagen were evaluated by immunoblotting. RESULTS: The phosphorylation levels of Fli1 at threonine 312 were increased, while the total Fli1 levels and the binding of Fli1 to the COL1A2 promoter were decreased, in cultured LSc fibroblasts compared with cultured normal fibroblasts. Furthermore, in cultured LSc fibroblasts, the expression levels of c-Abl were elevated compared with cultured normal fibroblasts and PKC-delta was preferentially localized in the nucleus. These findings were also confirmed in vivo by immunohistochemistry using skin sections. Moreover, gene silencing of c-Abl, but not AG1296, significantly suppressed the expression of type I collagen in cultured LSc fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Constitutive activation of the c-Abl/PKC-delta/Fli1 pathway at least partially contributes to the establishment of the profibrotic phenotype in LSc dermal fibroblasts, which provides a novel molecular basis to explain the efficacy of imatinib against skin sclerosis in a certain subset of LSc.","['Noda, S', 'Asano, Y', 'Akamata, K', 'Aozasa, N', 'Taniguchi, T', 'Takahashi, T', 'Ichimura, Y', 'Toyama, T', 'Sumida, H', 'Yanaba, K', 'Tada, Y', 'Sugaya, M', 'Kadono, T', 'Sato, S']","['Noda S', 'Asano Y', 'Akamata K', 'Aozasa N', 'Taniguchi T', 'Takahashi T', 'Ichimura Y', 'Toyama T', 'Sumida H', 'Yanaba K', 'Tada Y', 'Sugaya M', 'Kadono T', 'Sato S']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120913,England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (FLI1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Benzamides', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C-delta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Scleroderma, Localized/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/drug effects/genetics/metabolism']",2012/05/18 06:00,2013/04/12 06:00,['2012/05/18 06:00'],"['2012/05/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2133.2012.11055.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2012 Nov;167(5):1098-105. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2012.11055.x.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are currently unknown but it is likely that epigenetic regulation by methyltransferases is involved. The MLL (mixed-lineage leukaemia) family comprises histone methyltransferases that play a critical role in regulating gene expression during early development in mammals. So far, these genes have received scant attention in teleost fish. In the present study, the mean weight of Atlantic cod juveniles reared under continuous illumination was found to be 13% greater than those kept under natural photoperiod conditions for 120 days. We newly determined cDNA sequences of five mll (mll1, mll2, mll3a, mll4b and mll5) and two setd1 (setd1a and setd1ba) paralogues from Atlantic cod. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the cod genes clustered within the appropriate mll clade and comparative mapping of mll paralogues showed that these genes lie within a region of conserved synteny among teleosts. All mll and setd1 genes were highly expressed in gonads and fast muscle of adult cod, albeit at different levels, and they were differentially regulated with photoperiod in muscle of juvenile fish. Following only one day of exposure to constant light, mll1, mll4b and setd1a were up to 57% lower in these fish compared to the natural photoperiod group. In addition, mRNA expression of myogenic regulatory factors (myog and myf-5) and pax7 in fast muscle was also affected by different photoperiod conditions. Notably, myog was significantly elevated in the continuous illumination group throughout the time course of the experiment. The absence of a day/night cycle is associated with a generalised decrease in mll expression concomitant with an increase in myog transcript levels in fast muscle of Atlantic cod, which may be involved in the observed epigenetic regulation of growth by photoperiod in this species.","['Nagasawa, Kazue', 'Giannetto, Alessia', 'Fernandes, Jorge M O']","['Nagasawa K', 'Giannetto A', 'Fernandes JM']","['Faculty of Biosciences and Aquaculture, University of Nordland, Bodo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120509,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Fish Proteins)', '0 (Myogenic Regulatory Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Fish Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gadus morhua/genetics/*growth & development/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Gonads/growth & development/metabolism', 'Male', 'Muscle, Skeletal/growth & development/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Myogenic Regulatory Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', '*Photoperiod', 'Phylogeny']",2012/05/17 06:00,2012/09/20 06:00,['2012/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0036908 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-21657 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e36908. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0036908.

Here, we investigated molecular determinants of sensitivity and resistance of cell lines of different tumor types towards arsenic trioxide. Arsenic trioxide was the most cytotoxic compound among 8 arsenicals investigated in the NCI cell line panel. We correlated transcriptome-wide microarray-based mRNA expression to the IC(50) values for arsenic trioxide by bioinformatic approaches (COMPARE and hierarchical cluster analyses, Ingenuity signaling pathway analysis). Among the identified pathways were signaling routes for p53, integrin-linked kinase, and actin cytoskeleton. Genes from these pathways significantly predicted cellular response to arsenic trioxide. Then, we analyzed whether classical drug resistance factors may also play a role for arsenic trioxide. Cell lines transfected with cDNAs for catalase, thioredoxin, or the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 gene were more resistant to arsenic trioxide than mock vector transfected cells. Multidrug-resistant cells overexpressing the MDR1, MRP1 or BCRP genes were not cross-resistant to arsenic trioxide.

Linker histone H1 is important for higher-order chromatin folding and is essential for mammalian embryogenesis. To investigate the role of H1 and chromatin compaction in stem cell pluripotency and differentiation, we examine the differentiation of embryonic stem cells that are depleted of multiple H1 subtypes. H1c/H1d/H1e triple null ESCs are more resistant to spontaneous differentiation in adherent monolayer culture upon removal of leukemia inhibitory factor. Similarly, the majority of the triple-H1 null embryoid bodies (EBs) lack morphological structures representing the three germ layers and retain gene expression signatures characteristic of undifferentiated ESCs. Furthermore, upon neural differentiation of EBs, triple-H1 null cell cultures are deficient in neurite outgrowth and lack efficient activation of neural markers. Finally, we discover that triple-H1 null embryos and EBs fail to fully repress the expression of the pluripotency genes in comparison with wild-type controls and that H1 depletion impairs DNA methylation and changes of histone marks at promoter regions necessary for efficiently silencing pluripotency gene Oct4 during stem cell differentiation and embryogenesis. In summary, we demonstrate that H1 plays a critical role in pluripotent stem cell differentiation, and our results suggest that H1 and chromatin compaction may mediate pluripotent stem cell differentiation through epigenetic repression of the pluripotency genes.","['Zhang, Yunzhe', 'Cooke, Marissa', 'Panjwani, Shiraj', 'Cao, Kaixiang', 'Krauth, Beth', 'Ho, Po-Yi', 'Medrzycki, Magdalena', 'Berhe, Dawit T', 'Pan, Chenyi', 'McDevitt, Todd C', 'Fan, Yuhong']","['Zhang Y', 'Cooke M', 'Panjwani S', 'Cao K', 'Krauth B', 'Ho PY', 'Medrzycki M', 'Berhe DT', 'Pan C', 'McDevitt TC', 'Fan Y']","['School of Biology, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120510,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Embryonic Development/genetics', '*Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Histones/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neurites/metabolism', 'Neurons', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2012/05/17 06:00,2012/09/27 06:00,['2012/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1002691 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-11-01896 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Genet. 2012;8(5):e1002691. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002691.

However, what constitutes protective T cell responses or determines the ability of the host to mount such responses is incompletely understood. Here we studied the requirements for development and induction of CD4+ T cells that were essential for immunity to Friend virus (FV) infection of mice, according to their TCR avidity for an FV-derived epitope. We showed that a self peptide, encoded by an endogenous retrovirus, negatively selected a significant fraction of polyclonal FV-specific CD4+ T cells and diminished the response to FV infection. Surprisingly, however, CD4+ T cell-mediated antiviral activity was fully preserved. Detailed repertoire analysis revealed that clones with low avidity for FV-derived peptides were more cross-reactive with self peptides and were consequently preferentially deleted. Negative selection of low-avidity FV-reactive CD4+ T cells was responsible for the dominance of high-avidity clones in the response to FV infection, suggesting that protection against the primary infecting virus was mediated exclusively by high-avidity CD4+ T cells. Thus, although negative selection reduced the size and cross-reactivity of the available FV-reactive naive CD4+ T cell repertoire, it increased the overall avidity of the repertoire that responded to infection. These findings demonstrate that self proteins expressed by replication-defective endogenous retroviruses can heavily influence the formation of the TCR repertoire reactive with exogenous retroviruses and determine the avidity of the response to retroviral infection. Given the overabundance of endogenous retroviruses in the human genome, these findings also suggest that endogenous retroviral proteins, presented by products of highly polymorphic HLA alleles, may shape the human TCR repertoire that reacts with exogenous retroviruses or other infecting pathogens, leading to interindividual heterogeneity.","['Young, George R', 'Ploquin, Mickael J-Y', 'Eksmond, Urszula', 'Wadwa, Munisch', 'Stoye, Jonathan P', 'Kassiotis, George']","['Young GR', 'Ploquin MJ', 'Eksmond U', 'Wadwa M', 'Stoye JP', 'Kassiotis G']","['Division of Immunoregulation, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120510,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*immunology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Gene Products, env/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology']",2012/05/17 06:00,2012/11/09 06:00,['2012/05/17 06:00'],"['2012/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1002709 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-12-00017 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2012;8(5):e1002709. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002709.

We show that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interferon alpha (IFNalpha) stimulate PML expression while suppressing EC network formation and migration, two key events during angiogenesis. By a knockdown approach, we demonstrate that PML is indispensable for TNFalpha- and IFNalpha-mediated inhibition of EC network formation. We further demonstrate that signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) binds PML promoter and that is an important regulator of PML expression. Knockdown of STAT1 reduces endogenous PML and blocks TNFalpha- and IFNalpha-induced PML accumulation and relieves TNFalpha- and IFNalpha-mediated inhibition of EC network formation. Our data also indicate that PML regulates EC migration, in part, by modulating expression of downstream genes, such as negatively regulating integrin beta1 (ITGB1). In addition, knockdown of STAT1 or PML alleviates TNFalpha- and IFNalpha-mediated inhibition of ITGB1 expression. Antibody blockade demonstrates that ITGB1 is functionally important for PML- and STAT1-regulated EC migration. Taken together, our data provide novel mechanistic insights that PML functions as a negative regulator in EC network formation and migration.","['Cheng, Xiwen', 'Liu, Yu', 'Chu, Hao', 'Kao, Hung-Ying']","['Cheng X', 'Liu Y', 'Chu H', 'Kao HY']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University and the Comprehensive Cancer Center of CWRU and University Hospital of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120515,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/genetics/metabolism', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/05/17 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/05/17 06:00'],"['2012/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)43346-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.340505 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Jul 6;287(28):23356-67. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.340505.

Progress in basic, preclinical, and clinical arenas spanning cellular immunology, gene therapy, and cell-processing technologies have paved the way for clinical applications of chimeric antigen receptor-based therapies. This is a new form of targeted immunotherapy that merges the exquisite targeting specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the potent cytotoxicity, potential for expansion, and long-term persistence provided by cytotoxic T cells. Although this field is still in its infancy, clinical trials have already shown clinically significant antitumor activity in neuroblastoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and B-cell lymphoma, and trials targeting a variety of other adult and pediatric malignancies are under way. Ongoing work is focused on identifying optimal tumor targets and elucidating and manipulating both cell- and host-associated factors to support expansion and persistence of the genetically engineered cells in vivo. In pediatric oncology, CD19 and GD2 are compelling antigens that have already been identified for targeting pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia and neuroblastoma, respectively, with this approach, but it is likely that other antigens expressed in a variety of childhood cancers will also soon be targeted using this therapy.

These neoplasms derive from the pathologic clonal expansion of an abnormal cancer-initiating cell and span a diverse spectrum of phenotypes, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Expansion of immature lymphoid or myeloid blasts with suppression of normal hematopoiesis is the hallmark of ALL and AML, whereas MPN is associated with proliferation of 1 or more lineages that retain the ability to differentiate, and MDS is characterized by abnormal hematopoiesis and cytopenias. The outcomes for children with the most common childhood cancer, B-progenitor ALL (B-ALL), in general, is quite favorable, in contrast to children affected by myeloid malignancies. The advent of highly sensitive genomic technologies reveals the remarkable genetic complexity of multiple subsets of high-risk B-progenitor ALL, in contrast to a somewhat simpler model of myeloid neoplasms, although a number of recently discovered alterations displayed by both types of malignancies may lead to common therapeutic approaches. This review outlines recent advances in our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of high-risk B-ALL and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, an overlap MPN/MDS found exclusively in children, and we also discuss novel therapeutic approaches that are currently being tested in clinical trials.

In addition to blood transfusion and sexual transmission, HTLV-1 is transmitted mainly through prolonged breastfeeding, and such infection represents a major risk for the development of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Although HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes can be retrieved from maternal milk, the mechanisms of HTLV-1 transmission through the digestive tract remain unknown. In the present study, we assessed HTLV-1 transport across the epithelial barrier using an in vitro model. Our results show that the integrity of the epithelial barrier was maintained during coculture with HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes, because neither morphological nor functional alterations of the cell monolayer were observed. Enterocytes were not susceptible to HTLV-1 infection, but free infectious HTLV-1 virions could cross the epithelial barrier via a transcytosis mechanism.

In this article, we describe a novel human monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for CD27 with properties that suggest a potential utility against malignancies that express CD27. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The fully human mAb 1F5 was generated using human Ig transgenic mice and characterized by analytical and functional assays in vitro. Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice inoculated with human CD27-expressing lymphoma cells were administered 1F5 to investigate direct antitumor effects. A pilot study of 1F5 was conducted in non-human primates to assess toxicity. RESULTS: 1F5 binds with high affinity and specificity to human and macaque CD27 and competes with ligand binding. 1F5 activates T cells only in combination with T-cell receptor stimulation and does not induce proliferation of primary CD27-expressing tumor cells. 1F5 significantly enhanced the survival of SCID mice bearing Raji or Daudi tumors, which may be mediated through direct effector mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Importantly, administration of up to 10 mg/kg of 1F5 to cynomolgus monkeys was well tolerated without evidence of significant toxicity or depletion of circulating lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the data suggest that the human mAb 1F5, which has recently entered clinical development under the name CDX-1127, may provide direct antitumor activity against CD27-expressing lymphoma or leukemia, independent of its potential to enhance immunity through its agonistic properties.","['Vitale, Laura A', 'He, Li-Zhen', 'Thomas, Lawrence J', 'Widger, Jennifer', 'Weidlick, Jeffrey', 'Crocker, Andrea', ""O'Neill, Thomas"", 'Storey, James', 'Glennie, Martin J', 'Grote, Deanna M', 'Ansell, Stephen M', 'Marsh, Henry', 'Keler, Tibor']","['Vitale LA', 'He LZ', 'Thomas LJ', 'Widger J', 'Weidlick J', 'Crocker A', ""O'Neill T"", 'Storey J', 'Glennie MJ', 'Grote DM', 'Ansell SM', 'Marsh H', 'Keler T']","['Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., Phillipsburg, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120515,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', '0125DUV5XC (varlilumab)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal/genetics/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/drug therapy/immunology', '*Lymphoma/drug therapy/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/immunology', '*T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', '*Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/genetics/immunology']",2012/05/17 06:00,2013/04/04 06:00,['2012/05/17 06:00'],"['2012/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-3308 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-3308 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Jul 15;18(14):3812-21. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-3308.

In this study, we characterized the apoptotic responses in diverse neuroblastomas using an unbiased mitochondrial functional assay. We defined the apoptotic set point of neuroblastomas using responses to distinct BH3 death domains providing a BH3 response profile and directly confirmed survival dependencies. We found that viable neuroblastoma cells and primary tumors are primed for death with tonic sequestration of Bim, a direct activator of apoptosis, by either Bcl-2 or Mcl-1, providing a survival dependency that predicts the activity of Bcl-2 antagonists. The Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Bcl-w inhibitor ABT-737 showed single-agent activity against only Bim:Bcl-2 primed tumor xenografts. Durable complete regressions were achieved in combination with noncurative chemotherapy even for highest risk molecular subtypes with MYCN amplification and activating ALK mutations. Furthermore, the use of unique isogenic cell lines from patients at diagnosis and at the time of relapse showed that therapy resistance was not mediated by upregulation of Bcl-2 homologues or loss of Bim priming, but by repressed Bak/Bax activation. Together, our findings provide a classification system that identifies tumors with clinical responses to Bcl-2 antagonists, defines Mcl-1 as the principal mediator of Bcl-2 antagonist resistance at diagnosis, and isolates the therapy resistant phenotype to the mitochondria.","['Goldsmith, Kelly C', 'Gross, Michelle', 'Peirce, Susan', 'Luyindula, Dema', 'Liu, Xueyuan', 'Vu, Annette', 'Sliozberg, Michael', 'Guo, Rong', 'Zhao, Huaqing', 'Reynolds, C Patrick', 'Hogarty, Michael D']","['Goldsmith KC', 'Gross M', 'Peirce S', 'Luyindula D', 'Liu X', 'Vu A', 'Sliozberg M', 'Guo R', 'Zhao H', 'Reynolds CP', 'Hogarty MD']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Aflac Children's Cancer Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. kgoldsm@emory.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BLID protein, human)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neuroblastoma/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/physiology']",2012/05/17 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2012/05/17 06:00'],"['2012/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-11-3603 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-3603 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2012 May 15;72(10):2565-77. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-3603.,['(c)2012 AACR.'],"['P01 CA097323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA128925-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA097323-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA082830/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA82830/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA128925/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA97323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08-CA128925/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3354953,['NIHMS365394'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, epigenetic therapies aim to restore normal chromatin modification patterns through the inhibition of various components of the epigenetic machinery. Histone deacetylase and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors represent the first putative epigenetic therapies; however, these agents have pleiotropic effects and it remains unclear how they lead to therapeutic responses. More recently, drugs that inhibit histone methyltransferases were developed, perhaps representing more specific agents. We review emerging epigenetic targets in cancer and present recent models of promising epigenetic therapies. SIGNIFICANCE: The use of DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors in patients has validated the use of drugs targeted to epigenetic enzymes and strengthened the need for development of additional therapies.

Battlefield reports documented a steady rise of malignancies and newborn malformations after war, that is, leukemia in the Balkans, and congenital anomalies and Kaposi sarcoma (KS) in Iraq. Kaposi sarcoma in Iraq has a quite aggressive behavior compared with the classic KS before, suggesting a potential relation with DU, and possibly a different DU related KS-type.

Finally, we discuss the clinical relevance of LSC and prospective targeted treatment strategies for patients with AML.","['Hoang, Van Thanh', 'Zepeda-Moreno, Abraham', 'Ho, Anthony D']","['Hoang VT', 'Zepeda-Moreno A', 'Ho AD']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120516,Germany,Biotechnol J,Biotechnology journal,101265833,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Stem Cell Niche']",2012/05/17 06:00,2012/10/17 06:00,['2012/05/17 06:00'],"['2011/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/biot.201100350 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol J. 2012 Jun;7(6):779-88. doi: 10.1002/biot.201100350.

The general condition was reduced, a maculo-papulous exanthema of the face and upper body as well as a general lymphadenopathy were found. INVESTIGATIONS: Bone marrow examination revealed the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) FAB M1 and a normal karyotype. Extramedullary manifestations of AML were demonstrated in skin and lymphnode biopsies. ECG showed no signs of ischemia, echocardiography a normal left-ventricular function. TREATMENT AND COURSE: The patient received induction treatment using sequential high-dose cytosinarabinosid and mitoxantrone, which rapidly resolved the extramedullary skin- and lymphnode-manifestations of the AML. During the chemotherapy-associated bone marrow aplasia a non-ST-elevation infarction (NSTEMI) developed combined with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, high-grade mitral valve deficiency and serious congestive heart failure with respiratory failure. Coronary artery angiography showed a complete occlusion of the proximal ramus circumflexus. Percutanous coronary intervention (PCI) with implantation of a bare-metal stent was performed, which resulted in prompt improvement of the condition. Despite the transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia a dual antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel was given. After each unit of platelets transfused a loading dose of 600 mg clopidogrel was given to prevent stent thrombosis. The patient did not experience major bleeding and was discharged in complete remission of AML and completely cardially recompensated. CONCLUSION: Coronary angiography and stenting can generally be safely performed in patients with transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia. Despite a higher risk of bleeding an oral dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and e. g. clopidogrel according to the guidelines should be performed, but its duration should be adapted to the individual patient circumstances.","['Staib, P', 'Forsch, S', 'Niedeggen, A', 'Janssens, U']","['Staib P', 'Forsch S', 'Niedeggen A', 'Janssens U']","['Klinik fur Hamatologie und Onkologie, St.-Antonius-Hospital, Eschweiler. peter.staib@sah-eschweiler.de']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20120515,Germany,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),0006723,"['0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Angioplasty, Balloon, Coronary/*methods', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Heart Failure/chemically induced/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency/chemically induced/therapy', 'Myocardial Infarction/*chemically induced/*therapy', 'Myocardial Ischemia/*chemically induced/*therapy', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Remission Induction', '*Stents', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced/therapy']",2012/05/17 06:00,2012/07/27 06:00,['2012/05/17 06:00'],"['2012/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0032-1305014 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 2012 May;137(21):1092-5. doi: 10.1055/s-0032-1305014.

This pattern of expression has made them promising targets for immunotherapy and cancer detection. Our aim was to find new members of this group that might be useful as markers in the detection of cancer and immunotherapy. DESIGN AND SETTING: A descriptive study conducted in referral centers of Tehran University of Medical Science from January 2008 to January 2009. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the expression of two testis-specific genes named ODF4 (outer dense fiber of sperm tails 4) and TEX101 (testis expressed 101) in 20 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and 20 normal samples by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Immunogenicity of TEX101 was evaluated by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: These two genes were expressed in 30% of CML patients but not in any of the healthy donors. Humoral response against TEX101 was not detected in any samples. CONCLUSIONS: TEX101 and ODF4 are CT genes useful for detection of CML. Unlike many CT genes, overexpression of TEX101 was not shown to induce immunologic responses in these samples. According to the previous studies, overexpression of TEX101 leads to suppression of cancer invasion and metastasis; thus, the induction of the expression of TEX101 in cancer by epigenetic mechanisms may be a treatment strategy.","['Ghafouri-Fard, Soudeh', 'Modarressi, Mohammad Hossein', 'Yazarloo, Fatemeh']","['Ghafouri-Fard S', 'Modarressi MH', 'Yazarloo F']","['Medical Genetics Department, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Health Care, Tehran, Iran. ghafourifard@razi.tums.ac.ir']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Saudi Arabia,Ann Saudi Med,Annals of Saudi medicine,8507355,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (ODF4 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Seminal Plasma Proteins)', '0 (TEX101 protein, human)']",IM,"['*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Seminal Plasma Proteins/*genetics']",2012/05/17 06:00,2012/10/19 06:00,['2012/05/17 06:00'],"['2012/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5144/0256-4947.2012.256 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Saudi Med. 2012 May-Jun;32(3):256-61. doi: 10.5144/0256-4947.2012.256.,,,PMC6081032,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many Muslim cancer patients witness the fasting month of Ramadan but we do not know which individuals elect to fast. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study conducted among Muslim cancer patients at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Egypt, during Ramadan, Hijri 1430 (the month of fasting) August-September 2009. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One-hundred and two patients being treated at the NCI were interviewed. The most common diagnoses were breast cancer (31%), acute leukemia (24%), colorectal cancer (7%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (5%), bladder cancer (4%), lung cancer (4%), and laryngeal cancer (4%). The two sexes were equally represented and so were metastatic and nonmetastatic diseases. The outpatient:inpatient ratio was 3:1. Treatments being received by these patients included chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, and nonspecific therapy in 42%, 31%, 10%, and 17%, respectively. Other concomitant diseases were present in 22% of the patients. RESULTS: While 40% of patients did not fast at all during Ramadan, 36% and 24% were partial and complete fasters, respectively. Female patients, those with performance status (PS) 0 to 1, those whose disease was a nonmetastatic solid tumor, and those receiving non-intravenous chemotherapy as outpatients were more likely to be fasting than their corresponding counterparts. Being a female, having PS 0 to 1, and receiving treatment as an outpatient were the only factors that were significant on multivariate analysis. Only 46% of patients sought the treating oncologist advice on whether they could fast. CONCLUSIONS: Most cancer patients fast during Ramadan, but only half of them discuss the issue with their oncologists. We hope that our study stimulates more research on this topic.","['Zeeneldin, Ahmed A', 'Taha, Fatma M']","['Zeeneldin AA', 'Taha FM']","['Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Fom El Khalig, Cairo, Egypt. amabood1@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Saudi Arabia,Ann Saudi Med,Annals of Saudi medicine,8507355,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Fasting/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Islam/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/ethnology/*psychology', '*Religion and Psychology']",2012/05/17 06:00,2012/10/19 06:00,['2012/05/17 06:00'],"['2012/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5144/0256-4947.2012.243 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Saudi Med. 2012 May-Jun;32(3):243-9. doi: 10.5144/0256-4947.2012.243.,,,PMC6081034,,,,,,"['Ann Saudi Med. 2014 Jul-Aug;34(4):361.

Large single-dose exposures and cumulative exposures to ionizing radiation have been associated with solid tumors and hematologic malignancy. Although these associations have been a driving force in minimizing patients' exposure, significant risks are found when diagnoses are missed and subsequent treatment is withheld. Therefore, based on epidemiologic data obtained after nuclear and occupational exposures, dose exposure limits have been estimated. A recent collaborative effort between the US Food and Drug Administration and the American College of Radiology has provided information and tools that patients and imaging professionals can use to avoid unnecessary ionizing radiation scans and ensure use of the lowest feasible radiation dose necessary for studies. Further collaboration, research, and development should focus on producing technological advances that minimize individual study exposures and duplicate studies.

Here, we pool data from the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group JBR.10 trial and the Cancer and Leukemia Group B-9633 trial to explore the prognostic and predictive effects of the new T-size descriptors and KRAS mutation status. METHODS: Node-negative patients were reclassified as T2a (>3-</=5 cm), T2b (>5-</=7 cm), T3 (>7 cm) or T </= 3 cm (</=3 cm, but other T2 characteristics). RESULTS: Of 538 eligible patients, 288 (53.5%) were T2a, 111 (21%) T2b, 62 (11.5%) T3, whereas 77 (14%) T</=3 cm were excluded to avoid confounding. KRAS mutations were detected in 104 of 390 patients (27%). T-size was prognostic for disease-free survival (p = 0.03), but borderline for overall survival (OS; p = 0.10), on multivariable analysis. Significant interaction between the prognostic value of KRAS and tumor size was observed for OS (p = 0.01), but not disease-free survival (p = 0.10). There was a nonsignificant trend (p = 0.24) for increased chemotherapy effect on OS with advancing T-size (hazard ratio [HR] T2a 0.90, [0.63-1.30]; T2b 0.69, [0.38-1.24]; and T3 0.57, [0.28-1.17]). The HR for chemotherapy effect on OS in T2a patients with KRAS wild-type tumors was 0.81 (p = 0.36), whereas a trend for detrimental effect was observed in those with mutant tumors (HR 2.11; p = 0.09; interaction p = 0.05). Similar trends were observed in T2b to T3 patients with wild-type (HR 0.86; p = 0.62), and KRAS mutant tumors (HR 1.16; p = 0.74; interaction p = 0.58). CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy effect seems to increase with tumor size.

In a transmission study, we exposed eight specified pathogen-free cats to blood from Iberian lynxes (Lynx pardinus) infected with CMhm. The cats were coinfected with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) from an Iberian lynx or with a prototype FeLV. The goal of the present study was to quantify the humoral immune response to CMhm and to identify potential target tissues and sequestration sites. Antibodies were measured by a recombinant antigen-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and blood and tissue loads were quantified using real-time PCR. Seven out of eight cats became CMhm-infected; all of these cats seroconverted between 3 and 13 weeks after inoculation. Antibody levels correlated with the CMhm blood loads. The peak CMhm blood loads were inversely correlated with the incubation period. PCR-positive results were found in all 24 tissues tested but not for all samples. Although all tissues were PCR-positive in one cat euthanized ten weeks after infection, many tissues tested negative in six cats euthanized at week 20 after infection. In several cats, the spleen, lung, liver, heart and aorta contained more copies than expected given the tissue's blood supply, but most tissues contained fewer copies than expected. In conclusion, this is the first study to quantify the humoral immune response and tissue loads in CMhm-FeLV-coinfected cats. The tissue loads appeared to correlate with the duration of infection and with the blood loads, but no evidence of significant CMhm tissue sequestration was found.","['Wolf-Jackel, Godelind A', 'Cattori, Valentino', 'Geret, Catrina P', 'Novacco, Marilisa', 'Meli, Marina L', 'Riond, Barbara', 'Boretti, Felicitas S', 'Lutz, Hans', 'Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina']","['Wolf-Jackel GA', 'Cattori V', 'Geret CP', 'Novacco M', 'Meli ML', 'Riond B', 'Boretti FS', 'Lutz H', 'Hofmann-Lehmann R']","['Clinical Laboratory, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120512,England,Microb Pathog,Microbial pathogenesis,8606191,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bacterial/blood/immunology', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood/immunology', 'Cat Diseases/*immunology/microbiology/virology', 'Cats', 'Coinfection/immunology/microbiology/*veterinary/virology', '*Immunity, Humoral', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics/*immunology/physiology', 'Male', 'Mycoplasma/genetics/*immunology/physiology', 'Mycoplasma Infections/immunology/microbiology/*veterinary/virology', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/microbiology/*veterinary/virology', 'Viral Load']",2012/05/17 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/05/17 06:00'],"['2012/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0882-4010(12)00106-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.micpath.2012.05.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Microb Pathog. 2012 Aug;53(2):74-80. doi: 10.1016/j.micpath.2012.05.003.

This study aimed to test whether IA patients' outcomes were associated with in vitro susceptibility results. To do so, we determined the in vitro susceptibility to amphotericin B (AMB) of 37 Aspergillus flavus isolates from 14 patients with haematological malignancies diagnosed with proven or probable IA, of which 13 were treated with AMB deoxycholate. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by Etest with the isolates classified as in vitro sensitive (AMB-S) or resistant (AMB-R) if their MICs were < 2 or >/= 2 mg/l, respectively. The association of the patients' death with primary disease, administered antifungal treatment, and infection with AMB-R A. flavus was tested using generalized estimating equations logistic regression. We assessed AMB-R in 31/37 (84%) isolates. In the patients treated with AMB, the survival rate was 2/3 (67%) and 2/9 (22%) for those infected with AMB-S or AMB-R A. flavus, respectively. Both infection with AMB-R A. flavus (P = 0.014) strain and acute myelocytic leukaemia as the underlying primary disease (P = 0.036) were independent predictors of death. Our findings indicate that in vitro resistance predicts a poor outcome in patients with A. flavus invasive disease treated with AMB. Recent advances in non-culture-based microbiological methods should not discourage efforts to obtain in vitro antifungal susceptibility results, which are critical for the choice of antifungal therapy in patients with IA.","['Hadrich, Ines', 'Makni, Fattouma', 'Neji, Sourour', 'Cheikhrouhou, Fatma', 'Bellaaj, Hatem', 'Elloumi, Moez', 'Ayadi, Ali', 'Ranque, Stephane']","['Hadrich I', 'Makni F', 'Neji S', 'Cheikhrouhou F', 'Bellaaj H', 'Elloumi M', 'Ayadi A', 'Ranque S']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire Parasitaire et Fongique, Faculte de Medecine, Sfax, Tunisia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120515,England,Med Mycol,Medical mycology,9815835,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amphotericin B/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillus flavus/*drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Cohort Studies', '*Drug Resistance, Fungal', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications', 'Humans', 'Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis/drug therapy/*microbiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2012/05/17 06:00,2013/03/02 06:00,['2012/05/17 06:00'],"['2012/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/13693786.2012.684154 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Mycol. 2012 Nov;50(8):829-34. doi: 10.3109/13693786.2012.684154.

Previous studies suggested that host genetic factors, including cytokines gene polymorphisms, could be involved in the pathogenesis of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Thus, we analyzed -137C/G and -607A/C of the IL-18 promoter and +874T/A of the IFN-gamma in DNA samples from 98 HTLV-1-infected individuals exhibiting or not clinical symptoms and 150 healthy control individuals. The IL-18 promoter -607CC genotype was significantly lower in HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers (HAC) and HTLV-1-infected individuals (HAC + HAM/TSP) than healthy control group. In contrast, the -607AC genotype was significantly higher in HAC and HTLV-1-infected individuals group compared to the healthy control group. The -137G/-607A IL-18 haplotype was higher in infected group than healthy control group, and the -137C/-607C IL-18 haplotype was increased in the healthy control group compared to the others. Finally, the IFN-gamma polymorphism analysis showed that the HTLV-1-infected individuals with +874AT genotype presented higher proviral load than +874AA genotype. These data indicate that the IL-18-607AC genotype and -137G/-607A haplotype could be a risk factor for HTLV-1 infection, whereas the protective effect could be conferred by -607CC genotype and -137C/-607C haplotype.

Resistant T315I clone may be present prior to initiating dasatinib, which could expand under selective pressures during treatment. However, it is also possible that Ph + ALL patients newly acquire the T315I mutation during dasatinib therapy. Despite the potent inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase by dasatinib, little is known about the relationship between dasatinib pharmacokinetics and the emergence of kinase domain mutations in vivo. METHODS: To determine whether plasma dasatinib pharmacokinetics influences the emergence of BCR-ABL mutations, we measured plasma dasatinib levels in 11 Ph + ALL patients undergoing dasatinib monotherapy. RESULTS: Bone marrow relapse occurred in 5 of the 11 Ph + ALL patients (45%). Importantly, a T315I mutation was detected in 4 of the 5 relapsed patients, despite the absence of BCR-ABL mutations in any patient at baseline. The median plasma concentration at 2 hours (C(2h)), the median plasma maximum concentration (C(max)), and the median area under the observed plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 4 hours (AUC(0-4)) were all significantly lower in patients with T315I than those without the mutation (C(2h), 22.3 ng/mL vs. 111.6 ng/mL, P = 0.0242; C(max), 43.8 ng/mL vs. 112.4 ng/mL, P = 0.0242; AUC(0-4), 108.3 ng.h/mL vs. 268.3 ng.h/mL, P = 0.0061, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the emergence of the T315I mutation among Ph + ALL patients treated with dasatinib is, in part, dependent on plasma dasatinib pharmacokinetics. Notably, these data also suggest that newly acquired BCR-ABL mutations may be inhibited by an increased exposure of dasatinib.","['Takahashi, Naoto', 'Miura, Masatomo', 'Scott, Stuart A', 'Niioka, Takenori', 'Sawada, Kenichi']","['Takahashi N', 'Miura M', 'Scott SA', 'Niioka T', 'Sawada K']","['Dept. of Hematology Nephrology and Rheumatology, Akita Univ.

In the present study we show that the Src family kinase substrate p130Cas (Cas is Crk-associated substrate) influences actin remodelling and concomitant muscle-specific gene expression, thereby regulating myogenic differentiation. In C2C12 myoblasts, silencing of p130Cas expression by RNA interference impaired F-actin (filamentous actin) formation and nuclear localization of the SRF (serum-response factor) co-activator MAL (megakaryocytic acute leukaemia) following the induction of myogenic differentiation. Consequently, formation of multinucleated myotubes was abolished. Re-introduction of wild-type p130Cas, but not its phosphorylation-defective mutant, into p130Cas-knockdown myoblasts restored F-actin assembly, MAL nuclear localization and myotube formation. Depletion of the adhesion molecule integrin beta3, a key regulator of myogenic differentiation as well as actin cytoskeletal organization, attenuated p130Cas phosphorylation and MAL nuclear localization during C2C12 differentiation. Moreover, knockdown of p130Cas led to the activation of the F-actin-severing protein cofilin. The introduction of a dominant-negative mutant of cofilin into p130Cas-knockdown myoblasts restored muscle-specific gene expression and myotube formation. The results of the present study suggest that p130Cas phosphorylation, mediated by integrin beta3, facilitates cofilin inactivation and promotes myogenic differentiation through modulating actin cytoskeleton remodelling.","['Kawauchi, Keiko', 'Tan, Wee Wee', 'Araki, Keigo', 'Abu Bakar, Farhana Binte', 'Kim, Minsoo', 'Fujita, Hideaki', 'Hirata, Hiroaki', 'Sawada, Yasuhiro']","['Kawauchi K', 'Tan WW', 'Araki K', 'Abu Bakar FB', 'Kim M', 'Fujita H', 'Hirata H', 'Sawada Y']","['Mechanobiology Institute, National University of Singapore, Level 10, T-Lab, 5A Engineering Drive 1, Singapore 117411.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Bcar1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cofilin 2)', '0 (Crk-Associated Substrate Protein)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Integrin beta3)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (megakaryocytic acute leukemia protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Tesk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (integrin-linked kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (testis-specific protein kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Actins/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cofilin 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Crk-Associated Substrate Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Integrin beta3/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Muscle Development/genetics/*physiology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Myoblasts, Skeletal/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference']",2012/05/17 06:00,2012/09/27 06:00,['2012/05/17 06:00'],"['2012/05/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['BJ20112169 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20112169 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2012 Aug 1;445(3):323-32. doi: 10.1042/BJ20112169.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study is to compare healthcare resource utilization and costs associated with PE among CML patients treated with a TKI therapy. METHODS: Two large retrospective claims databases (1999-2009) were combined to identify adult CML patients who received >/=1 TKI prescription before the index date, which was defined as 30 days before the first PE diagnosis for patients with PE and a randomly selected date for PE-free patients. Patients were followed for 6 months after the index date. PE and PE-free patients were matched on a 1:1 ratio. PE-related resource utilization and costs (measured in 2009 US dollars) were estimated for PE patients. All-cause and CML-related resource utilization and costs were compared between PE and PE-free patients. Multivariate regression models were used to control for confounding factors. RESULTS: The study included 186 matched pairs. PE-free and PE patients were on average 65.4 and 63.6 years old and 39.8% and 48.9% were female, respectively. PE patients had a significantly higher number of inpatient (IP) days, IP admissions, outpatient (OP) visits and emergency room (ER) visits than PE-free patients (all p < 0.01). All-cause medical services costs were $88,526 and $30,434 for PE and PE-free patients, respectively. After adjusting for confounding factors, the PE-related total medical costs were $47,288 (p < 0.01), which was mostly accounted for by higher IP (difference: $34,123, p < 0.01) and OP (difference: $9563, p < 0.05) costs. PE patients also incurred higher CML-related medical costs compared to PE-free patients (difference: $39,599; p < 0.01).

For this peculiar catalytic mechanism, the enzyme is considered an important cytoprotector. The NQO1 gene is expressed in all human tissues, unless a polymorphism due to C609T point mutation is present. This polymorphism produces a null phenotype in the homozygous condition and reduced enzyme activity in the heterozygous one. We previously demonstrated that two cell lines of haematopoietic origin, HL60 and Raji cells, possess the same heterozygous genotype, but different phenotypes; as expected for a heterozygous condition the HL60 cell line showed a low level of enzyme activity, while the Raji cell line appeared as null phenotype. The level of NQO1 mRNA was similar in the two cell lines and the different phenotype was not due to additional mutations or to expression of alternative splicing products.

CAL-101, a selective inhibitor of the PI3Kdelta isoform, has shown remarkable success in certain hematologic malignancies. Although PI3Kdelta signaling plays a central role in lymphocyte biology, the degree of single-agent therapeutic activity of CAL-101 during early-phase development has been somewhat unexpected. CAL-101 works in part by blocking signals from the microenvironment that normally sustain leukemia and lymphoma cells in a protective niche. As PI3Ks enter the arena of molecular-targeted therapies, CAL-101 provides proof of principle that isoform-selective compounds can be effective in selected cancer types and patient populations. SIGNIFICANCE: A key question is whether compounds targeting a single PI3K catalytic isoform can provide meaningful single agent efficacy in cancer cells that express multiple isoforms. Clinical studies of the drug CAL-101 have provided a significant advance by showing that selective targeting of PI3Kdelta achieves efficacy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, in part through targeting the tumor microenvironment.","['Fruman, David A', 'Rommel, Christian']","['Fruman DA', 'Rommel C']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry and Institute for Immunology, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California 92697-3900, USA. dfruman@uci.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111129,United States,Cancer Discov,Cancer discovery,101561693,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Purines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Quinazolinones/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2012/05/16 06:00,2012/11/13 06:00,['2012/05/16 06:00'],"['2012/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['2159-8290.CD-11-0249 [pii]', '10.1158/2159-8290.CD-11-0249 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Discov. 2011 Dec;1(7):562-72. doi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-11-0249.

Mismatching of the HLA complex most strongly determines outcomes, whereas non-HLA genetic polymorphisms are also having an impact. Although the majority of HSCTs are mismatched, only few studies have investigated the effects of non-HLA polymorphisms in the unrelated HSCT and HLA-mismatched setting. To understand these effects, we genotyped 41 previously studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2 independent, large cohorts of HSCT donor-recipient pairs (n = 460 and 462 pairs) from a homogeneous genetic background. The study population was chosen to pragmatically represent a large clinically homogeneous group (acute leukemia), allowing all degrees of HLA matching. The TNF-1031 donor-recipient genotype mismatch association with acute GVHD grade 4 was the only consistent association identified. Analysis of a subgroup of higher HLA matching showed consistent associations of the recipient IL2-330 GT genotype with risk of chronic GVHD, and the donor CTLA4-CT60 GG genotype with protection from acute GVHD. These associations are strong candidates for prediction of risk in a clinical setting. This study shows that non-HLA gene polymorphisms are of relevance for predicting HSCT outcome, even for HLA mismatched transplants.","['Harkensee, Christian', 'Oka, Akira', 'Onizuka, Makoto', 'Middleton, Peter G', 'Inoko, Hidetoshi', 'Hirayasu, Kouyuki', 'Kashiwase, Koichi', 'Yabe, Toshio', 'Nakaoka, Hirofumi', 'Gennery, Andrew R', 'Ando, Kiyoshi', 'Morishima, Yasuo']","['Harkensee C', 'Oka A', 'Onizuka M', 'Middleton PG', 'Inoko H', 'Hirayasu K', 'Kashiwase K', 'Yabe T', 'Nakaoka H', 'Gennery AR', 'Ando K', 'Morishima Y']","['Division of Molecular Life Sciences, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan. christian.harkensee@ncl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120514,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Unrelated Donors', 'Young Adult']",2012/05/16 06:00,2012/09/11 06:00,['2012/05/16 06:00'],"['2012/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47619-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-01-406785 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jun 28;119(26):6365-72. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-01-406785.

Recently, sFLC assays improved detection of M proteins when combined with standard methods of protein electrophoresis/immunofixation in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (NHL/CLL). Incidence of abnormal sFLC ratio (sFLCr) varied from 0% to 36% and 29.7% to 59% in NHL and CLL, respectively. Increased sFLC levels or abnormal sFLCr predict shorter overall survival in early-stage CLL. Furthermore, abnormal sFLCr correlated with advanced disease stage and poorer outcome. In diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, increased sFLC was demonstrated as an independent, adverse prognostic factor for overall/event-free survival. Moreover, abnormal sFLCr can be a diagnostic tool in central nervous system lymphomas. Finally, the quantitative FLC assay has the potential to become a new, easily measured biomarker for predicting prognosis and enhanced detection in NHL/CLL.

XRT techniques have evolved in recent years and are associated with significantly reduced bone marrow exposure. The characteristics of post-XRT t-MN in the current era have not been studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed patients who developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) after XRT alone (47 patients) or cytotoxic chemotherapy/combined-modality therapy (C/CMT, 181 patients) and compared them with patients with de novo MDS or AML (222 patients). We estimated bone marrow exposure to radiation and compared the clinical, pathologic, and cytogenetic features and outcome of the XRT patients with the C/CMT patients and with patients with de novo MDS and AML. RESULTS: Patients with t-MN after XRT alone had superior overall survival (P = .006) and lower incidence of high-risk karyotypes (P = .01 for AML and < .001 for MDS) compared with patients in the C/CMT group. In contrast, there were no significant differences in survival or frequency of high-risk karyotypes between the XRT and de novo groups. CONCLUSION: AML and MDS diagnosed in the past decade in patients after receiving XRT alone differ from t-MN occurring after C/CMT and share genetic features and clinical behavior with de novo AML/MDS. Our results suggest that post-XRT MDS/AML may not represent a direct consequence of radiation toxicity and warrant a therapeutic approach similar to de novo disease.","['Nardi, Valentina', 'Winkfield, Karen M', 'Ok, Chi Young', 'Niemierko, Andrzej', 'Kluk, Michael J', 'Attar, Eyal C', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Hasserjian, Robert P']","['Nardi V', 'Winkfield KM', 'Ok CY', 'Niemierko A', 'Kluk MJ', 'Attar EC', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Wang SA', 'Hasserjian RP']","['Massachusetts General Hospital, 55 Fruit St, Warren 225, Boston, MA 02114, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120514,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Young Adult']",2012/05/16 06:00,2012/11/13 06:00,['2012/05/16 06:00'],"['2012/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.38.7340 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.38.7340 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Jul 1;30(19):2340-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.38.7340.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either clofarabine (Clo) 40 mg/m(2) or a placebo followed by Ara-C 1 g/m(2) for five consecutive days. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included event-free survival (EFS), 4-month EFS, overall remission rate (ORR; complete remission [CR] plus CR with incomplete peripheral blood count recovery), disease-free survival (DFS), duration of remission (DOR), and safety. RESULTS: Among 320 patients with confirmed AML (median age, 67 years), the median OS was 6.6 months in the Clo+Ara-C arm and 6.3 months in the Ara-C arm (hazard ratio [HR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.28; P = 1.00). The ORR was 46.9% in the Clo+Ara-C arm (35.2% CR) versus 22.9% in the Ara-C arm (17.8% CR; P < .01). EFS (HR: 0.63; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.80; P < .01) and 4-month EFS (37.7% v 16.6%; P < .01) favored the Clo+Ara-C arm compared with Ara-C arm, respectively. DFS and DOR were similar in both arms. Overall 30-day mortality was 16% and 5% for CLO+Ara-C and Ara-C arms, respectively. In the Clo+Ara-C and Ara-C arms, the most common grade 3 to 4 toxicities were febrile neutropenia (47% v 35%, respectively), hypokalemia (18% v 11%, respectively), thrombocytopenia (16% v 17%, respectively), pneumonia (14% v 10%, respectively), anemia (13% v 0%, respectively), neutropenia (11% v 9%, respectively), increased AST (11% v 2%, respectively), and increased ALT (10% v 3%, respectively).

The study was designed to stop early if either excess toxicity or low probability of median event-free survival (EFS) of more than 28 weeks was likely. RESULTS: After a three-patient run-in phase, 75 patients were treated. Median age was 52 years (range, 19 to 65 years), 29 patients (39%) were cytogenetically normal, and 11 (15%) had FLT-3 internal tandem duplication (ITD). No excess vorinostat-related toxicity was observed. Induction mortality was 4%. EFS was 47 weeks (range, 3 to 134 weeks), and overall survival was 82 weeks (range, 3 to 134 weeks). Overall response rate (ORR) was 85%, including 76% complete response (CR) and 9% in CR with incomplete platelet recovery. ORR was 93% in diploid patients and 100% in FLT-3 ITD patients. Levels of NRF2 and CYBB were associated with longer survival. CONCLUSION: The combination of vorinostat with idarubicin and cytarabine is safe and active in AML.","['Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Tambaro, Francesco Paolo', 'Bekele, Nebiyou B', 'Yang, Hui', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'Konopleva, Marina Y', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Brandt, Mark', 'Hu, Yumin', 'McCue, Deborah', 'Newsome, Willie Mae', 'Pierce, Sherry R', 'de Lima, Marcos', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Garcia-Manero G', 'Tambaro FP', 'Bekele NB', 'Yang H', 'Ravandi F', 'Jabbour E', 'Borthakur G', 'Kadia TM', 'Konopleva MY', 'Faderl S', 'Cortes JE', 'Brandt M', 'Hu Y', 'McCue D', 'Newsome WM', 'Pierce SR', 'de Lima M', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Box 428, Houston, TX 77025, USA. ggarciam@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120514,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*administration & dosage', 'Idarubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Recurrence', 'Vorinostat']",2012/05/16 06:00,2012/08/17 06:00,['2012/05/16 06:00'],"['2012/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.38.3265 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.38.3265 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Jun 20;30(18):2204-10. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.38.3265.

METHODS: The study sample consisted of cancer survivors diagnosed from 2003 to 2007 identified in population-based registers in Sweden. Inclusion criteria included survivors who were age 18 to 45 years at diagnosis and had lymphoma, acute leukemia, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, or female breast cancer treated with chemotherapy. Of 810 eligible participants, 484 survivors (60% response rate) completed a postal questionnaire. RESULTS: The majority of male participants reported having received information about treatment impact on fertility (80%) and FP (68%), and more than half of the men banked frozen sperm (54%). Among women, less than half (48%) reported that they received information about treatment impact on fertility, and 14% reported that they received information about FP. Only seven women (2%) underwent FP. Predictors for receiving information about treatment impact on fertility were a pretreatment desire to have children (odds ratio [OR], 3.5), male sex (OR, 3.2), and being </= 35 years of age at diagnosis (OR, 2.0). Predictors for receiving information about FP included male sex (OR, 14.4), age </= 35 at diagnosis (OR, 5.1), and having no children at diagnosis (OR, 2.5). CONCLUSION: Our results show marked sex differences regarding the receipt of fertility-related information and use of FP. There is an urgent need to develop fertility-related information adapted to female patients with cancer to improve their opportunities to participate in informed decisions regarding their treatment and future reproductive ability.","['Armuand, Gabriela M', 'Rodriguez-Wallberg, Kenny A', 'Wettergren, Lena', 'Ahlgren, Johan', 'Enblad, Gunilla', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Lampic, Claudia']","['Armuand GM', 'Rodriguez-Wallberg KA', 'Wettergren L', 'Ahlgren J', 'Enblad G', 'Hoglund M', 'Lampic C']","['Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden. gabriela.armuand@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120514,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Fertility Preservation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/*prevention & control', 'Infertility, Male/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications/*therapy', 'Patient Education as Topic/*methods', 'Physician-Patient Relations', 'Regression Analysis', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Class', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors', 'Young Adult']",2012/05/16 06:00,2012/08/24 06:00,['2012/05/16 06:00'],"['2012/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.40.6470 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.40.6470 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Jun 10;30(17):2147-53. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.40.6470.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Overall, 269 patients were randomly assigned to receive bortezomib (1.3 mg/m(2) intravenous bolus) or no bortezomib for 1 year, in combination with thalidomide (200 mg per day orally) and dexamethasone (40 mg orally once a day on 4 days once every 3 weeks). Bortezomib was administered on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 with a 10-day rest period (day 12 to day 21) for eight cycles (6 months), and then on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 with a 20-day rest period (day 23 to day 42) for four cycles (6 months). RESULTS: Median time to progression (primary end point) was significantly longer with VTD than TD (19.5 v13.8 months; hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.80; P = .001), the complete response plus near-complete response rate was higher (45% v 21%; P 0.001), and the median duration of response was longer (17.9 v 13.4 months; P.04) [corrected].The 24-month survival rate was in favor of VTD (71% v 65%; P = .093). Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy was more frequent with VTD (29% v 12%; P = .001) as were the rates of grades 3 and 4 infection and thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSION: VTD was more effective than TD in the treatment of patients with MM with progressive or relapsing disease post-ASCT but was associated with a higher incidence of grade 3 neurotoxicity.","['Garderet, Laurent', 'Iacobelli, Simona', 'Moreau, Philippe', 'Dib, Mamoun', 'Lafon, Ingrid', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Masszi, Tamas', 'Fontan, Jean', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Milone, Giuseppe', 'Doyen, Chantal', 'Pegourie, Brigitte', 'Hajek, Roman', 'Casassus, Philippe', 'Kolb, Brigitte', 'Chaleteix, Carine', 'Hertenstein, Bernd', 'Onida, Francesco', 'Ludwig, Heinz', 'Ketterer, Nicolas', 'Koenecke, Christian', 'van Os, Marleen', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Cakana, Andrew', 'Gorin, Norbert Claude', 'de Witte, Theo', 'Harousseau, Jean Luc', 'Morris, Curly', 'Gahrton, Gosta']","['Garderet L', 'Iacobelli S', 'Moreau P', 'Dib M', 'Lafon I', 'Niederwieser D', 'Masszi T', 'Fontan J', 'Michallet M', 'Gratwohl A', 'Milone G', 'Doyen C', 'Pegourie B', 'Hajek R', 'Casassus P', 'Kolb B', 'Chaleteix C', 'Hertenstein B', 'Onida F', 'Ludwig H', 'Ketterer N', 'Koenecke C', 'van Os M', 'Mohty M', 'Cakana A', 'Gorin NC', 'de Witte T', 'Harousseau JL', 'Morris C', 'Gahrton G']","['University Hospital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France. laurent.garderet@sat.aphp.fr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120514,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Boronic Acids/administration & dosage', 'Bortezomib', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/05/16 06:00,2012/09/12 06:00,['2012/05/16 06:00'],"['2012/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.37.4918 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.37.4918 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Jul 10;30(20):2475-82. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.37.4918.

Although conventional T cells are acknowledged as important players in the control of CML, a possible modification of invariant NKT (iNKT) cells, known for their antitumoral activity, has not been established as yet. Here, we showed that the expression of perforin, CD95L, and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger, a transcription factor required for maintenance of iNKT cell functions, was reduced or suppressed in CML patients at diagnosis, as compared with healthy individuals. The proliferation rate of blood iNKT cells in response to their cognate ligand was likewise diminished. These functional deficiencies were corrected in patients having achieved complete cytogenetic remission following TK inhibitor or IFN-alpha therapy. iNKT cells from CML patients in the chronic phase did not display increased TK activity, which argued against a direct autonomous action of BCR-ABL. Instead, we found that their anergic status originated from both intrinsic and APC-dependent dysfunctions. Our data demonstrate that chronic phase CML is associated with functional deficiencies of iNKT cells that are restored upon remission. These results suggest a possible contribution to disease control by TK inhibitor therapies.","['Rossignol, Alexis', 'Levescot, Anais', 'Jacomet, Florence', 'Robin, Aurelie', 'Basbous, Sara', 'Giraud, Christine', 'Roy, Lydia', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Turhan, Ali G', 'Barra, Anne', 'Herbelin, Andre', 'Gombert, Jean-Marc']","['Rossignol A', 'Levescot A', 'Jacomet F', 'Robin A', 'Basbous S', 'Giraud C', 'Roy L', 'Guilhot F', 'Turhan AG', 'Barra A', 'Herbelin A', 'Gombert JM']","['INSERM UMR S935, Poitiers and Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Fas Ligand Protein/blood', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/blood', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/*immunology', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/enzymology/*immunology', 'Perforin/blood', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology']",2012/05/16 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/05/16 06:00'],"['2012/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.201142043 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2012 Jul;42(7):1870-5. doi: 10.1002/eji.201142043.,"['(c) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, only a few biomarkers of CSCs have been identified. Here, we report that ganglioside GD2 (a glycosphingolipid) identifies a small fraction of cells in human breast cancer cell lines and patient samples that are capable of forming mammospheres and initiating tumors with as few as 10 GD2+ cells. In addition, the majority of GD2+ cells are also CD44hiCD24lo, the previously established CSC-associated cell surface phenotype. Gene expression analysis revealed that GD3 synthase (GD3S) is highly expressed in GD2+ as well as in CD44hiCD24lo cells and that interference with GD3S expression, either by shRNA or using a pharmacological inhibitor, reduced the CSC population and CSC-associated properties. GD3S knockdown completely abrogated tumor formation in vivo. Also, induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in transformed human mammary epithelial cells (HMLER cells) dramatically increased GD2 as well as GD3S expression in these cells, suggesting a role of EMT in the origin of GD2+ breast CSCs. In summary, we identified GD2 as a new CSC-specific cell surface marker and GD3S as a potential therapeutic target for CSCs, with the possibility of improving survival and cure rates in patients with breast cancer.","['Battula, Venkata Lokesh', 'Shi, Yuexi', 'Evans, Kurt W', 'Wang, Rui-Yu', 'Spaeth, Erika L', 'Jacamo, Rodrigo O', 'Guerra, Rudy', 'Sahin, Aysegul A', 'Marini, Frank C', 'Hortobagyi, Gabriel', 'Mani, Sendurai A', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Battula VL', 'Shi Y', 'Evans KW', 'Wang RY', 'Spaeth EL', 'Jacamo RO', 'Guerra R', 'Sahin AA', 'Marini FC', 'Hortobagyi G', 'Mani SA', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120515,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD24 Antigen)', '0 (CD24 protein, human)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '65988-71-8 (ganglioside, GD2)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.8 (alpha-N-acetylneuraminate alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'CD24 Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/genetics', 'Female', 'Gangliosides/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology/transplantation', 'Sialyltransferases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2012/05/16 06:00,2012/08/21 06:00,['2012/05/16 06:00'],"['2011/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['59735 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI59735 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2012 Jun;122(6):2066-78. doi: 10.1172/JCI59735.

However, the molecular mechanisms of the effect of beta-eudesmol on human tumor cells are unknown. In the present study, we report the cytotoxic effect of beta-eudesmol on the human leukemia HL60 cells and its molecular mechanisms. The cytotoxic effect of beta-eudesmol on HL60 cells was associated with apoptosis, which was characterized by the presence of DNA fragmentation. beta-eudesmol-induced apoptosis was accompanied by cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-9, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase; downregulation of Bcl-2 expression; release of cytochrome c from mitochondria; and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinases was observed in beta-eudesmol-treated HL60 cells, and the inhibitor of JNK blocked the beta-eudesmol-induced apoptosis, downregulation of Bcl-2, and the loss of MMP. These data suggest that beta-eudesmol induces apoptosis in HL60 cells via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, which is controlled through JNK signaling.","['Li, Yanchun', 'Li, Te', 'Miao, Caixia', 'Li, Jianchun', 'Xiao, Wei', 'Ma, Enlong']","['Li Y', 'Li T', 'Miao C', 'Li J', 'Xiao W', 'Ma E']","['Department of Pharmacology, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, 110016, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120514,England,Phytother Res,Phytotherapy research : PTR,8904486,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes, Eudesmane)', '473-15-4 (beta-eudesmol)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Sesquiterpenes, Eudesmane/*pharmacology']",2012/05/16 06:00,2013/06/29 06:00,['2012/05/16 06:00'],"['2011/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/04 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ptr.4727 [doi]'],ppublish,Phytother Res. 2013 Mar;27(3):338-43. doi: 10.1002/ptr.4727.

The family of human sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (siglecs) comprises inhibitory as well as activating receptors intimately involved in the regulation of immune responses. Analyses of the interaction between siglecs and glycans are hampered by the low affinity of this interaction. Therefore, we expressed siglec-7 in eukaryotic cells, allowing for glycosylation, and oligomerized the protein in analogy to MHC tetramers. Using this tool, flow cytometric analysis of lymphocytes became possible. Sialic acid-dependent binding of siglec-7 tetramers was confirmed by glycan array analysis and loss of siglec tetramer binding after neuraminidase treatment of lymphocytes. In contrast to most lymphocyte subpopulations, which showed high siglec-7 ligand expression, B-cell subpopulations could be further subdivided according to different siglec-7 ligand expression levels. We also analyzed blasts from acute lymphoblastic leukemias of the B-cell lineage as well as the T-cell lineage, since malignant transformation is often associated with aberrant cell surface glycosylation. While pediatric T-ALL blasts highly expressed siglec-7 ligands, siglec-7 ligands were barely detectable on cALL blasts. Taken together, oligomerization of recombinant soluble siglec-7 enabled flow cytometric identification of physiologic lymphocyte subpopulations and malignant blasts.","['Gieseke, Friederike', 'Mang, Philippa', 'Viebahn, Susanne', 'Sonntag, Inga', 'Kruchen, Anne', 'Erbacher, Annika', 'Pfeiffer, Matthias', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Muller, Ingo']","['Gieseke F', 'Mang P', 'Viebahn S', 'Sonntag I', 'Kruchen A', 'Erbacher A', 'Pfeiffer M', 'Handgretinger R', 'Muller I']","[""Research Institute Children's Cancer Center, Hamburg, Germany. gieseke@kinderkrebs-forschung.de""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120709,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SIGLEC7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)']",IM,"['*Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/immunology/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', '*Lectins/immunology/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid/metabolism', 'Neuraminidase/metabolism', 'Polysaccharides', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins']",2012/05/16 06:00,2012/11/01 06:00,['2012/05/16 06:00'],"['2011/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.201142298 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2012 Aug;42(8):2176-86. doi: 10.1002/eji.201142298.

However, the polysaccharide obtained from Monascus-fermented products has never been investigated. This study evaluated the effects of dioscorea polysaccharide (DPS) and red mold dioscorea polysaccharide (RMDPS) on differentiation of leukemic THP-1 cells. DPS and RMDPS inhibited THP-1 cells proliferation in dose- and time-dependent manners. The differentiation induction (macrophage-like cells) was observed when THP-1 cells were treated with DPS and RMDPS for 5 days. Superoxide anion production, phagocytic capacity, and cytokine secretion confirmed activity for differentiating THP-1 cells. Results indicated that RMDPS elevated reactive oxygen species production and immune activity, including phagocytosis, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) productions in THP-1 cells, which was greater than that seen with DPS. These results may be attributed to Monascus-fermentation altering the carbohydrate components and polysaccharide structure. RMDPS may serve as a novel material and functional ingredient to exert anticancer capacity.","['Lee, Bao-Hong', 'Hsu, Wei-Hsuan', 'Liao, Te-Han', 'Pan, Tzu-Ming']","['Lee BH', 'Hsu WH', 'Liao TH', 'Pan TM']","['Department of Biochemical Science & Technology, College of Life Science, National Taiwan University, No. 1, Sec. 4, Roosevelt Road, Taipei, 10617, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120514,England,Food Funct,Food & function,101549033,['0 (Polysaccharides)'],IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Dioscorea/chemistry/metabolism/*microbiology', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Fermentation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Monascus/*metabolism', 'Polysaccharides/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2012/05/16 06:00,2012/10/30 06:00,['2012/05/16 06:00'],"['2012/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c2fo30026e [doi]'],ppublish,Food Funct. 2012 Jul;3(7):758-64. doi: 10.1039/c2fo30026e.

Cleavable isoforms of ErbB4 release a soluble intracellular domain (ICD) that can translocate to the nucleus and function as a transcriptional coregulator. In search of regulatory mechanisms of ErbB4 ICD function, we identified PIAS3 as a novel interaction partner of ErbB4 ICD. In keeping with the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase function of protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) proteins, we showed that the ErbB4 ICD is modified by SUMO, and that PIAS3 stimulates the SUMOylation. Upon overexpression of PIAS3, the ErbB4 ICD generated from the full-length receptor accumulated into the nucleus in a manner that was dependent on the functional nuclear localization signal of ErbB4. In the nucleus, ErbB4 colocalized with PIAS3 and SUMO-1 in promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies, nuclear domains involved in regulation of transcription. Accordingly, PIAS3 overexpression had an effect on the transcriptional coregulatory activity of ErbB4, repressing its ability to coactivate transcription with Yes-associated protein. Finally, knockdown of PIAS3 with siRNA partially rescued the inhibitory effect of the ErbB4 ICD on differentiation of MDA-MB-468 breast cancer and HC11 mammary epithelial cells. Our findings illustrate that PIAS3 is a novel regulator of ErbB4 receptor tyrosine kinase, controlling its nuclear sequestration and function.","['Sundvall, Maria', 'Korhonen, Anna', 'Vaparanta, Katri', 'Anckar, Julius', 'Halkilahti, Kalle', 'Salah, Zaidoun', 'Aqeilan, Rami I', 'Palvimo, Jorma J', 'Sistonen, Lea', 'Elenius, Klaus']","['Sundvall M', 'Korhonen A', 'Vaparanta K', 'Anckar J', 'Halkilahti K', 'Salah Z', 'Aqeilan RI', 'Palvimo JJ', 'Sistonen L', 'Elenius K']","['MediCity Research Laboratory and Department of Medical Biochemistry and Genetics, University of Turku, 20520 Turku, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120514,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PIAS3 protein, human)', '0 (PIAS4 protein, human)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SUMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-4)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'ErbB Receptors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mammary Glands, Human/cytology/metabolism', 'Molecular Chaperones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs/physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptor, ErbB-4', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/metabolism', 'Sumoylation/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2012/05/16 06:00,2012/09/12 06:00,['2012/05/16 06:00'],"['2012/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)43492-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.335927 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Jun 29;287(27):23216-26. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.335927.

Though measurement of PU.1 levels is important to health and disease, most studies have relied on PCR or western blots to measure the expression of this transcription factor. An accessible, validated assay that could measure PU.1 protein in subpopulations of cells is needed. In this work we present an optimized flow cytometric assay to detect PU.1 in subpopulations of immune cells. Murine myeloid cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and then stained with anti PU.1 in the presence and absence of a blocking peptide containing the binding site of the antibody. The bound anti PU.1 was then visualized with a labeled second antibody. Methanol and ethanol were tested for their relative ability to permeabilize cells and detect PU.1. The effect of the procedure upon the ability to detect cellular subpopulations was examined. Relative PU.1 1evels in normal T cells, B cells, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and progenitors from the spleen and/or bone marrow were determined. Finally, PU.1 levels in proliferating myeloid cells from burn mice were determined. There was a dose dependent increase in the amount of PU.1 detected with increasing amounts of PU.1 antibody that was not seen when blocking peptide was used. Methanol or ethanol gave equivalent results as permeabilization agents, but the latter allowed easier detection of surface antigens when surface staining was performed prior to permeabilization. T cells had little if any PU.1, while B cells had intermediate levels of PU.1, and myeloid cells had high levels of PU.1. Monocytes had higher levels of PU.1 than did neutrophils or spleen macrophages. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells had lower levels of PU.1 than did conventional dendritic cells. Immature myeloid cells had higher levels of PU.1 than did mature myeloid cells. In addition, PU.1 levels were higher in proliferating cells than the corresponding non proliferating cells. Myeloid cells derived from burn mice tended to have higher levels of PU.1 than did unburned, but proliferating cells from burn or sham mice showed no difference in their levels of PU.1. This assay should be a useful addition to the tools used to study the function of PU.1 in health and disease.","['Noel, Greg', 'DeKoter, Rodney P', 'Wang, Quan', 'Hexley, Philip', 'Ogle, Cora K']","['Noel G', 'DeKoter RP', 'Wang Q', 'Hexley P', 'Ogle CK']","['Shriners Hospital for Children, Cincinnati, OH 45209, USA. gnoel@shrinenet.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120511,Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis/immunology', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Trans-Activators/*analysis/immunology']",2012/05/16 06:00,2012/10/16 06:00,['2012/05/16 06:00'],"['2012/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-1759(12)00134-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jim.2012.05.008 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2012 Aug 31;382(1-2):81-92. doi: 10.1016/j.jim.2012.05.008.

No more than 20 pediatric patients with vincristine-induced vocal cord palsy have been reported, and to the best of our knowledge this is the first case where glutamic acid was administered with the aim of preventing a relapse of laryngeal dysfunction. CASE PRESENTATION: The larynx paralysis presented with hoarseness and stridor in a Caucasian 18-month-old girl and spontaneously resolved in about a month. In order to administer a subsequent full dose of vincristine, our patient received oral glutamic acid whose efficacy against vincristine neurological side effects has been previously reported. CONCLUSIONS: Since in our patient the amino acid proved to be ineffective in the prevention of laryngeal paralysis relapse, we suggest that a dose reduction of vincristine should be preferred by oncologists as an initial approach after a case of drug-induced vocal cord palsy.","['Farruggia, Piero', 'Tropia, Serena', 'Cannella, Sonia', 'Bruno, Giuseppa', 'Oddo, Gaspare', ""D'Angelo, Paolo""]","['Farruggia P', 'Tropia S', 'Cannella S', 'Bruno G', 'Oddo G', ""D'Angelo P""]","['Oncology Department, Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, A,R,N,A,S, Ospedali Civico, Di Cristina e Benfratelli, Piazza N, Leotta 4, Palermo, 90127, Italy. farruggia.oep@ospedalecivicopa.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120514,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,,,2012/05/16 06:00,2012/05/16 06:01,['2012/05/16 06:00'],"['2011/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/16 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-1947-6-128 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-6-128 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2012 May 14;6:128. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-6-128.,,,PMC3407770,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mechanisms of progesterone action in breast cancer still remain elusive. On the other hand, micro RNAs (miRNAs) are short ribonucleic acids which have also been found to play a pivotal role in cancer pathogenesis. The role of miRNA in progestin-induced breast cancer is poorly explored. In this study we explored progestin modulation of miRNA expression in mammary tumorigenesis. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide study to explore progestin-mediated regulation of miRNA expression in breast cancer. miR-16 expression was studied by RT-qPCR in cancer cell lines with silenced PR, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) or c-Myc, treated or not with progestins. Breast cancer cells were transfected with the precursor of miR-16 and proliferation assays, Western blots or in vivo experiments were performed. Target genes of miR-16 were searched through a bioinformatical approach, and the study was focused on cyclin E. Reporter gene assays were performed to confirm that cyclin E 3'UTR is a direct target of miR-16. RESULTS: We found that nine miRNAs were upregulated and seven were downregulated by progestin in mammary tumor cells. miR-16, whose function as a tumor suppressor in leukemia has already been shown, was identified as one of the downregulated miRNAs in murine and human breast cancer cells. Progestin induced a decrease in miR-16 levels via the classical PR and through a hierarchical interplay between Stat3 and the oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc. A search for miR-16 targets showed that the CCNE1 gene, encoding the cell cycle regulator cyclin E, contains conserved putative miR-16 target sites in its mRNA 3' UTR region. We found that, similar to the molecular mechanism underlying progestin-modulated miR-16 expression, Stat3 and c-Myc participated in the induction of cyclin E expression by progestin. Moreover, overexpression of miR-16 abrogated the ability of progestin to induce cyclin E upregulation, revealing that cyclin E is a novel target of miR-16 in breast cancer. Overexpression of miR-16 also inhibited progestin-induced breast tumor growth in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating for the first time, a role for miR-16 as a tumor suppressor in mammary tumorigenesis. We also found that the ErbB ligand heregulin (HRG) downregulated the expression of miR-16, which then participates in the proliferative activity of HRG in breast tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we reveal the first progestin-regulated miRNA expression profile and identify a novel role for miR-16 as a tumor suppressor in progestin- and growth factor-induced growth in breast cancer.","['Rivas, Martin A', 'Venturutti, Leandro', 'Huang, Yi-Wen', 'Schillaci, Roxana', 'Huang, Tim Hui-Ming', 'Elizalde, Patricia V']","['Rivas MA', 'Venturutti L', 'Huang YW', 'Schillaci R', 'Huang TH', 'Elizalde PV']","['Laboratory of Molecular Mechanisms of Carcinogenesis, Instituto de Biologia y Medicina Experimental (IBYME), CONICET, Vuelta de Obligado 2490, C1428ADN Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120514,England,Breast Cancer Res,Breast cancer research : BCR,100927353,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (CCNE1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (MIRN16 microRNA, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Progestins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (histidine-rich proteins)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin E/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Progestins/*metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptors, Progesterone/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Up-Regulation']",2012/05/16 06:00,2013/03/12 06:00,['2012/05/16 06:00'],"['2011/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['bcr3187 [pii]', '10.1186/bcr3187 [doi]']",epublish,Breast Cancer Res. 2012 May 14;14(3):R77. doi: 10.1186/bcr3187.,,,PMC3446340,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This subgroup activates gene expression in a constitutive ligand-independent manner. These nuclear receptors are classified as early response genes that are induced by a diverse range of signals. These orphan NRs have been implicated in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, inflammation, metabolism and more recently in carcinogenesis. The ultimate growth of a tumor depends not only on the rate of tumor cell proliferation, but also the rate of apoptosis and NR4A1 controls both, survival and death of cancer cells. It has been demonstrated that NR4A1 activities are regulated through its subcellular localisation. In the nucleus, NR4A1 can function in a context dependent manner either as an oncogenic survival factor, promoting cancer cell growth or as the opposite through the activation of apoptosis. Additionally, in an atypical fashion, it is a potent killer when migrating to the mitochondria, where it binds to Bcl-2 and converts its survival phenotype, triggering cytochrome c release and apoptosis. The most convincing evidence that nuclear orphan receptors function as critical tumor suppressors is the observation that the NR4A1 and NR4A3 double knock out mouse develops rapidly acute myeloid leukemia. Down regulation of NR4A1 and NR4A3 was a common feature in leukemic blasts from human AML patients. In particular, the recent identification of pro-apoptotic agents inducing NR4A expression or acting as agonists suggests that these members could serve as potential targets for cancer therapy.","['Deutsch, Alexander J A', 'Angerer, Hannes', 'Fuchs, Tamara E', 'Neumeister, Peter']","['Deutsch AJ', 'Angerer H', 'Fuchs TE', 'Neumeister P']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University Graz, Austria. alexander.deutsch@medunigraz.at']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 2)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 3/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/05/16 06:00,2013/05/15 06:00,['2012/05/16 06:00'],"['2011/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/16 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-20120502-001 [pii]', '10.2174/187152012803529619 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2012 Nov;12(9):1001-14. doi: 10.2174/187152012803529619.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The in vitro anti-tumor activities of decursin and/or DA against prostate cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, bladder cancer, sarcoma, myeloma and leukemia have been increasingly reported in the past decade whereas the in vivo efficacy in mouse models was established only for a few organ sites. Preliminary pharmacokinetic studies by us and others in rodent models indicated that decursinol (DOH), which has much less in vitro direct anticancer activities by itself, is the major and rapid in vivo hydrolysis metabolite of both decursin and DA. Besides decursin, DA and DOH, other chemical components in AGN such as polysaccharides and polyacetylenes have been reported to exert anti-cancer and anti-inflammation activities as well. We systematically reviewed the published literature on the anti-cancer and other bio-activities effects of AGN extract and decursin, DA and DOH, as well as other chemicals identified from AGN.

The GST-tagged SET-domain polypeptide of ALL-1 was assayed for binding to assembled mononucleosomes and nucleosome-dimer particles, either intact or remodeled with purified yeast Isw2.

Kit mutations supposedly contribute to abnormal growth and drug resistance in these patients. METHODS: We established a novel canine mastocytoma cell line, NI-1, from a patient suffering from MC leukemia. RESULTS: NI-1 cells were found to form mastocytoma lesions in NOD/SCID IL-2Rgamma(null) mice and to harbor several homozygous Kit mutations, including missense mutations at nucleotides 107(C-->T) and 1187(A-->G), a 12-bp duplication (nucleotide 1263), and a 12-bp deletion (nucleotide 1550). NI-1 cells expressed several MC differentiation antigens, including tryptase, Kit, and a functional IgE receptor. Compared to the C2 mastocytoma cell line harboring a Kit exon 11 mutation, NI-1 cells were found to be less responsive against the Kit tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) masitinib and imatinib, but were even more sensitive against proliferation-inhibitory effects of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) blocker RAD001 and PI3-kinase/mTOR blocker NVP-BEZ235. The Kit-targeting multikinase inhibitors PKC412 and dasatinib were also found to override TKI resistance in NI-1 cells, and produced growth inhibition with reasonable IC(50) values (<0.1 muM). CONCLUSION: NI-1 may serve as a useful tool to investigate IgE-dependent reactions and mechanisms of abnormal growth and drug resistance in neoplastic MC in advanced mastocytosis.","['Hadzijusufovic, E', 'Peter, B', 'Herrmann, H', 'Rulicke, T', 'Cerny-Reiterer, S', 'Schuch, K', 'Kenner, L', 'Thaiwong, T', 'Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, V', 'Pickl, W F', 'Willmann, M', 'Valent, P']","['Hadzijusufovic E', 'Peter B', 'Herrmann H', 'Rulicke T', 'Cerny-Reiterer S', 'Schuch K', 'Kenner L', 'Thaiwong T', 'Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan V', 'Pickl WF', 'Willmann M', 'Valent P']","['Department for Companion Animals and Horses, Clinic for Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120515,Denmark,Allergy,Allergy,7804028,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dogs', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Histamine Release', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mastocytoma/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Receptors, IgE/immunology/*metabolism']",2012/05/16 06:00,2012/11/01 06:00,['2012/05/16 06:00'],"['2012/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1398-9995.2012.02833.x [doi]'],ppublish,Allergy. 2012 Jul;67(7):858-68. doi: 10.1111/j.1398-9995.2012.02833.x.

Cytarabine (1000 mg/m(2)/12 h days 1-4) was combined with topotecan (TA, 1.25 mg/m(2)/day by continuous intravenous infusion [CIV] days 1-4) in 31 consecutive patients with >/= 5% marrow blasts by day 14 of induction. The median follow-up was 36 months. The CR rate was 81%, and the 2-year probability of overall survival and cumulative incidence of relapse were 66% and 38%, respectively. No unexpected toxicity was observed. Comparison with historical controls treated with the combination of a similar schedule of cytarabine and an anthracycline showed a better CR rate (p = 0.054), overall survival (p = 0.03) and cumulative incidence of relapse (p = 0.03). These results were confirmed in a multivariate analysis model. This work shows that the substitution of an anthracycline by topotecan is feasible and associated with significant efficacy for patients with AML with persistent leukemia at day 14 after standard-dose anthracycline induction.","['Prebet, Thomas', 'Jean, Estelle', 'Autret, Aurelie', 'Charbonnier, Aude', 'Rey, Jerome', 'Etienne, Anne', ""D'incan, Evelyne"", 'Furst, Sabine', 'Arnoulet, Christine', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Vey, Norbert']","['Prebet T', 'Jean E', 'Autret A', 'Charbonnier A', 'Rey J', 'Etienne A', ""D'incan E"", 'Furst S', 'Arnoulet C', 'Blaise D', 'Vey N']","['Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120807,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Topotecan/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2012/05/16 06:00,2013/06/20 06:00,['2012/05/16 06:00'],"['2012/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.685733 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Nov;53(11):2186-91. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.685733.

Several studies have investigated the effects of melatonin on haematological malignancies. However, the previous studies investigating lymphoid malignancies have been largely restricted to a single type of malignancy, Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). Thus, we examined the actions of melatonin on the growth and apoptosis in a small panel of cell lines representing different human lymphoid malignancies including Ramos (Epstein-Barr virus-negative BL), SU-DHL-4 (diffuse large B cell lymphoma), DoHH2 (follicular B non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and JURKAT (acute T cell leukaemia). We showed that melatonin promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in all these cells, although there was marked variations in responses among different cell lines (sensitivity; Ramos/DoHH2 > SU-DHL-4 > JURKAT). Melatonin-induced apoptosis was relatively rapid, with increased caspase 3 and PARP cleavage detected within 0.5-1 h following melatonin addition. Moreover, there was evidence for rapid processing of both caspase 9, as well as a breakdown of the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential. On the contrary, caspase activation was detected only in SU-DHL-4 and Ramos cells following melatonin treatment suggesting that the extrinsic pathway does not make a consistent contribution to melatonin-induced apoptosis in malignant lymphocytes. Although all cell lines expressed the high-affinity melatonin receptors, MT1 and MT2, melatonin-induced caspase activation appeared to be independent these receptors. Our findings confirm that melatonin could be a potential chemotherapeutic/preventive agent for malignant lymphocytes. However, it is necessary to take into account that different lymphoid malignancies may differ in their response to melatonin.","['Sanchez-Hidalgo, Marina', 'Lee, Melanie', 'de la Lastra, Catalina A', 'Guerrero, Juan M', 'Packham, Graham']","['Sanchez-Hidalgo M', 'Lee M', 'de la Lastra CA', 'Guerrero JM', 'Packham G']","['Faculty of Medicine, Cancer Research UK Centre, Cancer Sciences, Southampton General Hospital, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK. hidalgosanz@us.es']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120514,England,J Pineal Res,Journal of pineal research,8504412,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptor, Melatonin, MT1)', '0 (Receptor, Melatonin, MT2)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Melatonin/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Receptor, Melatonin, MT1/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Melatonin, MT2/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2012/05/16 06:00,2013/03/23 06:00,['2012/05/16 06:00'],"['2012/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-079X.2012.01006.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Pineal Res. 2012 Nov;53(4):366-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-079X.2012.01006.x.

Previous studies have suggested that microRNA-182 (miR-182) functions as an oncogene and plays a role in tumorigenesis, through regulation of FOXO3A. FOXO3A has been implicated in tumor suppression and GC-induced apoptosis, suggesting that FOXO3A has potential as a therapeutic target. Herein we investigated the role of miR-182 in GC sensitivity in lymphoblastic malignancies. Expression of miR-182 was consistently higher in human and mouse GC-resistant cell lines than in GC-sensitive cell lines. Furthermore, increased expression of miR-182 reduced total FOXO3A expression but had no significant effect on phospho-FOXO3A. Additionally Bim, as a downstream target of FOXO3A, was reduced by overexpression of miR-182, and increased by down-regulation of miR-182. These results demonstrate that miR-182 is involved in glucocorticoid resistance, via targeting of FOXO3A, and that restoration of miR-182 is a potentially promising therapeutic strategy in lymphoblastic malignancies.","['Yang, Apeng', 'Ma, Jiexian', 'Wu, Min', 'Qin, Wenming', 'Zhao, Botao', 'Shi, Yi', 'Jin, Youxin', 'Xie, Yanhui']","['Yang A', 'Ma J', 'Wu M', 'Qin W', 'Zhao B', 'Shi Y', 'Jin Y', 'Xie Y']","['The Hematology Department of Huadong Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120618,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn182 microRNA, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2012/05/16 06:00,2013/04/16 06:00,['2012/05/16 06:00'],"['2012/05/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.693178 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Dec;53(12):2465-73. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.693178.

IGF-1 plays an important role in tumor proliferation in various malignancies. The relationship between IGF-1 and thyroid hormones is complex and not fully understood. Therefore we planned to evaluate the level of IGF-1 and thyroid hormones in patients of acute leukemia. METHODS: The present study included 25 patients with acute leukemia (Acute Myeloid Leukemia, n = 16; Acute Lymphoid Leukemia n = 9, mean age 28.16 years). 25 age and gender matched healthy individuals were taken as control (mean age 27.17 years). In all the subjects, serum IGF-1 was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), serum total triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4) by radioimmunoassay (RIA), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) by immunoradiometric assay (IRMA), and free T3 (FT3) and free T4 (FT4) by chemilluminiscence. These tests were done before starting of chemotherapy and either 6 to 8 weeks after chemotherapy or at the time of remission, whichever was earlier. RESULTS: At the time of diagnosis, patients with acute leukemia showed a significantly increased level of IGF-1 as compared to controls (198.32 +/- 67.55 vs 160.64 +/- 45.96; p < 0.01). After 6 to 8 weeks of chemotherapy, patients with acute leukemia showed a significant decrease in the level of IGF-1 compared to the baseline values (198.32 +/- 67.55 vs 155.6 +/- 45.96; p < 0.01). Though FT3, FT4, total T3, and total T4 values in these patients were within the normal range, these values were still significantly higher compared to controls. TSH levels were significantly lower in patients at the time of presentation and the levels increased after chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The estimation of IGF-1 and thyroid hormones may be helpful in assessing the disease activity and predicting the response of chemotherapy.","['Ghalaut, Veena Singh', 'Yadav, Surabhi', 'Ghalaut, P S', 'Yadav, Amit', 'Sachdeva, Ashuma', 'Yadav, Rakhee', 'Sharma, Tarun Kumar', 'Shankar, Vijay']","['Ghalaut VS', 'Yadav S', 'Ghalaut PS', 'Yadav A', 'Sachdeva A', 'Yadav R', 'Sharma TK', 'Shankar V']","['Department of Biochemistry, Pt.

STAT3 signaling is essential for controlling lung injury during pneumonia. We previously identified LIF as a prominent STAT3-activating cytokine expressed in the airspaces of pneumonic lungs, but its physiological significance in this setting has never been explored. To do so, Escherichia coli was intratracheally instilled into C57BL/6 mice in the presence of neutralizing anti-LIF IgG or control IgG. Anti-LIF completely eliminated lung LIF detection and markedly exacerbated lung injury compared with control mice as evidenced by airspace albumin content, lung liquid accumulation, and histological analysis. Although lung bacteriology was equivalent between groups, bacteremia was more prevalent with anti-LIF treatment, suggestive of compromised barrier function rather than impaired antibacterial defense as the cause of dissemination. Inflammatory cytokine expression was also exaggerated in anti-LIF-treated lungs, albeit after injury had ensued. Interestingly, alveolar neutrophil recruitment was modestly but significantly reduced compared with control mice despite elevated cytokine levels, indicating that inflammatory injury was not a consequence of excessive neutrophilic alveolitis. Lastly, the lung transcriptome was dramatically remodeled during pneumonia, but far more so following LIF neutralization, with gene changes implicating cell death and epithelial homeostasis among other processes relevant to tissue injury. From these findings, we conclude that endogenous LIF facilitates tissue protection during pneumonia. The LIF-STAT3 axis is identified in this study as a critical determinant of lung injury with clinical implications for pneumonia patients.","['Quinton, Lee J', 'Mizgerd, Joseph P', 'Hilliard, Kristie L', 'Jones, Matthew R', 'Kwon, Candice Y', 'Allen, Eri']","['Quinton LJ', 'Mizgerd JP', 'Hilliard KL', 'Jones MR', 'Kwon CY', 'Allen E']","['Pulmonary Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120511,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/chemistry/immunology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Escherichia coli Infections/immunology/metabolism/microbiology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lung/immunology/*metabolism/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pneumonia/immunology/*metabolism/microbiology/pathology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/immunology/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology']",2012/05/15 06:00,2012/08/15 06:00,['2012/05/15 06:00'],"['2012/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1200256 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1200256 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2012 Jun 15;188(12):6300-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1200256.

A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) is known to be frequently upregulated in many cancers. We aimed to determine the biological function of ADAM10 in the chemoresistance of HCC cells. Overexpression of ADAM10 in three HCC cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B, and Huh7) conferred protection against doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, as determined by Annexin V staining. Western blot analysis revealed that ADAM10-overexpressing cells had a significantly lower amount of cleaved caspase-3 and an elevated expression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), a prosurvival member of the Bcl-2 family. Conversely, RNA interference-mediated silencing of endogenous ADAM10 potentiated doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in HepG2 and Hep3B cells, which was coupled with increased cleavage of caspase-3 and decreased expression of Mcl-1. Ectopic expression of ADAM10 resulted in a marked increase in the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and Akt. Most interestingly, the pretreatment with the PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 significantly enhanced doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and diminished the Mcl-1 expression in ADAM10-overexpressing Huh7 cells. Our data provide evidence that ADAM10 plays an important role in modulating the chemosensitivity of HCC cells, which, at least partially, involves the activation of the PI3-K/Akt pathway. ADAM10 may be a promising target for the improvement of chemotherapeutic efficacy in HCC.","['Yang, Cheng-lin', 'Jiang, Feng-qin', 'Xu, Feng', 'Jiang, Gui-xing']","['Yang CL', 'Jiang FQ', 'Xu F', 'Jiang GX']","['Ankang Central Hospital, Ankang, 725000, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120513,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.81 (ADAM10 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.81 (ADAM10 protein, human)']",IM,"['ADAM Proteins/*genetics', 'ADAM10 Protein', 'Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*genetics', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2012/05/15 06:00,2012/12/27 06:00,['2012/05/15 06:00'],"['2012/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-012-0405-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2012 Oct;33(5):1535-41. doi: 10.1007/s13277-012-0405-4.

RESULTS: In a comparative simulation study accuracy and robustness of the proposed and established methodologies are validated, considering various sources of variation in the data. To assess this variation, we propose a jackknife resampling procedure resulting in an ensemble of optimal modules. A consensus approach summarizes the ensemble into one final module containing maximally robust nodes and edges. The resulting consensus module identifies and visualizes robust and variable regions by assigning support values to nodes and edges. Finally, the proposed approach is exemplified on two large gene expression studies: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Beisser, Daniela', 'Brunkhorst, Stefan', 'Dandekar, Thomas', 'Klau, Gunnar W', 'Dittrich, Marcus T', 'Muller, Tobias']","['Beisser D', 'Brunkhorst S', 'Dandekar T', 'Klau GW', 'Dittrich MT', 'Muller T']","['Department of Bioinformatics, Biocenter, University of Wurzburg, Am Hubland, 97074 Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120511,England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Computer Simulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics']",2012/05/15 06:00,2013/04/17 06:00,['2012/05/15 06:00'],"['2012/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bts265 [pii]', '10.1093/bioinformatics/bts265 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2012 Jul 15;28(14):1887-94. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bts265.

The aim of this study was to compare the performances of these two methodologies in the detection of minimal residual disease in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry were simultaneously applied for prospective minimal residual disease measurements at days 15, 33 and 78 of induction therapy on 3565 samples from 1547 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled into the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000 trial. RESULTS: The overall concordance was 80%, but different results were observed according to the time point. Most discordances were found at day 33 (concordance rate 70%) in samples that had significantly lower minimal residual disease. However, the discordance was not due to different starting materials (total versus mononucleated cells), but rather to cell input number. At day 33, cases with minimal residual disease below or above the 0.01% cut-off by both methods showed a very good outcome (5-year event-free survival, 91.6%) or a poor one (5-year event-free survival, 50.9%), respectively, whereas discordant cases showed similar event-free survival rates (around 80%). CONCLUSIONS: Within the current BFM-based protocols, flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction cannot simply substitute each other at single time points, and the concordance rates between their results depend largely on the time at which they are used. Our findings suggest a potential complementary role of the two technologies in optimizing risk stratification in future clinical trials.","['Gaipa, Giuseppe', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Panzer-Grumayer, Renate', 'Buldini, Barbara', 'Silvestri, Daniela', 'Karawajew, Leonid', 'Maglia, Oscar', 'Ratei, Richard', 'Benetello, Alessandra', 'Sala, Simona', 'Schumich, Angela', 'Schrauder, Andre', 'Villa, Tiziana', 'Veltroni, Marinella', 'Ludwig, Wolf-Dieter', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Dworzak, Michael N', 'Basso, Giuseppe']","['Gaipa G', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Panzer-Grumayer R', 'Buldini B', 'Silvestri D', 'Karawajew L', 'Maglia O', 'Ratei R', 'Benetello A', 'Sala S', 'Schumich A', 'Schrauder A', 'Villa T', 'Veltroni M', 'Ludwig WD', 'Conter V', 'Schrappe M', 'Biondi A', 'Dworzak MN', 'Basso G']","['M Tettamanti Research Center, Pediatric Clinic University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120511,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/mortality', '*Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2012/05/15 06:00,2013/07/09 06:00,['2012/05/15 06:00'],"['2012/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.060426 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.060426 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Oct;97(10):1582-93. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.060426.

We performed a long-term, follow-up retrospective study to address the outcome of patients with ETV6/RUNX1-positive leukemia relapses. DESIGN AND METHODS: Among the 713 children tested for ETV6/RUNX1 enrolled into the FRALLE 93 protocol, 43 ETV6/RUNX1-positive patients relapsed (19.4%). Most were initially stratified in the low or intermediate risk groups. The median follow-up after relapse was 54.2 months. All but three received second-line salvage therapy and 16 underwent allogeneic transplantation. RESULTS: ETV6/RUNX1 had a strong effect on overall survival after relapse (3-year survival= 64.7% for positive cases versus 46.5% for negative cases) (P=0.007). The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 19.4% and testes were more frequently involved in ETV6/RUNX1-positive relapses (P=0.04). In 81.4% of cases the relapses were late, early combined or isolated extramedullary relapses. The 5-year survival rate of patients with ETV6-RUNX1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapses reached 80.8% when the relapse occurred after 36 months (versus 31.2% when the relapse occurred earlier). In univariate analysis, female gender was associated with a poor survival, whereas site of relapse, age at diagnosis, leukocytosis and consolidation strategy had no effect. In multivariate analysis, only the duration of first remission remained associated with outcome. CONCLUSIONS: We found an excellent outcome for patients with ETV6/RUNX1-positive leukemia relapses that occurred more than 36 months after diagnosis. The duration of first complete remission may, therefore, be a guide to define the treatment strategy for patients with relapsed ETV6/RUNX1- positive leukemia.","['Gandemer, Virginie', 'Chevret, Sylvie', 'Petit, Arnaud', 'Vermylen, Christiane', 'Leblanc, Thierry', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Schmitt, Claudine', 'Lejars, Odile', 'Schneider, Pascale', 'Demeocq, Francois', 'Bader-Meunier, Brigitte', 'Bernaudin, Francoise', 'Perel, Yves', 'Auclerc, Marie-Francoise', 'Cayuela, Jean-Michel', 'Leverger, Guy', 'Baruchel, Andre']","['Gandemer V', 'Chevret S', 'Petit A', 'Vermylen C', 'Leblanc T', 'Michel G', 'Schmitt C', 'Lejars O', 'Schneider P', 'Demeocq F', 'Bader-Meunier B', 'Bernaudin F', 'Perel Y', 'Auclerc MF', 'Cayuela JM', 'Leverger G', 'Baruchel A']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital of Rennes, France. virginie.gandemer@chu-rennes.fr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120511,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'V27W9254FZ (Cortisone)', 'FRALLE 93 protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Cortisone/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2012/05/15 06:00,2013/11/08 06:00,['2012/05/15 06:00'],"['2012/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.059584 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.059584 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Nov;97(11):1743-50. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.059584.

However, it is unknown if it has a role in the pituitary. Recently, our group found that 15-PGDH expression was low in prolactin (PRL) secreting adenomas (prolactinomas) and growth hormone (GH) secreting adenomas (GHomas) using fiber-optic BeadArray technology. In this study, we examined the relative expression of 15-PGDH and COX-2 mRNA in clinical specimens and examined the effects of 15-PGDH on GH3 rat pituitary tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis and hormone secretion. 15-PGDH expression was lower and COX-2 expression was higher in prolactinomas and GHomas compared with normal controls. Overexpressed 15-PGDH inhibited tumor cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. It had a significant suppressive effect on mRNA levels and on the secretion of PRL and GH in GH3 cells. The inhibition of cell proliferation was accompanied by the decreased expression of cox-2, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and B cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2). These data are suggestive of a previously unrecognized pathway in pituitary tumorigenesis, and this novel observation may shed light on therapeutic strategies for pituitary tumors.","['Bai, Ji-Wei', 'Wang, Zhe', 'Gui, Song-Bai', 'Zhang, Ya-Zhuo']","['Bai JW', 'Wang Z', 'Gui SB', 'Zhang YZ']","['Beijing Neurosurgical Institute, Capital Medical University, and Neurosurgical Department, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Dongcheng District, Beijing 100050, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120509,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Hydroxyprostaglandin Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 1.1.1.141 (15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Dinoprostone/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Growth Hormone/metabolism', 'Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyprostaglandin Dehydrogenases/biosynthesis/*deficiency/genetics', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/metabolism', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Prolactin/metabolism', 'Prolactinoma/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Rats', 'Transfection', 'Young Adult']",2012/05/15 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/05/15 06:00'],"['2012/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2012.1806 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2012 Aug;28(2):714-20. doi: 10.3892/or.2012.1806.

Both isolated strains belonged to phylogenetic group B2 and harboured some of the main virulence factor genes commonly found in extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), including neuC, iro and fimH. Cellulitis due to E. coli seems to be linked to the immunocompromised status of patients rather than to a highly virulent clone.

At our institution, ATG is exclusively used in the conditioning of matched unrelated donor (URD) transplant recipients. A total of 50 URD HCT recipients who received ATG (ATG group) were retrospectively compared with 48 matched related donor (MRD) HCT recipients who did not receive ATG (no ATG group). There were no significant differences between the groups in rates of day 100 mortality, acute GVHD or relapse. Chronic GVHD incidence was significantly lower in the ATG group (P = 0.007). At a median follow-up of 36 months in the entire cohort, 50% patients are alive in the ATG group and 63% of the patients are alive in the no ATG group (P = 0.13).

In the present study, we analyzed RPL23 expression in 169 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by using real-time PCR. The apoptosis of CD34(+) marrow cells was examined by flow cytometry, and the correlation between RPL23 expression levels and apoptosis in CD34(+) cells was assessed. We then analyzed the clinical significance of RPL23 expression for predicting disease progression and patient survival as well as therapeutic response in patients administered with a cytarabine, homoharringtonine, and G-CSF (CHG) regimen or decitabine therapy. Increased RPL23 expression was found in patients with higher-risk MDS than in patients with lower-risk disease (p = 0.004). RPL23 expression levels were found being inversely correlated with decreased apoptotic ratio of CD34(+) cells in higher-risk patients (r = -0.672, p < 0.001). Compared to patients with normal RPL23 expression levels, those with increased RPL23 expression presented higher rates of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (p = 0.005) and reduced 2-year survival rates (p = 0.012). Multivariate regression analysis showed that RPL23 expression level was an independent predictor of prognosis, regardless of patient age, IPSS score, or hemoglobin level. Moreover, patients with RPL23 over-expression appeared to have lower response rates to CHG chemotherapy (p = 0.027) but similar response rates to decitabine treatment. In conclusion, the over-expression of RPL23 might confer apoptosis resistance in CD34(+) cells, which may lead to disease progression and adverse prognosis in MDS. Increased RPL23 expression was an inverse indicator for CHG regimen, but not for decitabine treatment.","['Wu, Lingyun', 'Li, Xiao', 'Xu, Feng', 'Chang, Chunkang', 'He, Qi', 'Zhang, Zheng', 'Zhang, Yan']","['Wu L', 'Li X', 'Xu F', 'Chang C', 'He Q', 'Zhang Z', 'Zhang Y']","['Hematology Division, Sixth Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai 200233, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120513,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (ribosomal protein L17)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/*biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Decitabine', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Harringtonines/therapeutic use', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Ribosomal Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2012/05/15 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/05/15 06:00'],"['2012/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-012-1486-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2012 Oct;91(10):1547-54. doi: 10.1007/s00277-012-1486-2.

As high levels of Bcl-3 expression and activation have been detected in different types of human cancer, Bcl-3 has been labeled a proto-oncogene. Our study uncovered a markedly upregulated Bcl-3 expression in human prostate cancer (PCa), where inflammatory cell infiltration was observed. Elevated Bcl-3 expression in PCa was dependent on the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6-mediated STAT3 activation. Microarray analyses, using Bcl-3 knockdown in PCa cells, identified the inhibitor of DNA-binding (Id) family of helix-loop-helix proteins as potential Bcl-3-regulated genes. Bcl-3 knockdown reduced the abundance of Id-1 and Id-2 proteins and boosted PCa cells to be more receptive to undergoing apoptosis following treatment with anticancer drug. Our data imply that inactivation of Bcl-3 may lead to sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis, thus suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy in PCa treatment.","['Ahlqvist, K', 'Saamarthy, K', 'Syed Khaja, A S', 'Bjartell, A', 'Massoumi, R']","['Ahlqvist K', 'Saamarthy K', 'Syed Khaja AS', 'Bjartell A', 'Massoumi R']","['Center for Molecular Tumor Pathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Skane University Hospital, Malmo, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120514,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (BCL3 protein, human)', '0 (ID1 protein, human)', '0 (ID2 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B p52 Subunit)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1/*genetics', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2/*genetics', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Male', 'NF-kappa B p52 Subunit/physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/physiology', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/physiology']",2012/05/15 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2012/05/15 06:00'],"['2012/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2012175 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.175 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Mar 21;32(12):1601-8. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.175.

Unfortunately, there is a lack of information on the signal transduction pathways of beta-conglycinin induced mast cell activation and how to alleviate these allergic reactions. Bupleurum falcatum, a traditional oriental medicine, has been widely utilized in the treatment of influenza, fever, malaria and menstrual disorders. Furthermore, it has been reported that saikosaponins, the important principle of B. falcatum, possesses anti-allergic activities. Therefore, the present study investigated whether or not saikosaponin-d, an extract of B. falcatum, was effective in the treatment of allergic reactions cased by beta-conglycinin, using a rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cell line. There were multiple signaling pathways contributing to the development of beta-conglycinin-mediated rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cell activation. The intracellular calcium mobilization and tyrosine phosphorylation were early events, which in turn elicited reactive oxygen species production, gene activation of Cdc42 and c-Fos, and ultimately led to beta-hexosaminidase release. Saikosaponin-d inhibited rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cell degranulation by suppressing these critical incidents in the signal transduction pathway. These results suggest that saikosaponin-d exhibited anti-allergic activity and could become an effective herbal therapy for alleviating soybean allergy.","['Hao, Yue', 'Piao, Xiangshu', 'Piao, Xianglan']","['Hao Y', 'Piao X', 'Piao X']","['State Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, China Agricultural University, No. 2 Yuanmingyuan West Road, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120511,Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Antigens, Plant)', '0 (Globulins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (Seed Storage Proteins)', '0 (Soybean Proteins)', '0 (beta-conglycinin protein, Glycine max)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)', 'UR635J3F00 (saikosaponin D)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Plant/*immunology', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Food Hypersensitivity/drug therapy/immunology', 'Globulins/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/immunology', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/*immunology/physiology', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Saponins/*pharmacology', 'Seed Storage Proteins/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology', 'Soybean Proteins/*immunology', 'Soybeans/adverse effects/immunology', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism']",2012/05/15 06:00,2012/10/26 06:00,['2012/05/15 06:00'],"['2011/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S1567-5769(12)00129-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.intimp.2012.04.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2012 Jul;13(3):257-63. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2012.04.021.

Contrary to study presumptions, not elevated copeptin but the lack of a proper initial increase of plasma copeptin (<0.02 ng/mL from day 0 to day 1) predicted blood culture positive sepsis (p=0.023) and gram-negative bacteremia (p=0.045). No correlation was observed with plasma sodium, blood pressure or evaluated osmolality. Plasma copeptin correlated inversely with the same day pentraxin 3 on day 0-day 2 (all p-values <0.001) and with C-reactive protein on day 1 (p=0.015). In conclusion, copeptin did not correlate with disease severity, but the lack of a proper initial increase was associated with bacteremic complications of febrile neutropenia in hematological patients.

It was established that the ethanolic extract of the leaves of Crotalaria agatiflora, as well as the isolated compound madurensine, is moderately toxic against leukemic U-937 cells. Light microscopic investigations indicated that symptoms of cell death are induced during treatments, but flow cytometry analysis of treated cells, using annexin-V and propidium iodide, showed that apoptosis and necrosis are insignificantly induced. The Raman results suggested that protein extraction and DNA melting occur in the cells during treatment with the ethanolic extracts (IC(50) value 73.9 mug/mL), drastically changing the molecular content of the cells. In contrast, treatment with madurensine (IC(50) value 136.5 mug/mL), an isolated pyrrolizidine alkaloid from the ethanolic extract of the leaves, did not have the same effect. The results are also compared to that of cells treated with actinomycin D, a compound known to induce apoptosis. The investigation showed that micro-Raman spectroscopy has great promise to be used for initial screening of samples to determine the effects of different treatments on cancerous cell lines together with conventional methods. The results highlight the fact that for many natural products used for medicinal purposes, the therapeutic effect of the crude plant extract tends to be significantly more effective than the particular action of its individual constituents.","['le Roux, Karlien', 'Prinsloo, Linda C', 'Hussein, Ahmed A', 'Lall, Namrita']","['le Roux K', 'Prinsloo LC', 'Hussein AA', 'Lall N']","['Department of Plant Science, University of Pretoria, Pretoria 0002, South Africa.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120423,England,Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc,"Spectrochimica acta.

In this study we describe glycomic alterations of multidrug resistance in human leukemia cell lines. Using multiple glycan profiling tools: real-time PCR for quantification of glycogenes, FITC-lectin binding for glycan profiling, and mass spectrometry for glycan composition, we compared the glycomics of drug-resistant K562/ADR cells with parental K562 line. The results showed that the expression of glycogenes, glycan profiling and N-glycan composition were different in K562/ADR cells, as compared with those in K562 cells, whereas O-glycans of the two cell lines showed no different mass spectra. Further analysis of the N-glycan regulation by way of tunicamycin application or PNGase F treatment in K562/ADR cells showed partial inhibition of biosynthesis and increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro. We targeted glycogene B3GNT8 and ST8SIA4, which were over-expressed in K562/ADR cells, and silenced the expression levels of two glycogenes after using RNA interference approach. The results showed that the silencing of B3GNT8 or ST8SIA4 in K562/ADR cells resulted in increased chemosensitivity to anti-tumor drugs. In conclusion, glycomic alterations are responsible for the overcoming multidrug resistance in human leukemia therapy and the N-linked oligosaccharides are associated with the drug resistance of cancer cells.","['Zhang, Zhaohai', 'Zhao, Yongfu', 'Jiang, Lili', 'Miao, Xiaoyan', 'Zhou, Huimin', 'Jia, Li']","['Zhang Z', 'Zhao Y', 'Jiang L', 'Miao X', 'Zhou H', 'Jia L']","['College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, Liaoning Province, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120511,Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (B3GNT8 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (ST8SIA4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.52 (Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) Asparagine Amidase)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glycomics/*methods', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lectins/metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) Asparagine Amidase/metabolism', 'Polysaccharides/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sialyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2012/05/15 06:00,2012/10/27 06:00,['2012/05/15 06:00'],"['2012/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S1357-2725(12)00151-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biocel.2012.04.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2012 Aug;44(8):1244-53. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2012.04.026.

GVS inhibited colony formation and proliferation and induced apoptosis at doses two- to threefold lower in a panel of JAK2(V617F) MPN compared to JAK2 wild-type myeloid leukemia cell lines. By global gene expression analysis, we observed that at 6 hours, GVS modulated 293 common genes in the JAK2(V617F) cell lines HEL and UKE1, of which 19 are implicated in cell cycle regulation and 33 in hematopoiesis. In particular, the hematopoietic transcription factors NFE2 and C-MYB were downmodulated by the drug specifically in JAK2(V617F) cells at both the RNA and protein level. GVS also inhibited JAK2-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation, but modulation of NFE2 and C-MYB was JAK2-independent, as shown using the JAK2 inhibitor TG101209. GVS had a direct effect on the NFE2 promoters, as demonstrated by specific enrichment of associated histone H3 acetylated at lysine 9. Modulation by GVS of NFE2 was also observed in freshly isolated CD34(+) cells from MPN patients, and was accompanied by inhibition of their proliferation and differentiation toward the erythroid lineage. We conclude that GVS acts on MPN cells through dual JAK2-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 inhibition and downmodulation of NFE2 and C-MYB transcription.","['Amaru Calzada, Ariel', 'Todoerti, Katia', 'Donadoni, Luca', 'Pellicioli, Anna', 'Tuana, Giacomo', 'Gatta, Raffaella', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Finazzi, Guido', 'Mantovani, Roberto', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Introna, Martino', 'Lombardi, Luigia', 'Golay, Josee']","['Amaru Calzada A', 'Todoerti K', 'Donadoni L', 'Pellicioli A', 'Tuana G', 'Gatta R', 'Neri A', 'Finazzi G', 'Mantovani R', 'Rambaldi A', 'Introna M', 'Lombardi L', 'Golay J']","['USC Hematology, Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120508,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Carbamates)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (NFE2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (TG101209)', '5P60F84FBH (givinostat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Carbamates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics/*physiology', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']",2012/05/15 06:00,2012/10/02 06:00,['2012/05/15 06:00'],"['2011/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/26 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(12)00174-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2012.04.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2012 Aug;40(8):634-45.e10. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2012.04.007.

However, the only approach with curative potential remains allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). To date, no direct comparison of both strategies has been reported. The outcomes of 2 well-balanced cohorts of patients with high-risk MDS defined by age (60-70 years), performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score </=2), and donor availability (yes/no) were compared, including 103 patients undergoing HCT and 75 patients without this option who received AZA. The estimated 2-year overall survival after the start of treatment was 39% (95% confidence interval, 30%-50%) for the patients undergoing HCT and 23% (95% confidence interval, 14%-40%) for the patients receiving AZA therapy. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis of all patients (n = 178), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score (0 versus 1 versus 2; hazard ratio [HR], 2.9/3.9; P < .001), cytogenetics (good versus intermediate versus poor; HR, 1.2/1.7; P = .026), and treatment (HCT versus AZA; HR, 0.3; P = .007) were associated with overall survival.

The carrageenan-induced inflammatory cascades involve toll-like receptor (TLR)4- and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma (BCL)10-dependent activation of NF-kappaB, leading to increased IL-8 production. Translocations involving BCL10 in the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas are associated with constitutive activation of NF-kappaB. This report presents a mechanism by which carrageenan exposure leads to prolonged activation of both BCL10 and NF-kappaB in human colonic epithelial cells. Study findings demonstrate that nuclear RelA and RelB bind to an NF-kappaB binding motif in the BCL10 promoter in human colonic epithelial NCM460 and HT-29 cells. In vitro oligonucleotide binding assay, non-radioactive gel shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) indicate binding of RelA and RelB to the BCL10 promoter. Prolonged inflammation follows activation of the BCL10-NFkappaB inflammatory loop in response to carrageenan, shown by increased BCL10, RelA, and IL-8 for 36 to 48h and increased RelB for 24h following withdrawal of carrageenan after 12h. In contrast, exposure to dextran sulfate sodium, which does not cause inflammation through TLR4 and BCL10 in the colonic epithelial cells, did not provoke prolonged activation of inflammation. The carrageenan-enhanced BCL10 promoter activity was blocked by caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and MB-132 which inhibit NF-kappaB activation. These results indicate that NF-kappaB binding to the BCL10 promoter can lead to prolonged activation of the carrageenan-induced inflammatory cascade by a transcriptional mechanism involving an NF-kappaB-BCL10 loop.","['Borthakur, Alip', 'Bhattacharyya, Sumit', 'Anbazhagan, Arivarasu N', 'Kumar, Anoop', 'Dudeja, Pradeep K', 'Tobacman, Joanne K']","['Borthakur A', 'Bhattacharyya S', 'Anbazhagan AN', 'Kumar A', 'Dudeja PK', 'Tobacman JK']","['Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120508,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein)', '0 (BCL10 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RELA protein, human)', '0 (RELB protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '147337-75-5 (Transcription Factor RelB)', '9000-07-1 (Carrageenan)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein', 'Carrageenan/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Colitis/chemically induced/genetics/*metabolism', 'Colon/*drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelB/metabolism', 'Transfection']",2012/05/15 06:00,2013/01/19 06:00,['2012/05/15 06:00'],"['2011/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0925-4439(12)00103-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbadis.2012.05.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2012 Aug;1822(8):1300-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbadis.2012.05.001.

The overall complete remission rate with or without platelet recovery was 7% (2/27). Activity of lenalidomide was limited to patients with noncomplex cytogenetics. BACKGROUND: Lenalidomide is effective in low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with deletion 5q. We conducted a phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lenalidomide in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk MDS with any chromosome 5 abnormality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen adults with AML and 9 with high-risk MDS were enrolled. Lenalidomide was given orally at doses 5 to 25 mg daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable adverse event. RESULTS: Median age for all 27 patients was 64 years (range, 39-88 years) with a median of 2 previous therapies (range, 1-6 lines). Two patients (7%) with AML and 5q deletion and +8 cytogenetic abnormality in 2 separate clones achieved complete remission (CR) or CR without platelet recovery (CRp).

We identified all patients with HAC using microbiology records from 1/2004 to 12/2007, reviewed medical records, and pulled isolates for testing. We compared mortality, underlying illness, Candida species distribution, and antifungal susceptibility with 2 prior University of Iowa cohorts (88 patients from 1983 to 1986 [pre-FLU], and 108 from 1997 to 2001 [pre-EC]). Of 108 patients with HAC from 2004 to 2007, species distribution was 47% C. albicans, 29% C. glabrata, 12% C. parapsilosis, 6% C. tropicalis, and no C. krusei. Compared with pre-FLU and pre-EC eras, there was a reduction in % C. albicans (from 61% and 60%, respectively), an increase in % C. glabrata (from 0% and 16%), and no change in % C. parapsilosis over time (12% and 12%). In-hospital mortality was lower in 2004-2007 than both pre-FLU and pre-EC (31% versus 57-61%), and 30-day mortality was also lower (33% versus 48% in pre-EC). Mean Charlson index was lower for the 2004-2007 cohort than pre-EC (3.0 versus 3.4)-fewer patients had leukemia or lymphoma (8% versus 16%) or other malignancies (18% versus 24%), while more were surgical patients (58% versus 48%). Using the new Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints for FLU and caspofungin, we found no caspofungin resistance, and FLU resistance only among C. glabrata (15% had FLU MICs >32 microg/mL). The epidemiology of HAC is changing at our hospital, with continued emergence of C. glabrata, fewer cases among oncology patients, and lower in-hospital and 30-day mortality.","['Diekema, Daniel', 'Arbefeville, Sophie', 'Boyken, Linda', 'Kroeger, Jennifer', 'Pfaller, Michael']","['Diekema D', 'Arbefeville S', 'Boyken L', 'Kroeger J', 'Pfaller M']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA. daniel-diekema@uiowa.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,Diagnostic microbiology and infectious disease,8305899,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antifungal Agents/pharmacology', 'Candida/classification/drug effects/*isolation & purification', 'Candidemia/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Comorbidity', 'Cross Infection/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Drug Resistance, Fungal', 'Female', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Iowa/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis']",2012/05/15 06:00,2012/09/06 06:00,['2012/05/15 06:00'],"['2011/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0732-8893(12)00066-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2012.02.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis. 2012 May;73(1):45-8. doi: 10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2012.02.001.,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

BACKGROUND: Alkylating agents have shown activity in leukemia. Bendamustine, an active alkylating agent in lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, was given in a fractionated twice daily schedule for 4 days to patients with acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to define the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adults with refractory acute leukemia or high-risk MDS were treated with bendamustine at a starting dose of 50 mg/m(2) IV over 1-2 hours twice daily for 4 days. Dose escalations were by 25 mg/m(2) in the 1st 3 levels. The study used the 3 + 3 design. RESULTS: A total of 25 patients were treated. Their median age was 57 years; the median salvage number was 3. Grade 2 creatinine elevations were observed in 1 of 6 patients at the 50 mg/m(2) dose, in 2 of 13 patients at the 75 mg/m(2) dose, and in 3 of 6 patients at the 100 mg/m(2) dose. This was considered significant, even though DLT was not reached. One patient achieved marrow complete remission. Significant reductions of marrow blasts (50% or more) were observed in 6 of 25 patients (24%). CONCLUSION: Bendamustine fractionated dose level of 100 mg/m(2) IV twice daily for 4 days (800 mg/m(2) per course) was associated with Grade 2 renal toxicity. The proposed phase II schedule is 75 mg/m(2) IV twice daily for 4 days. Future studies should evaluate this schedule in less heavily treated patients.","['Chacar, Christelle', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Rios, Mary Beth', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Chacar C', 'Jabbour E', 'Ravandi F', 'Borthakur G', 'Kadia T', 'Estrov Z', 'Rios MB', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H']","['The Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2012/05/15 06:00,2013/01/23 06:00,['2012/05/15 06:00'],"['2012/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(12)00052-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2012.03.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2012 Jun;12(3):197-200. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2012.03.004.,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Although allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is considered potentially curative, very few patients have been reported who have undergone allo-SCT for MPN-BP; therefore the success rate remains unknown. In a retrospective review, we identified 13 patients with an MPN transformation to blast phase after a median 9 years (range 5 months to 30 years); 8 (median age 55) continued to allo-SCT within 6 months. Induction chemotherapy cleared blood/marrow blasts in 60% (6/10) (2 declined therapy, 1 had early death). At the time of allo-SCT, 5/8 patients were in complete remission (CR) of their leukemia or had returned to MPN chronic phase (CP), 2 had residual blood blasts and 1 was refractory with >5% marrow blasts. At follow-up (median 20.3 months), 6 patients are alive in CR of both their leukemia/MPN. All 5 patients in CR/CP at pre-allo-SCT remain alive in remission, while 2/3 with persistent blood/marrow blasts relapsed and expired.

Their frequently result in rearrangements of the ETV6 gene. At present, 48 chromosomal bands have been identified to be involved in ETV6 translocations, insertions or inversions and 30 ETV6 partner genes have been molecularly characterized. The ETV6 protein contains two major domains, the HLH (helix-loop-helix) domain, encoded by exons 3 and 4, and the ETS domain, encoded by exons 6 through 8, with in between the internal domain encoded by exon 5. ETV6 is a strong transcriptional repressor, acting through its HLH and internal domains. Five potential mechanisms of ETV6-mediated leukemogenesis have been identified: constitutive activation of the kinase activity of the partner protein, modification of the original functions of a transcription factor, loss of function of the fusion gene, affecting ETV6 and the partner gene, activation of a proto-oncogene in the vicinity of a chromosomal translocation and dominant negative effect of the fusion protein over transcriptional repression mediated by wild-type ETV6. It is likely that ETV6 is frequently involved in leukemogenesis because of the large number of partners with which it can rearrange and the several pathogenic mechanisms by which it can lead to cell transformation.","['De Braekeleer, Etienne', 'Douet-Guilbert, Nathalie', 'Morel, Frederic', 'Le Bris, Marie-Josee', 'Basinko, Audrey', 'De Braekeleer, Marc']","['De Braekeleer E', 'Douet-Guilbert N', 'Morel F', 'Le Bris MJ', 'Basinko A', 'De Braekeleer M']","[""Laboratoire d'Histologie, Embryologie et Cytogenetique, Universite de Brest, Brest, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120512,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genes, Homeobox/genetics/physiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*genetics/physiology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics/physiology']",2012/05/15 06:00,2012/09/06 06:00,['2012/05/15 06:00'],"['2012/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/13 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(12)00185-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2012.04.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2012 Aug;36(8):945-61. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2012.04.010.

Furthermore, clinicians are often challenged to discriminate between CNS involvement by the disease, toxicity of drugs or infections. This clinically oriented review will help recognize and handle the main neurologic adverse effects induced by chemotherapy in pediatric patients with lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. Different clinical entities and putative drugs involved are discussed in each chapter, with clinical cases illustrating the most relevant and challenging events.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at each institution, and informed consent was waived. Patients who were diagnosed with adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia or collagen vascular disease were excluded from the study. Chest CT of 106 HTLV-1 carriers (54 females and 52 males; age range 44-94 years) were initially evaluated by two chest radiologists. Assessed CT findings included centrilobular nodules, thickening of bronchovascular bundles, ground-glass opacity, bronchiectasis, interlobular septal thickening, consolidation, honeycombing, crazy-paving appearance, enlarged lymph nodes, pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion. Three chest radiologists secondarily evaluated the CT scans with the abnormal findings to judge the presence of interstitial pneumonia patterns or a bronchiolitis/bronchitis pattern. RESULTS: Abnormal CT findings were found in 65 (61.3%) patients, including ground-glass opacity (n = 33), bronchiectasis (n = 28), centrilobular nodules (n = 25), and interlobular septal thickening (n = 19). Honeycombing (n = 5) and crazy-paving appearance (n = 3) were also observed. Based on the CT findings, 10 subjects were diagnosed with interstitial pneumonia (usual interstitial pneumonia pattern, n = 3; nonspecific interstitial pneumonia pattern, n = 5; organizing pneumonia pattern, n = 2; respectively). Twenty subjects were diagnosed with the bronchitis/bronchiolitis pattern. CONCLUSION: Although the bronchiolitis/bronchitis pattern is predominant on chest CT in HTLV-1 carriers, the HTLV-1 infection is associated with various interstitial pneumonias.","['Yamashiro, Tsuneo', 'Kamiya, Hisashi', 'Miyara, Tetsuhiro', 'Gibo, Shinji', 'Ogawa, Kazuhiko', 'Akamine, Tamaki', 'Moromizato, Hidekazu', 'Yara, Satomi', 'Murayama, Sadayuki']","['Yamashiro T', 'Kamiya H', 'Miyara T', 'Gibo S', 'Ogawa K', 'Akamine T', 'Moromizato H', 'Yara S', 'Murayama S']","['Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medical Science, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan. clatsune@yahoo.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120510,United States,Acad Radiol,Academic radiology,9440159,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Heterozygote', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnostic imaging/*genetics', 'Lung Diseases, Interstitial/*diagnostic imaging/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Radiography, Thoracic', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2012/05/15 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/05/15 06:00'],"['2011/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/11 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S1076-6332(12)00173-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.acra.2012.03.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Acad Radiol. 2012 Aug;19(8):952-7. doi: 10.1016/j.acra.2012.03.020.

However, the mechanisms of antiproliferative activity in leukemia cells are not fully understood. In this study, the apoptotic effects of DATS were investigated in human leukemia cells. RESULTS: Results of this study indicated that treatment with DATS resulted in significantly inhibited leukemia cell growth in a concentration- and time-dependent manner by induction of apoptosis. In U937 cells, DATS-induced apoptosis was correlated with down-regulation of Bcl-2, XIAP, and cIAP-1 protein levels, cleavage of Bid proteins, activation of caspases, and collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential. The data further demonstrated that DATS increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which was attenuated by pretreatment with antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), a scavenger of ROS. In addition, administration of NAC resulted in significant inhibition of DATS-induced apoptosis by inhibiting activation of caspases. CONCLUSIONS: The present study reveals that the cytotoxicity caused by DATS is mediated by generation of ROS and subsequent activation of the ROS-dependent caspase pathway in U937 leukemia cells.","['Choi, Yung Hyun', 'Park, Hyun Soo']","['Choi YH', 'Park HS']","['Department of Biochemistry, Dongeui University College of Oriental Medicine, San 45, Yangjung-dong Busanjin-gu, Busan 614-052, Republic of Korea. choiyh@deu.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120511,England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,"['0 (Allyl Compounds)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfides)', '0ZO1U5A3XX (diallyl trisulfide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Allyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Sulfides/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2012/05/15 06:00,2013/01/05 06:00,['2012/05/15 06:00'],"['2012/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1423-0127-19-50 [pii]', '10.1186/1423-0127-19-50 [doi]']",epublish,J Biomed Sci. 2012 May 11;19:50. doi: 10.1186/1423-0127-19-50.,,,PMC3404941,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to facilitate surveillance of this disease in dairy herds, we developed a method to combine ELISA of milk collected during routine production testing with a prescribed sampling of cows that is independent of the proportion of cows within each lactation. In 113 Michigan dairy herds, milk samples from ten cows in each of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and >/=4th lactations were analyzed for anti-Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) antibodies by milk ELISA. For each herd, a BLV herd profile (BHP) was calculated as the simple average of the percent of BLV-positive cows within each of the four lactation groups. The mean BHP for all herds was 32.8%, with means of 18.5, 28.8, 39.2, and 44.8% of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and >/=4th lactation animals infected, respectively. In eight herds, we determined the correlation between the BHP, and true herd prevalence by testing the entire lactating herd (r = 0.988, P < 0.0001).

However, extending binary classification approaches to multiclass problems is not trivial. Instance-based methods such as the K nearest neighbor (KNN) can naturally extend to multiclass problems and usually perform well with unbalanced data, but suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Their performance is degraded when applied to high dimensional data. On the other hand, model-based methods such as logistic regression require the decomposition of the multiclass problem into several binary problems with one-vs.-one or one-vs.-rest schemes. Even though they can be applied to high dimensional data with L(1) or L(p) penalized methods, such approaches can only select independent features and the features selected with different binary problems are usually different. They also produce unbalanced classification problems with one vs. the rest scheme even if the original multiclass problem is balanced.By combining instance-based and model-based learning, we propose an efficient learning method with integrated KNN and constrained logistic regression (KNNLog) for simultaneous multiclass classification and feature selection. Our proposed method simultaneously minimizes the intra-class distance and maximizes the interclass distance with fewer estimated parameters. It is very efficient for problems with small sample size and unbalanced classes, a case common in many real applications. In addition, our model-based feature selection methods can identify highly correlated features simultaneously avoiding the multiplicity problem due to multiple tests. The proposed method is evaluated with simulation and real data including one unbalanced microRNA dataset for leukemia and one multiclass metagenomic dataset from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP). It performs well with limited computational experiments.","['Liu, Zhenqiu', 'Bensmail, Halima', 'Tan, Ming']","['Liu Z', 'Bensmail H', 'Tan M']","['Greenebaum Cancer Center and Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Maryland at Baltimore, 655 W.

These patients have a drastically reduced life expectancy as compared to sensitive patients. Therefore identifying predictive factors for AZA resistance is of great interest to propose alternative therapeutic strategies for non-responsive patients. We generated AZA-resistant myeloid cell line (SKM1-R) that exhibited increased expression of BCL2L10 an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 member. Importantly, BCL2L10 knockdown sensitized SKM1-R cells to AZA effect suggesting that increased BCL2L10 expression is linked to AZA resistance in SKM1-R. We next established in 77 MDS patients that resistance to AZA is significantly correlated with the percentage of MDS or AML cells expressing BCL2L10. In addition, we showed that the proportion of BCL2L10 positive bone marrow cells can predict overall survival in MDS or AML patients. We propose a convenient assay in which the percentage of BCL2L10 expressing cells as assessed by flow cytometry is predictive of whether or not a patient will become resistant to AZA. Therefore, systematic determination of BCL2L10 expression could be of great interest in newly diagnosed and AZA-treated MDS patients.","['Cluzeau, Thomas', 'Robert, Guillaume', 'Mounier, Nicolas', 'Karsenti, Jean Michel', 'Dufies, Maeva', 'Puissant, Alexandre', 'Jacquel, Arnaud', 'Renneville, Aline', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Cassuto, Jill-Patrice', 'Raynaud, Sophie', 'Luciano, Frederic', 'Auberger, Patrick']","['Cluzeau T', 'Robert G', 'Mounier N', 'Karsenti JM', 'Dufies M', 'Puissant A', 'Jacquel A', 'Renneville A', 'Preudhomme C', 'Cassuto JP', 'Raynaud S', 'Luciano F', 'Auberger P']","['INSERM U1065, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire, Team Cell Death, Differentiation, Inflammation and Cancer, Nice, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (BCL2-like 10 protein)', '0 (Biomarkers, Pharmacological)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Pharmacological/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transgenes/genetics']",2012/05/12 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/05/12 06:00'],"['2012/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['481 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.481 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2012 Apr;3(4):490-501. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.481.,,,PMC3380582,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01210274'],,,,,,,,,,,

Those type of interactions consists of at least three cornerstones, among them mesenchymal- or bone marrow-derived stromal cells, cells of the innate or adaptive immune response, and the lymphoma cells themselves. The molecular pathways of crosstalk between the lymphoma cells and their nursing stroma are not well understood and their dissection is challenging because of (1) the complexity of stroma cell subpopulations, (2) kinetic and developmental transitions/switches of stroma composition, and (3) inherent technical difficulties to isolate and analyze defined stroma cell subsets. However, recent studies of bone marrow stroma interaction with leukemia or lymphoma cells have revealed therapeutic targets involved in regulating tumor cell mobilization. Release of tumor cells from their supportive niches could be effectuated by inhibition of homing and retention signals. The present review focuses on the effects of homing receptors and cytokines attributed to lymphoid tissue formation in tumor-stroma interactions within secondary lymphoid tissues. We discuss possible cellular and molecular mechanisms of lymphoma-stroma crosstalk and highlight novel therapeutic strategies based on the disruption of tumor-stroma interaction in secondary lymphoid organs.","['Hopken, Uta E', 'Rehm, Armin']","['Hopken UE', 'Rehm A']","['Department of Tumor Genetics and Immunogenetics, Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, MDC, Berlin 13125, Germany. uhoepken@mdc-berlin.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120511,Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Cell Communication', 'Chemokines/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', '*Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism/therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*metabolism/therapy', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/cytology', '*Tumor Microenvironment', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2012/05/12 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/05/12 06:00'],"['2012/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00109-012-0906-z [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 2012 Nov;90(11):1237-45. doi: 10.1007/s00109-012-0906-z.

Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that lithium induces apoptotic cell death in HL-60 promyelocytes at concentrations of 10 mM and above. A lithium-tolerant HL-60 sub-clone, resistant to up to 15 mM lithium, was also generated and its growth profile reported. Treatment of cells with lithium resulted in a dose-dependent induction of p53, retinoblastoma (Rb) and bax expression which was accompanied by concomitant inhibition of bcl-2 expression as demonstrated using immunohistochemical microscopy. These results seem to suggest that lithium induced cell death in these cells by inhibiting expression of anti-apoptotic protein, bcl-2, while inducing higher expression of its pro-apoptotic counterparts which include bax. Expression of bax and bcl-2 is also linked to expression of inflammation-regulating cytokines. Using ELISA assays, lithium was demonstrated to induce production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, while inhibiting release of anti-inflammation-related IL-2 and IL-10 in a dose-dependent fashion. Our findings identify a critical function for lithium in modulating pro- versus anti-apoptotic gene expression and pro- versus anti-inflammatory cytokines in vitro and provide a rationale for suggesting a promising role of lithium in regulation of inflammation and cancer growth.","['Matsebatlela, Thabe', 'Gallicchio, Vincent', 'Becker, Rolf']","['Matsebatlela T', 'Gallicchio V', 'Becker R']","['Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology and Biotechnology, University of Limpopo, P/bag x1106, Sovenga 0727, South Africa. thabe.matsebatlela@ul.ac.za']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120512,United States,Biol Trace Elem Res,Biological trace element research,7911509,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '9FN79X2M3F (Lithium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Lithium/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2012/05/12 06:00,2013/04/23 06:00,['2012/05/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12011-012-9438-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Trace Elem Res. 2012 Dec;149(3):323-30. doi: 10.1007/s12011-012-9438-1.

The most common polymorphism in TS is a unique double (2R) or triple (3R) 28-bp tandem repeat sequence in the enhancer region of the TS gene (TSER). This genetic variation in TSER has been widely investigated and has been implicated as a risk factor for the development of various cancers, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

We found the frequency of the TS 2R allele to be 32.6 and 26.0%, in cases and controls, respectively.

It is known to be the most common neoplasm appearing in the upper aerodigestive tract. The poor 5year survival rate has remained unchanged in the last decades even though improved techniques in surgery, radiation and chemotherapy have been established. In contrast to the overall decreasing incidence of head and neck cancer in the US, the incidence of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer is increasing, indicating the importance of viral etiology. Furthermore, growth and invasion of HNSCC are strongly influenced by the extracellular matrix (ECM). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) have been shown to play key roles in the remodeling of the ECM. Imatinib (STI 571) was originally designed to inhibit the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase in chronic myeloid leukaemia. But it also has an inhibitory impact, e.g., on the protein-tyrosine-kinase (PTK) receptor c-kit and on its PTK activity in HNSCC. In this study, we incubated the HNSCC cell lines HNSCC 11A and 14C and the p16-positive SCC line CERV196 with increasing concentrations of imatinib or carboplatin. After an incubation time of up to 10 days, we evaluated MMP-2 and -14 expression by ELISA techniques and immunohistochemistry. MMP-2 and -14 expression was demonstrated in all incubated tumor cell lines. Especially incubation with imatinib resulted in a significant decrease in MMP expression in incubated cell lines. Our results indicate that the expression of MMP-2 and -14 is suppressed in the presence of imatinib. Thus, imatinib may exert in part its inhibitory effect on malignant cell growth via the blockage of the signal transduction of PTK receptors. Further studies are warranted, especially keeping in mind the moderate toxicity of imatinib.","['Faber, Anne', 'Sauter, Alexander', 'Hoedt, Sarah', 'Hoermann, Karl', 'Erben, Philipp', 'Hofheinz, Ralf-Dieter', 'Sommer, Ulrich', 'Stern-Straeter, Jens', 'Schultz, David Johannes']","['Faber A', 'Sauter A', 'Hoedt S', 'Hoermann K', 'Erben P', 'Hofheinz RD', 'Sommer U', 'Stern-Straeter J', 'Schultz DJ']","['Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, University Medical Centre Mannheim, D-68167 Mannheim, Germany. faberanne@gmx.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120420,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (MMP2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.80 (MMP14 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.80 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 14)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Carboplatin/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*metabolism/virology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*metabolism/virology', 'Human papillomavirus 16', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 14/genetics/*metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Papillomavirus Infections/complications/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2012/05/12 06:00,2012/09/05 06:00,['2012/05/12 06:00'],"['2011/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2012.1766 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2012 Jul;28(1):172-8. doi: 10.3892/or.2012.1766.

However, mechanisms underlying the acquisition of radiation resistance are yet to be elucidated. We established a radiation-resistant strain (Res-HL60 cells) from HL60 leukemic cells and investigated their response to radiation. Res-HL60 cells not only proliferated on the fifth day after radiation but also had a high survival rate in a clonogenic assay. Although Chk1 was activated in HL60 cells after irradiation, the expression levels of Chk1 in Res-HL60 cells decreased. There were few differences between the two cell lines with regard to Chk2 activity. Res-HL60 cells show prolonged G2/M arrest and an early decrease in the extent of DNA damage. However, inhibitors against ATM/ATR and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) both abrogated the radiation resistance capacity of the cells. These results reveal that radiation-resistant strains have a high repair capacity, and inhibition of the repair system at an early stage is an effective strategy in the second round of radiation therapy.","['Hazawa, Masaharu', 'Hosokawa, Yoichiro', 'Monzen, Satoru', 'Yoshino, Hironori', 'Kashiwakura, Ikuo']","['Hazawa M', 'Hosokawa Y', 'Monzen S', 'Yoshino H', 'Kashiwakura I']","['Department of Radiological Life Sciences, Division of Medical Life Sciences, Hirosaki University, 66-1 Honcho, Hirosaki, Aomori 036-8564, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120420,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (2-(morpholin-4-yl)benzo(h)chromen-4-one)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Caffeine/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Shape/radiation effects', 'Cell Size', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Chromones/pharmacology', '*DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/radiation effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*radiation effects', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Radiation Tolerance', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2012/05/12 06:00,2012/09/05 06:00,['2012/05/12 06:00'],"['2012/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2012.1771 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2012 Jul;28(1):55-61. doi: 10.3892/or.2012.1771.

It encodes an enzyme that mediates regulatory signaling of energy metabolism, calcium homeostasis and intracellular movements. PLCD1 has been studied in some human solid tumors relating to the CpG island methylation of the gene promoter as a functional tumor suppressor. However, no such information is available in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In this study, we investigated PLCD1 expression in the CML K562 cell line (0/1) and 15% (2/13) of bone marrow mononuclear cells with CML by using semi-quantitative PCR. The CpG island (CGI) methylation status of the PLCD1 promoter was detected in K562 (0/1) and 56% (23/41) of CML patients by methylation-specific PCR (MSP), but not in the normal adult bone marrow mononuclear cells. Furthermore, the DNA demethylation agent 5'-aza-2'deoxycytidine restored the expression of PLCD1 in K562 cells. Functional studies showed that ectopic expression of PLCD1 in K562 cells was able to dramatically inhibit their colony formation and induce cell cycle G1 arrest, suggesting that PLCD1 acts as a functional tumor suppressor and may serve as a biomarker for possible early detection and prognosis of CML.","['Song, Jun-Jun', 'Liu, Qiong', 'Li, Ying', 'Yang, Ze-Song', 'Yang, Li', 'Xiang, Ting-Xiu', 'Ren, Guo-Sheng', 'Chen, Jian-Bin']","['Song JJ', 'Liu Q', 'Li Y', 'Yang ZS', 'Yang L', 'Xiang TX', 'Ren GS', 'Chen JB']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, P.R.

METHODS: The authors retrieved data from the Taiwan Cancer Registry and linked them with the National Mortality Registry to estimate the survival functions for major occupational cancers: lung, pleural mesothelioma, urinary bladder and leukaemia. Assuming a constant excess hazard for each type of cancer, the authors extrapolated lifetime survival functions by the Monte Carlo method. For each patient with cancer, the authors simulated an age- and gender-matched person without cancer based on vital statistics of Taiwan to estimate life expectancy and expected years of life lost (EYLL). By using the reimbursement data from the National Health Insurance Research Database, the authors calculated the average monthly healthcare expenditures, which were summed to estimate the lifetime healthcare expenditures after adjusting for the corresponding monthly survival probability. RESULTS: A total of 51,408, 136, 12,891 and 5285 new cases of lung, pleural mesothelioma, bladder and leukaemia cancers, respectively, were identified during 1997-2005 and followed until the end of 2007. The EYLL was predicted to be 13.7+/-0.1, 18.9+/-0.7, 4.7+/-0.3 and 19.4+/-0.5 years for these cancers, respectively, and the lifetime healthcare expenditures with a 3% annual discount were predicted to be US$22,359, US$14,900, US$51,987 and US$59,741, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of these occupational cancers, in terms of EYLL and lifetime healthcare expenditures, was substantial. Such estimates may provide useful empirical evidence for comparative risk assessment that can be applied in health policy-making and clinical decision-making.","['Lee, Lukas Jyuhn-Hsiarn', 'Chang, Yu-Yin', 'Liou, Saou-Hsing', 'Wang, Jung-Der']","['Lee LJ', 'Chang YY', 'Liou SH', 'Wang JD']","['Division of Environmental Health and Occupational Medicine, National Health Research Institutes, Miaoli County, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120510,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', '*Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Humans', '*Life Expectancy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'National Health Programs', '*Neoplasms/economics/prevention & control', '*Occupational Diseases/economics/prevention & control', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment', 'Taiwan']",2012/05/12 06:00,2012/09/28 06:00,['2012/05/12 06:00'],"['2012/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['oemed-2011-100462 [pii]', '10.1136/oemed-2011-100462 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2012 Aug;69(8):582-6. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2011-100462.

Our purpose was to examine associations between certain medical conditions and adult myeloid leukemia. METHODS: Using logistic regression, we evaluated associations between 16 self-reported medical conditions and myeloid leukemia in a case-control study of 670 cases [including 420 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 186 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)] and 701 population-based controls. RESULTS: We observed significant positive associations between AML and ulcerative colitis (odds ratio (OR) = 3.8; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.1-13) and between CML and peptic ulcer (OR = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.8). A personal cancer history increased both AML (OR = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.7-3.9) and CML (OR = 3.5; 95% CI, 2.0-5.8) risk even after excluding individuals who reported prior radiation and/or chemotherapy treatment.

METHODS: We developed an innovative simulation model to estimate the occupational disease burden and facilitate future assessments as more field-based quantitative data become available. RESULTS: We determined that, in 2008, an estimated 46 deaths (95% CI: 27-71) and 17,000 health-care facility visits (95% CI: 16,000-18,000), along with 4,500 cases of noise-induced hearing loss, were attributable to the occupational risk factors covered in this study. Lung cancer and leukemia were associated with the highest number of deaths (38), whereas asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease contributed most to the health-care facility visits (nearly 16,900). The highest estimated occupational disease burden is in construction.

She had increased inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and mild anemia for more than 6 months. In the beginning, she was suspected of having either juvenile idiopathic arthritis or chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis. However, after about 6 months, there were abrupt increases of LDH in serum titers and blast cells were also revealed by bone marrow examination. Upon these findings, she was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Since bone pain and arthralgia bone pain and arthralgia are both indicative of numerous inflammatory disorders such as infectious myelitis, juvenile chronic arthritis, childhood leukemia and malignancies, and auto-inflammatory bone diseases, especially chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, it is difficult to accurately diagnose right away. For now, these aforementioned inflammatory responses are the sole key findings for clinical investigations. Other than that, there are not enough reports yet to help diagnose incases similar to this. Therefore, it is difficult to differentiate between the disorders above even after blood tests, Ga-scincigraphy, and imaging examinations. Moreover, in the case of childhood leukemia, it was difficult to differentiate these diseases by routine X-ray surveys in the general pediatric fields. The reasons are because there are only a few descriptions on X-ray bone examinations on findings of X-ray bone investigations, and both are usually non-specific. However, according to the pediatric radiology specialists, of which there are only a few in Japan, the imaging results show somewhat abnormal findings could be spotted from the early stage. Through this present case, it is suggested to us that it is important to consult the pediatric radiology specialists in order to speed up the diagnostic process.

Although several previous studies have suggested that intensive chemotherapy is associated with a better prognosis, there may have been a selection bias. Therefore, we retrospectively evaluated the impact of intensive chemotherapy for AML in the elderly by stratifying patients according to a propensity score. Eighty-one AML patients aged 70 years or more were included in this study. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia were not included. A propensity score for the use of intensive chemotherapy was calculated from four factors at diagnosis. Forty-five patients received intensive chemotherapy, whereas 36 received low-dose or no chemotherapy. We stratified the patients into quartiles based on the propensity score. The numbers of patients in the first, second, third, and forth quartiles who received intensive chemotherapy were 5 of 21, 10 of 20, 12 of 20, and 18 of 20, respectively. A stratified log-rank test showed significantly better overall survival in the intensive chemotherapy group (P = 0.0088).

The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction of monoperoxidovanadium(V) complex Pr(4)N[VO(O(2))(ox)(phen)], (Vphen), [phen=1,10-phenantroline, ox=oxalate(2-) and Pr(4)N=tetra(n-propyl)ammonium(1+)] with DNA. UV-Vis spectrophotometry and the alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE, the comet assay) were used to examine the possibility of the vanadium(V) complex to induce changes in DNA. The interaction of Vphen with calf thymus DNA resulted in absorption hyperchromicity in DNA spectrum and shift of the absorption band of DNA to longer wavelengths for the [complex]/[DNA] concentration ratio equals to 4 and after 60 min of incubation. The rise in DNA absorption (by 34%) and bathochromic shift (Deltalambda(max)=6 nm) are indicative of the interaction between DNA and the complex molecules. DNA strand breaks in cellular DNA were investigated using the comet assay. The human lymphocytes were exposed to various concentrations of Vphen for 30 min. The results revealed that Vphen contributed to the DNA damage expressed as DNA strand breaks in concentration dependent manner. The used concentrations of Vphen (ranging from 0.1 to 100 mumol/L) caused higher DNA damage in lymphocytes compared to untreated cells (from 1.2 times for 0.1 mumol/L to 1.8 times for 100 mumol/L). Vphen was screened for its potential antitumor activity towards murine leukemia cell line L1210. Vphen exhibited significant antiproliferative activity depending on its concentration and time of exposure. The IC(50) values were 0.247 mug/mL (0.45 mumol/L) for 24h, 0.671 mug/mL (1.21 mumol/L) for 48 h and 0.627 mug/mL (1.13 mumol/L) for 72 h.","['Andrezalova, Lucia', 'Gbelcova, Helena', 'Durackova, Zdenka']","['Andrezalova L', 'Gbelcova H', 'Durackova Z']","['Institute of Medical Chemistry, Biochemistry and Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Comenius University, Sasinkova 2, 811 08 Bratislava, Slovakia. lucia.andrezalova@fmed.uniba.sk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120508,Germany,J Trace Elem Med Biol,Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS),9508274,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '00J9J9XKDE (Vanadium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Organometallic Compounds/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Reference Values', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vanadium/*chemistry/pharmacology']",2012/05/12 06:00,2014/08/21 06:00,['2012/05/12 06:00'],"['2011/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/14 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0946-672X(12)00061-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jtemb.2012.04.007 [doi]']",ppublish,J Trace Elem Med Biol. 2013 Jan;27(1):21-6. doi: 10.1016/j.jtemb.2012.04.007.

In this study, we investigated the antitumoral effect of metformin on both acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells. Metformin induced apoptosis with partial differentiation in an APL cell line, NB4, but only displayed a proapoptotic effect on several non-M3 AML cell lines. Further analysis revealed that a strong synergistic effect existed between metformin and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) during APL cell maturation and that metformin induced the hyperphosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in APL cells. U0126, a specific MEK/ERK activation inhibitor, abrogated metformin-induced differentiation. Finally, we found that metformin induced the degradation of the oncoproteins PML-RARalpha and c-Myc and activated caspase-3. In conclusion, these results suggest that metformin treatment may contribute to the enhancement of ATRA-induced differentiation in APL, which may deepen the understanding of APL maturation and thus provide insight for new therapy strategies.","['Huai, Lei', 'Wang, Cuicui', 'Zhang, Cuiping', 'Li, Qihui', 'Chen, Yirui', 'Jia, Yujiao', 'Li, Yan', 'Xing, Haiyan', 'Tian, Zheng', 'Rao, Qing', 'Wang, Min', 'Wang, Jianxiang']","['Huai L', 'Wang C', 'Zhang C', 'Li Q', 'Chen Y', 'Jia Y', 'Li Y', 'Xing H', 'Tian Z', 'Rao Q', 'Wang M', 'Wang J']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120507,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9100L32L2N (Metformin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Metformin/*pharmacology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2012/05/12 06:00,2012/09/01 06:00,['2012/05/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(12)00852-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.05.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2012 Jun 8;422(3):398-404. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.05.001.

B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia occurs predominantly in children, but can occur at any age. Risk-adapted intensive chemotherapy is effective in treating most children with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but this approach is less successful in adults. Recent developments in genome-wide genetic analysis in B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia have provided insights into disease pathogenesis and prognosis. B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases usually carry a primary genetic event, often a chromosome translocation, and a constellation of secondary genetic alterations that are acquired and selected dynamically in a nonlinear fashion. These genetic changes commonly affect cellular mechanisms that control B-cell differentiation and proliferation. The cooperative interaction between inactivation of hematopoietic transcription factors involved in differentiation (class II mutation) and activating mutations involved in cell proliferation (class I mutation) is reminiscent of the pathogenic model of acute myeloid leukemia. The resulting improved molecular understanding of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia is helping to refine disease risk stratification and discover new therapeutic approaches for patients with refractory disease. In this review, we first summarize the clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic features of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia and introduce current understanding of B-cell development and B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia leukemogenesis. We then focus on recent advances in genetic analysis and gene expression profiling of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia and discuss the implications of these findings for disease evolution, risk prediction, and possible novel therapeutic approaches.","['Zhou, Yi', 'You, M James', 'Young, Ken H', 'Lin, Pei', 'Lu, Gary', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E']","['Zhou Y', 'You MJ', 'Young KH', 'Lin P', 'Lu G', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Bueso-Ramos CE']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. yzhou7@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120508,United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology']",2012/05/12 06:00,2012/10/26 06:00,['2012/05/12 06:00'],"['2011/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/26 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0046-8177(12)00047-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.humpath.2012.02.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2012 Sep;43(9):1347-62. doi: 10.1016/j.humpath.2012.02.004.

METHODS: Kasumi-1 cells treated by PRF for 48 hours were observed with Wright's and Hoechst 33258 dying. The apoptotic cells were analyzed by flow cytometry with AnnexinV/PI staining. The expression levels of bcl-2, Bim and Caspase-3/-8/-9 protein were assayed by Western blot and the AML1-ETO fusion gene was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: PRF could induce Kasumi-1 cells to apoptosis effectively. The proportion of apoptotic cells in 50, 200 and 500 microg/ml PRF treatment groups were (14.1 +/- 0.8)%, (17.7 +/- 1.3)% and (32.4 +/- 1.4)%, respectively, and significantly higher than that of control \[(7.8 +/- 0.7)%\]. The relative expression levels of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein were 0.85 +/- 0.05, 0.62 +/- 0.07 and 0.43 +/- 0.05; the apoptotic Bim protein were 0.21 +/- 0.06, 0.39 +/- 0.04 and 0.75 +/- 0.05; the caspase-3 and caspase-9 were 0.92 +/- 0.04, 1.21 +/- 0.07, 1.33 +/- 0.04 and 0.35 +/- 0.05, 0.53 +/- 0.03, 0.69 +/- 0.07, respectively. Compared to the blank control group, all these changes were significant (P < 0.01). Nevertheless, nearly no changes could be observed on the expression level of AML1-ETO fusion gene and caspase-8 protein. CONCLUSION: Apoptosis of Kasumi-1 cells induced by PRF might correlate to the down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein expression and the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8 protein in the cells.

METHODS: The lentiviral vector mediated wild type SHIP (wtSHIP) and mutant SHIP (muSHIP) plasmids were transfected into K562 cells through gene transfection techniques. Expression of SHIP at mRNA and protein level was detected by real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. Transwell assay was used to analyze the difference between the migration and invasion ability of the K562/wtSHIP and the K562/muSHIP cells after transfection. Primary migration associated factor FAK, MMP and NF-kappaB were assayed by Western blot. RESULTS: After transfection, the SHIP expression in transfected K562 cells were significantly increased. Compared with the migration ability of K562/wtSHIP\[(15.8 +/- 1.4)%\], that of K562/muSHIP cells \[(54.3 +/- 2.4)% \] increased greatly and almost at the same level of that of K562/pFIV\[(50.3 +/- 3.8)%\] (P < 0.01).

METHODS: The Ig/TCR gene rearrangements in bone marrow or peripheral blood of 139 NHL patients were analyzed by using BIOMED-2 multiple primers system and Multiplex PCR assay. RESULTS: Ig clonality was detected in 85.4% (70/82) of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), including 46.3% (38/82) IgH rearrangement, 62.2% (51/82) IgK rearrangement and 1.2% (1/82) IgL rearrangement, and in 39.4% (13/33) of other categories of B-lineage NHL (B-NHL), including 33.3% (11/33) IgH and 39.4% (13/33) IgK rearrangements.

CONCLUSIONS: The detection rate of gene rearrangements diverses in different clinical stages and degrees of malignancy of NHL, but the correlation has not been proved in this research. The sensitivity of multiplex PCR-based clonality testing is enhanced with the combination of BIOMED-2 primers system.

METHODS: Data associated with pregnancy, delivery and neonate from the patients or patient's spouse who conceived while receiving TKIs were collected retrospectively. RESULTS: Two young female patients (who had been on imatinib therapy for 90 and 91 months, respectively) and spouses of 10 male patients (involving 7 patients who had received imatinib for a median of 60 months and 3 who had received dasatinib for 2.5 months to 7 months, respectively) with median age of 33.5 years (range 26 - 46 years) conceived and gave birth to 12 babies. One woman took imatinib throughout her pregnancy except one month. The other one took imatinib throughout her pregnancy and had breast-fed while on imatinib therapy for nearly half a year postpartum. Among the 12 babies, one was born prematurely with low birth weight and hypospadias (surgical repair after birth), the others were all healthy with no congenital defects. The median age of the children at the date of this report is 17.5 months (range 3 to 101 months), and they all have a normal pattern of growth and development. CONCLUSIONS: Conception among patients with CML while receiving TKIs may result in normal pregnancies. The possible effects of TKIs on birth abnormalities cannot be ruled out. It is recommended that childbearing female patients should be advised to practice adequate methods of contraception and should not breast-feed while on TKIs therapy. In cases of accidental pregnancy, risk/benefit evaluations must be carried out carefully on an individual basis. No special precautions apply for male patients being treated with imatinib.","['Jiang, Qian', 'Jiang, Bin', 'Chen, Shan-shan', 'Jiang, Hao', 'Qin, Ya-zhen', 'Lai, Yue-yun', 'Shi, Hong-xia', 'Huang, Xiao-jun']","['Jiang Q', 'Jiang B', 'Chen SS', 'Jiang H', 'Qin YZ', 'Lai YY', 'Shi HX', 'Huang XJ']","['Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thiazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/05/12 06:00,2013/03/19 06:00,['2012/05/12 06:00'],"['2012/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2012 Jan;33(1):6-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Bone marrow samples from 44 newly diagnosed t(8;21) AML patients co-expressed AE9a and AE were screened by RT-PCR. The alteration of the AE9a expression ratio was monitored during follow-up by using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR). RESULTS: The expression level of AE9a was markedly lower than that of AE in these patients. There was a positive correlation between the expression level of AE9a and AE in most of bone marrow samples. The transcript level of both AE9a and AE was decreased in the 44 patients after one course of standard chemotherapy, but the percentage of AE9a expression level was increased in comparison with that before treatment (P < 0.05). After one course of standard chemotherapy treatment, the percentage of AE9a in incomplete remission (ICR) patients was significantly higher than that in CR patients (P < 0.05). Relapsed patients had a higher AE9a ratio than the unrelapsed patients (P < 0.05). During the remission, the percentage of AE9a in 11/17 relapsed patients obviously elevated even while the expression of AE fusion gene at low level. CONCLUSIONS: AE9a and AE co-expressed in most of AML patients with t(8;21) translocation. The expression level of AE9a was lower than that of AE, and there is a positive correlation between the expression level of these two isoforms. The sensitivity of AE9a gene to the standard chemotherapy is less than that of the AE fusion gene.

It showed cytotoxicity at IC(50) = 3.4 muM and induced apoptosis against the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 through a new stable rearrangement product (1) when in the presence of FeSO(4). This conversion mechanism is different from another sesquiterpene endoperoxide lactone compound, dihydroartemisinin (DHA), which is an anti-malarial drug. The cytotoxicity of EDBD decreased in the presence of the ferrous ion chelating drug deferoxamine mesylate (DFOM), and this suggested that the structural change of the drug caused by Fe(2+) may be responsible for its biological activities. EDBD induced apoptosis via phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in HL60 cells, and was detected by Western blot. EDBD resulted in an immediate increase in DCF fluorescence intensity in HL60 cells using DCFH-DA (2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate) assay. The in vitro reaction of EDBD with FeSO(4) also increased DCF fluorescence intensity in a dose dependent manner. These results showed that the biological activity of EDBD involves an unstable carbon-centered radical intermediate. Furthermore, there was no similarity between the JFCR39 fingerprints of EDBD and DHA (correlation coefficient on COMPARE Analysis gamma = 0.158).

METHODS: Data from 36 cancer registry sites in China and from the Third National Death Survey in China (2004 - 2005) were used to estimate the incidence and mortality of cancer in China in 2008 by using mathematical models. Prediction on cancer incidence and mortality in the next 20 years was carried out. RESULTS: According to the age-standardized incidence rates, the top cancer sites were lung, stomach, liver, breast, oesophageal, colorectal, corpus uterine, cervical, leukemia and brain tumor. According to the age-standardized mortality rates, the top cancers in China were lung cancer, liver cancer, stomach cancer, oesophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, leukemia, brain tumor and corpus uterine cancer. Cancer happened more frequently among people older than 40 years, particularly among males. Data related to prediction showed that the incidence and mortality of cancer in China would gradually increase in the next 20 years. CONCLUSION: Both incidence and mortality of cancers in China had been increasing, with the most common cancers appeared to be lung, breast and digestive tract cancers, in China.

Loss of SOCS3 in vivo has profound effects on placental development, inflammation, fat-induced weight gain, and insulin sensitivity. SOCS3 expression is induced by Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling and it then binds to specific cytokine receptors (including gp130, G-CSF, and leptin receptors). SOCS3 then inhibits JAK/STAT signaling in two distinct ways. First, SOCS3 is able to directly inhibit the catalytic activity of JAK1, JAK2, or TYK2 while remaining bound to the cytokine receptor. Second, SOCS3 recruits elongins B/C and Cullin5 to generate an E3 ligase that ubiquitinates both JAK and cytokine receptor targeting them for proteasomal degradation. Detailed in vivo studies have revealed that SOCS3 action not only limits the duration of cytokine signaling to prevent overactivity but it is also important in maintaining the specificity of cytokine signaling.","['Babon, Jeffrey J', 'Nicola, Nicos A']","['Babon JJ', 'Nicola NA']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia. babon@wehi.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120511,England,Growth Factors,"Growth factors (Chur, Switzerland)",9000468,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Brain/metabolism', 'Catalysis', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*metabolism', 'src Homology Domains']",2012/05/12 06:00,2013/01/26 06:00,['2012/05/12 06:00'],"['2012/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08977194.2012.687375 [doi]'],ppublish,Growth Factors. 2012 Aug;30(4):207-19. doi: 10.3109/08977194.2012.687375.

Restoring aberrantly downregulated tumor suppressor miRs or antagonizing overexpressed oncogenic miRs in malignant cells by synthetic RNA oligonucleotides represents a potentially novel therapeutic approach in cancer and leukemia. However, given the complex networking and concurrent deregulation of miRs in malignant cells, an effective approach may require concurrent targeting of multiple miRs. Cassette dosing involves simultaneous administration of a mixture of oligonucleotides from the same or different structural classes. However, information on cassette dosing pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution and bioactivity of synthetic miRs is lacking. In this study, three synthetic 2'-methoxyphosphorothioate-miRs (2'-MeOPSmiR16-1, 2'-MeOPSmiR29b and 2'-MeOPSantagomiR155) were administered iv to C57BL/6 mice as a mixture, each at 7.5 mg/kg. Analysis of concentrations of individual miR in plasma and major organ tissues (bone marrow, spleen, liver, brain, heart, kidney and lung) was performed. The mRNA and protein levels of miR's biotargets were monitored sequentially after dosing up to 24 h. Our results demonstrated that these synthetic miRs retain their different individual pharmacokinetic properties and all display three-compartmental pharmacokinetics. 2'-MeOPSmiR16-1 has the longest plasma gamma half-life of 2508 min and lowest total body clearance of 0.0054 L/min.kg, whereas 2'-MeOPSmiR29b has the shortest gamma half-life of 510.6 min and highest total body clearance of 0.042 L/min.kg. The tissue concentrations of all three 2'-MeOPS-modified miR(s)/antagomiR were measurable from 5 min to at least 24 h after dosing, indicating that these concurrently delivered oligonucleotides can reach organ tissues. Importantly, there were biological activities of the concurrently administered miRs which persisted, as shown by the downregulation of specific targets in tested tissues, albeit with variations. Brain was one of the most sensitive tissues with respect to downregulation of mRNA and protein levels of four measured biotargets (e.g., Bcl-2, Mcl-1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b) despite its relatively low miR/antagomiRs levels. We conclude that cassette dosing is applicable to 2'-MeOPS-modified synthetic miRs that are tissue-deliverable and biofunctional without any additional formulation requirement. This study supports future exploration of miR-involved combination therapies.","['Wang, Hongyan', 'Chiu, Ming', 'Xie, Zhiliang', 'Chiu, Michael', 'Liu, Zhongfa', 'Chen, Ping', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Byrd, John C', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Chan, Kenneth K']","['Wang H', 'Chiu M', 'Xie Z', 'Chiu M', 'Liu Z', 'Chen P', 'Liu S', 'Byrd JC', 'Muthusamy N', 'Garzon R', 'Croce CM', 'Marcucci G', 'Chan KK']","['Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210,United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120523,United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Dnmt3a protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA methyltransferase 3B)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Brain/metabolism', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Lung/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2012/05/12 06:00,2012/12/29 06:00,['2012/05/12 06:00'],"['2012/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/mp2006483 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2012 Jun 4;9(6):1638-44. doi: 10.1021/mp2006483.

In contrast to the poor survival found in patients with transformed FL in previous studies, the 5-yr OS was almost identical in patients with transformed and non-transformed FL, 83% and 78%, respectively. In conclusion, our study supports that NMC-HCT is a safe and efficacious treatment that can provide long-term survival in elderly, heavily pretreated patients with FL and CLL. Especially patients with FL, and also transformed FL, seemed to have a great benefit of NMC-HCT, and CR at the time of HCT was an important prognostic factor.","['Mortensen, Bo K', 'Petersen, Soren L', 'Kornblit, Brian', 'Andersen, Per K', 'Braendstrup, Peter', 'Andersen, Niels S', 'Sengelov, Henrik', 'Vindelov, Lars']","['Mortensen BK', 'Petersen SL', 'Kornblit B', 'Andersen PK', 'Braendstrup P', 'Andersen NS', 'Sengelov H', 'Vindelov L']","['Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Laboratory, Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. bokokmortensen@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120625,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2012/05/12 06:00,2012/09/20 06:00,['2012/05/12 06:00'],"['2012/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2012.01801.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2012 Aug;89(2):151-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2012.01801.x.

CASE REPORT: A 54-year-old female presented for HPC transplantation for acute leukemia. No HLA-matched donor was identified, so she received a peripheral blood stem cell graft from an HLA-mismatched unrelated donor. On pretransplant testing, both the donor and the recipient typed as blood group A. On Day +67 after transplant, the recipient had a transfusion reaction consisting of an increase in temperature, rigors, and shaking chills during infusion of a unit of group A red blood cells (RBCs). A transfusion reaction workup revealed an ABO discrepancy with both anti-A (1+) and anti-B (3+) identified in the patient's serum as well as a positive direct antiglobulin test with monoclonal anti-IgG antisera. Anti-A(1) were identified serologically and in an eluate. Hemolysis was clinically significant, requiring blood transfusion. No ABO typing discrepancies were found on pretransplant testing in either the recipient or the donor. DNA sequencing for blood group A subgroups performed after the transfusion reaction on blood collected before the transplant showed the donor to be type A(1) and the recipient as A(2) . Unfortunately, the patient experienced graft failure requiring reconditioning and reinfusion of additional cells from the original HPC donor. On Day +94 after the second transplant, the patient died with severe acute gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease. CONCLUSION: This report describes a blood group A(2) patient who developed an anti-A(1) causing clinically significant hemolysis after HPC transplant from an A(1) donor.","['Jaben, Elizabeth A', 'Jacob, Eapen K', 'Tauscher, Craig', ""D'Souza, Anita"", 'Hogan, William J', 'Stubbs, James R']","['Jaben EA', 'Jacob EK', 'Tauscher C', ""D'Souza A"", 'Hogan WJ', 'Stubbs JR']","['Division of Clinical Pathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona , USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20120511,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)'],IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/*blood', '*Blood Group Incompatibility', 'Blood Grouping and Crossmatching', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hemolysis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged']",2012/05/12 06:00,2013/03/15 06:00,['2012/05/12 06:00'],"['2012/05/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1537-2995.2012.03696.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2013 Jan;53(1):202-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2012.03696.x.

The expression level of the bcl-2 gene was detected using semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), thus analyzing the correlation between the bcl-2 expression level and the apoptosis of HL-60. RESULTS: Shikonin could inhibit the proliferation of HL-60 cells with the concentration range of 1-8 microg/mL in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Two microg/mL shikonin could induce the apoptosis of HL-60 cells in a time-dependent manner. The expression level of bcl-2 was obviously down-regulated at 2 microg/mL shikonin.

In this study, we evaluated changes in 3 parameters, namely, random blood glucose, body mass index (BMI), and Z score for BMI (Z-BMI), in children with ALL during chemotherapy and after completion of treatment. METHODS: Patients newly diagnosed with ALL from January, 2005 to December, 2008 at Saint Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, who completed treatment with chemotherapy only were included (n=107). Random glucose, BMI, and Z-BMI were recorded at 5 intervals: at diagnosis, before maintenance treatment, at completion of maintenance treatment, and 6 and 12 months after completion of maintenance treatment. Similar analyses were conducted on 2 subcohorts based on ALL risk groups. RESULTS: For random glucose, a paired comparison showed significantly lower levels at 12 months post-treatment compared to those at initial diagnosis (P<0.001) and before maintenance (P<0.001). The Z-BMI score was significantly higher before maintenance than at diagnosis (P<0.001), but decreased significantly at the end of treatment (P<0.001) and remained low at 6 months (P<0.001) and 12 months (P<0.001) post-treatment. Similar results were obtained upon analysis of risk group-based subcohorts. CONCLUSION: For a cohort of ALL patients treated without allogeneic transplantation or cranial irradiation, decrease in random glucose and Z-BMI after completion of chemotherapy does not indicate future glucose intolerance or obesity.","['Bang, Kyong-Won', 'Seo, Soo Young', 'Lee, Jae Wook', 'Jang, Pil-Sang', 'Jung, Min Ho', 'Chung, Nack-Gyun', 'Cho, Bin', 'Jeong, Dae-Chul', 'Suh, Byung Kyu', 'Kim, Hack-Ki']","['Bang KW', 'Seo SY', 'Lee JW', 'Jang PS', 'Jung MH', 'Chung NG', 'Cho B', 'Jeong DC', 'Suh BK', 'Kim HK']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Catholic University of Korea, School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120430,Korea (South),Korean J Pediatr,Korean journal of pediatrics,101215374,,,,2012/05/11 06:00,2012/05/11 06:01,['2012/05/11 06:00'],"['2011/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3345/kjp.2012.55.4.121 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Pediatr. 2012 Apr;55(4):121-7. doi: 10.3345/kjp.2012.55.4.121.

In this study, the kinetics of nitrate reduction (NR) by Mycobacterium tuberculosis during growth in Thp1 macrophages was found to be almost parallel to viable bacilli count. NR in the culture medium containing 50 mM of nitrate was found to be optimum on the fifth day after infection with M. tuberculosis. The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio and Z-factor obtained from this macrophage-based assay were 5.4 and 0.965, respectively, which confirms the robustness of the assay protocol. The protocol was further validated by using standard antitubercular inhibitors such as rifampicin, isoniazid, streptomycin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, added at their IC(90) value, on the day of infection. These inhibitors were not able to kill the bacilli when added to the culture on the fifth day after infection. Interestingly, pentachlorophenol and rifampicin killed the bacilli immediately after addition on the fifth day of infection. Altogether, this assay protocol using M. tuberculosis-infected Thp-1 macrophages provides a novel, cost-efficient, robust, and easy-to-perform screening platform for the identification of both active and hypoxic stage-specific inhibitors against tuberculosis.","['Sarkar, Sampa', 'Sarkar, Dhiman']","['Sarkar S', 'Sarkar D']","['Combichem Bioresource Center, CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, India. d.sarkar@ncl.res.in']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120509,United States,J Biomol Screen,Journal of biomolecular screening,9612112,"['0 (Antitubercular Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '2KNI5N06TI (Pyrazinamide)', '8G167061QZ (Ethambutol)', 'D9BSU0SE4T (Pentachlorophenol)', 'EC 1.7.99.4 (Nitrate Reductase)', 'V83O1VOZ8L (Isoniazid)', 'VJT6J7R4TR (Rifampin)', 'Y45QSO73OB (Streptomycin)']",IM,"['Antitubercular Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Discovery', 'Ethambutol/pharmacology', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays/*methods', 'Humans', 'Isoniazid/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Macrophages/microbiology', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests/*methods', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*drug effects', 'Nitrate Reductase/*metabolism', 'Pentachlorophenol/pharmacology', 'Pyrazinamide/pharmacology', 'Rifampin/pharmacology', 'Streptomycin/pharmacology']",2012/05/11 06:00,2013/01/18 06:00,['2012/05/11 06:00'],"['2012/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1087057112445485 [pii]', '10.1177/1087057112445485 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biomol Screen. 2012 Aug;17(7):966-73. doi: 10.1177/1087057112445485.

We hypothesized that these expression levels are influenced by both neural and muscular damage within lacerated muscles. Microarrays were confirmed with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays and histology of biopsies at the lesion of three simulated lacerated muscle models in 130 adult rats. The lacerated medial gastrocnemius with the main intramuscular nerve branch either cut (DN), crushed but leaving an intact nerve sheath (RN); or preserved intact (PN) were compared. At 4 weeks, DN had a higher number of interleukins up-regulated. DN and RN also had a set of Bmp genes significantly expressed between 2 and 8 weeks (P </= 0.05). By 12 weeks, DN had a poorer and slower myogenic recovery and greater fibrosis formation correlating with an up-regulation of the Tgf-beta gene family. DN also showed poorer re-innervation with higher mRNA expression levels of nerve growth factor (Ngf) and brain-derived neurotrophin growth factor (Bdnf) over RN and PN. This study demonstrates that the inflammatory response over 12 weeks in lacerated muscles may be directed by the type of intramuscular nerve damage, which can influence the recovery at the lesion site. Inflammatory-related genes associated to the type of intramuscular nerve damage include Gas-6, Artemin, Fgf10, Gdf8, Cntf, Lif, and Igf-2. qPCR also found up-regulation of Bdnf (1-week), neurotrophin-3 (2w), Lif (4w), and Ngf (4w, 8w) mRNA expressions in DN, making them possible candidates for therapeutic treatment to arrest the poor recovery in muscle lacerations (250).","['Pereira, Barry P', 'Tan, Bee Leng', 'Han, Hwan Chour', 'Zou, Yu', 'Aung, Khin Zarchi', 'Leong, David T']","['Pereira BP', 'Tan BL', 'Han HC', 'Zou Y', 'Aung KZ', 'Leong DT']","['Musculoskeletal Research Laboratories, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, National University of Singapore, Singapore. dosbarry@nus.edu.sg']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Neurotrophin 3)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '9061-61-4 (Nerve Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/biosynthesis', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Fibrosis/pathology', 'Inflammation/immunology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/biosynthesis', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*injuries/*innervation/pathology/surgery', 'Nerve Crush', 'Nerve Growth Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Nerve Regeneration', 'Neurotrophin 3/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2012/05/11 06:00,2012/10/30 06:00,['2012/05/11 06:00'],"['2012/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.24105 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2012 Jul;113(7):2330-45. doi: 10.1002/jcb.24105.,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data on control trios may also be available, but how and when their use is advantageous is less familiar and is described here. In addition, the authors examine assumptions and properties of hybrid analyses combining association estimates from unrelated case-control individuals together with case and control family trios, focusing on low-prevalence disease. One such assumption is absence of population stratification bias (PSB), a potential source of confounding in case-control analyses. For detection of PSB, the authors discuss 4 possible tests that assess equality between individual-level and family-based estimates. Furthermore, a weighted framework is presented, in which estimates from analyses combining unrelated individuals and families (most powerful but subject to PSB) and family-based analyses (robust to PSB) are weighted according to the observed PSB test P value. In contrast to existing hybrid designs that combine individuals and families only if no significant PSB is detected, the weighted framework does not require specification of an arbitrary PSB testing level to establish significance. The statistical methods are evaluated using simulations and applied to a candidate gene study of childhood leukemia (Quebec Childhood Leukemia Study, 1980-2000).","['Mirea, Lucia', 'Infante-Rivard, Claire', 'Sun, Lei', 'Bull, Shelley B']","['Mirea L', 'Infante-Rivard C', 'Sun L', 'Bull SB']","['Maternal-Infant Care Research Centre, Mount Sinai Hospital, 700 University Avenue, Suite 8-500, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1X6, Canada.

Patients were grouped for analysis according to whether conditioning included antithymocyte globulin (ATG; n = 191) or alemtuzumab (n = 132) and no in vivo T-cell depletion (n = 392). The median follow-up time was 3.5 years for the ATG group and 5 years for the alemtuzumab and T cell-replete groups. Using Cox regression analysis, we compared transplantation outcomes between groups. Compared with no T-cell depletion, grade 2-4 acute and chronic GVHD rates were significantly lower after in vivo T-cell depletion with ATG (relative risk [RR] = 0.66; P = .005 and RR = 0.55; P < .0001, respectively) or alemtuzumab (RR = 0.09; P < .003 and RR = 0.21; P < .0001, respectively). Despite lower GVHD rates after in vivo T-cell depletion, nonrelapse mortality, relapse, overall survival, and leukemia-free survival (LFS) did not differ significantly among the treatment groups. The 3-year probabilities of LFS after ATG-containing, alemtuzumab-containing, and T cell-replete transplantations were 43%, 49%, and 46%, respectively.

A conserved attribute of the E4-ORF3 proteins of different human adenoviruses is the ability to disrupt PML nuclear bodies from their normally punctate appearance into heterogeneous filamentous structures. This E4-ORF3 activity correlates with the inhibition of PML-mediated antiviral activity. The mechanism of E4-ORF3-mediated reorganization of PML nuclear bodies is unknown. Biophysical analysis of the purified WT E4-ORF3 protein revealed an ordered secondary/tertiary structure and the ability to form heterogeneous higher-order multimers in solution. Importantly, a nonfunctional E4-ORF3 mutant protein, L103A, forms a stable dimer with WT secondary structure content. Because the L103A mutant is incapable of PML reorganization, this result suggests that higher-order multimerization of E4-ORF3 may be required for the activity of the protein. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate that the E4-ORF3 L103A mutant protein acts as a dominant-negative effector when coexpressed with the WT E4-ORF3 in mammalian cells. It prevents WT E4-ORF3-mediated PML track formation presumably by binding to the WT protein and inhibiting the formation of higher-order multimers. In vitro protein binding studies support this conclusion as demonstrated by copurification of coexpressed WT and L103A proteins in Escherichia coli and coimmunoprecipitation of WT.L103A E4-ORF3 complexes in mammalian cells. These results provide new insight into the properties of the Ad E4-ORF3 protein and suggest that higher-order protein multimerization is essential for E4-ORF3 activity.","['Patsalo, Vadim', 'Yondola, Mark A', 'Luan, Bowu', 'Shoshani, Ilana', 'Kisker, Caroline', 'Green, David F', 'Raleigh, Daniel P', 'Hearing, Patrick']","['Patsalo V', 'Yondola MA', 'Luan B', 'Shoshani I', 'Kisker C', 'Green DF', 'Raleigh DP', 'Hearing P']","['Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York 11794, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120509,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adenovirus E4 Proteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*metabolism', 'Adenoviridae Infections/*metabolism', 'Adenovirus E4 Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Biophysics/methods', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/virology', 'Dimerization', 'HeLa Cells', 'Host-Parasite Interactions/physiology', 'Humans', 'Multiprotein Complexes/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Mutagenesis/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism']",2012/05/11 06:00,2012/09/12 06:00,['2012/05/11 06:00'],"['2012/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)43428-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.344234 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Jun 29;287(27):22573-83. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.344234.

Besides its antifungal activity, the anticancer effect of citral was studied in recent years. In this study, we investigated the effect of citral on the acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4. Citral treatment had an antiproliferative effect in NB4 cells via the induction of apoptosis assessed by morphology, proliferation assay, DNA electrophoresis, Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and caspase-3 activation. And citral induced apoptosis of NB4 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, citral treatment induced decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating that citral induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. Bax up-regulation and Bcl-2 down-regulation on mRNA level and NF-kappaB down-regulation on protein level was found in this study, suggesting that Bcl-2, Bax and NF-kappaB may be involved in the mechanism of the apoptotic effect of citral on NB4 cells.

Disrupting mTOR constraints on eIF4F activity can be oncogenic and alter chemotherapy response, making eIF4F an attractive antineoplastic target. Here, we combine a newly developed inducible RNAi platform and pharmacological targeting of eIF4F activity to define a critical role for endogenous eIF4F in Myc-dependent tumor initiation. We find elevated Myc levels are associated with deregulated eIF4F activity in the prelymphomatous stage of the Emu-Myc lymphoma model. Inhibition of eIF4F is synthetic lethal with elevated Myc in premalignant pre-B/B cells resulting in reduced numbers of cycling pre-B/B cells and delayed tumor onset. At the organismal level, eIF4F suppression affected a subset of normal regenerating cells, but this was well tolerated and rapidly and completely reversible. Therefore, eIF4F is a key Myc client that represents a tumor-specific vulnerability.","['Lin, Chen-Ju', 'Nasr, Zeina', 'Premsrirut, Prem K', 'Porco, John A Jr', 'Hippo, Yoshitaka', 'Lowe, Scott W', 'Pelletier, Jerry']","['Lin CJ', 'Nasr Z', 'Premsrirut PK', 'Porco JA Jr', 'Hippo Y', 'Lowe SW', 'Pelletier J']","['Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec H3G 1Y6, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Rep,Cell reports,101573691,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (silvestrol)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'Triterpenes/pharmacology']",2012/05/11 06:00,2013/03/19 06:00,['2012/05/11 06:00'],"['2012/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.celrep.2012.02.010 [doi]', 'S2211-1247(12)00067-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Rep. 2012 Apr 19;1(4):325-33. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2012.02.010.,,"['T32 GM008444/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'P01 CA087497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM073855/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3346676,['NIHMS372495'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conclude that they are important functional intermediates in what is considered the canonical ALT pathway and discuss deregulations of cellular pathways that contribute to the emergence of the ALT phenotype.","['Chung, Inn', 'Osterwald, Sarah', 'Deeg, Katharina I', 'Rippe, Karsten']","['Chung I', 'Osterwald S', 'Deeg KI', 'Rippe K']","['Research Group Genome Organization & Function, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ) and BioQuant, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120501,United States,Nucleus,"Nucleus (Austin, Tex.)",101518322,['0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)'],IM,"['Cell Nucleus Division', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/metabolism', 'Telomere/*metabolism', 'Telomere Homeostasis']",2012/05/11 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/05/11 06:00'],"['2012/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['20326 [pii]', '10.4161/nucl.20326 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleus. 2012 May-Jun;3(3):263-75. doi: 10.4161/nucl.20326.

Over 150 hybridoma clones producing monoclonal antibodies were generated against a human phosphoprotein mixture derived from a human leukemia cell line. The expression profiles of 22 cell lines from 9 different types of cancer using PPmAbs were examined. The relationship between cancer cells and the expression of human phosphoprotein in the cells was analyzed by multiple discriminant analysis and was used to construct a diagnostic system for cancers. Multiple discriminant analysis was able to successfully classify the cell lines into the correct cancer group by using the diagnostic system for cancers.

We reviewed the current evidence on the interactions between CD, AL and AZA as well as the potential underlying mechanisms of leukaemia in AZA-treated patients. From this review, we concluded that AL should be questioned when facing cytopenia in a patient with CD.

Here, we provide novel evidence that the inhibition of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) by a selective inhibitor or small interfering RNA (siRNA) enhances US-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Jurkat cells showed insignificant lysis immediately after US at any applied intensity, whereas approximately 70% of the cells were gammaH2AX-positive 30min after US at 0.4W/cm(2). Regarding DNA damage response (DDR), Chk1, known as a target of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and rad3-related (ATR), was phosphorylated in cells after US exposure. An ATM inhibitor showed nearly no effect on Chk1 phosphorylation, whereas chemicals showing the ATR inhibitory effect markedly abrogated the phosphorylation, indicating that Chk1 phosphorylation is preferentially more dependent on ATR than on ATM in cells exposed to US. The pharmacological inhibition of Chk1 promoted caspase-3 cleavage and increased the percentage of cells in SubG1 after US exposure. siRNA targeting Chk1 abrogated approximately 55% of Chk1 expression and also promoted apoptosis, suggesting that Chk1 plays anti-apoptotic roles in response to US. These findings revealed, for the first time, that US activates Chk1 dependently on ATR and the activated Chk1 is involved in apoptosis of cells exposed to US. Moreover, we propose that Chk1 may be a promising target in US-aided therapy.","['Furusawa, Yukihiro', 'Iizumi, Takashi', 'Fujiwara, Yoshisada', 'Hassan, Mariame Ali', 'Tabuchi, Yoshiaki', 'Nomura, Takaharu', 'Kondo, Takashi']","['Furusawa Y', 'Iizumi T', 'Fujiwara Y', 'Hassan MA', 'Tabuchi Y', 'Nomura T', 'Kondo T']","['Department of Radiological Sciences, Life Science Research Center, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Sugitani 2630, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120419,Netherlands,Ultrason Sonochem,Ultrasonics sonochemistry,9433356,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', '*Sonication', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2012/05/11 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/05/11 06:00'],"['2012/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S1350-4177(12)00078-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ultsonch.2012.04.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Ultrason Sonochem. 2012 Nov;19(6):1246-51. doi: 10.1016/j.ultsonch.2012.04.003.

The molecular pathogenesis of MDS/MPN-U patients remains to be elucidated. Among five patients diagnosed with MDS/MPN-U, three patients harboured RUNX1 (AML1) mutations; one carried somatic mosaicism of RUNX1 mutation with JAK2(V617F) mutation and one had dual RUNX1 and FLT3-internal tandem duplication mutations with progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).

For a long period of time, the standard therapy for MDS was hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, however DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMT inhibitors) including decitabine (DAC) and azacitidine (AZA), and lenalidomide, a derivative of thalidomide have been highlighted as new chemotherapeutic agents for MDS. However, the underlying mechanisms of action of these drugs have not been fully defined yet. Therefore, we investigated the in vitro effects of DNMT inhibitors and lenalidomide on an MDS-derived cell line, MDS92 and its blastic subline MDS-L, both of which carry del(5q). MDS-L cells were found to be quite sensitive to DAC, which induced to cell death through DNA damage-mediated G2 arrest via p53- independent pathways. Gene expression profiling suggested that DAC affects biogroups representing hematological systems, cellular development, cell death and apoptosis. Next, we examined the effects of lenalidomide on MDS-L. Cell growth was inhibited and multinucleated cells were frequently formed prior to cell death by lenalidomide treatment. Time-lapse microscopic observation and DNA ploidy analysis revealed that lenalidomide does not affect DNA synthesis itself but inhibits cytokinesis of MDS-L cells. The gene expression profiling showed decreased expression of M phase-related genes. These data contribute to the understanding of action mechanisms of lenalidomide on MDS with del(5q).","['Tsujioka, Takayuki', 'Matsuoka, Akihito', 'Tohyama, Yumi', 'Tohyama, Kaoru']","['Tsujioka T', 'Matsuoka A', 'Tohyama Y', 'Tohyama K']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki-City, Okayama 701-0192, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/genetics', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2012/05/11 06:00,2012/10/31 06:00,['2012/05/11 06:00'],"['2011/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['CPD-EPUB-20120507-014 [pii]', '10.2174/1381612811209023204 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2012;18(22):3204-14. doi: 10.2174/1381612811209023204.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pathophysiologically, low risk MDS are separated from the high risk category by an increased rate of apoptosis of the bone marrow cells which causes the morphological paradoxon of a peripheral cytopenia and hypercellular bone marrow known as ineffective hematopoesis. Laboratory findings and clinical evidence suggest that some patients with myelodysplastic syndrome have immunologically mediated disease. MDS shares some of the features of acquired aplastic anemia and up to 30% of patients with MDS respond to immunosuppressive treatment. In the last decades, significant advances have been made in the diagnostic and prognostic classifications of myelodysplastic syndromes. While allogeneic transplantation still offers the only available option with a probability of cure in a minority of patients, the mainstay of therapy in low-risk patients remains supportive care, stimulation of ineffective hematopoiesis with growth factors, and immunomodulatory therapy.

Protein kinases are divided in two classes: tyrosine kinases (TKs) and serine/threonine kinases (STKs). Overexpression or activation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) has been found to be responsible for the development of many diseases, including cancer, inflammation, and many cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, the design of PTK inhibitors (PTKIs) has become a subject of a major interest for the pharmaceutical industry. A number of marketed PTKIs that target conserved ATP binding site of PTKs were found to demonstrate toxicity (e.g., imitanib and sorafenib) or to generate resistance (e.g., imitanib and vemurafenib in chronic myeloid leukemia and metastatic melanoma, respectively). Thus, alternative strategies are urgently required for designing novel PTKIs. Linear peptides designed based on the natural protein substrates of PTKs have been introduced to target unique and non conserved PTK regions, such as substrate binding site. These compounds are more specific than the small molecules that usually target conserved ATP binding site. On the other hand, linear peptides are susceptible to hydrolysis by endogenous peptidases. Cyclization of linear peptides has led to generation of diverse conformationally constrained structures as PTKIs. Introduction of the conformational constraints enhances the stability towards proteases, the free energy upon binding, and binding affinity, but reduces the conformational entropy penalty upon receptor binding. Herein, design strategies for conformationally constrained peptides and their application as PTKIs are discussed.","['Tiwari, Rakesh K', 'Parang, Keykavous']","['Tiwari RK', 'Parang K']","['Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, Rhode Island, 02881, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,"['0 (Peptides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Peptides/adverse effects/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2012/05/11 06:00,2012/10/23 06:00,['2012/05/11 06:00'],"['2012/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['CPD-EPUB-20120504-001 [pii]', '10.2174/138161212800672714 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2012;18(20):2852-66. doi: 10.2174/138161212800672714.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the determinants of MTX therapeutic effect are not clearly identified, although intracellular polyglutamation is essential. MTX, the monoglutamate form (MTXG(1)) inhibits the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) implicated in the folate cycle. MTXG(1) is metabolized to active methotrexate polyglutamates (MTXPG) with sequential gamma-linkage of 2 to 6 glutamyl residues by the folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS). Long chain MTXPG have higher affinity than MTX for the enzymes involved in de novo purine synthesis such as 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase (ATIC) and thymidilate synthase (TS), which results in a reinforcement of MTX inhibition. Thus, intracellular formation of MTXPG enhances the cytotoxic and antileukemic effect of MTX. Different pharmacogenetic polymorphisms contribute to interindividual variability in MTX response to treatment. In addition, pharmacokinetic interactions with 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), frequently co-administered, have been reported.

The proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, has limited efficacy as a single agent in acute myeloid leukaemia. Its activity on leukaemic cell lines is potentiated by chemotherapy. We treated 43 higher-risk MDS patients with bortezomib (1.5 mg/m(2) , days 1, 4, 8 and 11) and low dose cytarabine arabinoside (LDAC; 10 mg/m(2) , then 20 mg/m(2) from days 1-14), every 28 d for four cycles. Median follow-up was 29.7 months. Responses were seen in 12 of the 43 patients (28%), including complete response (CR, n = 1), marrow-CR (n = 3), partial response (PR, n = 5) and haematological improvement (HI, n = 3). Responses were seen in 12 (36%) of the 33 previously untreated patients (11% CR, 13% PR, 2.5% HI), compared to none in the 12 previously treated patients (P < 0.01). Responders had better overall survival (median 18.2 vs. 10 months). One CR and 3 marrow-CRs were seen in patients with complex karyotypes. Main toxicity was haematological, responsible for infection in six patients and bleeding in 3. Three patients with Grade 1-2 pre-treatment haematotoxicity developed Grade 3-4 toxicity. Neuropathy was seen in 12% of patients. The addition of bortezomib to LDAC in higher-risk MDS may improve results obtained with LDAC alone, especially in patients with unfavourable karyotypes.","['Natarajan-Ame, Shanti', 'Park, Sophie', 'Ades, Lionel', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Guerci-Bresler, Agnes', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'Etienne, Gabriel', 'Bordessoule, Dominique', 'Ravoet, Christophe', 'Legros, Laurence', 'Cheze, Stephane', 'Stamatoullas, Aspasia', 'Berger, Elisabeth', 'Schmidt, Aline', 'Charbonnier, Aude', 'Chaury, Marie-Pierre', 'Braun, Thorsten', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Dreyfus, Francois']","['Natarajan-Ame S', 'Park S', 'Ades L', 'Vey N', 'Guerci-Bresler A', 'Cahn JY', 'Etienne G', 'Bordessoule D', 'Ravoet C', 'Legros L', 'Cheze S', 'Stamatoullas A', 'Berger E', 'Schmidt A', 'Charbonnier A', 'Chaury MP', 'Braun T', 'Fenaux P', 'Dreyfus F']","['Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Hotel Dieu de Paris, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Universite Paris VI, Paris, France.', 'Hopital Avicenne, AP-HP, Universite Paris XIII, Bobigny, France.', 'Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Brabois, Nancy, France.', ""Clinique Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital Michallon, Grenoble, France."", 'Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.', 'Centre Hospitalier Dupuytren, Limoges, France.', 'Hopital de Jolimont, La Louviere, Belgium.', ""Hopital de l'Archet, Nice, France."", 'CHU de Caen, Caen, France.', 'Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France.', 'CHU de Dijon, Dijon, France.', ""Centre Hospitalier Regional Universitaire d'Angers, Angers, France."", 'Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Centre Hospitalier Dupuytren, Limoges, France.', 'Hopital Avicenne, AP-HP, Universite Paris XIII, Bobigny, France.', 'Hopital Avicenne, AP-HP, Universite Paris XIII, Bobigny, France.', 'Hotel Dieu de Paris, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Universite Paris VI, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20120510,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/drug therapy', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Boronic Acids/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/05/11 06:00,2012/09/22 06:00,['2012/05/11 06:00'],"['2012/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2012.09153.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2012 Jul;158(2):232-237. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2012.09153.x.

This article reviews the clinical efficacy and tolerability of azacitidine in the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)/acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), as well as summarizing its pharmacological properties. The randomized, multicentre Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9221 trial compared the efficacy of subcutaneous azacitidine with that of supportive care alone in patients with MDS fulfilling French-American-British (FAB) classification criteria. The overall response rate, the complete response rate and the complete plus partial response rate were significantly higher in patients receiving azacitidine than in those receiving supportive care alone. The randomized, open-label, multicentre AZA-001 trial compared the efficacy of subcutaneous azacitidine with that of conventional care in adults with higher-risk (i.e. International Prognostic Scoring System intermediate-2-risk or high-risk classification) MDS/AML. Prior to randomization, investigators preselected patients to the conventional care strategy considered most appropriate (i.e. best supportive care, low-dose cytarabine or intensive chemotherapy). The median duration of overall survival was significantly prolonged by 9.4 months in patients with higher-risk MDS receiving azacitidine versus those receiving conventional care. The survival benefit seen with azacitidine versus conventional care was maintained across various patient subgroups (e.g. in patients aged >/=75 years, in those who did not achieve complete remission and in patients with WHO-defined AML). The efficacy of subcutaneous or intravenous azacitidine was also shown in a noncomparative trial in Japanese patients with MDS fulfilling FAB classification criteria, and registry programmes in various countries support the efficacy of azacitidine in patients with MDS. Azacitidine was generally well tolerated in patients with MDS, including in the elderly. Across trials, peripheral cytopenias were the most commonly occurring adverse event in azacitidine recipients, with gastrointestinal adverse events (e.g. nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea) and injection-site reactions among the most commonly occurring non-haematological adverse events. In conclusion, azacitidine is an important agent for use in the treatment of patients with MDS/AML.","['Keating, Gillian M']",['Keating GM'],"['Adis, Auckland, New Zealand. demail@adis.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",2012/05/11 06:00,2012/09/25 06:00,['2012/05/11 06:00'],"['2012/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2165/11209430-000000000-00000 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs. 2012 May 28;72(8):1111-36. doi: 10.2165/11209430-000000000-00000.,,,,,,,,,,,,['Drugs. 2012 Jul 30;72(11):1578'],,,,,,,

In males with CML, ischaemic priapism is believed to result from hyperleucocytosis and associated leucostasis or hyperviscosity, and is seen in patients presenting with a high white cell count. Increasingly, a combined modality approach is being used to treat CML patients presenting with priapism. This includes systemic therapy with chemotherapy (hydroxycarbamide or tyrosine kinase inhibitors) and therapeutic leukapheresis to reduce the white cell count as well as local intracavernous therapy.

However, the precise mechanism and molecules involved in this process remain unknown. Gene expression profiles of CLL cells from lymph node (LN), bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) indicate overexpression of a tolerogenic signature in CLL cells in lymph nodes (LN-CLL). Based on their role in B cell biology, the progression of CLL, or immune regulation, a few genes of this 83-gene signature were selected for further analyses. We observed a significant correlation between the clinical outcomes and the expression of CAV1 (P = 0.041), FGFR1 isoform 8 (P = 0.032), PTPN6 (P = 0.031) and ZWINT (P < 0.001). CAV1, a molecule involved in the regulation of tumour progression in other cancers, was seven-fold higher in LN-CLL cells compared to BM- and PB-CLL cells. Knockdown of CAV1 expression in CLL cells resulted in significantly decreased migration (P = 0.016) and proliferation (P = 0.04). When CAV1 was knocked down in B and T cell lines, we observed an inability to form immune synapses. Furthermore, CAV1 knockdown in CLL cells impaired their ability to form immune synapses with autologous T lymphocytes and allogeneic, healthy T cells. Subsequent analyses of microarray data showed differential expression of cytoskeletal genes, specifically those involved in actin polymerization. Therefore, we report a novel role for CAV1 in tumour-induced immunosuppression during the progression of CLL.","['Gilling, Christine E', 'Mittal, Amit K', 'Chaturvedi, Nagendra K', 'Iqbal, Javeed', 'Aoun, Patricia', 'Bierman, Philip J', 'Bociek, Robert G', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D', 'Joshi, Shantaram S']","['Gilling CE', 'Mittal AK', 'Chaturvedi NK', 'Iqbal J', 'Aoun P', 'Bierman PJ', 'Bociek RG', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Joshi SS']","['Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Internal Medicine-Oncology/Hematology Section, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Internal Medicine-Oncology/Hematology Section, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120510,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CAV1 protein, human)', '0 (Caveolin 1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Caveolin 1/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/immunology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/genetics', 'Immunological Synapses/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Protein Binding', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/05/11 06:00,2012/09/22 06:00,['2012/05/11 06:00'],"['2011/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2012.09148.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2012 Jul;158(2):216-231. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2012.09148.x.

During the last years, changed treatment regimens for non-transplanted patients with hematological malignancies have had potential to increase the incidence of viral infections in this group. In this study, we have prospectively investigated the prevalence of a broad range of respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) as well as viruses that commonly reactivate after allogeneic HSCT. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Patients with hematological malignancies and therapy induced neutropenia (n = 159) were screened regarding a broad range of common respiratory viruses in the nasopharynx and for viruses commonly detected in severely immunosuppressed patients in peripheral blood. Quantitative PCR was used for detection of viruses. A viral pathogen was detected in 35% of the patients. The detection rate was rather similar in blood (22%) and NPA (18%) with polyoma BK virus and rhinovirus as dominating pathogens in blood and NPA, respectively. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (p<0.01) and patients with fever (p<0.001) were overrepresented in the virus-positive group. Furthermore, viral findings in NPA were associated with upper respiratory symptoms (URTS) (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Both respiratory viral infections and low titers of viruses in blood from patients with neutropenia were common. Patients with CLL and patients with fever were independently associated to these infections, and viral findings in NPA were associated to URTS indicating active infection. These findings motivate further studies on viruses' impact on this patient category and their potential role as causative agents of fever during neutropenia.","['Ohrmalm, Lars', 'Wong, Michelle', 'Aust, Carl', 'Ljungman, Per', 'Norbeck, Oscar', 'Broliden, Kristina', 'Tolfvenstam, Thomas']","['Ohrmalm L', 'Wong M', 'Aust C', 'Ljungman P', 'Norbeck O', 'Broliden K', 'Tolfvenstam T']","['Department of Medicine, Solna, Infectious Disease Unit, Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. lars.ohrmalm@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120503,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Nasopharynx/virology', 'Neutropenia/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/*complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/virology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Virus Diseases/*complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/virology']",2012/05/10 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/05/10 06:00'],"['2011/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0036543 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-25370 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e36543. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0036543.

However a significant proportion of patients, particularly adult patients, relapse with the majority dying of leukemia. FTY720 is an immunosuppressive drug that was recently approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and is currently under pre-clinical investigation as a therapy for a number of hematological malignancies. Using human ALL xenografts in NOD/SCIDgammac(-/-) mice, we show for the first time that three Ph(+) human ALL xenografts responded to FTY720 with an 80 +/- 12% (p = 0.048) reduction in overall disease when treatment was commenced early. In contrast, treatment of mice with FTY720 did not result in reduced leukemia compared to controls using four separate human Ph(-) ALL xenografts. Although FTY720 reactivated PP2A in vitro, this reactivation was not required for death of Ph(-) ALL cells. The plasma levels of FTY720 achieved in the mice were in the high nanomolar range. However, the response seen in the Ph(+) ALL xenografts when treatment was initiated early implies that in vivo efficacy may be obtained with substantially lower drug concentrations than those required in vitro. Our data suggest that while FTY720 may have potential as a treatment for Ph(+) ALL it will not be a useful agent for the treatment of Ph(-) B-ALL.","['Wallington-Beddoe, Craig T', 'Don, Anthony S', 'Hewson, John', 'Qiao, Qiao', 'Papa, Rachael A', 'Lock, Richard B', 'Bradstock, Kenneth F', 'Bendall, Linda J']","['Wallington-Beddoe CT', 'Don AS', 'Hewson J', 'Qiao Q', 'Papa RA', 'Lock RB', 'Bradstock KF', 'Bendall LJ']","['Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, Westmead Millennium Institute, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120503,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Propylene Glycols)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'G926EC510T (Fingolimod Hydrochloride)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Fingolimod Hydrochloride', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Propylene Glycols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/metabolism', 'Sphingosine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/05/10 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/05/10 06:00'],"['2011/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0036429 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-19057 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e36429. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0036429.

The resulting AF4*MLL oncoprotein becomes activated by Taspase1 hydrolysis and is considered to promote oncogenic transcriptional activation. Hence, Taspase1's proteolytic activity is a critical step in AF4*MLL pathophysiology. The Taspase1 proenzyme is autoproteolytically processed in its subunits and is assumed to assemble into an alphabetabetaalpha-heterodimer, the active protease. Therefore, we investigated here whether overexpression of catalytically inactive Taspase1 variants are able to interfere with the proteolytic activity of the wild type enzyme in AF4*MLL model systems. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: The consequences of overexpressing the catalytically dead Taspase1 mutant, Taspase1(T234V), or the highly attenuated variant, Taspase1(D233A), on Taspase1's processing of AF4*MLL and of other Taspase1 targets was analyzed in living cancer cells employing an optimized cell-based assay. Notably, even a nine-fold overexpression of the respective Taspase1 mutants neither inhibited Taspase1's cis- nor trans-cleavage activity in vivo. Likewise, enforced expression of the alpha- or beta-subunits showed no trans-dominant effect against the ectopically or endogenously expressed enzyme. Notably, co-expression of the individual alpha- and beta-subunits did not result in their assembly into an enzymatically active protease complex. Probing Taspase1 multimerization in living cells by a translocation-based protein interaction assay as well as by biochemical methods indicated that the inactive Taspase1 failed to assemble into stable heterocomplexes with the wild type enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results demonstrate that inefficient heterodimerization appears to be the mechanism by which inactive Taspase1 variants fail to inhibit wild type Taspase1's activity in trans. Our work favours strategies targeting Taspase1's catalytic activity rather than attempts to block the formation of active Taspase1 dimers to interfere with the pathobiological function of AF4*MLL.","['Bier, Carolin', 'Hecht, Rouven', 'Kunst, Lena', 'Scheiding, Sabine', 'Wunsch, Desiree', 'Goesswein, Dorothee', 'Schneider, Gunter', 'Kramer, Oliver H', 'Knauer, Shirley K', 'Stauber, Roland H']","['Bier C', 'Hecht R', 'Kunst L', 'Scheiding S', 'Wunsch D', 'Goesswein D', 'Schneider G', 'Kramer OH', 'Knauer SK', 'Stauber RH']","['Molecular and Cellular Oncology, Mainz Screening Center (MSC), University Hospital of Mainz, Mainz, Germany. bier@uni-mainz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120503,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (taspase1, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Endopeptidases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Models, Biological', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Protein Interaction Mapping/methods', 'Protein Multimerization', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2012/05/10 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/05/10 06:00'],"['2011/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0034142 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-20159 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e34142. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0034142.

To understand the underlying mechanism, we studied the effect of endothelin-1 (ET-1) on endothelial production of Forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), a forkhead transcription factor that plays an important role in cell survival. ET-1 is a 21-amino acid peptide that is secreted primarily from endothelium. Using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer approach, we delivered FOXO1 cDNA into cultured human aorta endothelial cells. FOXO1 was shown to stimulate B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2-associated death promoter (BAD) production and promote cellular apoptosis. This effect was counteracted by ET-1. In response to ET-1, FOXO1 was phosphorylated and translocated from the nucleus to cytoplasm, resulting in inhibition of BAD production and mitigation of FOXO1-mediated apoptosis. Hyperglycemia stimulated FOXO1 O-glycosylation and promoted its nuclear localization in human aorta endothelial cells. This effect accounted for unbridled FOXO1 activity in the nucleus, contributing to augmented BAD production and endothelial apoptosis under hyperglycemic conditions. FOXO1 expression became deregulated in the aorta of both streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice and diabetic db/db mice. This hyperglycemia-elicited FOXO1 deregulation and its ensuing effect on endothelial cell survival was corrected by ET-1. Likewise, FoxO1 deregulation in the aorta of diabetic mice was reversible after the reduction of hyperglycemia by insulin therapy. These data reveal a mechanism by which FOXO1 mediated the autocrine effect of ET-1 on endothelial cell survival. FOXO1 deregulation, resulting from an impaired ability of ET-1 to control FOXO1 activity in endothelium, may contribute to hyperglycemia-induced endothelial lesion in diabetes.","['Cifarelli, Vincenza', 'Lee, Sojin', 'Kim, Dae Hyun', 'Zhang, Ting', 'Kamagate, Adama', 'Slusher, Sandra', 'Bertera, Suzanne', 'Luppi, Patrizia', 'Trucco, Massimo', 'Dong, H Henry']","['Cifarelli V', 'Lee S', 'Kim DH', 'Zhang T', 'Kamagate A', 'Slusher S', 'Bertera S', 'Luppi P', 'Trucco M', 'Dong HH']","[""Division of Immunogenetics, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15224, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120508,United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (Endothelin-1)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O1)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxo1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aorta', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Survival', 'Diabetes Mellitus/metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Endothelin-1/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Forkhead Box Protein O1', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/metabolism', 'Insulin/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phosphorylation', 'Random Allocation', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/biosynthesis']",2012/05/10 06:00,2012/12/29 06:00,['2012/05/10 06:00'],"['2012/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['me.2011-1276 [pii]', '10.1210/me.2011-1276 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2012 Jul;26(7):1213-24. doi: 10.1210/me.2011-1276.

Introducing a new risk assessment grading system.,1181-92,10.1007/s00381-012-1787-8 [doi],"PURPOSE: The Children's Cancer Leukaemia Group (CCLG) proposed a management pathway for craniopharyngioma that advocated limited surgery followed by upfront radiotherapy (RT) for large tumours with hypothalamic involvement and a radical resection only for smaller tumours without hypothalamic involvement. This strategy is not proven to provide optimum care or to be risk-free. The aim of this study is to review our experience of the management of craniopharyngioma diagnosed since the introduction of the CCLG guidelines in 2005. METHODS: All children diagnosed with craniopharyngioma at Alder Hey Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in the period between 1 January 2005 and 30 June 2011 were included. Management was based on the presence of hypothalamic syndrome, hydrocephalus, tumour size and radiological Paris grading system. Endoscopic drainage of tumour cyst was performed prior to formalising risk grade and surgical strategy. Definitive surgery was performed in 4-6 weeks time. In this respect, we developed a grading criteria. RESULTS: Twenty patients were included. Ten of the children underwent endoscopic cyst drainage prior to definitive surgery. The results of the subsequent surgical excision were complete resection, near total resection or subtotal resection in 30, 25 and 45 % patients, respectively. There was no surgical-related mortality and no new neurological deficits. Nine patients underwent RT at some stage. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we tried to develop an advanced model for the management of craniopharyngioma with a new risk grading system. This may have a direct impact on the surgical strategy and outcome and could be able to improve morbidity.","['Mallucci, Conor', 'Pizer, Barry', 'Blair, Jo', 'Didi, Mohammed', 'Doss, Arun', 'Upadrasta, Swathi', 'Newman, William', 'Avula, Shivaram', 'Pettorini, Benedetta']","['Mallucci C', 'Pizer B', 'Blair J', 'Didi M', 'Doss A', 'Upadrasta S', 'Newman W', 'Avula S', 'Pettorini B']","[""Paediatric Neurosurgery Department, Alder Hey Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Eaton Road, West Derby, Liverpool L12 2AP, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120509,Germany,Childs Nerv Syst,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,8503227,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Craniopharyngioma/mortality/pathology/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'England', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/mortality/pathology/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/05/10 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/05/10 06:00'],"['2011/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00381-012-1787-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Childs Nerv Syst. 2012 Aug;28(8):1181-92. doi: 10.1007/s00381-012-1787-8.

To overcome this resistance, several inhibitors of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity were developed. In this context, computational simulations have become a powerful tool for understanding drug-protein interactions. Herein, we report a comparative molecular dynamics analysis of the interaction between two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib or nilotinib) against wild type c-ABL protein and 12 mutants, using the semi-empirical linear interaction energy (LIE) method, to assess the feasibility of this approach for studying resistance against the inhibitory activity of these drugs. In addition, to understand the structural changes that are associated with resistance, we describe the behavior of water molecules that interact simultaneously with specific residues (Glu286, Lys271 and Asp381) of c-ABL (wild type or mutant) and their relationship with drug resistance. Experimental IC50 values for the interaction between imatinib, wild type c-ABL, and 12 mutants were used to obtain the proper LIE coefficients (alpha, beta and gamma) to estimate the free energy of the binding of imatinib with wild-type and mutant proteins, and values were extrapolated for the analysis of the nilotinib/c-ABL interaction. Our results indicate that LIE was suitable to predict the superior inhibitory activity of nilotinib and the resistance to inhibition that was observed in c-ABL mutants. Additionally, for c-ABL mutants, the observed number of water molecules being turned over while interacting with amino acids Glu286, Lys271 and Asp381 was associated with resistance to imatinib, resulting in a less effective inhibition of the kinase activity.","['Pereira, Elen Gomes', 'Moreira, Miguel Angelo Martins', 'Caffarena, Ernesto Raul']","['Pereira EG', 'Moreira MA', 'Caffarena ER']","['Laboratorio Nacional de Computacao Cientifica, LNCC, Av.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed to establish the clinical characteristics of patients with RAS-mutated (RAS(mut) ) AML, to analyze their outcome by therapy, and to describe the proteomic profile of RAS(mut) compared with wild-type RAS (RAS(WT) ) AML. RESULTS: Of 609 patients with newly diagnosed AML, 11% had RAS(mut) . Compared with RAS(WT) , patients with RAS(mut) AML were younger (median age, 54 years vs 63 years; P = .001), had a higher white blood cell count (16K mm(-3) vs 4K mm(-3) ; P < 0.001) and bone marrow blast percentage (56% vs 42%; P = .01) at diagnosis, and were less likely to have an antecedent hematologic disorder (36% vs 50%; P = .03). The inv(16) karyotype was overrepresented in patients with RAS(mut) and the -5 and/or -7 karyotype was underrepresented. RAS mutations were found to have no prognostic impact on overall survival or disease-free survival overall or within cytogenetic subgroups. There was a suggestion that patients with RAS(mut) benefited from cytarabine (AraC)-based therapy. Proteomic analysis revealed simultaneous upregulation of the RAS-Raf-MAP kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways in patients with RAS(mut) .

In addition, effects of insulin and BMOV on the association of IR, phosphorylated IR (pIR) and phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (pIRS-1) with chemically-isolated plasma membrane microdomains on rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells were evaluated. Single particle tracking experiments indicate that individual quantum dot-labeled IR on RBL-2H3 cells exhibit relatively unrestricted lateral diffusion of approximately 1 x 10(-10) cm(2) s(-1) and are confined in approximately 475 nm diameter cell-surface membrane compartments. After treating of RBL-2H3 cells with 10 muM BMOV, IR lateral diffusion and the size of IR-containing membrane compartments is significantly reduced to 6 x 10(-11) cm(2) s(-1) and approximately 400 nm, respectively. BMOV treatment also increases the association of IR with low-density, detergent-resistant membrane fragments isolated using isopycnic sucrose-gradient centrifugation from 2.4% for untreated cells to 25.8% for cells treated with 10 muM BMOV. Additionally, confocal fluorescence microscopic imaging of live RBL-2H3 cells labeled with the phase sensitive aminonaphthylethenylpyridinium-based dye, Di-4-ANEPPDHQ, indicates that BMOV treatment, but not insulin treatment, decreases cell-surface plasma membrane lipid order while fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements suggest that BMOV treatment does not affect IR surface-density or insulin binding affinity. Finally, model studies using microemulsions of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) micelles and (1)H NMR spectroscopy show that an oxidized form of BMOV readily localizes near the CTAB head-groups at the lipid-water interface. These observations were supported by IR spectroscopic studies using microemulsions of CTAB reverse micelles showing that both BMOV and oxidized BMOV are associated with the water pool. This conclusion is based on changes in (1)H NMR chemical shifts observed for the complex, oxidized BMOV. Moreover, these shifts appeared to be informative about the location of the complex. No differences were observed in the OD absorption peak positions for the CTAB reverse micelles prepared in the presence and absence of BMOV, oxidized BMOV or maltol. Combined, these results suggest that activation of IR signaling by both insulin and BMOV treatment involves increased association of IR with specialized, nanoscale membrane microdomains. The observed insulin-like activity of BMOV or decomposition products of BMOV may be due to changes in cell-surface membrane lipid order rather than due to direct interactions with IR.","['Winter, Peter W', 'Al-Qatati, Abeer', 'Wolf-Ringwall, Amber L', 'Schoeberl, Samantha', 'Chatterjee, Pabitra B', 'Barisas, B George', 'Roess, Deborah A', 'Crans, Debbie C']","['Winter PW', 'Al-Qatati A', 'Wolf-Ringwall AL', 'Schoeberl S', 'Chatterjee PB', 'Barisas BG', 'Roess DA', 'Crans DC']","['Cell and Molecular Biology Program, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120430,England,Dalton Trans,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",101176026,"['0 (Cetrimonium Compounds)', '0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Micelles)', '0 (Pyrones)', '38213-69-3 (bis(maltolato)oxovanadium(IV))', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)', 'Z7FF1XKL7A (Cetrimonium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cetrimonium', 'Cetrimonium Compounds/chemistry', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Insulin/pharmacology', 'Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins/metabolism', 'Membrane Lipids/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Micelles', 'Movement/drug effects', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Pyrones/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Insulin/*metabolism', 'Vanadates/*pharmacology']",2012/05/10 06:00,2012/09/05 06:00,['2012/05/10 06:00'],"['2012/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c2dt30521f [doi]'],ppublish,Dalton Trans. 2012 Jun 7;41(21):6419-30. doi: 10.1039/c2dt30521f.

In vertebrates, the paralogous MLL2 and MLL3 contain multiple domains required for epigenetic reading and writing of the histone code involved in hormone-stimulated gene programming, including receptor-binding motifs, SET methyltransferase, HMG and PHD domains. The genes encoding MLL2 and MLL3 arose from a common ancestor. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that the ancestral gene underwent a fission event in some Brachycera dipterans, including Drosophila species, creating two independent genes corresponding to the N- and C-terminal portions. In Drosophila, the C-terminal SET domain is encoded by trithorax-related (trr), which is required for hormone-dependent gene activation. We identified the cara mitad (cmi) gene, which encodes the previously undiscovered N-terminal region consisting of PHD and HMG domains and receptor-binding motifs. The cmi gene is essential and its functions are dosage sensitive. CMI associates with TRR, as well as the EcR-USP receptor, and is required for hormone-dependent transcription. Unexpectedly, although the CMI and MLL2 PHDf3 domains could bind histone H3, neither showed preference for trimethylated lysine 4. Genetic tests reveal that cmi is required for proper global trimethylation of H3K4 and that hormone-stimulated transcription requires chromatin binding by CMI, methylation of H3K4 by TRR and demethylation of H3K27 by the demethylase UTX. The evolutionary split of MLL2 into two distinct genes in Drosophila provides important insight into distinct epigenetic functions of conserved readers and writers of the histone code.","['Chauhan, Chhavi', 'Zraly, Claudia B', 'Parilla, Megan', 'Diaz, Manuel O', 'Dingwall, Andrew K']","['Chauhan C', 'Zraly CB', 'Parilla M', 'Diaz MO', 'Dingwall AK']","['Oncology Institute, Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University of Chicago, Maywood, IL 60153, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Lpt protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivators)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (TRR protein, Drosophila)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Drosophila/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drosophila Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Genes, Essential/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Methylation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Nuclear Receptor Coactivators/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2012/05/10 06:00,2012/07/21 06:00,['2012/05/10 06:00'],"['2012/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['139/11/1997 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.076687 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2012 Jun;139(11):1997-2008. doi: 10.1242/dev.076687.,,"['P01 CA105049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1P01-CA105049-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3347691,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The risk allele is thought to function by diminishing antigen-receptor signals responsible for negative selection of autoreactive lymphocytes. We now show that PTPN22 is markedly overexpressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a common malignancy of autoreactive B lymphocytes. We also show that overexpression of PTPN22 significantly inhibits antigen-induced apoptosis of primary CLL cells by blocking B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathways that negatively regulate lymphocyte survival. More importantly, we show that PTPN22 positively regulates the antiapoptotic AKT kinase, which provides a powerful survival signal to antigen-stimulated CLL cells. This selective uncoupling of AKT from other downstream BCR signaling pathways is a result of inhibition of a negative regulatory circuit involving LYN, CD22, and SHIP. Finally, we show that PTPN22 can be effectively down-regulated by the PKC inhibitors ruboxistaurin and sotrastaurin, resulting in enhanced killing of CLL cells exposed to proapoptotic BCR stimuli. Collectively, these data suggest that PTPN22 overexpression represents a protective mechanism that allows autoantigen-activated CLL cells to escape from negative selection and indicate that this mechanism could be exploited for therapeutic purposes by targeting PTPN22 with PKC inhibitors.","['Negro, Roberto', 'Gobessi, Stefania', 'Longo, Pablo G', 'He, Yantao', 'Zhang, Zhong-Yin', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Efremov, Dimitar G']","['Negro R', 'Gobessi S', 'Longo PG', 'He Y', 'Zhang ZY', 'Laurenti L', 'Efremov DG']","['Molecular Hematology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology, Campus A.

For this purpose, three in vitro models were employed to compare the toxic effects of various concentrations of the venoms from these three scorpions, namely: hemolytic potential using human RBCs, phospholipase activity using Saubouraud's dextrose agar (SDA) supplemented with 2% egg yolk and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme releasing effect using K562 leukemia cell line. In addition, the neutralizing effectiveness of the antivenom against these toxic properties was assessed. The results showed that, unlike the venoms from A. crassicauda and M. eupeus, the venom from H. lepturus produced dose-dependent lysis of human RBCs and showed phospholipase activity. However, all the tested venoms showed variable degrees of LDH releasing properties. The venom from H. lepturus had highest and the venom from M. eupeus had the lowest LDH releasing effect. The antivenom effectively inhibited all the tested toxicities. In conclusion, these results suggest that the venoms from the studied scorpions have variable toxic properties, which may explain the underlying reason for the differences in their clinical manifestations.

The current study used APL patient samples to assess the expression pattern of PU.1 in the initiation and progression of APL. FINDINGS: We used real-time RT-PCR to compare PU.1 expression between de novo APL patient samples and normal blood specimens, and the results indicated that PU.1 expression was significantly lower in newly diagnosed APL patient samples as compared to normal hematopoietic cells. Further evidence showed a significant inverse correlation between the expression level of PML-RARalpha and that of PU.1. In addition, we analyzed the correlation between PML-RARalpha and PU.1 expression in a large population of AML patients retrieved from the expression profiles. The results showed that PU.1 expression was lower in patients with APL than other AML subtypes and there was also a trend towards increasing PU.1 expression from AML-M0 to AML-M5, with the exception of AML-M3 (APL). These observations suggested that PU.1 expression was reduced by PML-RARalpha in APL patients. Furthermore, we measured PU.1 expression in APL-initiating cells isolated from de novo APL patients by side population cell analysis and found that suppression of PU.1 expression occurred concurrently with PML-RARalpha expression, indicating the pivotal role of PU.1 in APL initiation. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence that low PU.1 expression in APL patients is required for disease initiation and progression.","['Zhu, Xuehua', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Qian, Maoxiang', 'Zhao, Xujie', 'Yang, Wentao', 'Wang, Ping', 'Zhang, Ji', 'Wang, Kankan']","['Zhu X', 'Zhang H', 'Qian M', 'Zhao X', 'Yang W', 'Wang P', 'Zhang J', 'Wang K']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) & Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTUSM), Rui-Jin Hospital, SJTUSM, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120508,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2012/05/10 06:00,2012/12/21 06:00,['2012/05/10 06:00'],"['2012/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-5-22 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-5-22 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2012 May 8;5:22. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-5-22.,,,PMC3407792,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it seems to have a benign course, it may also be lethal and severe in some cases, especially in the form of hydrops and/or cardiopulmonary failure. Herein, we report a male infant with Down syndrome who was admitted with respiratory distress due to severe pericardial effusion leading to pericardial tamponade in the first 2 weeks of life. Pericardiosentesis and pericardial tube replacement in combination with steroid therapy was performed. He responded well to these therapies and his leukemia resolved on the fourth month of life. This case suggests that severe pericardial effusion and pericardial tamponade may be life-threatening complications of transient leukemia of Down syndrome and also it may be managed successfully with appropriate treatments.","['Buyukkale, Gokhan', 'Cetinkaya, Merih', 'Akcay, Arzu', 'Payasli, Muge', 'Oztarhan, Kazim', 'Ozbek, Ayse Sibel', 'Kavuncuoglu, Sultan']","['Buyukkale G', 'Cetinkaya M', 'Akcay A', 'Payasli M', 'Oztarhan K', 'Ozbek AS', 'Kavuncuoglu S']","['Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey. gbuyukkale@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,"['Cardiac Tamponade/complications/*therapy', 'Down Syndrome/complications/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/complications/*therapy', 'Male', 'Pericardial Effusion/complications/therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn/complications/therapy']",2012/05/10 06:00,2012/09/13 06:00,['2012/05/10 06:00'],"['2012/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2012.680683 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2012 May;29(4):386-8. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2012.680683.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polymorphism in the human GGH gene (GGH) was associated with efficacy and side effects of methotrexate for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This study aimed to identify polymorphisms of GGH in Chinese. Seventy-one children with ALL, 25 children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 132 children with nonmalignancy as control were included. Human GGH cDNAs were prepared and analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The detected variants were further confirmed by DNA sequencing. Novel variant GGH cDNA was cloned, expressed, and characterized. Allelic frequency of GGH 452C-->T polymorphism was determined as 9.2% (CT, 11/71; TT, 1/71) in the ALL group, 8.0% (CT, 4/25; TT, 0/25) in the AML group, and 9.1% (TT, 4/132; T/C, 16/132) in the controls, respectively. The total allelic frequency in the Chinese population (9.0%) was higher than those reported in Japanese (5.6%) and African Americans (4.4%), and was similar to Caucasians (10.0%). Association of 452TT+TC with increased rate of hepatotoxicity and mucositis was observed in the ALL patients. Two novel mutations were determined in the coding region of GGH in 2 boys with ALL: one of the mutations was a double nonsynonymous heterozygote (841AG+845AG, K257E/N258S), the other was a nonsynonymous heterozygote (797AG, K242R). The corresponding double-mutant protein showed unchanged enzymatic activity by functional analysis. Allele frequency of GGH C452T polymorphism is determined for the first time among Chinese. A novel double nonsynonymous mutation of GGH was identified in a boy with ALL.","['Chen, Xiaowen', 'Wen, Feiqiu', 'Yue, Lijie', 'Li, Changgang']","['Chen X', 'Wen F', 'Yue L', 'Li C']","[""Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Shenzhen Institute of Pediatrics, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', 'EC 3.4.19.9 (gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Asians', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/epidemiology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', '*Point Mutation', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', 'gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase/*genetics/metabolism']",2012/05/10 06:00,2012/09/13 06:00,['2012/05/10 06:00'],"['2012/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2012.657767 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2012 May;29(4):303-12. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2012.657767.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we analysed the prognostic impact of ID1 expression in 269 patients (aged 16-60 years) with CN-AML in the context of other molecular markers, particularly CEBPA mutations. ID1(high) status was an independent negative prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) in multivariate analysis when analysed together with age, extramedullary disease, platelets, expression of BAALC and WT1, FLT3-internal tandem duplication, NPM1, WT1 single nucleotide polymorphism rs16754 and IDH1. ID1 expression was higher in CEBPA wildtype patients than in patients with monoallelic CEBPA mutations and these patients showed higher ID1 expression compared to patients with biallelic CEBPA mutations. Thus, when CEBPA mutations were considered, ID1 expression lost its prognostic impact. Likewise, the negative impact of ID1(high) status on relapse-free survival (RFS) was lost when CEBPA mutations were included in the analysis. In CEBPA wildtype patients, ID1 expression had no impact on complete remission-rate, OS or RFS. In conclusion, CEBPA mutations seem to deregulate ID1 expression.

However, the GS group had a significantly higher relapse rate than the non-GS group (74.2% vs 55.3%; P = 0.048) and a significantly lower 5-year disease-free survival rate (8.2% vs 25.7%, respectively; P = 0.005). When considered together with the results of multivariate analysis, which identified the presence of GS as an independent predictor for disease-free survival time, these findings indicate that GS might identify a high-risk subset of patients with AML.","['Shimizu, Hiroaki', 'Saitoh, Takayuki', 'Hatsumi, Nahoko', 'Takada, Satoru', 'Yokohama, Akihiko', 'Handa, Hiroshi', 'Jimbo, Tkahiro', 'Sakura, Toru', 'Tsukamoto, Norifumi', 'Murakami, Hirokazu', 'Miyawaki, Shuichi', 'Nojima, Yoshihisa']","['Shimizu H', 'Saitoh T', 'Hatsumi N', 'Takada S', 'Yokohama A', 'Handa H', 'Jimbo T', 'Sakura T', 'Tsukamoto N', 'Murakami H', 'Miyawaki S', 'Nojima Y']","['Leukemia Research Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Gunma, Japan. hiroakis@ked.biglobe.ne.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120621,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*complications/drug therapy/immunology', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2012/05/10 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2012/05/10 06:00'],"['2012/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/27 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2012.02324.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2012 Aug;103(8):1513-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2012.02324.x.

Although it has been shown that ovarian, breast, and melanoma cancer cells depend on PBX1 for cell growth and survival, the molecular mechanism of how PBX1 promotes tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here, we applied an integrated approach by overlapping PBX1 ChIP-chip targets with the PBX1-regulated transcriptome in ovarian cancer cells to identify genes whose transcription was directly regulated by PBX1. We further determined if PBX1 target genes identified in ovarian cancer cells were co-overexpressed with PBX1 in carcinoma tissues. By analyzing TCGA gene expression microarray datasets from ovarian serous carcinomas, we found co-upregulation of PBX1 and a significant number of its direct target genes. Among the PBX1 target genes, a homeodomain protein MEOX1 whose DNA binding motif was enriched in PBX1-immunoprecipicated DNA sequences was selected for functional analysis. We demonstrated that MEOX1 protein interacts with PBX1 protein and inhibition of MEOX1 yields a similar growth inhibitory phenotype as PBX1 suppression. Furthermore, ectopically expressed MEOX1 functionally rescued the PBX1-withdrawn effect, suggesting MEOX1 mediates the cellular growth signal of PBX1. These results demonstrate that MEOX1 is a critical target gene and cofactor of PBX1 in ovarian cancers.","['Thiaville, Michelle M', 'Stoeck, Alexander', 'Chen, Li', 'Wu, Ren-Chin', 'Magnani, Luca', 'Oidtman, Jessica', 'Shih, Ie-Ming', 'Lupien, Mathieu', 'Wang, Tian-Li']","['Thiaville MM', 'Stoeck A', 'Chen L', 'Wu RC', 'Magnani L', 'Oidtman J', 'Shih IeM', 'Lupien M', 'Wang TL']","['Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120502,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEOX1 protein, human)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/05/09 06:00,2012/09/18 06:00,['2012/05/09 06:00'],"['2011/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0036054 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-24864 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e36054. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0036054.

Hepatitis viruses are hepatotrope viruses, potentially lymphotrope and also potentially oncogenic (hepatocellular carcinoma) viruses. HBV and HCV are involved in autoimmune disorders and in the ethiopathogeny of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. AIM: Detection of immunophenotype changes of malignant lymphocytes in CLD--especially CLL--associated with hepatitis viral infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow aspirate, peripheral blood samples on EDTA were available for analysis from 58 patients from a follow-up schedule of the Department of Hematology SUUB from March 2008 until June 2009. The patients were diagnosed with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders associated with hepatitis virus B/C/D infections. A group of 28 consecutive unselected patients with CLL who met the diagnostic criteria of the National Cancer Institute-Working Group (NCI NCIWG), and associated hepatitis viral infection (v-CLL) were studied for the expression of several immunophenotypical markers, in comparison to CLL patients without viral infection (control group). Immunophenotyping analysis was performed on a FACS Calibur flowcytometer with a large panel according to EGIL/WHO recommendations. The diagnosis was completed after the histological and immunochemical analysis from tumoral lesions. RESULTS: Demographics characteristics--male/female ratio 1/2, average age 64 years. Disease type: 90% B-CLD, 5% T-CLD, 5% Hodgkin's disease. The viral infections: 58.53% HCV, 34.41% HBV, 2.43% HBV+HDV, 2.43% HCV+HDV, 2.43% HBV+HCV+HDV. We found in CLL with viral coinfection (v-CLL) cases an elevated expression of B-cell markers--CD19 (Md95/92), CD20 (Md 90/39), CD79b (Md58/31), CD23 (Md67/37). Poor prognosis markers have a higher expression in v-CLL: CD38 (Md49/24), Bcl2 (Md 46/5), cyclin D19 (Md 11/0.5). No change in ZAP-70 expression was observed: Md 59.5/59.1. DISCUSSIONS: Hepatitis viruses could be involved in the pathogenesis of CLD, but as a trigger for a more aggressive outcome. Higher expression of B-cell markers CD19, CD20 in CLL with viral infection suggests a change to atypical CLL, sustained by elevated expression of known poor prognosis markers bcl-2, cyclin D1 and CD38. Lack of ZAP-70 expression could be explained by a strong correlation with a basic unmutated IgVH status, not related to the viral infection.

Among many distinguishing characteristics, B1 B cells display evidence of activation that includes phosphorylated STAT3. In order to identify the origin of pSTAT3 we examined interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) expression on B1 cells. We found that some (about 1/5) B1a cells express the IL-2R alpha chain, CD25. Although lacking CD122 and unresponsive to IL-2, B1a cells marked by CD25 express increased levels of activated signaling intermediates, interruption of which results in diminished CD25. Further, CD25(+) B1a cells contain most of the pSTAT3 found in the B1a population as a whole. Moreover, CD25(+) B1a cells express leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), and respond to LIF by upregulating pSTAT3. Together, these results define a new subset of B1a cells that is marked by activation-dependent CD25 expression, expresses substantial amounts of activated STAT3, and contains a functional LIFR.","['Tumang, Joseph R', 'Holodick, Nichol E', 'Vizconde, Teresa C', 'Kaku, Hiroaki', 'Frances, Ruben', 'Rothstein, Thomas L']","['Tumang JR', 'Holodick NE', 'Vizconde TC', 'Kaku H', 'Frances R', 'Rothstein TL']","['Immunobiology Laboratory, Center for Oncology and Cell Biology, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research Manhasset, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110321,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,2011/01/01 00:00,2011/01/01 00:01,['2012/05/09 06:00'],"['2010/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2011.00006 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2011 Mar 21;2:6. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2011.00006. eCollection 2011.,,"['P01 AI060896/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI029690/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI029690/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3342026,,['NOTNLM'],"['B1 cells', 'CD25', 'LIF receptor', 'signaling']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in osteoarthritis (OA) and specifically in HOA have yielded only few loci, which is partly explained by heterogeneity in the OA definition. Therefore, we here focused on radiographically measured joint-space width (JSW), a proxy for cartilage thickness and an important underlying intermediate trait for HOA. In a GWAS of 6,523 individuals on hip-JSW, we identified the G allele of rs12982744 on chromosome 19p13.3 to be associated with a 5% larger JSW (P = 4.8 x 10(-10)). The association was replicated in 4,442 individuals from three United Kingdom cohorts with an overall meta-analysis P value of 1.1 x 10(-11). The SNP was also strongly associated with a 12% reduced risk for HOA (P = 1 x 10(-4)). The SNP is located in the DOT1L gene, which is an evolutionarily conserved histone methyltransferase, recently identified as a potentially dedicated enzyme for Wnt target-gene activation in leukemia. Immunohistochemical staining of the DOT1L protein in mouse limbs supports a role for DOT1L in chondrogenic differentiation and adult articular cartilage. DOT1L is also expressed in OA articular chondrocytes. Silencing of Dot1l inhibited chondrogenesis in vitro. Dot1l knockdown reduces proteoglycan and collagen content, and mineralization during chondrogenesis. In the ATDC5 chondrogenesis model system, DOT1L interacts with TCF and Wnt signaling. These data are a further step to better understand the role of Wnt-signaling during chondrogenesis and cartilage homeostasis. DOT1L may represent a therapeutic target for OA.","['Castano Betancourt, Martha C', 'Cailotto, Frederic', 'Kerkhof, Hanneke J', 'Cornelis, Frederique M F', 'Doherty, Sally A', 'Hart, Deborah J', 'Hofman, Albert', 'Luyten, Frank P', 'Maciewicz, Rose A', 'Mangino, Massimo', 'Metrustry, Sarah', 'Muir, Kenneth', 'Peters, Marjolein J', 'Rivadeneira, Fernando', 'Wheeler, Maggie', 'Zhang, Weiya', 'Arden, Nigel', 'Spector, Tim D', 'Uitterlinden, Andre G', 'Doherty, Michael', 'Lories, Rik J U', 'Valdes, Ana M', 'van Meurs, Joyce B J']","['Castano Betancourt MC', 'Cailotto F', 'Kerkhof HJ', 'Cornelis FM', 'Doherty SA', 'Hart DJ', 'Hofman A', 'Luyten FP', 'Maciewicz RA', 'Mangino M', 'Metrustry S', 'Muir K', 'Peters MJ', 'Rivadeneira F', 'Wheeler M', 'Zhang W', 'Arden N', 'Spector TD', 'Uitterlinden AG', 'Doherty M', 'Lories RJ', 'Valdes AM', 'van Meurs JB']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Erasmus Medical Center, 3000 DR Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120507,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (HNF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-alpha)', '0 (Hnf1a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DOT1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Dot1l protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Cartilage, Articular/pathology/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Chondrocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Chondrogenesis/*genetics', 'Genetic Variation', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-alpha/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Osteoarthritis, Hip/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/physiology']",2012/05/09 06:00,2012/08/03 06:00,['2012/05/09 06:00'],"['2012/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1119899109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1119899109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 May 22;109(21):8218-23. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1119899109.

Despite the lack of targeted therapy for most subtypes and a dearth of new agents, survival rates have reached approximately 60% for children treated on clinical trials in developed countries. Most of the advances have been accomplished by better risk classification, the implementation of excellent supportive care measures, adaptation of therapy on the basis of each patient's response to therapy, and improvements in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, it is unlikely that further gains can be made through these measures alone. In this regard, high-resolution, genome-wide analyses have led to greater understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease and the identification of molecular abnormalities that are potential targets of new therapies.

Here, we show that Setbp1 overexpression efficiently confers self-renewal capability to myeloid progenitors in vitro, causing their immortalization in the presence of stem cell factor and IL-3. Self-renewal after immortalization requires continuous Setbp1 expression. We also found that Hoxa9 and Hoxa10 mRNA are present at dramatically higher levels in Setbp1-immortalized cells compared with other immortalized cells, and are induced shortly after Setbp1 expression in primary myeloid progenitors. Suppression of either gene in Setbp1-immortalized cells drastically reduces their colony-forming capability. Interestingly, Setbp1 protein associates with Hoxa9 and Hoxa10 promoters in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in these cells, suggesting that both are direct transcriptional targets of Setbp1. Setbp1 also promotes self-renewal of myeloid progenitors in vivo as its coexpression with BCR/ABL transforms primary mouse myeloid progenitors, generating aggressive leukemias in recipient mice resembling chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) myeloid blast crisis. Increased SETBP1 mRNA levels were also detected in a subset of CML advanced phase/blast crisis patients with high levels of HOXA9 and HOXA10 expression. Thus, Setbp1 activation represents a novel mechanism conferring self-renewal capability to myeloid progenitors in myeloid leukemia development.","['Oakley, Kevin', 'Han, Yufen', 'Vishwakarma, Bandana A', 'Chu, Su', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Gudmundsson, Kristbjorn O', 'Keller, Jonathan', 'Chen, Xiongfong', 'Vasko, Vasyl', 'Jenkins, Nancy A', 'Copeland, Neal G', 'Du, Yang']","['Oakley K', 'Han Y', 'Vishwakarma BA', 'Chu S', 'Bhatia R', 'Gudmundsson KO', 'Keller J', 'Chen X', 'Vasko V', 'Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG', 'Du Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, 4301 Jones Bridge Rd, Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120507,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (SETBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Setbp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '164384-16-1 (Hoxa10 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation/physiology', 'Transfection']",2012/05/09 06:00,2012/09/14 06:00,['2012/05/09 06:00'],"['2012/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47654-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-10-388710 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jun 21;119(25):6099-108. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-10-388710.

Subsequent preclinical studies with bortezomib in AML cells have shown drug-induced miR-29b up-regulation, resulting in loss of transcriptional activation for several genes relevant to myeloid leukemogenesis, including DNA methyltransferases and receptor tyrosine kinases. Thus, a phase 1 trial of bortezomib and decitabine was developed. Nineteen poor-risk AML patients (median age 70 years; range, 32-84 years) enrolled. Induction with decitabine (20 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1-10) plus bortezomib (escalated up to the target 1.3 mg/m(2) on days 5, 8, 12, and 15) was tolerable, but bortezomib-related neuropathy developed after repetitive cycles. Of previously untreated patients (age >/= 65 years), 5 of 10 had CR (complete remission, n = 4) or incomplete CR (CRi, n = 1); 7 of 19 overall had CR/CRi. Pharmacodynamic analysis showed FLT3 down-regulation on day 26 of cycle 1 (P = .02). Additional mechanistic studies showed that FLT3 down-regulation was due to bortezomib-induced miR-29b up-regulation; this led to SP1 down-regulation and destruction of the SP1/NF-kappaB complex that transactivated FLT3. This study demonstrates the feasibility and preliminary clinical activity of decitabine plus bortezomib in AML and identifies FLT3 as a novel pharmacodynamic end point for future trials.","['Blum, William', 'Schwind, Sebastian', 'Tarighat, Somayeh S', 'Geyer, Susan', 'Eisfeld, Ann-Kathrin', 'Whitman, Susan', 'Walker, Alison', 'Klisovic, Rebecca', 'Byrd, John C', 'Santhanam, Ramasamy', 'Wang, Hongyan', 'Curfman, John P', 'Devine, Steven M', 'Jacob, Samson', 'Garr, Celia', 'Kefauver, Cheryl', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Chan, Kenneth K', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Marcucci, Guido']","['Blum W', 'Schwind S', 'Tarighat SS', 'Geyer S', 'Eisfeld AK', 'Whitman S', 'Walker A', 'Klisovic R', 'Byrd JC', 'Santhanam R', 'Wang H', 'Curfman JP', 'Devine SM', 'Jacob S', 'Garr C', 'Kefauver C', 'Perrotti D', 'Chan KK', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Grever MR', 'Garzon R', 'Marcucci G']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, B310 Starling-Loving Hall, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. william.blum@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120507,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Boronic Acids/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyrazines/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Validation Studies as Topic']",2012/05/09 06:00,2012/09/14 06:00,['2012/05/09 06:00'],"['2012/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47646-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-03-413898 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jun 21;119(25):6025-31. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-03-413898.

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2) regulates the stability of Akt and conventional PKC (cPKC; PKCalpha and PKCbeta) proteins by phosphorylating the highly conserved turn motif of these proteins. In cells that lack mTORC2 function, the turn motif phosphorylation of Akt and cPKC is abolished and therefore Akt and cPKC protein stability is impaired. However, the chaperone protein HSP90 can stabilize Akt and cPKC, partially rescuing the expression of these proteins. In the present study, we investigated the antitumor effects of inhibiting mTORC2 plus HSP90 in mouse and human leukemia cell models and show that the HSP90 inhibitor 17-allylaminogeldanamycin (17-AAG) preferentially inhibits Akt and cPKC expression and promotes cell death in mTORC2 deficient pre-B leukemia cells. Furthermore, we show that 17-AAG selectively inhibits mTORC2 deficient leukemia cell growth in vivo. Finally, we show that the mTOR inhibitors rapamycin and pp242 work together with 17-AAG to inhibit leukemia cell growth to a greater extent than either drug alone. These studies provide a mechanistic and clinical rationale to combine mTOR inhibitors with chaperone protein inhibitors to treat human blood cancers.","['Zhang, Fan', 'Lazorchak, Adam S', 'Liu, Dou', 'Chen, Fangping', 'Su, Bing']","['Zhang F', 'Lazorchak AS', 'Liu D', 'Chen F', 'Su B']","['Department of Immunobiology and Vascular Biology and Therapeutic Program, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120507,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Crtc2 protein, mouse)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'H5669VNZ7V (PP242)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Benzoquinones/administration & dosage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Indoles/administration & dosage', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Chaperones/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Purines/administration & dosage', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Sirolimus/administration & dosage', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Trans-Activators/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors']",2012/05/09 06:00,2012/09/14 06:00,['2012/05/09 06:00'],"['2012/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47652-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-12-399519 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jun 21;119(25):6080-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-12-399519.

Data presented illustrates that mechanical transduction changes the expression of humoral factors by facilitating paracrine/autocrine signalling, therefore modulating intracellular trafficking of tyrosine kinase receptors. Understanding mechano-transduction in the context of cell and tissue morphogenesis is the major focus of this study. The effects of external physiological stresses, such as blood flow, on several cellular subtypes seem to produce very intricate cellular responses. It is well accepted that mechanical loading plays an intrinsic and extrinsic influence on cell survival. This study shows how microgravity effects hematopoietic stem cells, and human leukemic cell proliferation and expression of its receptors that control cell survival, such as the tyrosine kinase vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, receptor-2 and receptor-3.","['Puca, Andrew', 'Russo, Giuseppe', 'Giordano, Antonio']","['Puca A', 'Russo G', 'Giordano A']","['Sbarro Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, College of Science and Technology, Temple University Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', '*Mechanotransduction, Cellular', 'Protein Transport', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'Weightlessness Simulation']",2012/05/09 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/05/09 06:00'],"['2012/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['472 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.472 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2012 Apr;3(4):426-34. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.472.,,,PMC3380577,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Manipulation of classic ligand-activated nuclear receptors, such as estrogen receptor blockade in breast cancer, is an important established cancer therapy. Orphan nuclear receptors, such as nuclear family 4 subgroup A (NR4A) receptors, have no known natural ligand(s). These elusive receptors are increasingly recognized as molecular switches in cell survival and a molecular link between inflammation and cancer. NR4A receptors act as transcription factors, altering expression of downstream genes in apoptosis (Fas-ligand, TRAIL), proliferation, DNA repair, metabolism, cell migration, inflammation (interleukin-8), and angiogenesis (VEGF). NR4A receptors are modulated by multiple cell-signaling pathways, including protein kinase A/CREB, NF-kappaB, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT, c-jun-NH(2)-kinase, Wnt, and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. NR4A receptor effects are context and tissue specific, influenced by their levels of expression, posttranslational modification, and interaction with other transcription factors (RXR, PPAR-Upsilon). The subcellular location of NR4A ""nuclear receptors"" is also important functionally; novel roles have been described in the cytoplasm where NR4A proteins act both indirectly and directly on the mitochondria to promote apoptosis via Bcl-2. NR4A receptors are implicated in a wide variety of malignancies, including breast, lung, colon, bladder, and prostate cancer; glioblastoma multiforme; sarcoma; and acute and/or chronic myeloid leukemia. NR4A receptors modulate response to conventional chemotherapy and represent an exciting frontier for chemotherapeutic intervention, as novel agents targeting NR4A receptors have now been developed. This review provides a concise clinical overview of current knowledge of NR4A signaling in cancer and the potential for therapeutic manipulation.","['Mohan, Helen M', 'Aherne, Carol M', 'Rogers, Ailin C', 'Baird, Alan W', 'Winter, Des C', 'Murphy, Evelyn P']","['Mohan HM', 'Aherne CM', 'Rogers AC', 'Baird AW', 'Winter DC', 'Murphy EP']","[""UCD Veterinary Sciences Centre, University College Dublin, Department of Surgery, St Vincent's University Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin, Ireland. helen.mohan@gmail.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120507,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (NR4A1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Repair', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Neoplasms/etiology/*metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2012/05/09 06:00,2012/12/21 06:00,['2012/05/09 06:00'],"['2012/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-2953 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2953 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Jun 15;18(12):3223-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2953.

A progressive increase in the incidence of copy number abnormalities (CNA) from MGUS to SMM and to MM (median 5, 7.5 and 12 per case, respectively) was observed (P=0.006).

We conducted a study aimed to determine the frequency of RVI in children with low compared with high risk for invasive bacterial infection (IBI) FN episodes and compare the clinical outcome of RVI and mixed RV-bacterial infections. METHODS: Prospective, multicenter study in children with cancer and FN admitted to pediatric hospitals in Chile between May 2009 and January 2011. Children were evaluated by clinical examination and laboratory tests, including bacterial cultures and their risk for IBI. Nasopharyngeal sample was obtained for the detection of 17 respiratory viruses using polymerase chain reaction-DNA microarray platform. RESULTS: A total of 331 episodes of FN in 193 children were enrolled of whom 55% were male, with the median age of 7 years and 61% had a hematological malignancy. A viral and/or bacterial pathogen was detected in 67% (224/331) episodes. Overall, RVIs were associated with 57% of FN of which one-third were mixed RV-bacterial infections. Bacterial infection was detected in 29% (97/331). Children classified at admission as high risk for IBI had a similar overall proportion of RVI compared with low-risk group. Respiratory syncytial virus (31%) and rhinovirus (23%) were the most frequently detected respiratory viruses, followed by parainfluenza (12%) and influenza A (11%). Children detected with any respiratory virus had fewer days of hospitalization and a significantly lower probability of hypotension and admission to pediatric intensive care unit irrespective of their risk classification status at admission when compared with children with mixed RV-bacterial or bacterial infections (P < 0.05). All children with a sole RVI had favorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: RVIs were the most frequently detected agents irrespective of their initial risk assessment for IBI. The clinical outcome of mixed RVI was similar to sole RVI episodes as well as for bacterial infections compared with mixed viral-bacterial infections. Systematic and early detection of RVI in children with cancer and FN might help to optimize their management by reducing hospitalization and antimicrobial use.","['Torres, Juan P', 'Labrana, Yenis', 'Ibanez, Carolina', 'Kasaneva, Pilar', 'Farfan, Mauricio J', 'De la Maza, Veronica', 'Villarroel, Milena', 'Vergara, Ivonne', 'Piemonte, Paula', 'Zubieta, Marcela', 'Salgado, Carmen', 'Tordecilla, Juan', 'Topelberg, Santiago', 'O Ryan, Miguel', 'Santolaya, Maria E']","['Torres JP', 'Labrana Y', 'Ibanez C', 'Kasaneva P', 'Farfan MJ', 'De la Maza V', 'Villarroel M', 'Vergara I', 'Piemonte P', 'Zubieta M', 'Salgado C', 'Tordecilla J', 'Topelberg S', 'O Ryan M', 'Santolaya ME']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Hospital Luis Calvo Mackenna, Antonio Varas 360, Providencia, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile. jptorres@clc.cl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,,IM,"['Bacterial Infections/epidemiology/microbiology/virology', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chile/epidemiology', 'Coinfection/*epidemiology/microbiology/virology', 'Female', 'Fever/*epidemiology/microbiology/virology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/microbiology/virology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/microbiology/virology', 'Neutropenia/*epidemiology/microbiology/virology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/*epidemiology/microbiology/virology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Virus Diseases/epidemiology/microbiology/virology']",2012/05/09 06:00,2013/01/23 06:00,['2012/05/09 06:00'],"['2012/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/INF.0b013e31825c4b7e [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2012 Sep;31(9):889-93. doi: 10.1097/INF.0b013e31825c4b7e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From May 2002 to August 2009, 111 consecutive patients 1-21 years of age with newly diagnosed ALL received the CCCL ALL protocol which was based on the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Total XV Study. The median age at diagnosis was 5 years 5 months. The male to female ratio was 1.5. Forty-six patients received the intermediate-/high-risk arm and 65 received the low-risk arm. Only one patient (0.9%) died during induction therapy. Relapse occurred in 8 (7.2%) patients. Eight (7.2%) patients died, 4 of whom were in remission.

To overcome the issue of tumor heterogeneity, it is essential to develop assays and tools enabling phenotypic, (epi)genetic and functional identification and characterization of tumor subpopulations that drive specific disease pathologies and represent clinically relevant targets. It is now well established that tumors exhibit distinct sub-fractions of cells with different frequencies of cell division, and that the functional criteria of being slow cycling is positively associated with tumor formation ability in several cancers including those of the brain, breast, skin and pancreas as well as leukemia(2-8). The fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) has been used for tracking the division frequency of cells in vitro and in vivo in blood-borne tumors and solid tumors such as glioblastoma(2,7,8). The cell-permeant non-fluorescent pro-drug of CFSE is converted by intracellular esterases into a fluorescent compound, which is retained within cells by covalently binding to proteins through reaction of its succinimidyl moiety with intracellular amine groups to form stable amide bonds(9). The fluorescent dye is equally distributed between daughter cells upon divisions, leading to the halving of the fluorescence intensity with every cell division. This enables tracking of cell cycle frequency up to eight to ten rounds of division(10). CFSE retention capacity was used with brain tumor cells to identify and isolate a slow cycling subpopulation (top 5% dye-retaining cells) demonstrated to be enriched in cancer stem cell activity(2). This protocol describes the technique of staining cells with CFSE and the isolation of individual populations within a culture of human glioblastoma (GBM)-derived cells possessing differing division rates using flow cytometry(2). The technique has served to identify and isolate a brain tumor slow-cycling population of cells by virtue of their ability to retain the CFSE labeling.","['Deleyrolle, Loic P', 'Rohaus, Mark R', 'Fortin, Jeff M', 'Reynolds, Brent A', 'Azari, Hassan']","['Deleyrolle LP', 'Rohaus MR', 'Fortin JM', 'Reynolds BA', 'Azari H']","['Department of Neurosurgery, The University of Florida, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",20120429,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (5-(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Succinimides)']",IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fluoresceins/*chemistry', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*chemistry', 'Glioblastoma/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Staining and Labeling/*methods', 'Succinimides/*chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/05/09 06:00,2012/07/21 06:00,['2012/05/09 06:00'],"['2012/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['3918 [pii]', '10.3791/3918 [doi]']",epublish,J Vis Exp. 2012 Apr 29;(62). pii: 3918. doi: 10.3791/3918.,,"['R21 CA141020/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R21CA141020-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3466660,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Metallothionein, a heavy-metal-scavenging antioxidant, protects against cardiac anomalies. This study was designed to examine the impact of metallothionein on cold exposure-induced myocardial dysfunction, intracellular Ca(2+) derangement, fibrosis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and apoptosis. Echocardiography, cardiomyocyte function, and Masson trichrome staining were evaluated in Friend virus B (FVB) and cardiac-specific metallothionein transgenic mice after cold exposure (3 months, 4 degrees C). Cold exposure increased plasma levels of norepinephrine, endothelin-1, and TGF-beta; reduced plasma NO levels and cardiac antioxidant capacity; enlarged ventricular end-systolic diameter; compromised fractional shortening; promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis; and suppressed the ER stress markers Bip, calregulin, and phospho-eIF2alpha, accompanied by cardiac fibrosis and elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinases and Smad-2/3 in FVB mice. Cold exposure-induced echocardiographic, histological, ER stress, ROS, apoptotic, and fibrotic signaling changes (but not plasma markers) were greatly improved by metallothionein. In vitro metallothionein induction by zinc chloride ablated H(2)O(2)- but not TGF-beta-induced cell proliferation in fibroblasts. In summary, our data suggest that metallothionein protects against cold exposure-induced cardiac anomalies possibly through attenuation of myocardial fibrosis.","['Zhang, Yingmei', 'Hu, Nan', 'Hua, Yinan', 'Richmond, Kacy L', 'Dong, Feng', 'Ren, Jun']","['Zhang Y', 'Hu N', 'Hua Y', 'Richmond KL', 'Dong F', 'Ren J']","[""Department of Cardiology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710032, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120505,United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Endothelin-1)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '9038-94-2 (Metallothionein)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'X4W3ENH1CV (Norepinephrine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cold Temperature/adverse effects', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress', 'Endothelin-1/blood', 'Fibroblasts/*metabolism/pathology', 'Fibrosis/diagnostic imaging/etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Male', 'Metallothionein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Myocardial Contraction', 'Myocardium/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*metabolism/pathology', 'Norepinephrine/blood', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/blood', 'Ultrasonography']",2012/05/09 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/05/09 06:00'],"['2011/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0891-5849(12)00202-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.04.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2012 Jul 15;53(2):194-207. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2012.04.005.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 2,560 patients (younger than age 61 years) without core-binding factor abnormalities including 305 patients with MK-AML receiving first-line induction treatment, 1,975 patients (77%) achieved remission, and 1,588 received consolidation in the first complete remission (CR1) after two induction cycles. Consolidation treatment of 107 patients with MK-AML consisted of alloHSCT (n = 45), chemotherapy (n = 48), or autologous HSCT (n = 14). RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival after start of consolidation was 19% for patients with MK-AML who received alloHSCT and 9% for those who received chemotherapy or autoHSCT (P = .02). Relapse-free survival (RFS) at 5 years was 17% versus 7% (P = .003). Cox regression analysis was performed with alloHSCT as a time-dependent covariate. Hazard ratios (HRs) associated with alloHSCT for relapse and RFS were 0.30 (95% CI, 0.24 to 0.37; P < .001), and 0.52 (95% CI, 0.43 to 0.62; P < .001), respectively. HRs were similar in MK-AML and the other cytogenetic subgroups. CONCLUSION: AlloHSCT, applied as consolidation in CR1, is associated with a significant reduction of relapse and improvement of survival in MK-AML, with the same relative reduction of relapse or death as in other cytogenetic risk categories.","['Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Breems, Dimitri', 'van Putten, Wim L J', 'Gratwohl, Alois A', 'Passweg, Jakob R', 'Pabst, Thomas', 'Maertens, Johan', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'van Marwijk Kooy, Marinus', 'Wijermans, Pierre W', 'Biemond, Bart J', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Verdonck, Leo F', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Lowenberg, Bob']","['Cornelissen JJ', 'Breems D', 'van Putten WL', 'Gratwohl AA', 'Passweg JR', 'Pabst T', 'Maertens J', 'Beverloo HB', 'van Marwijk Kooy M', 'Wijermans PW', 'Biemond BJ', 'Vellenga E', 'Verdonck LF', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Lowenberg B']","['Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. j.cornelissen@erasmusmc.nl']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20120507,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cytogenetics/*methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/05/09 06:00,2012/08/24 06:00,['2012/05/09 06:00'],"['2012/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.39.6499 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.39.6499 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Jun 10;30(17):2140-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.39.6499.

Nonadherence to oral MP could increase relapse risk and also contribute to inferior outcome in Hispanics. This study identified determinants of adherence and described impact of adherence on relapse, both overall and by ethnicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 327 children with ALL (169 Hispanic; 158 non-Hispanic white) participated. Medication event-monitoring system caps recorded date and time of MP bottle openings. Adherence rate, calculated monthly, was defined as ratio of days of MP bottle opening to days when MP was prescribed. RESULTS: After 53,394 person-days of monitoring, adherence declined from 94.7% (month 1) to 90.2% (month 6; P < .001). Mean adherence over 6 months was significantly lower among Hispanics (88.4% v 94.8%; P < .001), patients age >/= 12 years (85.8% v 93.1%; P < .001), and patients from single-mother households (80.6% v 93.1%; P = .001). A progressive increase in relapse was observed with decreasing adherence (reference: adherence >/= 95%; 94.9% to 90%: hazard ratio [HR], 4.1; 95% CI,1.2 to 13.5; P = .02; 89.9% to 85%: HR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.0 to 15.5; P = .04; < 85%: HR. 5.7; 95% CI, 1.9 to 16.8; P = .002). Cumulative incidence of relapse (+/- standard deviation) was higher among Hispanics (16.5% +/- 4.0% v 6.3% +/- 2.2%; P = .02). Association between Hispanic ethnicity and relapse (HR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 6.1; P = .02) became nonsignificant (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 0.6 to 5.2; P = .26) after adjusting for adherence and socioeconomic status. At adherence rates >/= 90%, Hispanics continued to demonstrate higher relapse, whereas at rates < 90%, relapse risk was comparable to that of non-Hispanic whites. CONCLUSION: Lower adherence to oral MP increases relapse risk. Ethnic difference in relapse risk differs by level of adherence-an observation currently under investigation.","['Bhatia, Smita', 'Landier, Wendy', 'Shangguan, Muyun', 'Hageman, Lindsey', 'Schaible, Alexandra N', 'Carter, Andrea R', 'Hanby, Cara L', 'Leisenring, Wendy', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Kornegay, Nancy M', 'Mascarenhas, Leo', 'Ritchey, A Kim', 'Casillas, Jacqueline N', 'Dickens, David S', 'Meza, Jane', 'Carroll, William L', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Wong, F Lennie']","['Bhatia S', 'Landier W', 'Shangguan M', 'Hageman L', 'Schaible AN', 'Carter AR', 'Hanby CL', 'Leisenring W', 'Yasui Y', 'Kornegay NM', 'Mascarenhas L', 'Ritchey AK', 'Casillas JN', 'Dickens DS', 'Meza J', 'Carroll WL', 'Relling MV', 'Wong FL']","['City of Hope, Duarte, CA 91010-3000, USA. sbhatia@coh.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120507,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)'],IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Medication Adherence', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/ethnology', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Time Factors', 'United States']",2012/05/09 06:00,2012/08/24 06:00,['2012/05/09 06:00'],"['2012/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.38.9924 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.38.9924 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Jun 10;30(17):2094-101. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.38.9924.

Current methods for accurately measuring ZAP-70 expression are problematic, preventing widespread application of these tests in clinical decision making. We therefore used comprehensive DNA methylation profiling of the ZAP-70 regulatory region to identify sites important for transcriptional control. PATIENTS AND METHODS: High-resolution quantitative DNA methylation analysis of the entire ZAP-70 gene regulatory regions was conducted on 247 samples from patients with CLL from four independent clinical studies. RESULTS: Through this comprehensive analysis, we identified a small area in the 5' regulatory region of ZAP-70 that showed large variability in methylation in CLL samples but was universally methylated in normal B cells. High correlation with mRNA and protein expression, as well as activity in promoter reporter assays, revealed that within this differentially methylated region, a single CpG dinucleotide and neighboring nucleotides are particularly important in ZAP-70 transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, by using clustering approaches, we identified a prognostic role for this site in four independent data sets of patients with CLL using time to treatment, progression-free survival, and overall survival as clinical end points. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive quantitative DNA methylation analysis of the ZAP-70 gene in CLL identified important regions responsible for transcriptional regulation. In addition, loss of methylation at a specific single CpG dinucleotide in the ZAP-70 5' regulatory sequence is a highly predictive and reproducible biomarker of poor prognosis in this disease.

This signal transduction cascade regulates a wide range of physiological cell processes, that include differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, metabolism, motility, and exocytosis. However, constitutively active PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling characterizes many types of tumors where it negatively influences response to therapeutic treatments. Hence, targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling with small molecule inhibitors may improve cancer patient outcome. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling cascade is overactive in acute leukemias, where it correlates with enhanced drug-resistance and poor prognosis. The catalytic sites of PI3K and mTOR share a high degree of sequence homology. This feature has allowed the synthesis of ATP-competitive compounds targeting the catalytic site of both kinases. In preclinical models, dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors displayed a much stronger cytotoxicity against acute leukemia cells than either PI3K inhibitors or allosteric mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin. At variance with rapamycin, dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors targeted both mTOR complex 1 and mTOR complex 2, and inhibited the rapamycin-resistant phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, resulting in a marked inhibition of oncogenic protein translation.

However, their clinical impact on HSCT outcomes is controversial due to complexity of KIR haplotypes, genotypes, and phenotypes as well as their diversity among patient populations. The present study investigated the role of KIR-ligand interactions in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling transplants. METHODS: The recipient cohort, which included patients diagnosed with aplastic anemia, acute leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome, received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells. HLA typing was performed using polymerase chain reaction - sequence specific oligo probes (PCR-SSO). The KIR genotype of the donors and the ligands C1 (Asparagine 80), C2 (Lysine 80), and Bw4 recipient typings were performed using polymerase chain reaction - sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP). We assessed acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse, and overall survival. RESULTS: While 84.5% of donors carried a Bx KIR, 15.5% carried the AA haplotype. The effect of a recipient's lack of ligands among 88.5% of cases was associated with 39% of subjects developing GvHD. Lack of C1 may lead to manifestations of acute GvHD and lack of C2 to manifestation of chronic GvHD. The presence of both C1 and C2 seemed to be protective against both forms of GvHD. The role of two Bw4 alleles, threonine (T) or isoleucine (I) at position 80, was evaluated. 73% of recipients who carried Bw4 80(I) versus 27% with the Bw4 80(T) allele. The presence of Bw4-80(T) allele appeared to reduce the risk of GvHD, indicating its stronger inhibitory effect than its 80(I) counterpart. CONCLUSION: KIR-ligand interactions influenced HSCT outcomes.","['Kanga, U', 'Mourya, M', 'Seth, T', 'George, J', 'Sood, P', 'Sharma, R', 'Saxena, A', 'Mehra, N K']","['Kanga U', 'Mourya M', 'Seth T', 'George J', 'Sood P', 'Sharma R', 'Saxena A', 'Mehra NK']","['Department of Transplant Immunology and Immunogenetics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. umakanga@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Transplant Proc,Transplantation proceedings,0243532,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/immunology/mortality/*surgery', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'Haplotypes', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/mortality', '*Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Testing/methods', 'Humans', 'India', 'Leukemia/immunology/mortality/*surgery', 'Ligands', '*Living Donors', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/mortality/*surgery', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, KIR/genetics/*immunology', 'Recurrence', '*Siblings', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/05/09 06:00,2012/09/05 06:00,['2012/05/09 06:00'],"['2012/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0041-1345(12)00256-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.transproceed.2012.03.036 [doi]']",ppublish,Transplant Proc. 2012 May;44(4):919-21. doi: 10.1016/j.transproceed.2012.03.036.,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

OBJECTIVES: This report evaluates the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of dasatinib, nilotinib and high-dose imatinib within their licensed indications for the treatment of people with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) who are resistant to standard-dose imatinib. DATA SOURCES: Bibliographic databases were searched from inception to January 2011, including The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), and MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations. Bibliographies of related papers were screened, key conferences were searched, and experts were contacted to identify additional published and unpublished references. REVIEW METHODS: This report includes systematic reviews of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness studies, an independent appraisal of information submitted by drug manufacturers to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), an independent appraisal of the PenTAG economic evaluation, and new economic analyses adapting the PenTAG economic model. Standard systematic procedures involving two reviewers to maintain impartiality and transparency, and to minimise bias, were conducted. RESULTS: Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Four of these studies included new data published since the PenTAG report; all of these were in chronic-phase CML. No relevant studies on the clinical effectiveness of nilotinib were found. The clinical effectiveness studies on dasatinib [one arm of a randomised controlled trial (RCT)] and high-dose imatinib (one arm of a RCT and three single-arm cohort studies) had major methodological limitations. These limitations precluded a comparison of the different arms within the RCT. Data from the studies are summarised in this report, but caution in interpretation is required. One economic evaluation was identified that compared dasatinib with high-dose imatinib in patients with chronic-phase CML who were CML resistant to standard-dose imatinib. Two industry submissions and the PenTAG economic evaluation were critiqued and differences in the assumptions and results were identified. The PenTAG economic model was adapted and new analyses conducted for the interventions dasatinib, nilotinib and high-dose imatinib and the comparators interferon alfa, standard-dose imatinib, stem cell transplantation and hydroxycarbamide. The results suggest that the three interventions, dasatinib, nilotinib and high-dose imatinib, have similar costs and cost-effectiveness compared with hydroxycarbamide, with a cost-effectiveness of around pound30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. However, it is not possible to derive firm conclusions about the relative cost-effectiveness of the three interventions owing to great uncertainty around data inputs. Uncertainty was explored using deterministic sensitivity analyses, threshold analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. LIMITATIONS: The paucity of good-quality evidence should be considered when interpreting this report. CONCLUSIONS: This review has identified very limited new information on clinical effectiveness of the interventions over that already shown in the PenTAG report. Limitations in the data exist; however, the results of single-arm studies suggest that the interventions can lead to improvements in haematological and cytogenetic responses in people with imatinib-resistant CML. The economic analyses do not highlight any one of the interventions as being the most cost-effective; however, the analysis results are highly uncertain owing to lack of agreement on appropriate assumptions. Recommendations for future research made by PenTAG, for a good-quality RCT comparing the three treatments remain.","['Loveman, E', 'Cooper, K', 'Bryant, J', 'Colquitt, J L', 'Frampton, G K', 'Clegg, A']","['Loveman E', 'Cooper K', 'Bryant J', 'Colquitt JL', 'Frampton GK', 'Clegg A']","['Southampton Health Technology Assessments Centre (SHTAC), University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,England,Health Technol Assess,"Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)",9706284,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Dasatinib', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/economics', 'Models, Economic', 'Piperazines/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Thiazoles/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United Kingdom']",2012/05/09 06:00,2012/09/12 06:00,['2012/05/09 06:00'],"['2012/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3310/hta16230 [doi]'],ppublish,"Health Technol Assess. 2012;16(23):iii-xiii, 1-137. doi: 10.3310/hta16230.",,,PMC4781455,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we have evaluated the relationship between linear bone growth during chemotherapy for ALL and bone derived C-type Natriuretic Peptide (CNP). CNP is known to be critical to normal endochondral bone growth in both rodents and humans, and plasma concentration of the amino terminal pro CNP (NTproCNP) is strongly correlated with concurrent height velocity in children. Plasma NTproCNP and CNP were measured by radio-immunoassay in 12 children aged 2-9 years during induction and maintenance chemotherapy for children with ALL. Height velocity was calculated from stadiometer readings at intervals of 3-12 months and related to plasma NTproCNP during each growth interval. Plasma NTproCNP was markedly suppressed in all subjects during induction chemotherapy. Brief periods of NTproCNP decline and rapid rebound during maintenance treatment coincided with the use of dexamethasone but not with other chemotherapeutics. Height velocity was markedly reduced during ALL induction but unaffected in maintenance phase, and these changes in growth were strongly correlated with plasma NTproCNP concentration. Plasma NTproCNP has potential use as a biomarker of glucocorticoid-induced bone toxicity.","['Prickett, Timothy C R', 'Lyver, Amanda', 'Wilson, Rachel', 'Espiner, Eric A', 'Sullivan, Michael J']","['Prickett TC', 'Lyver A', 'Wilson R', 'Espiner EA', 'Sullivan MJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of Otago, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand. tim.prickett@otago.ac.nz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120427,United States,Peptides,Peptides,8008690,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (glutamyl-lysyl-alanyl-histidyl-aspartyl-glycyl-glycyl-arginine)', '127869-51-6 (Natriuretic Peptide, C-Type)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Body Height/drug effects', 'Bone Development/*drug effects', 'Bone and Bones/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Collagen/blood', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Natriuretic Peptide, C-Type/blood', 'Peptide Fragments/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies']",2012/05/09 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/05/09 06:00'],"['2012/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/20 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0196-9781(12)00200-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.peptides.2012.04.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Peptides. 2012 Jul;36(1):54-9. doi: 10.1016/j.peptides.2012.04.017.

Diethyl maleate (DEM) is known to conjugate with GSH and rapidly lower cellular GSH levels. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of DEM-induced GSH depletion on various genotoxicity and gene expression end points in mouse lymphoma L5178Y (TK(+/-)) cell cultures. Cells were exposed to DEM for 4 h at concentrations of 0, 6.7, 13.5, 26.9, 53.8, 107.6, 215.3, and 430.6 microg/mL (0.039-2.5 mM). Genotoxicity was evaluated by examining the induction of in vitro micronuclei (20 h post-treatment) and DNA strand breaks as measured by comet (immediately following treatment), and correlating these observations to cellular GSH levels. In the current study, GSH was decreased more than 50% at the lowest test concentration (6.7 microg/mL) and more than 95% at >/= 107.6 microg/mL. A significant increase in micronuclei and DNA strand breaks was observed at concentrations of >/= 26.9 microg/mL. Gene expression of seven apoptosis and oxidative-stress related genes showed significant alterations in only three genes only at the highest test concentration. Quantifiable levels of 8-OH-dG (>/= 2 adducts per 1 x 10(8) NT) were not detected at any treatment concentration.

Increasing numbers of studies have been carried out on the association of MDM2 T309G polymorphism with susceptibility to leukemia and have generated conflicting results. The aim of the present study was to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship. Meta-analyses assessing the association of MDM2 T309G variation with leukemia were conducted. Separate analyses on ethnicity and clinical types were also performed. Eligible studies were identified for the period up to February 2012. Consequently, seven publications including eight case-control studies with 1777 cases and 5482 controls were selected for analysis. The overall data indicated a significant association of the MDM2 T309G polymorphism with leukemia risk (GG vs. TT: odds ratio [OR] = 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.14-2.29; dominant model: OR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.06-1.36; recessive model: OR = 1.47; 95% CI = 1.07-2.03). In subgroup analysis by ethnicity, the G allele may increase leukemia susceptibility among Asians (GG vs. TT: OR = 3.06; 95% CI = 2.05-4.56; dominant model: OR = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.31-2.51; recessive model: OR = 2.32; 95% CI = 1.69-3.19) but not Caucasians. In subgroup analysis by clinical types, data suggested increased risk for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) under additive and recessive models, respectively. Similarly, elevated risk for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was shown under the dominant model. Collectively, the results of the present study suggest that MDM2 T309G polymorphism might be a low-penetrant risk factor for leukemia among Asians but not Caucasians. The G allele might increase CLL susceptibility and homozygous GG might elevate AML and CML risk.","['Zhuo, Wenlei', 'Zhang, Liang', 'Ling, Junjun', 'Zhu, Bo', 'Chen, Zhengtang']","['Zhuo W', 'Zhang L', 'Ling J', 'Zhu B', 'Chen Z']","['Th ird Military Medical University, Chongqing, China. zhuowenlei@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20120612,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*genetics', 'Publication Bias', 'Risk']",2012/05/09 06:00,2013/06/20 06:00,['2012/05/09 06:00'],"['2012/05/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.691485 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Nov;53(11):2245-52. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.691485.

The enzyme removes purine bases from the messenger RNAs of the retroviruses Human immunodeficiency virus-1 and Human T-cell leukemia virus-1. This depurination reduces viral protein synthesis by stalling elongating ribosomes at nucleotides with a missing base. Here, we transiently expressed PAP in cells with a proviral clone of HIV-1 to examine the effect of the protein on virus production and quality. PAP reduced virus production by approximately 450-fold, as measured by p24 ELISA of media containing virions, which correlated with a substantial decline in virus protein synthesis in cells. However, particles released from PAP-expressing cells were approximately 7-fold more infectious, as determined by single-cycle infection of 1G5 cells and productive infection of MT2 cells. This increase in infectivity was not likely due to changes in the processing of HIV-1 polyproteins, RNA packaging efficiency or maturation of virus. Rather, expression of PAP activated the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway to a limited extent, resulting in increased phosphorylation of viral p17 matrix protein. The increase in infectivity of HIV-1 particles produced from PAP-expressing cells was compensated by the reduction in virus number; that is, virus production decreased upon de novo infection of cells over time. However, our findings emphasize the importance of investigating the influence of heterologous protein expression upon host cells when assessing their potential for antiviral applications.","['Mansouri, Sheila', 'Kutky, Meherzad', 'Hudak, Katalin A']","['Mansouri S', 'Kutky M', 'Hudak KA']","['Department of Biology, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120501,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (HIV Antigens)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (p17 protein, Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (pokeweed antiviral protein)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HIV Antigens/metabolism', 'HIV-1/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Jurkat Cells', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phytolacca/metabolism', 'Plant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Virion/growth & development/metabolism', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/metabolism']",2012/05/09 06:00,2012/09/22 06:00,['2012/05/08 06:00'],"['2012/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0036369 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-03487 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e36369. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0036369.

We identified a homolog of HMGB1 in the Japanese lamprey (Lampetra japonica). The Lampetra japonica HMGB1 gene (Lj-HMGB1) has over 70% sequence identity with its homologs in jawed vertebrates. Despite the reasonably high sequence identity with other HMGB1 proteins, Lj-HMGB1 did not group together with these proteins in a phylogenetic analysis. We examined Lj-HMGB1 expression in lymphocyte-like cells, and the kidneys, heart, gills, and intestines of lampreys before and after the animals were challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and concanavalin A (ConA). Lj-HMGB1 was initially expressed at a higher level in the heart, but after treatment with LPS and ConA only the gills demonstrated a significant up-regulation of expression. The recombinant Lj-HMGB1 (rLj-HMGB1) protein bound double-stranded DNA and induced the proliferation of human adenocarcinoma cells to a similar extent as human HMGB1. We further revealed that Lj-HMGB1 was able to induce the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a pro-inflammatory mediator, in activated human acute monocytic leukemia cells. These results suggest that lampreys use HMGB1 to activate their innate immunity for the purpose of pathogen defense.","['Pang, Yue', 'Xiao, Rong', 'Liu, Xin', 'Li, Qingwei']","['Pang Y', 'Xiao R', 'Liu X', 'Li Q']","['Institute of Marine Genomics and Proteomics, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120426,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (HMGB1 Protein)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Concanavalin A/toxicity', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Gills/drug effects/metabolism', 'HMGB1 Protein/classification/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Lampreys/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/toxicity', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2012/05/09 06:00,2012/09/18 06:00,['2012/05/08 06:00'],"['2011/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0035755 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-19792 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e35755. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0035755.

The invariant chain (Ii)-derived peptide CLIP is required for HLA-II-mediated antigen presentation by stabilizing HLA-II molecules before antigen loading through transient and promiscuous binding to different HLA-II peptide grooves. Here, we demonstrate alternative binding of CLIP to surface HLA-I molecules on leukemic cells. In HLA-II-negative AML cells, we found plasma membrane display of the CLIP peptide. Silencing Ii in AML cells resulted in reduced HLA-I cell surface display, which indicated a direct role of CLIP in the HLA-I antigen presentation pathway. In HLA-I-specific peptide eluates from B-LCLs, five Ii-derived peptides were identified, of which two were from the CLIP region. In vitro peptide binding assays strikingly revealed that the eluted CLIP peptide RMATPLLMQALPM efficiently bound to four distinct HLA-I supertypes (-A2, -B7, -A3, -B40). Furthermore, shorter length variants of this CLIP peptide also bound to these four supertypes, although in silico algorithms only predicted binding to HLA-A2 or -B7. Immunization of HLA-A2 transgenic mice with these peptides did not induce CTL responses. Together these data show a remarkable promiscuity of CLIP for binding to a wide variety of HLA-I molecules. The found participation of CLIP in the HLA-I antigen presentation pathway could reflect an aberrant mechanism in leukemic cells, but might also lead to elucidation of novel processing pathways or immune escape mechanisms.","['van Luijn, Marvin M', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A', 'Lampen, Margit H', 'van Veelen, Peter A', 'Zevenbergen, Adri', 'Kester, Michel G D', 'de Ru, Arnoud H', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'van Hall, Thorbald', 'van Ham, S Marieke']","['van Luijn MM', 'van de Loosdrecht AA', 'Lampen MH', 'van Veelen PA', 'Zevenbergen A', 'Kester MG', 'de Ru AH', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'van Hall T', 'van Ham SM']","['Department of Hematology, VU Institute for Cancer and Immunology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. m.luijn@vumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120426,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (HLA-B7 Antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (invariant chain)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigen Presentation/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'HLA-B7 Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Protein Binding']",2012/05/09 06:00,2012/09/18 06:00,['2012/05/08 06:00'],"['2011/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0034649 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-11011 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e34649. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0034649.

He presented with sudden onset headache, vomiting and hypertension followed by seizures, unconsciousness, and involuntary movements. Computed tomography scan revealed bilateral cerebellar hypodensities. He improved within few hours and reversibility of the lesions was documented on magnetic resonance imaging after 2 weeks. Awareness of atypical patterns in distribution of imaging abnormalities is important to recognize PRES more accurately and to avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures and treatment.","['Chaudhary, Narendra', 'Majeed, Rubeena', 'Borker, Anupama']","['Chaudhary N', 'Majeed R', 'Borker A']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal University, Manipal, Karnataka, India.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],,Germany,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol,Indian journal of medical and paediatric oncology : official journal of Indian Society of Medical & Paediatric Oncology,9604571,,,,2012/05/09 06:00,2012/05/09 06:01,['2012/05/08 06:00'],"['2012/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0971-5851.95143 [doi]', 'IJMPO-32-211 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol. 2011 Oct;32(4):211-3. doi: 10.4103/0971-5851.95143.,,,PMC3343248,,['NOTNLM'],"['Isolated cerebellar involvement', 'posterior reversible encephalopathy', 'reversible occipito-parietal leukoencephalopathy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate oocyte quality, parthenogenetic activation of the oocytes recovered from in vitro grown preantral follicles was performed. Preantral follicles >110 mum in diameter were isolated and cultured for 18 days in basic medium either alone (control) or supplemented with LIF (10 or 50 ng/mL) in the absence or presence of FSH. Every 6 days the follicular survival, growth, and antrum formation were evaluated. When compared to control (P < .05), antrum formation was increased in follicles cultured in the presence of LIF10 and FSH. At the end of the culture, the oocytes underwent in vitro maturation (IVM); their viability and chromatin configuration were assessed. Although IVM was not affect by the treatments (P > .05), the numerically highest maturation rates (29.63%) were obtained when follicles were cultured in 50 ng/mL LIF (LIF50). Therefore, their oocytes were submitted to parthenogenetic activation; from which 58.3% of the mature oocytes resulted in 8-cell stage parthenotes. In conclusion, although LIF10 + FSH increases antrum formation when compared to a nonsupplemented medium (minimum essential medium), oocytes from sheep preantral follicles are capable of growing and maturing in vitro independent of LIF addition to the medium, which resulted in the formation of 8-cell parthenotes.","['Luz, V B', 'Araujo, V R', 'Duarte, A B G', 'Celestino, J J H', 'Silva, T F P', 'Magalhaes-Padilha, D M', 'Chaves, R N', 'Brito, I R', 'Almeida, A P', 'Campello, C C', 'Feltrin, C', 'Bertolini, M', 'Santos, R R', 'Figueiredo, J R']","['Luz VB', 'Araujo VR', 'Duarte AB', 'Celestino JJ', 'Silva TF', 'Magalhaes-Padilha DM', 'Chaves RN', 'Brito IR', 'Almeida AP', 'Campello CC', 'Feltrin C', 'Bertolini M', 'Santos RR', 'Figueiredo JR']","['Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias Veterinarias, Laboratorio de Manipulacao de Oocitos e Foliculos Pre-Antrais, State University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120504,United States,Reprod Sci,"Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)",101291249,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Culture Media', 'Female', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Oocytes/drug effects/growth & development/*physiology', 'Ovarian Follicle/*cytology/drug effects/*growth & development', '*Parthenogenesis', '*Sheep', 'Tissue Culture Techniques/veterinary']",2012/05/09 06:00,2013/03/15 06:00,['2012/05/08 06:00'],"['2012/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1933719112446072 [pii]', '10.1177/1933719112446072 [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Sci. 2012 Nov;19(11):1219-25. doi: 10.1177/1933719112446072.

METHODS: RNA expression of CBR1 and CBR3, intracellular daunorubicin and DOL levels, and in vitro cytotoxicity of daunorubicin were measured in bone marrow mononuclear cells of 104 adult AML patients. Plasma pharmacokinetics of daunorubicin and DOL was measured in 24 patients receiving daunorubicin-based induction chemotherapy for AML. RESULTS: Increased expression of CBR1 significantly reduced the in vitro cytotoxicity of daunorubicin and also positively correlated with intracellular DOL levels. Polymorphisms in CBR1 and CBR3 did not show any association with intracellular daunorubicin or DOL levels, but there was a trend towards significant increase in plasma daunorubicin systemic exposure in patients with a variant genotype for CBR1 polymorphism rs25678. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that CBR1 RNA expression may be helpful in identifying AML patients at risk of developing resistance or toxicity to daunorubicin due to increased formation of DOL. Further confirmation of these findings in a larger sample pool would be required to determine the applicability of these results. Inhibition of CBR1 can be an option to improve the efficacy and prevent toxicity related to the treatment. Influence of daunorubicin and DOL plasma levels on clinical outcome, if any, remains to be evaluated.","['Varatharajan, Savitha', 'Abraham, Ajay', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Shaji, R V', 'Ahmed, Rayaz', 'Abraham, Aby', 'George, Biju', 'Srivastava, Alok', 'Chandy, Mammen', 'Mathews, Vikram', 'Balasubramanian, Poonkuzhali']","['Varatharajan S', 'Abraham A', 'Zhang W', 'Shaji RV', 'Ahmed R', 'Abraham A', 'George B', 'Srivastava A', 'Chandy M', 'Mathews V', 'Balasubramanian P']","['Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, 632004, India.']",['eng'],"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120505,Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.184 (CBR1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.184 (CBR3 protein, human)', 'YDU8YIP30L (daunorubicinol)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alcohol Oxidoreductases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/blood/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2012/05/09 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/05/08 06:00'],"['2011/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00228-012-1291-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2012 Dec;68(12):1577-86. doi: 10.1007/s00228-012-1291-9.

New, highly selective inhibitors of BRAF and MEK1/2 have shown promise in clinical trials, including in previously intractable diseases such as melanoma. However, drug-resistant tumour cells invariably emerge leading to disease progression. It is important to understand the mechanisms underlying such acquired resistance since this may lead to the development of rational strategies either to delay its onset or to overcome it once established. It also offers unique insights into the plasticity of signalling pathways, which may in turn inform our understanding of the basic biology of these pathways and lead to the validation of new drug targets.

No randomized comparative data exist to suggest the superiority of reduced-toxicity allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (RT-allo-HCT) over conventional chemo-(immuno) therapy (CCIT). By using estimates from a systematic review and by meta-analysis of available published evidence, we constructed a Markov decision model to examine these competing modalities. Cohort analysis demonstrated superior outcome for RT-allo-HCT, with a 10-month overall life expectancy (and 6-month quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE)) advantage over CCIT. Although the model was sensitive to changes in base-case assumptions and transition probabilities, RT-allo-HCT provided superior overall life expectancy through a range of values supported by the meta-analysis. QALE was superior for RT-allo-HCT compared with CCIT. This conclusion was sensitive to change in the anticipated state utility associated with the post-allogeneic HCT state; however, RT-allo-HCT remained the optimal strategy for values supported by existing literature. This analysis provides a quantitative comparison of outcomes between RT-allo-HCT and CCIT for relapsed/refractory CLL in the absence of randomized comparative trials. Confirmation of these findings requires a prospective randomized trial, which compares the most effective RT-allo-HCT and CCIT regimens for relapsed/refractory CLL.","['Kharfan-Dabaja, M A', 'Pidala, J', 'Kumar, A', 'Terasawa, T', 'Djulbegovic, B']","['Kharfan-Dabaja MA', 'Pidala J', 'Kumar A', 'Terasawa T', 'Djulbegovic B']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.

Chromosomal alterations and mutation of FLT3 (FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3) tyrosine kinase receptor are the frequent genetic alterations in acute myeloid leukemia. However, the prognostic significance of FLT3 mutations in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is not firmly established. METHODS: In this study, the chromosomal abnormalities were analyzed by bone marrow cytogenetic in 45 APL patients and FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITD) screening by fragment length analysis and FLT3 D835 mutation by melting curve analysis were screened in 23 APL samples. RESULTS: Cytogenetic study showed 14.3% trisomy 8 and 17.1% chromosomal abnormalities other than t(15;17). About 13% of the patients had FLT3 ITD, and 26% had D835 point mutation. FLT3 ITD mutation was associated with higher white blood cell count at presentation and poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: The PML-RARA translocation alone may not be sufficient to induce leukemia. Therefore, we assume that FLT3 mutations and the other genetic and chromosomal alterations may cooperate with PML-RARA in the development of APL disease.","['Yaghmaie, Marjan', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Mozdarani, Hossein', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir', 'Hajhashemi, Marjan', 'Aznab, Mozaffar', 'Ghaffari, Seyed H']","['Yaghmaie M', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Mozdarani H', 'Ghavamzadeh A', 'Hajhashemi M', 'Aznab M', 'Ghaffari SH']","['Dept. of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modarres University, P.

A total of 32 patients were included in this study. Among them, 19 were male and 13 were female and the age of the patients ranges from 15-60 years. We use High Dose Cytosine Arabinoside 1.5-2.5 g/m2 i.v, 12 hourly, over 2-3 hours on day 1, 3 and 5 in a 28 days cycle. This study was done during the period of April 2007 to March 2009 in the department of hematology, Dhaka Medical College & Hospital. History, clinical features and laboratory investigations were included. Among 32 patients, 5 patients (15.6%) received one cycle, 20 patients (62.5%) received two cycles and 7 patients (21.9%) received three cycles. The mean +/- SD duration of remission (disease free survival) was 5.20 +/- 3.83 months who received one cycle, 9.55 +/- 3.30 months and 10.71 +/- 1.70 months who received two cycles and three cycles respectively. The adverse effects of the therapy were neutropenia and neutropenic fever, purpuric rash, gum bleeding, mucositis and peripheral neuropathy. The supportive materials needed were antibiotics (both prophylactic and treatment) 86.13%, blood and blood products 51.7% and G-CSF 14.9% patients of all cycles. High Dose Ara-C (HiDAC) is a safe and cost effective consolidation treatment for AML patients in complete remission.

In cancer-free individuals, frequency increased with age, from 0.23% under 50 years to 1.91% between 75 and 79 years (P = 4.8 x 10(-8)). Mosaic abnormalities were more frequent in individuals with solid tumors (0.97% versus 0.74% in cancer-free individuals; odds ratio (OR) = 1.25; P = 0.016), with stronger association with cases who had DNA collected before diagnosis or treatment (OR = 1.45; P = 0.0005). Detectable mosaicism was also more common in individuals for whom DNA was collected at least 1 year before diagnosis with leukemia compared to cancer-free individuals (OR = 35.4; P = 3.8 x 10(-11)).

[(18)F]-3 was prepared by McMurry cyclization of a (18)F-labeled intermediate with low valent titanium and zinc via a two-step procedure in a remote controlled synthesizer unit including HPLC purification and solid phase extraction. In this way [(18)F]-3 was synthesized in 80 min synthesis time in 10% total decay corrected yield from [(18)F]fluoride in radiochemical purity >98% and a specific activity of 74-91 GBq/mumol (EOS). [(18)F]-3 was evaluated in vitro using pro-inflammatory stimulated THP-1 and COX-2 expressing tumor cell lines (FaDu, A2058, HT-29), where the radiotracer uptake was shown to be consistent with up regulated COX-2 expression. The stability of [(18)F]-3 was determined by incubation in rat whole blood and plasma in vitro and by metabolite analysis of arterial blood samples in vivo, showing with 75% of original compound after 60 min an acceptable high metabolic stability. However, no substantial tumor accumulation of [(18)F]-3 could be observed by dynamic small animal PET studies on HT-29 tumor-bearing mice in vivo. This may be due to the only moderate COX-1/COX-2 selectivity of 3 as demonstrated by both cellular and enzymatic cyclooxygenase inhibition assay in vitro.

A few novel lipophilic analogues have recently been synthesized by conjugating a pyridinol core with the phytyl side chain of alpha-tocopherol; these have been shown to possess potent antioxidant activity. However, the complexity of the synthetic routes has hampered their further development. Herein, we describe a facile approach, involving only five synthetic steps, to simplified analogues (1a-1c) and their acetate ester precursors (2a-2c). Simple alkyl chains of different lengths were attached to the 6-methyl group of the antioxidant core via regioselective metalation. These analogues were found to retain biological activity and exhibit protective behaviour under conditions of induced oxidative stress, which could lead to the development of more readily accessible analogues as potential antioxidants capable of preserving mitochondrial function.","['Cai, Xiaoqing', 'Khdour, Omar M', 'Jaruvangsanti, Jennifer', 'Hecht, Sidney M']","['Cai X', 'Khdour OM', 'Jaruvangsanti J', 'Hecht SM']","['Center for BioEnergetics, Biodesign Institute, and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120413,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '3P2MV07G53 (4-pyridone)', 'H4N855PNZ1 (alpha-Tocopherol)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Organic Chemistry Phenomena', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Pyridines/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Pyridones', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'alpha-Tocopherol/analogs & derivatives']",2012/05/09 06:00,2012/10/06 06:00,['2012/05/08 06:00'],"['2012/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0968-0896(12)00275-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2012.03.075 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2012 Jun 1;20(11):3584-95. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2012.03.075.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were accrued over a 3-year period from 22 US and Canadian institutions. Patients with LSCLC and good performance status were given thoracic radiation to 61.2 Gy over 5 weeks (daily 1.8-Gy fractions on days 1-22, then twice-daily 1.8-Gy fractions on days 23-33). Cisplatin (60 mg/m(2) IV) was given on day 1 and etoposide (120 mg/m(2) IV) on days 1-3 and days 22-24, followed by 2 cycles of cisplatin plus etoposide alone. Patients who achieved complete response were offered prophylactic cranial irradiation. Endpoints included overall and progression-free survival; severe esophagitis (Common Toxicity Criteria v 2.0) and treatment-related fatalities; response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors); and local control. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients were accrued from June 2003 through May 2006; 71 were evaluable (median age 63 years; 52% female; 58% Zubrod 0). Median survival time was 19 months; at 2 years, the overall survival rate was 36.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 25.6%-47.7%), and progression-free survival 19.7% (95% CI 11.4%-29.6%). Thirteen patients (18%) experienced severe acute esophagitis, and 2 (3%) died of treatment-related causes; 41% achieved complete response, 39% partial response, 10% stable disease, and 6% progressive disease. The local control rate was 73%. Forty-three patients (61%) received prophylactic cranial irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: The overall survival rate did not reach the projected goal; however, rates of esophagitis were lower, and local control higher, than projected.

We previously reported that Pbx1 deficiency causes organ growth defects including asplenia. Here, we show that mice with splenic mesenchyme-specific Pbx1 inactivation exhibit hyposplenia. Moreover, the loss of Pbx causes downregulation of Nkx2-5 and derepression of p15Ink4b in spleen mesenchymal progenitors, perturbing the cell cycle. Removal of p15Ink4b in Pbx1 spleen-specific mutants partially rescues spleen growth. By whole-exome sequencing of a multiplex kindred with ICA, we identify a heterozygous missense mutation (P236H) in NKX2-5 showing reduced transactivation in vitro.

We found that 55.3% of cases belonged to mutated and 44.7% to unmutated CLL, progressive disease predominating in the unmutated subset. IGHV gene use resembled that obtained for Mediterranean countries, except for underrepresentation of the IGHV4 subgroup in our cohort. BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) results from the clonal expansion of mature B lymphocytes and is characterized by extreme clinical heterogeneity. One of the most reliable prognostic markers in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the mutational status of immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) genes, which defines 2 subsets, mutated CLL (M-CLL) and unmutated CLL (U-CLL), with different clinical courses. Biased IGHV gene use between M-CLL and U-CLL clones, as well as population differences in the IGHV gene repertoire have been reported. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, mutational status and configuration of IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ rearrangements in 85 Serbian patients were analyzed using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing methodology. RESULTS: We found that 55.3% of cases belonged to M-CLL and 44.7% belonged to U-CLL, with progressive disease predominating in the unmutated subset. Most frequently expressed was the IGHV3 subgroup (55.7%), followed by IGHV1 (27.3%), IGHV4 (12.5%), IGHV5 (2.3%), IGHV2 (1.1%), and IGHV6 (1.1%). The distribution of IGHD subgroups was as follows: IGHD3, 39.1%; IGHD2, 21.8%; IGHD6, 12.6%; IGHD1, 10.3%; IGHD4, 8%; IGHD5, 6.9%; and IGHD7, 1.1%. The most frequent IGHJ gene was IGHJ4 (48.9%), followed by IGHJ6 (28.4%), IGHJ3 (11.4%), and IGHJ5 (11.4%). In 15.3% of cases, heavy complementarity-determining region 3 (VH CDR3) amino acid sequences could be assigned to previously defined stereotyped clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a strong correlation between IGHV gene mutational status and clinical course of CLL.

This review aims to explore the pathogenesis of the condition and appraise the option and outcome of conservative and surgical management based on the literature review. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Medline search was carried out and most of the relevant papers in English literature from 1973 onwards on neutropenic enterocolitis were reviewed RESULTS: Twelve reports of single cases, 21 reports of 2 to 4 cases and 15 reports of 5 or more cases were identified. There were no prospective trials or case control studies on therapy of neutropenic enterocolitis.

Even though a formal comparison of these 2 groups will not be appropriate, the mortality rate of 31% in the medically managed group was higher than those that required surgical intervention (23%) CONCLUSION: With the increasing use of multiple, new and aggressive chemotherapy for hematological and solid tumors there may be an increased frequency of neutropenic enterocolitis encountered in clinical practice.

The roles and signals of the cardiac AT(2) receptor still remain unsettled. Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) was shown to bind to the AT(2) receptor and transmit the hypertrophic signal. Using PLZF knockout mice we directed our studies on the function of PLZF concerning the cardiac specific transcription factor GATA4, and GATA4 targets. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: PLZF knockout and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice were treated with Ang II, infused at a rate of 4.2 ng.kg(-1).min(-1) for 3 weeks. Ang II elevated systolic blood pressure to comparable levels in PLZF knockout and WT mice (140 mmHg). WT mice developed prominent cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis after Ang II infusion. In contrast, there was no obvious cardiac hypertrophy or fibrosis in PLZF knockout mice. An AT(2) receptor blocker given to Ang II-infused wild type mice prevented hypertrophy, verifying the role of AT(2) receptor for cardiac hypertrophy. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that PLZF bound to the GATA4 gene regulatory region. A Luciferase assay verified that PLZF up-regulated GATA4 gene expression and the absence of PLZF expression in vivo produced a corresponding repression of GATA4 protein. CONCLUSIONS: PLZF is an important AT(2) receptor binding protein in mediating Ang II induced cardiac hypertrophy through an AT(2) receptor-dependent signal pathway. The angiotensin II-AT(2)-PLZF-GATA4 signal may further augment Ang II induced pathological effects on cardiomyocytes.","['Wang, Ning', 'Frank, Gerald D', 'Ding, Ronghua', 'Tan, Zhongjia', 'Rachakonda, Amita', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Senbonmatsu, Takaaki', 'Landon, Erwin J', 'Inagami, Tadashi']","['Wang N', 'Frank GD', 'Ding R', 'Tan Z', 'Rachakonda A', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Senbonmatsu T', 'Landon EJ', 'Inagami T']","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120427,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Angiotensin II Type 2 Receptor Blockers)', '0 (GATA4 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 2)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '11128-99-7 (Angiotensin II)']",IM,"['Angiotensin II/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Angiotensin II Type 2 Receptor Blockers/administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Pressure/drug effects', 'Cardiomegaly/chemically induced/complications/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Fibrosis/chemically induced/complications/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'GATA4 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Heart/drug effects/physiopathology', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*deficiency/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",2012/05/05 06:00,2012/09/14 06:00,['2012/05/05 06:00'],"['2011/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0035632 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-13379 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e35632. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0035632.

Three functional domains have been identified in GATA1, a transactivation domain located in the N terminus (N-TAD) and two zinc finger domains located in the middle of the molecule. Although N-TAD is known as a solitary transactivation domain for GATA1, clinical observations in Down syndrome leukemia suggest that there may be additional transactivation domains. In this study, we found in reporter co-transfection assays that transactivation activity of GATA1 was markedly reduced by deletion of the C-terminal 95 amino acids without significant attenuation of the DNA binding activity or self-association potential. We therefore generated transgenic mouse lines that expressed GATA1 lacking the C-terminal region (GATA1-DeltaCT). When we crossed these transgenic mouse lines to the Gata1-deficient mouse, we found that the GATA1-DeltaCT transgene rescued Gata1-deficient mice from embryonic lethality. The embryos rescued with an almost similar level of GATA1-DeltaCT to endogenous GATA1 developed beyond embryonic 13.5 days, showing severe anemia with accumulation of immature erythroid cells, as was the case for the embryos rescued by endogenous levels of GATA1 lacking N-TAD (GATA1-DeltaNT). Distinct sets of target genes were affected in the embryos rescued by GATA1-DeltaCT and GATA1-DeltaNT. We also found attenuated GATA1 function in cell cycle control of immature megakaryocytes in both lines of rescued embryos. These results thus demonstrate that GATA1 has two independent transactivation domains, N-TAD and C-TAD. Both N-TAD and C-TAD retain redundant as well as specific activities for proper hematopoiesis in vivo.","['Kaneko, Hiroshi', 'Kobayashi, Eri', 'Yamamoto, Masayuki', 'Shimizu, Ritsuko']","['Kaneko H', 'Kobayashi E', 'Yamamoto M', 'Shimizu R']","['Department of Molecular Hematology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-1 Seiryo-machi, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8575, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120502,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Anemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*embryology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Thrombopoiesis/*physiology']",2012/05/05 06:00,2012/08/25 06:00,['2012/05/05 06:00'],"['2012/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)49835-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.370437 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Jun 15;287(25):21439-49. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.370437.

Although monocytes/macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutrophilic leukocytes (PMN) contribute to lesion formation, sequelae of myeloproliferative disease remain to be elucidated. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used mice deficient in interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8(-/-)) in hematopoietic cells that develop a chronic myelogenous leukemia-like phenotype. Apolipoprotein E-deficient mice reconstituted with IRF8(-/-) or IRF8(-/-) apolipoprotein E-deficient bone marrow displayed an exacerbated atherosclerotic lesion formation compared with controls. The chronic myelogenous leukemia-like phenotype in mice with IRF8(-/-) bone marrow, reflected by an expansion of PMN in the circulation, was associated with an increased lesional accumulation and apoptosis of PMN, and enlarged necrotic cores. IRF8(-/-) compared with IRF8(+/+) PMN displayed unaffected reactive oxygen species formation and discharge of PMN granule components. In contrast, accumulating in equal numbers at sites of inflammation, IRF8(-/-) macrophages were defective in efferocytosis, lipid uptake, and interleukin-10 cytokine production. Importantly, depletion of PMN in low-density lipoprotein receptor or apolipoprotein E-deficient mice with IRF8(-/-) or IRF8(-/-) apolipoprotein E-deficient bone marrow abrogated increased lesion formation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that a chronic myelogenous leukemia-like phenotype contributes to accelerated atherosclerosis in mice.

HL-60 leukemia cell lines was treated with different dose quercetin, the proliferation activity of leukemia cells was assessed by MTT method; the morphological changes of apoptosis of HL-60 cells, including nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation, were observed by Hoechst 33258 fluorescence staining, the apoptosis rate and caspase 2,3 activation were assessed by flow cytometry, and the cell signal pathway including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAkt), Bcl-2, Bax were detected by western blotting. Quercetin could significantly decrease the proliferation activity of HL-60 cells through the blockade of G(0)/G(1) phase, and induce the apoptosis of HL-60 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Quercetin caused leukemia cells apoptosis by decreasing the protein expression of PI3K and Bax, the inhibitory phosphorylation of Akt, the decreased levels of Bcl-2 protein and increased activations of caspase-2 and -3, and increased poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Our results indicate that the apoptotic processes caused by quercetin are mediated by the decrease of pAkt and Bcl-2 levels, the increase of Bax level, and the activation of caspase families in HL-60 cells.","['Yuan, Zhang', 'Long, Chen', 'Junming, Tang', 'Qihuan, Liu', 'Youshun, Zhang', 'Chan, Zou']","['Yuan Z', 'Long C', 'Junming T', 'Qihuan L', 'Youshun Z', 'Chan Z']","[""Hematology Department, Affiliated Dongfeng Hospital, HuBei University of Medicine, Shiyan, 442000, Hubei, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120504,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,"['0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 2/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*biosynthesis']",2012/05/05 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/05/05 06:00'],"['2010/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11033-012-1621-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2012 Jul;39(7):7785-93. doi: 10.1007/s11033-012-1621-0.

STUDY DESIGN: Ten cases of lymph node aspirate diagnosed as myeloid sarcoma were analyzed. FNAC was performed as a routine outpatient procedure in all cases. Correlation with peripheral smear, bone marrow examination, flow cytometry and cytogenetics was done wherever possible. RESULTS: Diagnosis of a hematologic malignancy, before fine-needle aspiration, was available in only 2 cases. All 10 cases showed eosinophilic precursors while five aspirates showed megakaryocytes with dysplastic forms. Of the 10 cases, 3 were diagnosed as acute myeloid leukemia, 3 as chronic myeloid leukemia, 1 case as juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, 1 case proved to be precursor T acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and 2 patients did not show blasts on peripheral blood smear but showed blasts, dysplastic megakaryocytes and eosinophilic precursors in the aspirate. CONCLUSION: Thorough workup to search for an underlying hematological malignancy should be done whenever dysplastic megakaryocytes and/or eosinophilic precursors are seen in lymph node aspirate.","['Ojha, Sandeep S', 'Kothari, Kanchan S', 'Naik, Leena P', 'Fernandes, Gwendolyn C', 'Rangwala, Saaishta', 'Agnihotri, Mona A']","['Ojha SS', 'Kothari KS', 'Naik LP', 'Fernandes GC', 'Rangwala S', 'Agnihotri MA']","['Seth G.S.

Detailed descriptions of cytological features of GS in an effusion have not been published to date. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 35-year-old male who presented clinically with a mediastinal mass, peripheral lymphadenopathy and pleural/pericardial effusion. His effusion cytology showed an atypical morphology. Immature cells with marked nuclear indentation/convolution, fine nuclear chromatin, conspicuous nucleoli and a moderate amount of cytoplasm were seen, without any granularity. GS was suspected based on the abnormal nuclear contours and fine nuclear chromatin, and was confirmed by lymph node fine needle aspiration and biopsy with immunocytochemistry. CONCLUSION: Abnormal nuclear contours are a significant marker in effusion cytology and provide an important morphological clue to the diagnosis of a myeloid malignancy in addition to fine nuclear chromatin especially in the absence of cytoplasmic granularity. In this case, these features helped to suspect the diagnosis despite a clinical scenario suggestive of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","['Singh, Geetika', 'Agarwal, Shipra', 'Iyer, Venkateswaran K', 'Sharma, Atul', 'Chopra, Anita', 'Mathur, Sandeep R']","['Singh G', 'Agarwal S', 'Iyer VK', 'Sharma A', 'Chopra A', 'Mathur SR']","['Department of Pathology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20120426,Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cytodiagnosis/methods', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Pericardial Effusion/etiology/*pathology', 'Pleural Effusion/etiology/*pathology', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/diagnosis/*pathology']",2012/05/05 06:00,2012/07/27 06:00,['2012/05/05 06:00'],"['2011/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/27 06:00 [medline]']","['000335058 [pii]', '10.1159/000335058 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Cytol. 2012;56(3):315-20. doi: 10.1159/000335058.

In the present study, we investigated the interaction of arsenic trioxide with metallothionein (MT) isoforms as a possible (protective response) resistance of glioblastoma cells to arsenic-induced cytotoxicity. Special attention was focused on MT3, the isoform expressed mainly in the brain. MT3 has low metal inducibility, fast metal binding/releasing properties and outstanding neuronal inhibitory activity. The human astrocytoma (glioblastoma) cell line U87 MG was treated with 0.6, 2 and 6-7 muM arsenic (equivalent to 0.3, 1 and 3-3.5 muM As(2)O(3)) for 12, 24 or 48 h and gene expression for different MT isoforms, namely MT2A, MT1A, MT1F, MT1X, MT1E and MT3, was measured by real time qPCR using SYBR Green I and Taqman(R) gene expression assays. TfR, 18S rRNA, GAPDH and AB were tested as reference genes, and the last two evaluated to be appropriate in conditions of low (GAPDH) and high (AB) arsenic exposure. The gene expression of MT3 gene was additionally tested and confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis with PvuII. In the given conditions the mRNAs of six MT isoforms were identified in human glioblastoma cell line U87 MG. Depending on arsenic exposure conditions, an increase or decrease of MT gene expression was observed for each isoform, with the highest increase for isoforms MT1X, MT1F and MT2A mRNA (up to 13-fold) and more persistent decreases for MT1A, MT1E and MT3 mRNA. Despite the common assumption of the noninducibility of MT3, the evident MT3 mRNA increase was observed during high As exposure (up to 4-fold). In conclusion, our results clearly demonstrate the influence of As on MT isoform gene expression. The MT1X, MT1F and MT2A increase could represent brain tumour acquired resistance to As cytotoxicity while the MT3 increase is more enigmatic, with its possible involvement in arsenic-related induction of type II cell death.","['Falnoga, Ingrid', 'Zelenik Pevec, Andreja', 'Slejkovec, Zdenka', 'Znidaric, Magda Tusek', 'Zajc, Irena', 'Mlakar, Simona Jurkovic', 'Marc, Janja']","['Falnoga I', 'Zelenik Pevec A', 'Slejkovec Z', 'Znidaric MT', 'Zajc I', 'Mlakar SJ', 'Marc J']","['Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia. ingrid.falnoga@ijs.si']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120504,United States,Biol Trace Elem Res,Biological trace element research,7911509,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (MT1A protein, human)', '0 (MT1E protein, human)', '0 (MT1F protein, human)', '0 (MT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oxides)', '9038-94-2 (Metallothionein)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Glioblastoma/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Metallothionein/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology']",2012/05/05 06:00,2013/04/23 06:00,['2012/05/05 06:00'],"['2012/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12011-012-9431-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Trace Elem Res. 2012 Dec;149(3):331-9. doi: 10.1007/s12011-012-9431-8.

TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising anti-cancer agent which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells. However, resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis is an important and frequent problem in cancer treatment. In this study, we investigated the effect of silibinin and TRAIL in an in vitro model of human colon cancer progression, consisting of primary colon tumor cells (SW480) and their derived TRAIL-resistant metastatic cells (SW620). We showed by flow cytometry that silibinin and TRAIL synergistically induced cell death in the two cell lines. Up-regulation of death receptor 4 (DR4) and DR5 by silibinin was shown by RT-PCR and by flow cytometry. Human recombinant DR5/Fc chimera protein that has a dominant-negative effect by competing with the endogenous receptors abrogated cell death induced by silibinin and TRAIL, demonstrating the activation of the death receptor pathway. Synergistic activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9 by silibinin and TRAIL was shown by colorimetric assays. When caspase inhibitors were used, cell death was blocked. Furthermore, silibinin and TRAIL potentiated activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and down-regulated the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and XIAP. The involvement of XIAP in sensitization of the two cell lines to TRAIL was demonstrated using the XIAP inhibitor embelin. These findings demonstrate the synergistic action of silibinin and TRAIL, suggesting chemopreventive and therapeutic potential which should be further explored.","['Kauntz, Henriette', 'Bousserouel, Souad', 'Gosse, Francine', 'Raul, Francis']","['Kauntz H', 'Bousserouel S', 'Gosse F', 'Raul F']","[""Laboratory of Nutritional Cancer Prevention, Unit EA 4438, IRCAD, University of Strasbourg, 1 Place de l'Hopital, 67091, Strasbourg-Cedex, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Silymarin)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '4RKY41TBTF (Silybin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy/secondary', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics/metabolism', 'Silybin', 'Silymarin/*pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2012/05/05 06:00,2012/10/18 06:00,['2012/05/05 06:00'],"['2012/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-012-0731-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2012 Aug;17(8):797-809. doi: 10.1007/s10495-012-0731-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Recent research has focused on mechanisms underlying the acquisition of function by NK cells after haematopoietic transplantation, on the therapeutic impact of NK-cell alloreactivity in various forms of transplantation and in adoptive immunotherapy. Finally, studies have highlighted the role of NK-cell responses in viral infections after transplantation. SUMMARY: Donor-versus-recipient NK-cell alloreactivity is established as a key therapeutic element in human leukocyte antigen haplotype-mismatched haematopoietic transplants in adult acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). NK-cell allotherapy for leukaemia is deployed through stem cell transplantation (and ensuing NK-cell reconstitution) across killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor ligand mismatches. Donor-derived NK cells were also reported to respond to cytomegalovirus by acquiring features that are reminiscent of the specificity and memory of adaptive (T-cell) immune responses. As NK cells are the earliest immune cells to recover after transplant, this observation suggests they may contribute to controlling viral reactivation early after transplant.","['Velardi, Andrea', 'Ruggeri, Loredana', 'Mancusi, Antonella']","['Velardi A', 'Ruggeri L', 'Mancusi A']","['Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy. velardi@unipg.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/transplantation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/therapy', 'Receptors, KIR/*immunology']",2012/05/05 06:00,2012/09/20 06:00,['2012/05/05 06:00'],"['2012/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e32835423c3 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2012 Jul;19(4):319-23. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e32835423c3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis was dependent on the activation of at least caspase-8, caspase-9 and caspase-3. The involvement of the death receptor pathway was indicated by the upregulation of both the tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and its death receptor (DR5). We also showed that 2'-nitroflavone increased the expression levels of Bax and induced the release of cytochrome C to cytosol, suggesting the participation of the mitochondria-dependent pathway. When mitogen-activated protein kinases pathways were studied, it was found that p38 and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways were activated by 2'-nitroflavone in HL-60 cells, whereas the phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 decreased significantly. In addition, whereas both pharmacological inhibition of JNK and downregulation of JNK expression by RNA interference reduced the nitroflavone growth-inhibitory activity and the apoptotic effect, contrasting results were obtained when the ERK1/2 pathway was inhibited, and no effect was observed in the presence of a specific inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. These findings show for the first time the antitumour action of 2'-nitroflavone in haematological cancer cell lines and suggest that both JNK and ERK1/2 cascades are involved in the apoptotic response induced by 2'-nitroflavone in HL-60 cells.","['Cardenas, Mariano G', 'Blank, Viviana C', 'Marder, Mariel N', 'Roguin, Leonor P']","['Cardenas MG', 'Blank VC', 'Marder MN', 'Roguin LP']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, School of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"[""0 (2'-nitroflavone)"", '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavones)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Flavones/*pharmacology', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2012/05/05 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/05/05 06:00'],"['2012/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0b013e328353f947 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2012 Sep;23(8):815-26. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e328353f947.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the PLZF protein expression in a variety of immature and mature lymphoid malignancies. PLZF was preferentially expressed in T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-LBL/ALL) in 50% of the 54 cases. Among 51 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified, only one (2%) expressed PLZF. One mycosis fungoides case expressed PLZF in lymph node involved by tumor. Otherwise, PLZF was not detected in any other type of lymphoma. In T-LBL/ALL, PLZF expression was more common in CD4/CD8 double-negative (67%) or CD8 single-positive subtypes (73%) than in CD4/CD8 double-positive (13%) and CD4 single-positive subtypes (0%) (P=0.001). Importantly, PLZF and CD1a expression were mutually exclusive in T-LBL/ALL (P=0.001). This was also the case for T-cell receptor betaF1 expression (P=0.000). Most (96%) of the PLZF-positive T-LBL/ALL cases showed initial bone marrow involvement compared with 39% of PLZF-negative cases (P=0.000). Based on these findings, we suggest that T-LBL/ALLs that express PLZF arise from early immature double-negative thymocytes when the T-cell receptor beta chain has not yet expressed or innate T-cell precursors, and strongly imply bone marrow involvement.","['Jeon, Yoon K', 'Go, Heounjeong', 'Nam, Soo J', 'Keam, Bhumsuk', 'Kim, Tae M', 'Jung, Kyeong C', 'Kang, Hyoung J', 'Lee, Dong S', 'Huh, Joo R', 'Park, Seong H']","['Jeon YK', 'Go H', 'Nam SJ', 'Keam B', 'Kim TM', 'Jung KC', 'Kang HJ', 'Lee DS', 'Huh JR', 'Park SH']","['Department of Pathology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea. junarplus@chol.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120504,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Thymocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Young Adult', '*Zinc Fingers']",2012/05/05 06:00,2013/01/30 06:00,['2012/05/05 06:00'],"['2012/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol201282 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2012.82 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2012 Sep;25(9):1236-45. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2012.82.

Compounds 6 and 9 exerted the most pronounced cytostatic effects in all tumour cell lines tested, and were highly selective for human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells (CEM/0) with IC(50)s of 10 +/- 4 and 7.3 +/- 0.1 muM, respectively. Unlike compound 9, compound 6 showed no toxicity in human diploid fibroblasts. One of the possible mechanisms of action of compound 6 accounting for observed cytostatic activity towards haematological malignancies might be inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) activity, a key enzyme of de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis providing the cells with precursors for DNA and RNA synthesis indispensable for cell growth and division, which has emerged as an important target for antileukemic therapy. In addition, this compound proved to be the most potent inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus replication as well. However, observed antiviral effect was most likely associated with the effect that the compound exerted on the host cell rather than with selective effect on the replication of the virus itself. In conclusion, results of this study put forward compound 6 as a potential novel antitumor agent (IMPDH inhibitor) for treating leukaemia. Its significant biological activity and low toxicity in human diploid fibroblasts encourage further development of this compound as a lead.","['Wittine, Karlo', 'Stipkovic Babic, Maja', 'Makuc, Damjan', 'Plavec, Janez', 'Kraljevic Pavelic, Sandra', 'Sedic, Mirela', 'Pavelic, Kresimir', 'Leyssen, Pieter', 'Neyts, Johan', 'Balzarini, Jan', 'Mintas, Mladen']","['Wittine K', 'Stipkovic Babic M', 'Makuc D', 'Plavec J', 'Kraljevic Pavelic S', 'Sedic M', 'Pavelic K', 'Leyssen P', 'Neyts J', 'Balzarini J', 'Mintas M']","['Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemical Engineering and Technology, University of Zagreb, Marulicev trg 20, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120215,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Triazoles)', '288-88-0 (1,2,4-triazole)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antiviral Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Ascorbic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dogs', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects', 'Hepacivirus/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Imidazoles/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Structure', 'Triazoles/*chemistry', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",2012/05/05 06:00,2012/10/06 06:00,['2012/05/05 06:00'],"['2011/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/24 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0968-0896(12)00101-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2012.01.054 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2012 Jun 1;20(11):3675-85. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2012.01.054.

SUMMARY: The development of Sweet's syndrome in association with azacitidine use is rare (three published case reports since the drug's U.S. marketing approval in 2004), and the syndrome is not listed as a potential adverse reaction in the product packaging. In one of two cases of probable azacitidine-related Sweet's syndrome reported here, a 64-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) developed a severe erythematous and nodular rash with peeling on his arms, legs, and face after receiving the drug (75 mg/m(2) subcutaneously daily) for three days; the second case involved a 67-year-old man with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) who experienced a similar skin rash, as well as chills and an elevated body temperature, after five days of treatment with azacitidine. In both cases, the results of dermatologic or pathologic examination and skin biopsies were consistent with Sweet's syndrome. Perhaps the strongest evidence of a drug-induced etiology in these cases was the close temporal relationship between the initiation of azacitidine use and the development of Sweet's syndrome, with prompt symptom resolution after the discontinuation of azacitidine use and administration of appropriate corticosteroid therapy. CONCLUSION: Azacitidine was the apparent cause of Sweet's syndrome in a patient with MDS and another with CMML. Both responded well to corticosteroid therapy. After resolution of the reaction, decitabine was given to the first patient and azacitidine to the second, without complications.","['Trickett, Hannah B', 'Cumpston, Aaron', 'Craig, Michael']","['Trickett HB', 'Cumpston A', 'Craig M']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Services, West Virginia University Healthcare, Morgantown, 26506, USA. tricketth@wvuhealthcare.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Aged', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Drug Eruptions/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/drug therapy/pathology', 'Skin/pathology', 'Sweet Syndrome/*chemically induced/complications/drug therapy']",2012/05/05 06:00,2012/08/22 06:00,['2012/05/05 06:00'],"['2012/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/22 06:00 [medline]']","['69/10/869 [pii]', '10.2146/ajhp110523 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2012 May 15;69(10):869-71. doi: 10.2146/ajhp110523.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following careful optimization and testing of quantification reliability of four assays, we analyzed 34 samples of patients with AML and 12 samples of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) at the time of diagnosis. Analyses of five more CML patients provided insight into WT1 variants expression kinetics. We found predominance of +5/+KTS in both diagnoses. Comparison of WT1 variant expression in AML and CML patients' groups differing in response to therapy suggested possible importance of particular WT1 variant levels as markers of further disease course.","['Lopotova, Tereza', 'Polak, Jaroslav', 'Schwarz, Jiri', 'Klamova, Hana', 'Moravcova, Jana']","['Lopotova T', 'Polak J', 'Schwarz J', 'Klamova H', 'Moravcova J']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Department of Cellular Biochemistry, U Nemocnice 1, 128 20, Prague 2, Czech Republic.

However, tumor cells often develop resistance to TRAIL, limiting its therapeutic potential. To study the mechanism underlying TRAIL-resistance in breast cancer cells, we performed a high-throughput compound screen in MCF-7 cells. We identified daunorubicin as a potent sensitizer of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Daunorubicin in combination with subtoxic concentrations of recombinant human TRAIL induced massive apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. This combination was effective in TRAIL-resistant MDA-MB-231 and T47D breast cancer cells. By immunoblotting, we found that daunorubicin treatment induced loss of the anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1, in breast cancer cells. RNA interference experiments revealed that reduced expression of Mcl-1 sensitized MCF-7 cells to TRAIL. Together, these data suggest that Mcl-1 is a major contributor to TRAIL-resistance in breast cancer cells, and that reduction of Mcl-1 protein levels using DNA damaging agents is a promising approach for cancer therapy.","['Oh, Bora', 'Park, SoJung', 'Pak, Jhang Ho', 'Kim, InKi']","['Oh B', 'Park S', 'Pak JH', 'Kim I']","['Asan Institute for Life Science, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120425,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology']",2012/05/05 06:00,2012/08/17 06:00,['2012/05/05 06:00'],"['2012/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(12)00775-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.04.093 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2012 May 25;422(1):42-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.04.093.

We identified a novel breakpoint region at 14q32.13 that was rearranged together with IGH/14q32.33 in four cases of BRAF/V600E-negative leukemia/lymphoma with villous lymphocytes carrying either t(14;14)(q32.13;q32.33) (three patients) or del(14)(q32.13q32.33) (one patient). The 14q32.13 breakpoints were mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in the region harboring the TCL1A/TCL1B/TCL6 genes, known to be affected by TCRA/D-mediated t(14;14)(q11;q32)/inv(14)(q11q32) occurring in T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. To identify the target of t(14;14)(q32.13; q32.33) and del(14)(q32.13q32.33), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis of 25 candidate genes located centromerically and telomerically to the 14q32.13 breakpoint was performed. Any of the analyzed genes was commonly overexpressed in the presented cases. Of note, up-regulated transcription of TCL1A was observed in two cases. In summary, we provide evidence that IGH-mediated chromosomal aberrations affecting the 14q32.13/TCL1A-TCL6 region are recurrent in mature B-cell neoplasms with villous lymphocytes.

This pathway was indeed strongly inhibited in C91PL, HUT102, and MT2 cells, and such an effect was also observed by the sole expression of the Tax protein in Jurkat and HeLa cells. In line with this activity, Tax binds INT6/EIF3E (here called INT6), which is a subunit of the translation initiation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) required for efficient NMD, as well as the NMD core factor upstream frameshift protein 1 (UPF1). It was also observed that Tax expression alters the morphology of processing bodies (P-bodies), the cytoplasmic structures which concentrate RNA degradation factors. The presence of UPF1 in these subcellular compartments was increased by Tax, whereas that of INT6 was decreased. In line with these effects, the level of the phosphorylated form of UPF1 was increased in the presence of Tax. Analysis of several mutants of the viral protein showed that the interaction with INT6 is necessary for NMD inhibition. The alteration of mRNA stability was observed to affect viral transcripts, such as that coding for the HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ), and also several cellular mRNAs sensitive to the NMD pathway. Our data indicate that the effect of Tax on viral and cellular gene expression is not restricted to transcriptional control but can also involve posttranscriptional regulation.","['Mocquet, Vincent', 'Neusiedler, Julia', 'Rende, Francesca', 'Cluet, David', 'Robin, Jean-Philippe', 'Terme, Jean-Michel', 'Duc Dodon, Madeleine', 'Wittmann, Jurgen', 'Morris, Christelle', 'Le Hir, Herve', 'Ciminale, Vincenzo', 'Jalinot, Pierre']","['Mocquet V', 'Neusiedler J', 'Rende F', 'Cluet D', 'Robin JP', 'Terme JM', 'Duc Dodon M', 'Wittmann J', 'Morris C', 'Le Hir H', 'Ciminale V', 'Jalinot P']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire de la Cellule, Unite Mixte de Recherche 5239, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120502,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-3)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (RNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (UPF1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-3/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'RNA Helicases', '*RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/virology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics']",2012/05/04 06:00,2012/09/11 06:00,['2012/05/04 06:00'],"['2012/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.07021-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.07021-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Jul;86(14):7530-43. doi: 10.1128/JVI.07021-11.

The higher resolution offered by recently developed genomic platforms may be used to establish more precise clinical correlations and identify specific target genes. We analyzed a series of patients with myeloid disorders using recent genomic technologies (1458 by single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays [SNP-A], 226 by next-generation sequencing, and 183 by expression microarrays). Using SNP-A, we identified chromosome 7q loss of heterozygosity segments in 161 of 1458 patients (11%); 26% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients harbored 7q uniparental disomy, of which 41% had a homozygous EZH2 mutation. In addition, we describe an SNP-A-isolated deletion 7 hypocellular myelodysplastic syndrome subset, with a high rate of progression. Using direct and parallel sequencing, we found no recurrent mutations in typically large deletion 7q and monosomy 7 patients. In contrast, we detected a markedly decreased expression of genes included in our SNP-A defined minimally deleted regions. Although a 2-hit model is present in most patients with 7q uniparental disomy and a myeloproliferative phenotype, haplodeficient expression of defined regions of 7q may underlie pathogenesis in patients with deletions and predominant dysplastic features.","['Jerez, Andres', 'Sugimoto, Yuka', 'Makishima, Hideki', 'Verma, Amit', 'Jankowska, Anna M', 'Przychodzen, Bartlomiej', 'Visconte, Valeria', 'Tiu, Ramon V', ""O'Keefe, Christine L"", 'Mohamedali, Azim M', 'Kulasekararaj, Austin G', 'Pellagatti, Andrea', 'McGraw, Kathy', 'Muramatsu, Hideki', 'Moliterno, Alison R', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'McDevitt, Michael A', 'Kojima, Seiji', 'List, Alan', 'Boultwood, Jacqueline', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Jerez A', 'Sugimoto Y', 'Makishima H', 'Verma A', 'Jankowska AM', 'Przychodzen B', 'Visconte V', 'Tiu RV', ""O'Keefe CL"", 'Mohamedali AM', 'Kulasekararaj AG', 'Pellagatti A', 'McGraw K', 'Muramatsu H', 'Moliterno AR', 'Sekeres MA', 'McDevitt MA', 'Kojima S', 'List A', 'Boultwood J', 'Mufti GJ', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120502,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['Chromosome 7, monosomy']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', '*Loss of Heterozygosity/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/genetics', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",2012/05/04 06:00,2012/09/14 06:00,['2012/05/04 06:00'],"['2012/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47655-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-12-397620 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jun 21;119(25):6109-17. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-12-397620.

In the current study, we showed, in a large AML cohort carrying 11q23 translocations, that approximately 43% of all mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged leukemias are EVI1(pos). High EVI1 expression occurs in AMLs expressing the MLL-AF6, -AF9, -AF10, -ENL, or -ELL fusion genes. In addition, we present evidence that EVI1(pos) MLL-rearranged AMLs differ molecularly, morphologically, and immunophenotypically from EVI1(neg) MLL-rearranged leukemias. In mouse bone marrow cells transduced with MLL-AF9, we show that MLL-AF9 fusion protein maintains Evi1 expression on transformation of Evi1(pos) HSCs. MLL-AF9 does not activate Evi1 expression in MLL-AF9-transformed granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) that were initially Evi1(neg). Moreover, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Evi1 in an Evi1(pos) MLL-AF9 mouse model inhibits leukemia growth both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that Evi1 provides a growth-promoting signal. Using the Evi1(pos) MLL-AF9 mouse leukemia model, we demonstrate increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents on reduction of Evi1 expression.

ATLL is a severe malignancy with no effective treatment. HTLV-1 regulatory proteins Tax and HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ) play a major role in ATLL development, by interfering with cellular functions such as CD4(+) T-cell survival. In this study, we observed that the expression of Bfl-1, an antiapoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family, is restricted to HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and to T-cells expressing both Tax and HBZ proteins. We showed that Tax-induced bfl-1 transcription through the canonical NF-kappaB pathway. Moreover, we demonstrated that Tax cooperated with c-Jun or JunD, but not JunB, transcription factors of the AP-1 family to stimulate bfl-1 gene activation. By contrast, HBZ inhibited c-Jun-induced bfl-1 gene activation, whereas it increased JunD-induced bfl-1 gene activation. We identified one NF-kappaB, targeted by RelA, c-Rel, RelB, p105/p50, and p100/p52, and two AP-1, targeted by both c-Jun and JunD, binding sites in the bfl-1 promoter of T-cells expressing both Tax and HBZ. Analyzing the potential role of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins in HTLV-1-infected T-cell survival, we demonstrated that these cells are differentially sensitive to silencing of Bfl-1, Bcl-x(L), and Bcl-2. Indeed, both Bfl-1 and Bcl-x(L) knockdowns decreased the survival of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, although no cell death was observed after Bcl-2 knockdown. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Bfl-1 knockdown sensitizes HTLV-1-infected T-cells to ABT-737 or etoposide treatment. Our results directly implicate Bfl-1 and Bcl-x(L) in HTLV-1-infected T-cell survival and suggest that both Bfl-1 and Bcl-x(L) represent potential therapeutic targets for ATLL treatment.","['Macaire, Heloise', 'Riquet, Aurelien', 'Moncollin, Vincent', 'Biemont-Trescol, Marie-Claude', 'Duc Dodon, Madeleine', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Debaud, Anne-Laure', 'Mahieux, Renaud', 'Mesnard, Jean-Michel', 'Pierre, Marlene', 'Gazzolo, Louis', 'Bonnefoy, Nathalie', 'Valentin, Helene']","['Macaire H', 'Riquet A', 'Moncollin V', 'Biemont-Trescol MC', 'Duc Dodon M', 'Hermine O', 'Debaud AL', 'Mahieux R', 'Mesnard JM', 'Pierre M', 'Gazzolo L', 'Bonnefoy N', 'Valentin H']","['Universite de Lyon, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120502,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BCL2-related protein A1)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (JunD protein, human)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (NFKB1 protein, human)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '0 (REL protein, human)', '0 (RELB protein, human)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', '147337-75-5 (Transcription Factor RelB)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)', ""EC 6.- (guanosine 3',5'-polyphosphate synthetases)""]",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, jun/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diet therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Ligases/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor RelB/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2012/05/04 06:00,2012/08/25 06:00,['2012/05/04 06:00'],"['2012/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)49827-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.340992 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Jun 15;287(25):21357-70. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.340992.

We computed age-standardized (world population) mortality rates, at all ages and in selected age groups, in 11 selected European countries, the European Union (EU) and, for comparative purposes, in the USA and Japan. For the EU, we also provided projections of the mortality to 2012. Over the period considered, mortality from leukemia steadily declined in most European countries in children and young adults, as well as in western and southern Europe at middle-age (45-69 years); in central/eastern Europe, reductions at ages 45-69 started since the mid-late 1990s. In the EU, annual percent changes were -3.7% in males and -3.8% in females at age 0-14, -2% in both sexes at age 15-44, and -0.6% in males and -1% in females at middle-age and overall. No decline was observed at age 70 or more. Between 1997 and 2007, overall EU rates decreased from 5.4 to 4.8/100,000 males and from 3.4 to 2.9/100,000 females. Declines were from 6.2 to 5.5/100,000 males and from 3.7 to 3.2/100,000 females in the USA and from 3.9 to 3.5/100,000 males and from 2.5 to 2.0/100,000 females in Japan.

Despite these successes, cooperative oncology groups currently face substantial challenges. We are working to develop methods to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of these trials. Specifically, we merged data from the Children's Oncology Group (COG) and the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) to improve toxicity monitoring, to estimate treatment-associated resource utilization and costs, and to address important clinical epidemiology questions. METHODS: COG and PHIS data on patients enrolled on a phase III COG trial for de novo acute myeloid leukemia at 43 PHIS hospitals were merged using a probabilistic algorithm. Resource utilization summary statistics were then tabulated for the first chemotherapy course based on PHIS data. RESULTS: Of 416 patients enrolled on the phase III COG trial at PHIS centers, 392 (94%) were successfully matched. Of these, 378 (96%) had inpatient PHIS data available beginning at the date of study enrollment. For these, daily blood product usage and anti-infective exposures were tabulated and standardized costs were described. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that patients enrolled in a cooperative group oncology trial can be successfully identified in an administrative data set and that supportive care resource utilization can be described. Further work is required to optimize the merging algorithm, map resource utilization metrics to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for monitoring toxicity, to perform comparative effectiveness studies, and to estimate the costs associated with protocol therapy.","['Aplenc, R', 'Fisher, B T', 'Huang, Y S', 'Li, Y', 'Alonzo, T A', 'Gerbing, R B', 'Hall, M', 'Bertoch, D', 'Keren, R', 'Seif, A E', 'Sung, L', 'Adamson, P C', 'Gamis, A']","['Aplenc R', 'Fisher BT', 'Huang YS', 'Li Y', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gerbing RB', 'Hall M', 'Bertoch D', 'Keren R', 'Seif AE', 'Sung L', 'Adamson PC', 'Gamis A']","[""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA. aplenc@email.chop.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,England,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,9208369,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', '*Child Health Services/economics/standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Child, Preschool', '*Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic/economics/standards/statistics & numerical data', '*Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology/economics/organization & administration/standards/statistics & numerical data/*trends', '*Medical Record Linkage', 'Medical Records Systems, Computerized/economics/standards/statistics & numerical data/*trends', 'National Cancer Institute (U.S.)', '*Neoplasms/economics/mortality/therapy', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care', 'United States', 'Young Adult']",2012/05/11 06:00,2012/09/05 06:00,['2012/05/04 06:00'],"['2012/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pds.3241 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf. 2012 May;21 Suppl 2:37-43. doi: 10.1002/pds.3241.,"['Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['R01 CA133881/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA98543-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01 CA133881/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3359580,['NIHMS377152'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epidemiological case-control studies have been conducted using antibiotics as a proxy for bacterial infections, but with inconclusive results. The aim of this study was, in a cohort design, based on the unique nationwide Danish registers, to investigate the association between use of antibiotics and the risk of NHL subtypes. On the basis of the Civil Registration System, we established a cohort of the entire adult (>/= 15 years) Danish population. Information on use of antibiotics came from the Danish Drug Prescription Registry and lymphoma diagnosis from the Danish Cancer Registry. Associations were assessed by adjusted rate ratios (RRs). In total, 13,602 patients were diagnosed with one of the NHL subtypes during 51.6 million person-years of follow-up (1995-2008). We observed positive associations between use of antibiotics and plasma cell myeloma [RR = 1.11, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) = 1.00-1.24], chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (RR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.20-1.45), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) (RR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.04-1.88) and anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma (ALCL) (RR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.00-3.36). Among these, the increased risk of CLL/SLL, MCL and ALCL, respectively, did not vary by years since use, and only the risk of CLL/SLL risk differed by number of prescriptions. While causality could not be established in our study, an intriguing positive long-term association between antibiotic use and CLL/SLL risk was observed. To what extent these findings indicate a role for bacteria in lymphoma pathogenesis requires further investigation.","['Rasmussen, M-L H', 'Hjalgrim, H', 'Molgaard-Nielsen, D', 'Wohlfahrt, J', 'Melbye, M']","['Rasmussen ML', 'Hjalgrim H', 'Molgaard-Nielsen D', 'Wohlfahrt J', 'Melbye M']","['Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark. eeh@ssi.dk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120530,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Young Adult']",2012/05/04 06:00,2012/10/18 06:00,['2012/05/04 06:00'],"['2012/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.27626 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2012 Oct 1;131(7):E1158-65. doi: 10.1002/ijc.27626.

We found that Res interacts with specificity protein 1 (Sp1). The IC50 for Res was 17 microM in MSTO-211H cells. Cell viability was decreased and apoptotic cell death was increased by Res (0-60 microM). Res increased the Sub-G1 population in MSTO-211H cells and significantly suppressed Sp1 protein levels, but not Sp1 mRNA levels. Res modulated the expression of Sp1 regulatory proteins including p21, p27, cyclin D1, Mcl-1 and survivin in mesothelioma cells. After treatment with Res, apoptosis signaling cascades were activated by the activation of Bid, Bim, caspase-3 and PARP, upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-xL. Res (20 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks) effectively suppressed tumor growth in vivo in BALB/c athymic (nu+/nu+) mice injected with MSTO-211H cells, an effect that was mediated by inhibition of Sp1 expression and induction of apoptotic cell death. Our results strongly suggest that Sp1 is a novel molecular target of Res in human malignant pleural mesothelioma.","['Lee, Kyung-Ae', 'Lee, Yong-Jin', 'Ban, Jung Ok', 'Lee, Yoon-Jin', 'Lee, Sang-Han', 'Cho, Moon-Kyun', 'Nam, Hae-Seon', 'Hong, Jin Tae', 'Shim, Jung-Hyun']","['Lee KA', 'Lee YJ', 'Ban JO', 'Lee YJ', 'Lee SH', 'Cho MK', 'Nam HS', 'Hong JT', 'Shim JH']","['Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University, Cheonan 330-090, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120423,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/biosynthesis', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/biosynthesis', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Caspase 3/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin D1/biosynthesis', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/biosynthesis', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Mesothelioma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Pleural Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Resveratrol', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Stilbenes/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Survivin', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/biosynthesis', 'bcl-X Protein/biosynthesis']",2012/05/04 06:00,2012/09/29 06:00,['2012/05/04 06:00'],"['2012/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijmm.2012.978 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2012 Jul;30(1):21-7. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.2012.978.

Our results show that both RRVs can efficiently spread throughout entire HCC cell populations in vitro and achieve high transduction efficiency in HCC xenografts in vivo, while GALV RRV, in general, exhibited more rapid replication kinetics in the tumors. In vitro, substantial HCC cell killing was achieved even when initially only 1% of the HCC cells were producing RRVs that express the yeast cytosine deaminase suicide gene, indicating that the high efficiency of gene transfer by replicative spread of RRVs greatly increased suicide gene toxicity. In vivo, GALV RRV-mediated suicide gene therapy efficiently suppressed HCC tumor growth and no detectable RRV signals were observed in extratumoral tissues, showing promise in using GALV RRV as a cancer therapeutic agent.","['Lu, Yin-Che', 'Chen, Ying-Ju', 'Yu, Yuan-Ren', 'Lai, Yi-Hui', 'Cheng, Jen-Chieh', 'Li, Yu-Fen', 'Shen, Cheng-Huang', 'Tai, Chien-Kuo']","['Lu YC', 'Chen YJ', 'Yu YR', 'Lai YH', 'Cheng JC', 'Li YF', 'Shen CH', 'Tai CK']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Ditmanson Medical Foundation Chia-Yi Christian Hospital, Chia-Yi 60002, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120426,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'D83282DT06 (Flucytosine)', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biotransformation', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/pathology/*therapy', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytosine Deaminase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Flucytosine/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Fungal Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/enzymology/*genetics/physiology', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Oncolytic Virotherapy', 'Oncolytic Viruses/enzymology/*genetics/physiology', 'Prodrugs/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Virus Replication', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/05/04 06:00,2012/09/05 06:00,['2012/05/04 06:00'],"['2012/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2012.1789 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2012 Jul;28(1):21-6. doi: 10.3892/or.2012.1789.

Although Mcl-1 and p53 have been implicated in trophoblast cell death in preeclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), the mechanisms regulating their expression in the human placenta remains elusive. Herein, we investigated MULE's involvement in regulating Mcl-1 and p53 degradation during normal and abnormal (PE, IUGR) placental development. MULE expression peaked at 5-7 weeks of gestation, when oxygen tension is low and inversely correlated with that of Mcl-1 and p53. MULE efficiently bound to Mcl-1 and p53 and regulated their ubiquitination during placental development. Exposure of first trimester villous explants to 3% O(2) resulted in elevated MULE expression compared with 20% O(2). Low-oxygen-induced MULE expression in JEG3 choriocarcinoma cells was abolished by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha siRNA. MULE was overexpressed in both PE and IUGR placentae. In PE, MULE preferentially targeted p53 for degradation, allowing accumulation of pro-apoptotic Mcl-1 isoforms. In IUGR, however, MULE targeted pro-survival Mcl-1, allowing p53 to accumulate and exert its apoptotic function. These data demonstrate that oxygen regulates Mcl-1 and p53 stability during placentation via HIF-1-controlled MULE expression. The different preferential targets of MULE in PE and IUGR placentae classify early-onset PE and IUGR as distinct molecular pathologies.","['Rolfo, A', 'Garcia, J', 'Todros, T', 'Post, M', 'Caniggia, I']","['Rolfo A', 'Garcia J', 'Todros T', 'Post M', 'Caniggia I']","['Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120503,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (HUWE1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Fetal Growth Retardation/*metabolism/pathology', 'Gestational Age', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Placenta/*metabolism', 'Placentation', 'Pre-Eclampsia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Pregnancy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination']",2012/05/04 06:00,2012/07/24 06:00,['2012/05/04 06:00'],"['2012/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis201244 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2012.44 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2012 May 3;3:e305. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2012.44.,,['MOP-89813/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],PMC3366078,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ubiquitously expressed E3 ligase protein cereblon (CRBN) has been identified as the primary teratogenic target of thalidomide. Our studies demonstrate that thalidomide, lenalidomide and another immunomodulatory drug, pomalidomide, bound endogenous CRBN and recombinant CRBN-DNA damage binding protein-1 (DDB1) complexes. CRBN mediated antiproliferative activities of lenalidomide and pomalidomide in myeloma cells, as well as lenalidomide- and pomalidomide-induced cytokine production in T cells. Lenalidomide and pomalidomide inhibited autoubiquitination of CRBN in HEK293T cells expressing thalidomide-binding competent wild-type CRBN, but not thalidomide-binding defective CRBN(YW/AA). Overexpression of CRBN wild-type protein, but not CRBN(YW/AA) mutant protein, in KMS12 myeloma cells, amplified pomalidomide-mediated reductions in c-myc and IRF4 expression and increases in p21(WAF-1) expression. Long-term selection for lenalidomide resistance in H929 myeloma cell lines was accompanied by a reduction in CRBN, while in DF15R myeloma cells resistant to both pomalidomide and lenalidomide, CRBN protein was undetectable. Our biophysical, biochemical and gene silencing studies show that CRBN is a proximate, therapeutically important molecular target of lenalidomide and pomalidomide.","['Lopez-Girona, A', 'Mendy, D', 'Ito, T', 'Miller, K', 'Gandhi, A K', 'Kang, J', 'Karasawa, S', 'Carmel, G', 'Jackson, P', 'Abbasian, M', 'Mahmoudi, A', 'Cathers, B', 'Rychak, E', 'Gaidarova, S', 'Chen, R', 'Schafer, P H', 'Handa, H', 'Daniel, T O', 'Evans, J F', 'Chopra, R']","['Lopez-Girona A', 'Mendy D', 'Ito T', 'Miller K', 'Gandhi AK', 'Kang J', 'Karasawa S', 'Carmel G', 'Jackson P', 'Abbasian M', 'Mahmoudi A', 'Cathers B', 'Rychak E', 'Gaidarova S', 'Chen R', 'Schafer PH', 'Handa H', 'Daniel TO', 'Evans JF', 'Chopra R']","['Celgene, San Diego, CA 92121, USA. alopez@celgene.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120503,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CRBN protein, human)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'D2UX06XLB5 (pomalidomide)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*drug effects', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Ubiquitination']",2012/05/04 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/05/04 06:00'],"['2012/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012119 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.119 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Nov;26(11):2326-35. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.119.

In the UK, an estimated 560 new cases of CML are diagnosed each year. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of dasatinib and nilotinib in the treatment of people with imatinib-resistant (ImR) and imatinib-intolerant (ImI) CML. A systematic review of the clinical effectiveness literature, a review of manufacturer submissions and a critique and exploration of manufacturer submissions for accelerated phase and blast crisis CML were carried out and a decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of dasatinib and nilotinib in chronic phase CML. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW METHODS: Key databases were searched for relevant studies from their inception to June 2009 [MEDLINE (including MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations), EMBASE, (ISI Web of Science) Conference Proceedings Citation Index and four others]. One reviewer assessed titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy, with a sample checked by a second reviewer. The full text of relevant papers was obtained and screened against the full inclusion criteria independently by two reviewers. Data from included studies were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second. Clinical effectiveness studies were synthesised through narrative review. ECONOMIC EVALUATION METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analyses reported in manufacturer submissions to the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence were critically appraised and summarised narratively. In addition, the models for accelerated phase and blast crisis underwent a more detailed critique and exploration. Two separate decision-analytic models were developed for chronic phase CML, one simulating a cohort of individuals who have shown or developed resistance to normal dose imatinib and one representing individuals who have been unable to continue imatinib treatment owing to adverse events. One-way, multiway and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to explore structural and parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included in the systematic review. Chronic phase: effectiveness data were limited but dasatinib and nilotinib appeared efficacious in terms of obtaining cytogenetic response and haematological response in both ImR and ImI populations. In terms of cost-effectiveness, it was extremely difficult to reach any conclusions regarding either agent in the ImR population. All three models (Novartis, PenTAG and Bristol-Myers Squibb) were seriously flawed in one way or another, as a consequence of the paucity of data appropriate to construct robust decision-analytic models. Accelerated and blast crisis: all available data originated from observational single-arm studies and there were considerable and potentially important differences in baseline characteristics which seriously undermined any process for making meaningful comparisons between treatments. Owing to a lack of available clinical data, de novo models of accelerated phase and blast crisis have not been developed. The economic evaluations carried out by the manufacturers of nilotinib and dasatinib were seriously undermined by the absence of evidence on high-dose imatinib in these populations. LIMITATIONS: The study has been necessarily constrained by the paucity of available clinical data, the differences in definitions used in the studies and the subsequent impossibility of undertaking a meaningful cost-effectiveness analyses to inform all policy questions. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib and nilotinib appeared efficacious in terms of obtaining cytogenetic and haematological responses in both ImR and ImI populations. It was difficult to reach any cost-effectiveness conclusions as a consequence of the paucity of the data. Future research should include a three-way, double-blind, randomised clinical trial of dasatinib, nilotinib and high-dose imatinib.","['Rogers, G', 'Hoyle, M', 'Thompson Coon, J', 'Moxham, T', 'Liu, Z', 'Pitt, M', 'Stein, K']","['Rogers G', 'Hoyle M', 'Thompson Coon J', 'Moxham T', 'Liu Z', 'Pitt M', 'Stein K']","['Peninsula Technology Assessment Group (PenTAG), Peninsula Medical School, Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,England,Health Technol Assess,"Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)",9706284,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Dasatinib', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Health Care Costs/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/drug therapy', 'Models, Economic', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/economics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Quality of Life', 'Thiazoles/economics/*therapeutic use']",2012/05/04 06:00,2012/09/06 06:00,['2012/05/04 06:00'],"['2012/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3310/hta16220 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Technol Assess. 2012;16(22):1-410. doi: 10.3310/hta16220.,,,PMC4781389,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, 5 of 20 patients developed leukemia from activation of cellular proto-oncogenes by viral enhancers in the long-terminal repeats (LTR) of the integrated vector. These events prompted the design of a gRV vector with self-inactivating (SIN) LTRs to enhance vector safety. Herein we report on the production of a clinical-grade SIN IL2RG gRV pseudotyped with the Gibbon Ape Leukemia Virus envelope for a new gene therapy trial for SCID-X1, and highlight variables that were found to be critical for transfection-based large-scale SIN gRV production.

There was a significant correlation between detection of MRD by MFC and WT1 mRNA, as well as between MFC and fusion transcripts. Serial monitoring of MRD by the three techniques correlated in parallel to the clinical course in most of the patients, but three patients were only positive for WT1 during hematological remission. The overall survival time of patients with complete remission was significantly associated with the appearance of aberrant expression after transplantation. In conclusion, MFC is valuable for clinical management decisions after transplantation.","['Miyazaki, Takuya', 'Fujita, Hiroyuki', 'Fujimaki, Katsumichi', 'Hosoyama, Takeshi', 'Watanabe, Reina', 'Tachibana, Takayoshi', 'Fujita, Atsuko', 'Matsumoto, Kenji', 'Tanaka, Masatsugu', 'Koharazawa, Hideyuki', 'Taguchi, Jun', 'Tomita, Naoto', 'Sakai, Rika', 'Fujisawa, Shin', 'Kanamori, Heiwa', 'Ishigatsubo, Yoshiaki']","['Miyazaki T', 'Fujita H', 'Fujimaki K', 'Hosoyama T', 'Watanabe R', 'Tachibana T', 'Fujita A', 'Matsumoto K', 'Tanaka M', 'Koharazawa H', 'Taguchi J', 'Tomita N', 'Sakai R', 'Fujisawa S', 'Kanamori H', 'Ishigatsubo Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20120430,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/genetics', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/methods', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'WT1 Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Young Adult']",2012/05/04 06:00,2012/09/06 06:00,['2012/05/04 06:00'],"['2011/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(12)00180-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2012.04.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2012 Aug;36(8):998-1003. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2012.04.005.

However, the question of whether TNF inhibitors increase the risk of malignancies (including lymphoma and leukaemia) in these diseases remains controversial. Despite this concern, anti-TNF therapy is being used experimentally in the management of haematological patients with risk of leukaemic transformation such as myeloproliferative neoplasms. We report here the first ever reported case of blastic transformation in a patient with myelofibrosis under etanercept treatment for a severe hidradenitis suppurativa. Although etanercept provided a sustained partial response of the skin disease, the patient developed an acute myeloid leukaemia after 27 months on exclusively etanercept therapy. According to the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System-plus score, the patient had a low risk for leukaemic transformation. We discuss here the potential of TNF inhibitors to increase the already elevated risk of leukaemic transformation of these haematological diseases.","['Ferrer-Marin, Francisca', 'Amigo, Maria Luz', 'Vicente, Vicente']","['Ferrer-Marin F', 'Amigo ML', 'Vicente V']","['Unidad de Hematologia y Oncologia Medica, Hospital Universitario Morales-Meseguer, Murcia, Spain. fferrermarin@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,New Zealand,Clin Drug Investig,Clinical drug investigation,9504817,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'OP401G7OJC (Etanercept)']",IM,"['Disease Progression', 'Etanercept', 'Hidradenitis Suppurativa/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*chemically induced', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2012/05/04 06:00,2012/08/31 06:00,['2012/05/04 06:00'],"['2012/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2165/11599850-000000000-00000 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Drug Investig. 2012 Jun 1;32(6):423-6. doi: 10.2165/11599850-000000000-00000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address these issues, the hypothesis tested in this study was that mannose functionalized nanohybrids composed of synthetic and natural polymers will improve transfection efficiency, cell viability, and cell specificity in macrophages. Robust nanohybrids were designed from hyaluronic acid (HA) and branched polyethyleneimine (bPEI) using carbodiimide chemistry. The reaction product, i.e., branched polyethyleneimine-hyaluronic acid (bPEI-HA) copolymer was subsequently functionalized with mannose at the terminal end of the copolymer to obtain mannosylated-bPEI-HA (Man-bPEI-HA) copolymer. UV spectroscopy and gel retardation studies confirmed the formation of polyplexes at polymer to DNA weight ratio >/= 2. Alamar Blue and MTT assay revealed that the cytotoxicity of the developed nanohybrids were significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that of unmodified bPEI. Mannose functionalization of these nanohybrids showed specificity for both murine and human macrophage-like cell lines RAW 264.7 and human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP1), respectively, with a significant level (P < 0.05) of expression of gaussia luciferase (GLuc) and green fluorescent reporter plasmids. Internalization studies indicate that a mannose mediated endocytic pathway is responsible for this higher transfection rate. These results suggest that hyaluronan-based mannosylated nanohybrids could be used as efficient carriers for targeted gene delivery to macrophages.","['Mahor, Sunil', 'Dash, Biraja C', ""O'Connor, Stephen"", 'Pandit, Abhay']","['Mahor S', 'Dash BC', ""O'Connor S"", 'Pandit A']","['Network of Excellence for Functional Biomaterials, National University of Ireland , IDA Business Park, Galway, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120510,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,"['0 (branched polyethylenimine-hyaluronic acid)', '9002-98-6 (Polyethyleneimine)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/*administration & dosage/genetics', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/toxicity', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mannose/*chemistry/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Nanostructures/*chemistry/toxicity', 'Polyethyleneimine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/toxicity', '*Transfection']",2012/05/04 06:00,2014/09/26 06:00,['2012/05/04 06:00'],"['2012/05/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bc200599k [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2012 Jun 20;23(6):1138-48. doi: 10.1021/bc200599k.

Sex disparities in pediatric leukemia have been previously reported, and male children continue to present with poorer survival. However, the observed disparities are not fully understood. This current study sought to examine disparities in survival by the sex, and to determine if tumor prognostic factors impact on these disparities. Patients and Methods. We used the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results dataset of pediatric leukemia patients (ages 0-19 years) diagnosed in the United States from 1973 to 2006. There were 15,215 patients of whom 8,622 (65.7%) were boys and 6,593 (43.3%) were girls. The Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, log rank test, and Cox proportional hazard methods were used to assess the data. Results. The overall (both sexes) five-year survival rate was 67.9%. Girls had a survival rate of 70.1%, while the rate was 66.3% in boys. Girls had a significant 14% decreased risk of dying relative to boys, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.86, 99% CI = 0.80-0.93. There were significant differences between boys and girls with respect to tumor cell type, race, age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, and number of primaries, P < 0.001. After controlling for these factors, the sex differences in survival persisted, with girls still less likely to die from leukemia compared to boys, adjusted HR (AHR) = 0.85, 99% CI = 0.72-1.00, P < 0.01. Conclusion. In a large population-based pediatric leukemia study, boys continued to show poorer survival. These disparities were not completely explained by treatment received, tumor prognostic or socio-demographic factors.","['Holmes, L Jr', 'Hossain, J', 'Desvignes-Kendrick, M', 'Opara, F']","['Holmes L Jr', 'Hossain J', 'Desvignes-Kendrick M', 'Opara F']","['American Health Research Institute, Heights Medical Tower, Houston, TX 77008, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120403,Egypt,ISRN Oncol,ISRN oncology,101567026,,,,2012/05/03 06:00,2012/05/03 06:01,['2012/05/03 06:00'],"['2011/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5402/2012/439070 [doi]'],ppublish,ISRN Oncol. 2012;2012:439070. doi: 10.5402/2012/439070.

He responded poorly to induction chemotherapy with cytarabine/idarubicin followed by high dose cytarabine and succumbed to neutropenic sepsis. Multiple systematic reviews, observational studies and clinical trials were conducted to identify the toxicity profile of hydroxurea. Only six cases of leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome were identified in patients with sickle cell anemia treated with hydroxyurea. Subsequently, it was concluded that hydroxyurea is not leukemogenic. However, it was noted that most of the published studies had only up to 9 years of follow-up. Our patient was started on hydroxyurea in 1990, before the widespread use of the drug and took hydroxyurea for 15 years.

For this purpose the soluble DC-SIGN/Fc adhesion assay and the THP-1 leukemia cells with induced expression of DC-SIGN were used. We showed that the binding specificity of DC-SIGN with H. pylori Le(X/Y) positive whole cells and H. pylori LPS of Le(X/Y) type was fucose dependent, whereas in Le(XY) negative H. pylori strains and LPS preparations without Lewis determinants, this binding was galactose dependent. The binding of soluble synthetic Le(X) and Le(Y) to the DC-SIGN-like receptor on THP-1 cells was also observed. In conclusion, the Le(XY) dependent as well as independent binding of H. pylori whole cells and H. pylori LPS to DC-SIGN was described.

We aimed to evaluate to what extent human malignant AML cells use NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) as an immune evasion strategy. We report that a subset of malignant myelomonocytic and monocytic AML cells (French-American-British [FAB] classes M4 and M5, respectively), recovered from blood or BM of untreated AML patients at diagnosis, expressed the NADPH oxidase component gp91(phox). Highly purified FAB M4/M5 AML cells produced large amounts of ROS on activation and triggered poly-[ADP-ribose] polymerase-1-dependent apoptosis in adjacent NK cells, CD4(+) T cells, and CD8(+) T cells. In contrast, immature (FAB class M1) and myeloblastic (FAB class M2) AML cells rarely expressed gp91(phox), did not produce ROS, and did not trigger NK or T-cell apoptosis. Microarray data from 207 AML patients confirmed a greater expression of gp91(phox) mRNA by FAB-M4/M5 AML cells than FAB-M1 cells (P < 10(-11)) or FAB-M2 cells (P < 10(-9)).

However, c-Abl has not been directly targeted to the mitochondria. Fusing c-Abl to a mitochondrial translocation signal (MTS) that is activated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) will selectively target the mitochondria of cancer cells exhibiting an elevated ROS phenotype. Mitochondrially targeted c-Abl will thereby induce malignant cell death. METHODS: Confocal microscopy was used to determine mitochondrial colocalization of ectopically expressed c-Abl-EGFP/cMTS fusion across three cell lines (K562, Cos-7, and 1471.1) with varying levels of basal (and pharmacologically modulated) ROS. ROS were quantified by indicator dye assay. The functional consequences of mitochondrial c-Abl were assessed by DNA accessibility to 7-AAD using flow cytometry. RESULTS: The cMTS and cMTS/c-Abl fusions colocalized to the mitochondria in leukemic (K562) and breast (1471.1) cancer phenotypes (but not Cos-7 fibroblasts) in a ROS and PKC dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm and extend oxidative stress activated translocation of the cMTS by demonstrating that the cMTS and Abl/cMTS fusion selectively target the mitochondria of K562 leukemia and mammary adenocarcinoma 1471.1 cells. c-Abl induced K562 leukemia cell death when targeted to the matrix but not the outer membrane of the mitochondria.","['Constance, Jonathan E', 'Despres, Samuel D', 'Nishida, Akemi', 'Lim, Carol S']","['Constance JE', 'Despres SD', 'Nishida A', 'Lim CS']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah 84108, USA.

It is unclear whether azacytidine can alter the proliferative and apoptotic changes in myeloid leukemia cells, and methylation changes induced by this drug have remained poorly characterized in therapy-related models. METHODS: The proliferation rate of azacytidine on HL60 cells was determined by the MTT protocol. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and RT-PCR were used respectively to detect gene methylation status changes and expression levels of p16, Death associated protein kinase (DAPK) and O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) before and after treatment with azacytidine. RESULTS: Azacytidine inhibited HL60 cell proliferation and showed a time- and dose-dependent effect. MSP showed hypermethylated p16, DAPK, and MGMT genes before azacytidine treatment. Complete demethylation was seen in p16 and DAPK genes and partial demethylation in the MGMT gene after co-culture with azacytidine. The expression level of p16, DAPK and MGMT genes in HL60 cells was up-regulated after treatment with azacytidine. CONCLUSIONS: The CpG islands of p16, DAPK and MGMT genes are hypermethylated in HL60 cells. Azacytidine inhibits proliferation of leukemic cells by hypomethylation of p16, DAPK and MGMT genes.","['Su, Yongchun', 'Xu, Hongzhen', 'Xu, Youhua', 'Yu, Jie', 'Xian, Ying', 'Luo, Qing']","['Su Y', 'Xu H', 'Xu Y', 'Yu J', 'Xian Y', 'Luo Q']","[""Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (MGMT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Death-Associated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Azacitidine/*pharmacology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands/drug effects', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/*genetics/metabolism', 'Death-Associated Protein Kinases', 'Genes, Regulator/drug effects', 'Genes, p16/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",2012/05/03 06:00,2012/09/21 06:00,['2012/05/03 06:00'],"['2012/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453312X13221316477624 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2012 Jan;17(1):41-6. doi: 10.1179/102453312X13221316477624.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it has been considered that BCR/ABL oncogene is a potential attractive target for anticancer agents. Antisense strategies aiming to suppress the expression of BCR/ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia cells have been studied by several research groups over the last decade. In the present study, the effect of Morpholino Oligo Antisense in BCR/ABL oncogene silencing was evaluated. To examine the hypothesis, K562 was used as a BCR/ABL fusion gene positive cell line using a Jurkat cell line as a control. The capacity of Morpholino Oligo Antisense in inhibiting the translation of p210(bcr-abl) protein by a western blotting technique, inhibition of cell proliferation, and stimulation of apoptosis by flow cytometric analysis after 24 and 48 hours was studied. Prolonged exposure of K562 cell line to Morpholino Oligo Antisense targeted against BCR-ABL showed proliferation inhibition as the main feature. Following western blotting, we found that complete silencing of BCR-ABL had been achieved but flow cytometric analysis showed no significant apoptosis. The results indicate that Morpholino Oligo Antisense was able to inhibit p210(bcr-abl), but did not induce apoptosis due to co-silencing of BCR.","['Haririan, Mahmoud', 'Kaviani, Saeid', 'Soleimani, Masoud', 'Ghaemi, Soraya Rasi', 'Delalat, Bahman', 'Atashi, Amir']","['Haririan M', 'Kaviani S', 'Soleimani M', 'Ghaemi SR', 'Delalat B', 'Atashi A']","['Department of Hematology, School of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Morpholinos)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Morpholinos/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics/*pharmacology']",2012/05/03 06:00,2012/09/21 06:00,['2012/05/03 06:00'],"['2012/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453311X13127324303470 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2012 Jan;17(1):28-34. doi: 10.1179/102453311X13127324303470.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were 97 (15.4%) children and 534 (84.6%) adults. RESULTS: Abnormal karyotypes were found in 397 (62.9%) of all cases. T(15;17) and t(8;21) were the most frequent chromosomal abnormalities observed in 83 (13.2%) and in 78 (12.4%) patients, respectively. -5/del(5q) and -7/del(7q) were less frequent, seen in only 14 (2.2%) and 19 (3%) cases, respectively.

For example, gene expression data has been analyzed to reveal novel disease subtypes (class discovery) and assign particular samples to well-defined classes (class prediction). In the past decade, many effective methods have been proposed for individual applications. However, there is still a pressing need for a unified framework that can reveal the complicated relationships between samples. RESULTS: We propose a novel convex optimization model to perform class discovery and class prediction in a unified framework. An efficient algorithm is designed and software named OTCC (Optimization Tool for Clustering and Classification) is developed. Comparison in a simulated dataset shows that our method outperforms the existing methods. We then applied OTCC to acute leukemia and breast cancer datasets. The results demonstrate that our method not only can reveal the subtle structures underlying those cancer gene expression data but also can accurately predict the class labels of unknown cancer samples. Therefore, our method holds the promise to identify novel cancer subtypes and improve diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a unified computational framework for class discovery and class prediction to facilitate the discovery and prediction of subtle subtypes of cancers. Our method can be generally applied to multiple types of measurements, e.g., gene expression profiling, proteomic measuring, and recent next-generation sequencing, since it only requires the similarities among samples as input.","['Ren, Xianwen', 'Wang, Yong', 'Wang, Jiguang', 'Zhang, Xiang-Sun']","['Ren X', 'Wang Y', 'Wang J', 'Zhang XS']","['MOH Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120501,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Breast Neoplasms/classification/genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology/*methods', '*Computer Simulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*classification/genetics', 'Software']",2012/05/03 06:00,2013/05/17 06:00,['2012/05/03 06:00'],"['2011/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-13-70 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-13-70 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2012 May 1;13:70. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-13-70.,,,PMC3464623,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FINDINGS: A broad distribution of ZAP70 expression was observed in ALL, ranging from 0.002 to 5.3 fold that of the ZAP70 positive Jurkat reference cell line. No association was observed between expression levels and the presence of specific cytogenetic abnormalities. Five cases, including one case of T-ALL, had ZAP70 expression above the level of the Jurkat reference cell line. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the frequent expression of ZAP70 in adult ALL. Limited comparisons made did highlight poor-risk patients with high ZAP70 expression, but due to lack of clinical information on patient samples we were unable to directly assess the impact on disease prognosis.

Bone marrow (BM) was massively infiltrated with 85 % highly proliferative polymorphic T-cell precursors. Immunologically, the malignant cells stained positive for CD7, CD34, intracytoplasmic CD3+, TdT + and negative for CD3 and CD5. G-banded chromosome analysis of BM cells showed the normal karyotype 46,XY[25] whereas BAC-based aCGH analysis revealed partial gain of 4q and partial loss of 5q. Multicolor karyotyping confirmed the presence of an unbalanced der(5)t(4;5) as the sole structural abnormality. Subsequent high-resolution oligonucleotide-based aCGH analysis showed that the der(5)t(4;5)(q26;q21.1) resulted in partial trisomy of 4q26qter (117,719,015-190,613,014) and partial monosomy of 5q21.1qter (100,425,442-180,857,866) and that there was no indication of any gene disruptions resulting from the breakages. Interphase FISH analysis using BAC-based specific probes for 4q26 and 5q21.1 confirmed the breakpoints and revealed approximately 80 % abnormal cells accordingly. At 4q26 the MIR1973 gene is located centromeric to the breakpoint in the copy number neutral region and the TRAM1L1 gene is located within the gained region. At 5q21.1 the genes ST8SIA4 and MIR548p are located centromeric to the breakpoint and no known genes up to approximately 1 Mb telomeric to the breakpoint in the copy number loss region. Interestingly, only the gene ST8SIA4 at 5q21.1 have been implicated in T-cell regulation as it encodes one of the key enzymes for polysialysation of surface proteins on dendritic cells which are important regulators for T-cell proliferation. The der(5)t(4;5) is thought to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acute T-ALL due to either gain of 4q, the loss of 5q, or deregulation of genes in proximity to the breakpoints.","['Kjeldsen, Eigil', 'Roug, Anne Stidsholt']","['Kjeldsen E', 'Roug AS']","['Cancer Cytogenetics Laboratory, Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Tage-Hansensgade 2, DK-8000, Aarhus C, Denmark.

Therefore, genetic variants of NOXA and MCL1 may modify the SCCHN risk associated with HPV16 seropositivity. METHODS: HPV16 serology was obtained by immunoadsorption assay. Four functional SNPs in the promoter of NOXA (rs9957673, rs4558496) and MCL1 (rs9803935, rs3738485) were genotyped for 380 cases and 335 frequency-matched cancer-free controls of non-Hispanic whites. RESULTS: Associations between the four polymorphisms and SCCHN risk were not significant, while we observed a significantly joint effect on SCCHN risk between the polymorphisms and HPV16 seropositivity. Notably, this effect modification was particularly pronounced for oropharyngeal cancer in subgroups including never smokers, never drinkers and younger subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that polymorphisms of NOXA and MCL1 may modify the risk of HPV16-associated oropharyngeal cancer. The further identification of population subgroups at higher risk provides evidence that HPV-targeting treatment may help benefit SCCHN. However, larger studies are needed to validate our findings.","['Zhou, Ziyuan', 'Sturgis, Erich M', 'Liu, Zhensheng', 'Wang, Li-E', 'Wei, Qingyi', 'Li, Guojun']","['Zhou Z', 'Sturgis EM', 'Liu Z', 'Wang LE', 'Wei Q', 'Li G']","['Department of Epidemiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120501,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*genetics/*virology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*genetics/*virology', 'Human papillomavirus 16/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Papillomavirus Infections/*complications', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Risk', 'Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck', 'Young Adult']",2012/05/03 06:00,2013/01/18 06:00,['2012/05/03 06:00'],"['2011/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-12-159 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-12-159 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2012 May 1;12:159. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-12-159.,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES011740/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'K07 CA133099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA131274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K-12 CA88084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA133099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA135679/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3428689,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancers have been shown to be associated with increased Hsp72 expression within the tumour itself and this may lead to resistance to apoptosis. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from patients diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (n = 27) and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) (n = 16) and Hsp72 expression was characterized on both the cell surface and intracellularly by flow cytometry. To allow for comparison PBMC from breast cancer patients (n = 25) and healthy volunteers (n = 19) were included. RESULTS: Both lymphocytes and monocytes from CLL and CMML patients showed high levels of total Hsp72 expression (4-6 fold increase) in comparison to breast cancer and healthy subjects. The majority of Hsp72 in these tumours was determined to be cell-surface expressed (64-93% of cell total Hsp72). CONCLUSIONS: A correlation was observed between lymphocyte and monocyte total Hsp72 expression (p < 0.001) suggesting a common stress response pathway may exist in these blood cells and there are stress conditions present within the circulation.

Results from ongoing phase 3 trials with nilotinib [Efficacy and Safety in Clinical Trials-Newly Diagnosed Patients (ENESTnd)] and dasatinib [Dasatinib Versus Imatinib Study in Treatment-Naive CML-CP Patients (DASISION)] in newly diagnosed patients with CML in chronic phase have demonstrated that these TKIs resulted in significant improvements in responses vs. imatinib. DESIGN: The Developmental Therapeutics Consortium (DTC) systematically reviewed the published literature to provide a comparative analysis of the ENESTnd and DASISION trial designs and data reported on each study. RESULTS: The recent approval of nilotinib and dasatinib based on these two pivotal studies offers physicians the option to optimise frontline treatment based on a patient's comorbidities, risk factors and tolerability profiles. Although nilotinib and dasatinib provide effective therapeutic options for the frontline treatment of CML, the lack of an evidenced-based, side-by-side comparison makes it difficult to directly compare these agents. CONCLUSIONS: Despite potential bias from differences in patient populations and study design, indirect cross-trial comparisons to determine the relative effectiveness of these agents will be performed by physicians. This DTC report provides a comprehensive summary of the study designs, protocols and results of the ENESTnd and DASISION trials, which will assist physicians in making informed decisions on the best treatment approach for their patients.","['Giles, Francis', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn', 'Swords, Ronan', 'Labar, Boris', 'Turkina, Anna', 'Rosti, Gianantonio']","['Giles F', 'Mahon FX', 'Gjertsen B', 'Swords R', 'Labar B', 'Turkina A', 'Rosti G']","['HRB Clinical Research Facility, National University of Ireland Galway and Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland. frankgiles@aol.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120501,England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dasatinib', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/classification/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Research Design', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/05/03 06:00,2012/12/27 06:00,['2012/05/03 06:00'],"['2012/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2362.2012.02675.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 2012 Sep;42(9):1016-26. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2012.02675.x.

To understand the function of Cdk2ap2 during early development, we generated mESCs with homozygous disruption of the endogenous Cdk2ap2 locus (Cdk2ap2(tr/tr)). The Cdk2ap2(tr/tr) mESCs, when grown in a complete growth medium containing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), showed an early differentiation phenotype characterized by flattened colonies and a distinct intercellular boundary. We also observed downregulation of Nanog and upregulation in markers of mesoderm and endoderm differentiation, including Brachyury (T), Afp, and S100a, when compared to Wt mESCs. Cdk2ap2(tr/tr) mESCs were able to form embryoid bodies (EBs); however, those EBs were unhealthy and had an increased level of apoptosis. Furthermore, Cdk2ap2(tr/tr) mESCs were unable to form teratomas in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Cdk2ap2 under normal conditions has a biphasic expression, suggesting regulatory roles in early-versus-late stem cell differentiation. These data begin to add to our understanding of how Cdk2ap2 may be involved in the regulation of self-renewal of stem cells during early embryogenesis.","['Deshpande, Amit M', 'Khalid, Omar', 'Kim, Jeffrey J', 'Kim, Yong', 'Lindgren, Anne', 'Clark, Amander T', 'Wong, David T W']","['Deshpande AM', 'Khalid O', 'Kim JJ', 'Kim Y', 'Lindgren A', 'Clark AT', 'Wong DT']","['School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, UCLA, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA. adeshpan@alumni.uconn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120625,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Doc-1r protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Embryoid Bodies/cytology/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Endoderm/cytology', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genotype', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mesoderm/cytology', 'Mice', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Teratoma/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",2012/05/03 06:00,2013/03/27 06:00,['2012/05/03 06:00'],"['2012/05/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2012.0007 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2012 Nov 1;21(16):3010-8. doi: 10.1089/scd.2012.0007.

LSCs are derived from normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), residing at the apex of leukemia cells and hiding in the bone marrow (BM) niche to evade chemotherapy. Novel therapy is strongly needed based on the unique features of LSCs to directly target these cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs, are now known to play important roles on cancer stem cell maintenance and differentiation. Because of the ability of miRNAs to inactivate either specific genes or entire gene families, strategies based on differential expression levels of miRNAs in LSCs as dominant activators or suppressors of gene activity have emerged as promising new candidate approaches for eradicating LSCs. In this review, we highlight new findings regarding the roles of miRNAs in LSC maintenance of quiescence repression, self-renewal, surface marker targeting, and the LSCBM niche interaction.

We studied this factor in the setting of a low-income province in 165 patients treated on Indonesian WK-ALL-2000 protocol between 1999 and 2006. Poor early response, defined as a peripheral lymphoblasts count of >/=1000/muL after 7 days of oral dexamethasone plus one intrathecal methotrexate (MTX), occurred in 19.4% of the patients. Poor responders showed a higher probability of induction failures compared to good responders (53.1% versus 23.3%, P < 0.01), higher probability of resistant disease (15.6% versus 4.5%, P = 0.02), shorter disease-free survival (P = 0.034; 5-year DFS: 24.9% +/- 12.1% versus 48.6% +/- 5.7%), and shorter event-free survival (P = 0.002; 5-year EFS: 9.7% +/- 5.3% versus 26.3% +/- 3.8%). We observed that the percentage of poor responders in our setting was higher than reported for Western countries with prednisone or prednisolone as the steroids. The study did not demonstrate a significant additive prognostic value of early response over other known risk factors (age and white blood cell count) for DFS and only a moderately added value for EFS.","['Widjajanto, Pudjo H', 'Sutaryo, Sutaryo', 'Purwanto, Ignatius', 'Ven, Peter M Vd', 'Veerman, Anjo J P']","['Widjajanto PH', 'Sutaryo S', 'Purwanto I', 'Ven PM', 'Veerman AJ']","['Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Division, Department of Pediatrics, Dr. Sardjito Hospital, Medical Faculty, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120403,Egypt,J Oncol,Journal of oncology,101496537,,,,2012/05/02 06:00,2012/05/02 06:01,['2012/05/02 06:00'],"['2011/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/24 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2012/417941 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol. 2012;2012:417941. doi: 10.1155/2012/417941.

First, cellular furin separates the receptor binding surface (SU) subunit from the fusion-active transmembrane (TM) subunit and then, in the newly assembled particle, the viral protease removes a 16-residue peptide, the R-peptide from the endodomain of the TM. Both cleavage events are required to prime the Env for receptor-triggered activation. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) analyses have shown that the mature Env forms an open cage-like structure composed of three SU-TM complexes, where the TM subunits formed separated Env legs. Here we have studied the structure of the R-peptide precursor Env by cryo-EM. TM cleavage in Moloney murine leukemia virus was inhibited by amprenavir, and the Envs were solubilized in Triton X-100 and isolated by sedimentation in a sucrose gradient. We found that the legs of the R-peptide Env were held together by trimeric interactions at the very bottom of the Env. This suggested that the R-peptide ties the TM legs together and that this prevents the activation of the TM for fusion. The model was supported by further cryo-EM studies using an R-peptide Env mutant that was fusion-competent despite an uncleaved R-peptide. The Env legs of this mutant were found to be separated, like in the mature Env. This shows that it is the TM leg separation, normally caused by R-peptide cleavage, that primes the Env for receptor triggering.","['Loving, Robin', 'Wu, Shang-Rung', 'Sjoberg, Mathilda', 'Lindqvist, Birgitta', 'Garoff, Henrik']","['Loving R', 'Wu SR', 'Sjoberg M', 'Lindqvist B', 'Garoff H']","['Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institute, S-141 57 Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120430,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '9002-93-1 (Octoxynol)']",IM,"['Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fractionation, Field Flow', 'Gene Products, env/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', '*Models, Molecular', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Octoxynol', '*Protein Conformation', 'Protein Precursors/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Subunits/metabolism']",2012/05/02 06:00,2012/07/28 06:00,['2012/05/02 06:00'],"['2012/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1118125109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1118125109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 May 15;109(20):7735-40. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1118125109.

Understanding the mechanisms underlying this heterogeneity is critical for personalized targeted therapies. Here, we used a recently established LC-MS/MS platform to profile protein phosphorylation in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines with different sensitivities to kinase inhibitors. The compounds used in this study were originally developed to target Janus kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and MEK. After further validation of the technique, we identified several phosphorylation sites that were inhibited by these compounds but whose intensities did not always correlate with growth inhibition sensitivity. In contrast, several hundred phosphorylation sites that correlated with sensitivity/resistance were not in general inhibited by the compounds. These results indicate that markers of pathway activity may not always be reliable indicators of sensitivity of cancer cells to inhibitors that target such pathways, because the activity of parallel kinases can contribute to resistance. By mining our data we identified protein kinase C isoforms as one of such parallel pathways being more active in resistant cells. Consistent with the view that several parallel kinase pathways were contributing to resistance, inhibitors that target protein kinase C, MEK, and Janus kinase potentiated each other in arresting the proliferation of multidrug-resistant cells. Untargeted/unbiased approaches, such as the one described here, to quantify the activity of the intended target kinase pathway in concert with the activities of parallel kinase pathways will be invaluable to personalize therapies based on kinase inhibitors.","['Alcolea, Maria P', 'Casado, Pedro', 'Rodriguez-Prados, Juan-Carlos', 'Vanhaesebroeck, Bart', 'Cutillas, Pedro R']","['Alcolea MP', 'Casado P', 'Rodriguez-Prados JC', 'Vanhaesebroeck B', 'Cutillas PR']","['Analytical Signalling Group, Centre for Cell Signalling, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London EC1M 6BQ, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120429,United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Phosphopeptides/analysis/classification/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*analysis/classification/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",2012/05/02 06:00,2012/12/22 06:00,['2012/05/02 06:00'],"['2012/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-9476(20)32991-1 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M112.017483 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2012 Aug;11(8):453-66. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M112.017483.

MYC is one of the direct targets of AFF4/SEC, and SEC recruitment to the MYC gene regulates its expression in different cancer cells, including those in acute myeloid or lymphoid leukemia.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome after autologous stem-cell transplantation (autoSCT) or allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (alloSCT) in RS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A survey was sent to all European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation centers assessing transplantations performed for RS. Eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of RS or secondary lymphoma before SCT, age >/= 18 years, and SCT performed from 1997 to 2007. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and methods from survival analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients were registered. Thirty-four patients had received autoSCT, mostly because of chemotherapy-sensitive disease, and 25 had received alloSCT, with 36% being refractory to chemotherapy at SCT. In 18 allograft recipients (72%), reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) was used. Three-year estimates of the probabilities of overall survival and relapse-free survival (RFS) and the cumulative incidences of relapse and nonrelapse mortality were 36%, 27%, 47%, and 26% for alloSCT and 59%, 45%, 43%, and 12% for autoSCT, respectively. Taking into account the limitations set by the low number of events and age younger than 60 years, chemotherapy-sensitive disease and RIC were found to be associated with superior RFS after alloSCT in multivariate analysis. Factors with a significant impact on autoSCT could not be identified. CONCLUSION: Patients with RS who are sensitive to induction chemotherapy appear to benefit from consolidation with transplantation strategies, and prolonged survival was observed in a proportion of patients.","['Cwynarski, Kate', 'van Biezen, Anja', 'de Wreede, Liesbeth', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Metzner, Bernd', 'Koza, Vladimir', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Remes, Kari', 'Russell, Nigel', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Scholten, Marijke', 'de Witte, Theo', 'Sureda, Anna', 'Dreger, Peter']","['Cwynarski K', 'van Biezen A', 'de Wreede L', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Bunjes D', 'Metzner B', 'Koza V', 'Mohty M', 'Remes K', 'Russell N', 'Nagler A', 'Scholten M', 'de Witte T', 'Sureda A', 'Dreger P']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, Pond St, London, NW3 2QG, United Kingdom. kate.cwynarski@nhs.net']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120430,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications', 'Lymphoma/ethnology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2012/05/02 06:00,2012/08/17 06:00,['2012/05/02 06:00'],"['2012/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.37.4108 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.37.4108 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Jun 20;30(18):2211-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.37.4108.

We determined whether recent improved treatment had narrowed the gap in outcome between black and white pediatric patients.

RESULTS: Analysis of the SEER data indicated that in both study periods, black patients had significantly poorer rates of survival than did white patients, with the exception of a few types of cancer. Despite significantly improved treatment outcomes for patients who were treated from 2001 to 2007, the racial difference in survival has actually widened for acute myeloid leukemia and neuroblastoma. By contrast, in the cohorts treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital, there were no significant differences in survival between black and white patients in either study period, regardless of the cancer type. Importantly, the outcome of treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and retinoblastoma has improved in parallel for both races during the most recent study period.

Therapeutic stratification based on response to the prephase treatment and on minimal residual disease assessment is well established in T-ALL but is not easy to extrapolate to T-LBL. The identification of molecular prognostic markers at diagnosis in T-LBL could provide an alternative for early therapeutic stratification. Our study determines the frequency and prognostic value of NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations (N/F(mut)), FLASH deletion at chromosome 6q, and TCR rearrangements in a prospective cohort of pediatric T-LBL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pathologic samples were obtained at diagnosis for 54 patients treated according to the EuroLB02 protocol in France. N/F(mut) were identified by direct sequencing and allelic dosage was used to detect FLASH and TCRgamma deletions, which were interpreted in conjunction with TCRgamma, TCRbeta, and TCRdelta rearrangements. RESULTS: N/F(mut) were found in 55% of T-LBL patients, in whom they were associated with improved event-free survival (P < .01) and overall survival (P < .01). FLASH monoallelic deletions were observed in 18% of patients; they were predominantly N/F wild-type (six of nine) and tended to be of inferior prognosis (P = .09). Absence of biallelic TCRgamma deletion (ABD) was seen in 7%, all of which were N/F(mut) and identified a poor prognosis group (P = .02). On multivariate analysis of N/F(mut), TCRgamma ABD, and FLASH deletion, only N/F(mut) was an independent factor for good prognosis. CONCLUSION: Mutational status of NOTCH1/FBXW7 represents a promising marker for early therapeutic stratification in pediatric T-LBL.","['Callens, Celine', 'Baleydier, Frederic', 'Lengline, Etienne', 'Ben Abdelali, Raouf', 'Petit, Arnaud', 'Villarese, Patrick', 'Cieslak, Agata', 'Minard-Colin, Veronique', 'Rullier, Anne', 'Moreau, Anne', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Schmitt, Claudine', 'Asnafi, Vahid', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth']","['Callens C', 'Baleydier F', 'Lengline E', 'Ben Abdelali R', 'Petit A', 'Villarese P', 'Cieslak A', 'Minard-Colin V', 'Rullier A', 'Moreau A', 'Baruchel A', 'Schmitt C', 'Asnafi V', 'Bertrand Y', 'Macintyre E']","['Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cite, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120430,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CASP8AP2 protein, human)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'F-Box Proteins/*genetics', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics']",2012/05/02 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2012/05/02 06:00'],"['2012/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.39.7661 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.39.7661 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 Jun 1;30(16):1966-73. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.39.7661.

We have demonstrated previously that impaired actin polymerization at the T-cell immunologic synapse is a global immune dysfunction in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Direct contact with tumor cells induces defective actin polarization at the synapse in previously healthy T cells, but the molecules mediating this dysfunction were not known. In the present study, we show via functional screening assays that CD200, CD270, CD274, and CD276 are coopted by CLL cells to induce impaired actin synapse formation in both allogeneic and autologous T cells. We also show that inhibitory ligand-induced impairment of T-cell actin dynamics is a common immunosuppressive strategy used by both hematologic (including lymphoma) and solid carcinoma cells. This immunosuppressive signaling targets T-cell Rho-GTPase activation. Of clinical relevance, the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide prevented the induction of these defects by down-regulating tumor cell-inhibitory molecule expression. These results using human CLL as a model cancer establish a novel evasion mechanism whereby malignant cells exploit multiple inhibitory ligand signaling to down-regulate small GTPases and lytic synapse function in global T-cell populations. These findings should contribute to the design of immunotherapeutic strategies to reverse T-cell tolerance in cancer.","['Ramsay, Alan G', 'Clear, Andrew J', 'Fatah, Rewas', 'Gribben, John G']","['Ramsay AG', 'Clear AJ', 'Fatah R', 'Gribben JG']","['Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom. a.ramsay@qmul.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120430,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Ligands)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/immunology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immune Evasion/*drug effects', 'Immunologic Factors/pharmacology', 'Immunological Synapses/*drug effects/immunology', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*immunology/physiopathology', 'Ligands', 'Polymerization/drug effects', 'Prognosis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology/*immunology', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/immunology', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism']",2012/05/02 06:00,2012/11/02 06:00,['2012/05/02 06:00'],"['2012/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46493-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-02-411678 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Aug 16;120(7):1412-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-02-411678.

More recently, similar roles have also become apparent for members of the ParaHox gene cluster, evolutionarily closely related to the Hox gene cluster. This is in particular found for the caudal-type homeobox genes (Cdx) genes, known to act as upstream regulators of Hox genes. The CDX gene family member CDX2 belongs to the most frequent aberrantly expressed proto-oncogenes in human acute leukemias and is highly leukemogenic in experimental models. Correlative studies indicate that CDX2 functions as master regulator of perturbed HOX gene expression in human acute myeloid leukemia, locating this ParaHox gene at a central position for initiating and maintaining HOX gene dysregulation as a driving leukemogenic force. There are still few data about potential upstream regulators initiating aberrant CDX2 expression in human leukemias or about critical downstream targets of CDX2 in leukemic cells. Characterizing this network will hopefully open the way to therapeutic approaches that target deregulated ParaHox genes in human leukemia.","['Rawat, Vijay P S', 'Humphries, R Keith', 'Buske, Christian']","['Rawat VP', 'Humphries RK', 'Buske C']","['The Institute of Experimental Cancer Research, Comprehensive Cancer Center and University Hospital Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 11, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120430,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Animals', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Homeobox/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",2012/05/02 06:00,2012/10/04 06:00,['2012/05/02 06:00'],"['2012/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47499-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-02-385898 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jul 19;120(3):519-27. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-02-385898.

A financial spreadsheet model was used for cost comparison. Various surveillance scenarios were tested with different sample sizes and sampling frequencies for BTM samples. The costs could be halved without compromising the power to substantiate the freedom from IBR and EBL through the surveillance programme. Alternatively, the sensitivity could be markedly increased when keeping the costs at the actual level and doubling the sample size. The risk-based sample size of the actual programme results in a confidence of 94,18 % that the farm level prevalence is below 0,2 %.

Tumor cells fit both these descriptions. Previous publications have described a prototype based on an amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV), encoding yeast cytosine deaminase (CD) that converts the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) to the potent anticancer drug, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in an infected tumor. We report here the selection of one lead clinical candidate based on a general design goal to optimize the genetic stability of the virus and the CD activity produced by the delivered transgene. Vectors were tested for titer, genetic stability, CD protein and enzyme activity, ability to confer susceptibility to 5-FC, and preliminary in vivo antitumor activity and stability. One vector, Toca 511, (aka T5.0002) encoding an optimized CD, shows a threefold increased specific activity in infected cells over infection with the prototype RRV and shows markedly higher genetic stability. Animal testing demonstrated that Toca 511 replicates stably in human tumor xenografts and, after 5-FC administration, causes complete regression of such xenografts. Toca 511 (vocimagene amiretrorepvec) has been taken forward to preclinical and clinical trials.","['Perez, Omar D', 'Logg, Christopher R', 'Hiraoka, Kei', 'Diago, Oscar', 'Burnett, Ryan', 'Inagaki, Akihito', 'Jolson, Dawn', 'Amundson, Karin', 'Buckley, Taylor', 'Lohse, Dan', 'Lin, Amy', 'Burrascano, Cindy', 'Ibanez, Carlos', 'Kasahara, Noriyuki', 'Gruber, Harry E', 'Jolly, Douglas J']","['Perez OD', 'Logg CR', 'Hiraoka K', 'Diago O', 'Burnett R', 'Inagaki A', 'Jolson D', 'Amundson K', 'Buckley T', 'Lohse D', 'Lin A', 'Burrascano C', 'Ibanez C', 'Kasahara N', 'Gruber HE', 'Jolly DJ']","['Tocagen Inc, San Diego, California 92109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120501,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Prodrugs)', 'D83282DT06 (Flucytosine)', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytosine Deaminase/genetics/metabolism', 'Flucytosine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Fluorouracil/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Fungal Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Prodrugs/metabolism/pharmacology', 'RNA Stability', 'Rats', 'Transgenes']",2012/05/02 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/05/02 06:00'],"['2012/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)32160-8 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2012.83 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2012 Sep;20(9):1689-98. doi: 10.1038/mt.2012.83.

To make informed decisions on the use of healthcare resources, costs as well as utilities need to be taken into account. Among the preference-based HRQL instruments, the Health Utilities Index (HUI) is the most employed in pediatric cancer. Information on utility scores during ALL treatment and in long-term survivors is available, but utility scores in short-term survivors are lacking. This study assesses utility scores, health state, and HRQL in short-term (6 months to 4 years) ALL survivors. METHODS: Cross-sectional single-center cohort study of short-term ALL survivors using HUI3 proxy assessments. RESULTS: Thirty-three survivors (median 1.5 years off treatment) reported 14 unique health states. The majority of survivors (61 %) enjoyed a perfect health, but 21 % had three affected attributes. Overall, HRQL was nonsignificantly lower compared to the norm, although the difference was large and may be clinically relevant. Cognition was significantly impaired (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Although 61 % of short-term survivors of ALL report no impairment, the health status of the other patients lead to a clinically important impaired HRQL compared to norms. Prospective studies assessing utility scores associated with pediatric ALL should be performed, enabling valid and reliable cost-utility analyses for policy makers to make informed decisions.","['van Litsenburg, Raphaele R L', 'Huisman, Jaap', 'Raat, Hein', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Gemke, Reinoud J B J']","['van Litsenburg RR', 'Huisman J', 'Raat H', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Gemke RJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, VU University Medical Center Amsterdam, P.O.

It is usually seen on computed tomographic scans as white-matter vasogenic edema predominantly affecting the posterior occipital and parietal lobes of the brain. Risk factors include malignant hypertension, eclampsia, medications such as immunosuppressants (including tacrolimus and cyclosporine), chemotherapy, biotherapy, and renal failure. Early recognition of the signs and symptoms of PRES, particularly identifying and treating high blood pressure, can prevent permanent neurologic disability.","['Wright, Kathleen L', 'Polito, Margaret H', 'French, Anna E']","['Wright KL', 'Polito MH', 'French AE']","['Acute Unit, Inova Loudoun Hospital in Leesburg, VA, USA. kathleen.wright@inova.org']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Am J Nurs,The American journal of nursing,0372646,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Brain/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome/*chemically induced/diagnosis/*diagnostic imaging/therapy', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Radiography']",2012/05/02 06:00,2012/06/26 06:00,['2012/05/02 06:00'],"['2012/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/01.NAJ.0000414317.79577.99 [doi]', '00000446-201205000-00024 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Nurs. 2012 May;112(5):36-40; quiz 41-2. doi: 10.1097/01.NAJ.0000414317.79577.99.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing evidence also supports their involvement in the development of certain lung, colon and prostate cancers. METHODS: In this study we systemically surveyed endogenous estrogen and estrogen metabolite levels in each of the NCI-60 human tumor cell lines, which include human breast, central nerve system, colon, ovarian, prostate, kidney and non-small cell lung cancers, as well as melanomas and leukemia. The absolute abundances of these metabolites were measured using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method that has been previously utilized for biological fluids such as serum and urine. RESULTS: Endogenous estrogens and estrogen metabolites were found in all NCI-60 human tumor cell lines and some were substantially elevated and exceeded the levels found in well known estrogen-dependent and estrogen receptor-positive tumor cells such as MCF-7 and T-47D. While estrogens were expected to be present at high levels in cell lines representing the female reproductive system (that is, breast and ovarian), other cell lines, such as leukemia and colon, also contained very high levels of these steroid hormones. The leukemia cell line RMPI-8226 contained the highest levels of estrone (182.06 pg/106 cells) and 17beta-estradiol (753.45 pg/106 cells). In comparison, the ovarian cancer cell line with the highest levels of these estrogens contained only 19.79 and 139.32 pg/106 cells of estrone and 17beta-estradiol, respectively. The highest levels of estrone and 17beta-estradiol in breast cancer cell lines were only 8.45 and 87.37 pg/106 cells in BT-549 and T-47D cells, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The data provided evidence for the presence of significant amounts of endogenous estrogens and estrogen metabolites in cell lines not commonly associated with these steroid hormones. This broad discovery of endogenous estrogens and estrogen metabolites in these cell lines suggest that several human tumors may be beneficially treated using endocrine therapy aimed at estrogen biosynthesis and estrogen-related signaling pathways.","['Xu, Xia', 'Veenstra, Timothy D']","['Xu X', 'Veenstra TD']","['Laboratory of Proteomics and Analytical Technologies, SAIC-Frederick, Inc,, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702, USA. veenstrat@mail.nih.gov.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120430,England,Genome Med,Genome medicine,101475844,,,,2012/05/02 06:00,2012/05/02 06:01,['2012/05/02 06:00'],"['2012/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/04 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:01 [medline]']","['gm330 [pii]', '10.1186/gm330 [doi]']",epublish,Genome Med. 2012 Apr 30;4(4):31. doi: 10.1186/gm330.,,,PMC3446259,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The retinal degeneration 10 (rd10) mouse expresses a mutant form of rod phosphodiesterase leading to autosomal recessive photoreceptor degeneration. In contrast to rd1, rd10 mice have remaining rod function mimicking more closely most forms of human Retinitis Pigmentosa. Here we use morphology, biochemistry, retinal whole mounts, real-time PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence to compile a comprehensive report on progression of retinal degeneration in the rd10 retina up to one year of age. We show that retinal development, morphology, gene expression pattern and retinal vasculature was normal until postnatal day 15. Thereafter, a bi-phasic pattern of rod cell death emerged with a first rapid phase peaking around 3 weeks of age followed by a slower second phase. Death of cone cells followed with a delay and vessel dropout was prominent in the retinal periphery of 6 months old rd10 mice. At one year of age, RPE atrophy was evident. The degenerating retina rapidly induced expression of transcriptional regulators Atf3 and Cebpd. Induction of Atf3 was transient and lasted only for several days at the beginning of degeneration whereas levels of Cebpd remained elevated throughout the period of photoreceptor loss. Several protective genes such as Lif, Edn2 and Fgf2 which are implicated in a potent endogenous survival pathway, and Mt1 and Mt2 were strongly upregulated in the rd10 retina. In addition, increased expression of Casp1 and Il1b suggested an inflammatory response.","['Samardzija, Marijana', 'Wariwoda, Hedwig', 'Imsand, Cornelia', 'Huber, Philipp', 'Heynen, Severin R', 'Gubler, Andrea', 'Grimm, Christian']","['Samardzija M', 'Wariwoda H', 'Imsand C', 'Huber P', 'Heynen SR', 'Gubler A', 'Grimm C']","['Lab for Retinal Cell Biology, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120421,England,Exp Eye Res,Experimental eye research,0370707,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factor 3)', '0 (Atf3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cebpd protein, mouse)', '0 (Endothelin-2)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '142662-43-9 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 3/genetics', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Apoptosis', 'Atrophy', 'Blotting, Western', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta/genetics', 'Cell Survival/physiology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Endothelin-2/genetics', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/genetics', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate/pathology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retinal Degeneration/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Retinal Pigment Epithelium/pathology', 'Retinal Vessels/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2012/05/02 06:00,2012/08/17 06:00,['2012/05/02 06:00'],"['2012/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4835(12)00116-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exer.2012.04.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Eye Res. 2012 Jun;99:17-26. doi: 10.1016/j.exer.2012.04.004.

It is associated with myeloid leukemias, and rarely affects the spine. The most common clinical presentation of MS in spine patients is some form of pain related to compression of neural elements. Given that MS is rare, and its imaging characteristics are similar to other more common diagnoses, it is frequently missed on initial presentation. We present a 28-year-old female, in her fifth year of remission from AML, with low back pain and right lumbar radiculopathy. Initially, the leading diagnosis was schwannoma in preference to neurofibroma; however, intra-operative pathology and subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed the tumor to be MS. This report highlights the difficulties of diagnosis of MS in patients in remission from acute myeloid leukemia. Thus, in patients with a history of leukemia, MS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any epidural or nerve root tumor. Timely diagnosis and treatment are key to optimal outcomes.","['Smith, Timothy R', 'Slimack, Nicholas', 'McClendon, Jamal Jr', 'Wong, Albert', 'Fessler, Richard G']","['Smith TR', 'Slimack N', 'McClendon J Jr', 'Wong A', 'Fessler RG']","['Department of Neurological Surgery, Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA. timothy-smith-0@fsm.northwestern.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20120429,Scotland,J Clin Neurosci,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,9433352,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/*diagnosis', 'Low Back Pain/*etiology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Radiculopathy/*etiology', 'Recurrence', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*complications/diagnosis']",2012/05/02 06:00,2012/10/23 06:00,['2012/05/02 06:00'],"['2011/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0967-5868(11)00672-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jocn.2011.11.012 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Neurosci. 2012 Jul;19(7):1040-1. doi: 10.1016/j.jocn.2011.11.012.

Germination of inhaled conidia (asexual spores) in the host is critical for the initiation of infection, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms of this process. RESULTS: To gain insights into early germination events and facilitate the identification of potential stage-specific biomarkers and vaccine candidates, we have used quantitative shotgun proteomics to elucidate patterns of protein abundance changes during early fungal development. Four different stages were examined: dormant conidia, isotropically expanding conidia, hyphae in which germ tube emergence has just begun, and pre-septation hyphae. To enrich for glycan-linked cell wall proteins we used an alkaline cell extraction method. Shotgun proteomic resulted in the identification of 375 unique gene products with high confidence, with no evidence for enrichment of cell wall-immobilized and secreted proteins. The most interesting discovery was the identification of 52 proteins enriched in dormant conidia including 28 proteins that have never been detected in the A. fumigatus conidial proteome such as signaling protein Pil1, chaperones BipA and calnexin, and transcription factor HapB. Additionally we found many small, Aspergillus specific proteins of unknown function including 17 hypothetical proteins. Thus, the most abundant protein, Grg1 (AFUA_5G14210), was also one of the smallest proteins detected in this study (M.W. 7,367). Among previously characterized proteins were melanin pigment and pseurotin A biosynthesis enzymes, histones H3 and H4.1, and other proteins involved in conidiation and response to oxidative or hypoxic stress. In contrast, expanding conidia, hyphae with early germ tubes, and pre-septation hyphae samples were enriched for proteins responsible for housekeeping functions, particularly translation, respiratory metabolism, amino acid and carbohydrate biosynthesis, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. CONCLUSIONS: The observed temporal expression patterns suggest that the A. fumigatus conidia are dominated by small, lineage-specific proteins. Some of them may play key roles in host-pathogen interactions, signal transduction during conidial germination, or survival in hostile environments.","['Suh, Moo-Jin', 'Fedorova, Natalie D', 'Cagas, Steven E', 'Hastings, Susan', 'Fleischmann, Robert D', 'Peterson, Scott N', 'Perlin, David S', 'Nierman, William C', 'Pieper, Rembert', 'Momany, Michelle']","['Suh MJ', 'Fedorova ND', 'Cagas SE', 'Hastings S', 'Fleischmann RD', 'Peterson SN', 'Perlin DS', 'Nierman WC', 'Pieper R', 'Momany M']","['The J.

In this study, a naturally occurring PNST in a Japanese native fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus) was pathologically examined and the strain of avian leukosis virus (ALV) isolated from the neoplasm was characterized by molecular biological analysis. The fowl presented with a firm subcutaneous mass in the neck. The mass, connected to the adjacent spinal cord (C9-14), was microscopically composed of highly cellular tissue of spindle cells arranged in interlacing bundles, streams, and palisading patterns with Verocay bodies and less cellular tissue with abundant collagen. Immunohistochemically, neoplastic cells were divided into two types: perineurial cells positive for vimentin, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), and claudin1; and Schwann cells positive for vimentin, occasionally positive for S-100 alpha/beta but negative for GLUT1. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of neurofibrosarcoma was made. The complete nucleotide sequence of an ALV strain, CTS_5371, isolated from the neoplasm was determined and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the strain was a novel recombinant virus from avian leukosis/sarcoma viruses previously reported. Additionally, experimental infection revealed that CTS_5371 induced the proliferation of Schwann cells and perineurial cells.

MAV-1 was detected in young chicks hatching from eggs produced by an experimental genetic line of egg-type chickens. Transmissibility of MAV-1 had not been documented previously. This investigation was intended to partially characterize the virus involved and to study its transmissibility and oncogenicity in naturally and contact-infected chickens. Commercially produced white and brown layer pullets free of exogenous avian leukosis viruses were commingled at hatch with naturally MAV-1-infected chickens. The original MAV-1-infected chickens were discarded after approximately 8 wk, and the contact-exposed chickens were maintained in isolation for 36 wk. Young specific-pathogen-free (SPF) single comb white leghorn chickens were added to the group to study possible horizontal transmission of MAV-1 in young chickens. Upon weekly virus isolation attempts, MAV-1 was readily isolated from the contact-exposed white layers but not from the brown layers between 36 and 53 wk of age (18 wk in total). Three-week-old SPF chickens were readily infected with MAV-1 by contact as early as 1 wk postexposure. Throughout 22 hatches derived from the white and brown MAV-1-contact-exposed layers (between 36 and 53 wk of age), MAV-1 was frequently detected in the white layer progeny, whereas the virus was seldom isolated from the progeny produced by the brown layers during the same 18-wk period. MAV-1 induced a persistent infection in some of the SPF chickens that were exposed by contact at 3 wk of age. Gross tumors were not detected in any of the originally infected experimental chickens at 8 wk of age, in the contact-exposed brown or white layers at the termination of the study at 53 wks of age, or in the contact-exposed SPF chickens at the end of the study at 12 wk of age.

About 80% of these are squamous cell carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma are next in frequency. Lymphoma of the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses and nasopharynx are rare, constituting less than 5% of all extranodal lymphomas. CASE REPORT: A 47-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of severe headache and progressive facial pain. He also complained of right-sided visual acuity. He had a manifest exopthalmia with disturbed eye movements. Nasoscopy showed a large mass with atypical appearance. CT and MRI showed a bilateral ethmoid mass invading the frontal sinuses, the right orbit, the lamina cribrosa and the right frontal cerebral region, and growing posteriorly through the choana. The first biopsies were inconclusive, showing only necrotic cells and purulent inflammation with epithelial elements. A larger biopsy demonstrated a high-grade malignant tumour with necrosis. The differential diagnosis of undifferentiated sinonasal carcinoma, undifferentiated neuro-endocrine tumour or T-cell lymphoma was suggested. In the meantime our patient developed high fever and sudden-onset pancytopenia. Bone marrow punction showed 65% blasts, leading to the diagnosis of AML type M2. He was immediately referred for chemotherapy, but died in intensive care before his first session. The biopsy of the sinonasal mass was diagnosed surprisingly as a natural killer cell lymphoma stage IVB. CONCLUSIONS: Natural killer cell lymphoma is rare in Europe. The simultaneous appearance of a NK-cell lymphoma and acute myelogenous leukemia has, as far as we know, never been described in the English literature before.","['Van Crombrugge, L', 'De Vos, G', 'Vanclooster, C', 'Lemmerling, M', 'Kerre, T']","['Van Crombrugge L', 'De Vos G', 'Vanclooster C', 'Lemmerling M', 'Kerre T']","['Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, University Hospital, Ghent.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Belgium,B-ENT,B-ENT,101247842,,IM,"['Exophthalmos/etiology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Image Enhancement', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell/complications/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Nose Neoplasms/complications/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Pancytopenia/etiology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2012/05/02 06:00,2012/05/18 06:00,['2012/05/02 06:00'],"['2012/05/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,B-ENT. 2012;8(1):49-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He complained of weakness for the past few months. On his dermatological examination he had a 3x3-cm necrotic ulcer on his left tibia (Figure 1). On physical examination, there was 1 x 1-cm axillary lymphadenopathy. There was no other lymph node enlargement, hepatosplenomegaly, or gingival hypertrophy. Peripheral blood results showed 2.4x103/mm3 leukocytes (normal range 4-11 x 103/mm3) with 66% neutrophils. The hemoglobin value was 10.1 g/dL (13-18 g/dL), and the platelet count was 63x103/mm3 (150-440 x 103/mm3). No blasts were detected in a peripheral blood smear. His lactate dehydrogenase level was 567 U/L (240-480 U/L). All other results of blood chemistry were within normal limits. Punch biopsy of the skin lesion showed ulceration and dense dermal acute and chronic inflammation. There was a superficial and deep perivascular and periadnexal infiltrate of neoplastic cells composed of relatively abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and large nuclei with blastic chromatin and occasional small nucleoli (Figure 2). Mitotic figures were prominent. Immunohistochemical stains were performed, and the neoplastic cells were CD3, CD20, CD138, and S100 protein negative. Myeloperoxidase and CD68 were positive. The histopathological findings were consistent with leukemic infiltration. Examination of bone marrow biopsy revealed that the blastic cells constituted more than 20% of the bone marrow cellularity. Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow aspiration with fluorescence in situ hybridization was negative for inversion 16, t(8;21) and t(15;7). Histochemical stains for myeloperoxidase, sudan black, periodic acid-Schiff, and alpha naphthyl acetate were also negative. Blastic cells were DR, CD13, CD117, and CD34 positive and CD5, CD7, CD10, CD14, CD19, CD20, CD33, CD41, CD56, CD64, and CD79 negative according to flow cytometry immunophenotyping. Blastic cells were 35% in the bone marrow. Based on the findings of bone marrow examination, the patient was diagnosed as having acute myeloblastic leukeamia (AML) with minimal differentiation (subtype MO) according to French-American-British and World Health Organization classification. The examination of abdominal ultrasonography and thorocic and abominal computed tomography revealed no metastases. The patient was treated with chemotherapy that consisted of cytarabin and daunorubicin. After chemotherapy, the lesion regressed. One month after chemotherapy, the patient presented to the hospital with a complaint of fever. He was diagnosed with febrile neutropenia.

Pancytopenia has multiple etiologies like megaloblastic anemia, aplastic anemia, leukemia, and various infections. We investigated the clinical, etiological and hematological profile including bone marrow morphology of patients with pancytopenia in relation to their vitamin B12 and folic acid status at a tertiary care referral hospital in north India. Methods. A total of 140 consecutive patients with pancytopenia were selected from June 2007 to December 2008. Bone marrow examination and other tests were carried out as warranted, including serum cobalamin and folate assays using liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC MS/MS). Results. The study population consisted of 92 males and 48 females with a mean age of 32.8 years. Megaloblastic anemia 60.7%, aplastic anemia (7.8%), and leukemia (9.2%) were common causes. Infectious causes (16.4% of all cases) included leishmaniasis, HIV-AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Severe cobalamin deficiency (B12 < 100 pg/mL) was seen in 81% of all patients including 91.6% of patients with MA. In contrast, only 7.14% of all pancytopenic patients were folate deficient. Folate deficiency (<5 ng/mL) was seen in just 5% MA patients. Combined cobalamin and folate deficiency was seen in 5 patients (3.51%). Conclusion. Cobalamin deficiency was found to be more common in our setting and is largely underdiagnosed in the age of folate supplementation. Infectious diseases like tuberculosis, leishmaniasis, and increasingly HIV are important and treatable causes of pancytopenia. This is in contrast with the developed nations where the bulk of disease is due to malignancy or marrow aplasia.","['Premkumar, M', 'Gupta, N', 'Singh, T', 'Velpandian, T']","['Premkumar M', 'Gupta N', 'Singh T', 'Velpandian T']","['Department of Medicine, Maulana Azad Medical College and Associated Hospitals, Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi 110002, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120401,Egypt,Anemia,Anemia,101536021,,,,2012/05/01 06:00,2012/05/01 06:01,['2012/05/01 06:00'],"['2011/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/06 00:00 [revised]', '2011/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2012/707402 [doi]'],ppublish,Anemia. 2012;2012:707402. doi: 10.1155/2012/707402.

Because of its function, LIF gene is considered as a candidate gene for litter size in many mammalian species including pig. The aim of present study was to evaluate the expression of LIF gene in the porcine ovary, oviduct and two regions of uterus (corpus uteri, cornu uteri) in prepubertal and pubertal gilts. In order to precise estimation of LIF transcript abundance we evaluated the stability of expression for several candidate housekeeping genes in investigated tissues across different breeds and different stage of oestrus cycle. The geNorm analysis indicated that the most stable reference genes across analyzed tissues were: OAZ1 and RPL27. The analysis conducted separately for each tissue confirmed that the most stable gene was OAZ1 in all tissues expect oviduct (the most stable was RPL27 gene). In prepubertal pigs, the highest level of the LIF expression was obtained in both regions of uterus compare to ovary and oviduct tissues (P < 0.01). A similar trend in LIF expression pattern was observed in follicular phase-the significantly highest transcript level was obtained in cornu uteri, it was about ninefold higher than in ovary (P < 0.05). In luteal stage the highest expression was in corpus uteri. In pig, the high expression in luteal phases suggested that, LIF may be mainly secreted in respond to the increased of progesterone concentration and it can be connected with the preparation of the uterus for implantation.","['Ropka-Molik, Katarzyna', 'Oczkowicz, Maria', 'Mucha, Aurelia', 'Piorkowska, Katarzyna', 'Piestrzynska-Kajtoch, Agata']","['Ropka-Molik K', 'Oczkowicz M', 'Mucha A', 'Piorkowska K', 'Piestrzynska-Kajtoch A']","['Laboratory of Genomics, National Research Institute of Animal Production, Krakowska 1, 32-083 Balice, Poland. kropka@izoo.krakow.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120428,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Estrous Cycle/genetics', 'Fallopian Tubes/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics', 'Ovary/*metabolism', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Swine', 'Uterus/*metabolism']",2012/05/01 06:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/05/01 06:00'],"['2011/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11033-012-1642-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2012 Aug;39(8):7965-72. doi: 10.1007/s11033-012-1642-8.

It can establish a latent stage in sensory ganglia after primary epithelial infections, and reactivate in response to stress or sunlight. Previous studies have demonstrated that viral immediate-early protein ICP0 plays a key role in regulating the balance between lytic and latent infection. Recently, It has been determined that promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs), small nuclear sub-structures, contribute to the repression of HSV-1 infection in the absence of functional ICP0.

We searched the Drosophila genome for BTB/POZ-ZF domains and discovered an unknown Drosophila gene, dPLZF, which encodes an orthologue of human PLZF. We then characterized the biological function of the dPLZF via genetic interaction analysis. Ectopic expression of dPLZF in the wing induced extra vein formation during wing development in Drosophila. Genetic interactions between dPLZF and Ras or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) significantly enhanced the formation of vein cells. On the other hand, loss-of-function mutations in dPLZF resulted in a dramatic suppression of the extra and ectopic vein formation induced by elevated Ras/ERK signaling. Moreover, dPLZF activity upregulated the expression of rhomboid (rho) and spitz, which perform crucial functions in vein cell formation in the developing wing. These results indicate that dPLZF is a transcription factor controlled by the Ras/ERK signaling pathway, which is a prominent regulator of vein cell formation during wing development in Drosophila.","['Maeng, Oky', 'Son, Wonseok', 'Chung, Jongkyeong', 'Lee, Kyu-Sun', 'Lee, Young-Ha', 'Yoo, Ook-Joon', 'Cha, Guang-Ho', 'Paik, Sang-Gi']","['Maeng O', 'Son W', 'Chung J', 'Lee KS', 'Lee YH', 'Yoo OJ', 'Cha GH', 'Paik SG']","['Department of Infection Biology, College of Medicine and Brain Korea 21 Program for Medical Science, Chungnam National University, Daejeon 301-131, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120426,Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,"['0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Rho protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', '148175-53-5 (spi protein, Drosophila)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Avipoxvirus/genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila/genetics/*growth & development/metabolism', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Wings, Animal/*growth & development/metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",2012/05/01 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/05/01 06:00'],"['2011/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/02/29 00:00 [revised]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10059-012-2179-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cells. 2012 May;33(5):457-63. doi: 10.1007/s10059-012-2179-3.

Here, we report that different forms of MCL-1 reside in distinct mitochondrial locations and exhibit separable functions. On the outer mitochondrial membrane, an MCL-1 isoform acts like other anti-apoptotic BCL-2 molecules to antagonize apoptosis, whereas an amino-terminally truncated isoform of MCL-1 that is imported into the mitochondrial matrix is necessary to facilitate normal mitochondrial fusion, ATP production, membrane potential, respiration, cristae ultrastructure and maintenance of oligomeric ATP synthase.

HSPCs that egresses to peripheral blood are widely used for transplant and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is used clinically to induce mobilization. The mechanisms, through which G-CSF regulates HSPC trafficking, however, are not completely understood. Herein we show that G-CSF-driven neutrophil expansion alters the BM niche that leads to HSPC mobilization. Alcam(-)Sca-1(+)MPC and Alcam(+)Sca-1(-) OB are reduced coincident with mobilization, which correlates inversely with BM neutrophil expansion. In mice made neutropenic by the neutrophil-specific anti-Ly6G antibody, G-CSF-mediated reduction in MPC and OB is attenuated and mobilization reduced without an effect on monocytes/macrophages. Neutrophils, expanded in response to G-CSF-induced MPC and OB apoptosis leading to reduced production of BM HSPC retention factors, including stromal cell-derived factor-1, stem cell factor and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Blockade of neutrophil reactive oxygen species attenuates G-CSF-mediated MPC and OB apoptosis. These data show that the expansion of BM neutrophils by G-CSF contributes to the transient degradation of retention mechanisms within the BM niche, facilitating enhanced HSPC egress/mobilization.","['Singh, P', 'Hu, P', 'Hoggatt, J', 'Moh, A', 'Pelus, L M']","['Singh P', 'Hu P', 'Hoggatt J', 'Moh A', 'Pelus LM']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120430,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Coculture Techniques', 'DNA Primers', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutrophils/*cytology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2012/05/01 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/05/01 06:00'],"['2012/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012117 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.117 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Nov;26(11):2375-83. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.117.

In addition, a low hemoglobin (Hb) level is often responsible for fatigue and other associated symptoms that cause a decline in the quality of life of these children. Traditionally, a number of contributing factors such as overcrowding of the marrow, coexisting infections, and nutritional deficits have been used to explain this phenomenon. However, recent advances in in vivo modeling and real-time ultrastructural analytical techniques have enabled researchers to examine leukemic bone marrow (BM) microenvironment more closely and helped to build mechanistic models of this process. Importantly, data from these studies show that in the majority of cases, the required stem cell populations and the erythropoietic growth mechanisms remain intact in leukemia. In this report, we aim to review the current state of knowledge regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms implicated in the altered erythropoiesis at the time of diagnosis of leukemia.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 137 CML patients receiving TT from five different countries. An additional sample of 99 CML patients, completing an online interview, was considered for supportive analyses. A sample of 59 HCPs from 12 countries also participated in the study. Patients and HCPs were asked to rate and rank the importance of a predefined list of 74 HRQOL aspects of potential relevance for CML patients. Patients and HCPs agreed that the following five aspects are most important: fatigue, muscle cramps, swelling, worries, and uncertainty about health condition in the future, and importance of social support in coping with the disease. However, the difference in rankings between the two groups was substantial with respect to other HRQOL aspects investigated. Patients valued some issues related to symptoms much higher than HCPs, thus suggesting that a better symptom management could be the crucial aspects to improve HRQOL of CML patients.","['Efficace, Fabio', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Saussele, Susanne', 'Kossak-Roth, Ute', 'Cardoni, Annarita', 'Caocci, Giovanni', 'Chie, Weichu', 'Naeem, Adel', 'Nicolatou-Galitis, Ourania', 'Cocks, Kim', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Mandelli, Franco', 'Sprangers, Mirjam']","['Efficace F', 'Breccia M', 'Saussele S', 'Kossak-Roth U', 'Cardoni A', 'Caocci G', 'Chie W', 'Naeem A', 'Nicolatou-Galitis O', 'Cocks K', 'Vignetti M', 'Baccarani M', 'Mandelli F', 'Sprangers M']","['Health Outcomes Research Unit, Italian Group for Adult Hematologic Diseases (GIMEMA), GIMEMA Data Center, Via Benevento, 6, 00161, Rome, Italy. f.efficace@gimema.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120429,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Anxiety', 'Benzamides', 'Edema/etiology/psychology', 'Europe', 'Fatigue/etiology/psychology', 'Female', 'Health Personnel/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Iraq', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*psychology', 'Muscle Cramp/etiology/psychology', 'Patients/*psychology', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', '*Quality of Life', 'Social Support', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Taiwan', 'Young Adult']",2012/05/01 06:00,2012/10/24 06:00,['2012/05/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-012-1458-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2012 Sep;91(9):1371-81. doi: 10.1007/s00277-012-1458-6.

Overall cellularity on day 30 was normal in 45.3%, reduced in 37.3% and increased in 17.3% of samples (day 100: normal: 54.8%; reduced: 38.7%; and increased: 6.5%).

Micelles of dodecylamine (DDA) assembled in an ethanol-water system have been explored as a template to direct the growth of the ZnO nanostructures. The key species for the formation of the ZnO nanostructures, OH(-), can be provided by the water-induced protonation of DDA. The pH of the reaction micro-environment can be regulated by changing the input amount of water and DDA. By controlling the reaction temperature and pH, various ZnO nanostructures, i.e. quantum dots with green or yellow-green emissions, have been prepared. The relationship of the optical properties and the synthetic conditions has been further discussed. This strategy realizes the convenient preparation of ZnO QDs, indicating the potential prospects in the nanotechnology field for their low-cost synthesis. Meanwhile, the cellular toxicity study of ZnO nanoparticles toward cancer cells, including leukemia K562 and K562/A02 cells as well as HepG2 cells, indicates a selective cytotoxic effect of ZnO QDs against a broad range of human cancer cell lines.","['Zhang, Yinzhu', 'Wang, Huangping', 'Jiang, Hui', 'Wang, Xuemei']","['Zhang Y', 'Wang H', 'Jiang H', 'Wang X']","['State Key Lab of Bioelectronics (Chien-Shiung WU Laboratory), Southeast University, Nanjing 210096, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120430,England,Nanoscale,Nanoscale,101525249,"['0 (Amines)', '0 (Micelles)', '0 (Protons)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', 'SOI2LOH54Z (Zinc Oxide)']",IM,"['Amines/*chemistry', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'K562 Cells', 'Metal Nanoparticles/*chemistry/toxicity', '*Micelles', 'Protons', '*Quantum Dots', 'Water/chemistry', 'Zinc Oxide/*chemistry']",2012/05/01 06:00,2012/09/19 06:00,['2012/05/01 06:00'],"['2012/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c2nr30127j [doi]'],ppublish,Nanoscale. 2012 Jun 7;4(11):3530-5. doi: 10.1039/c2nr30127j.

However, the requirement of coregulators for estrogen-induced expression of the PgR gene has not been fully explored. Here we used RNA interference to demonstrate dramatic differences in requirements of 10 different coregulators for estrogen-regulated expression of six different genes, including PgR and the well-studied TFF1 (or pS2) gene in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Full estrogen-induced expression of TFF1 required all ten coregulators, but PgR induction required only four of the 10 coregulators. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated several mechanisms responsible for the differential coregulator requirements. Actin-binding coregulator Flightless-I, required for TFF1 expression and recruited to that gene by estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha), is not required for PgR expression and not recruited to that gene. Protein acetyltransferase tat-interactive protein 60 and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Brahma Related Gene 1 are recruited to both genes but are required only for TFF1 expression. Histone methyltransferase G9a is recruited to both genes and required for estrogen-induced expression of TFF1 but negatively regulates estrogen-induced expression of PgR. In contrast, histone methyltransferase myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1), pioneer factor Forkhead box A1, and p160 coregulator steroid receptor coactivator-3 are required for expression of and are recruited to both genes. Depletion of MLL1 decreased ERalpha binding to the PgR and TFF1 genes. In contrast, depletion of G9a enhanced ERalpha binding to the PgR gene but had no effect on ERalpha binding to the TFF1 gene. These studies suggest that differential promoter architecture is responsible for promoter-specific mechanisms of gene regulation.","['Won Jeong, Kwang', 'Chodankar, Rajas', 'Purcell, Daniel J', 'Bittencourt, Danielle', 'Stallcup, Michael R']","['Won Jeong K', 'Chodankar R', 'Purcell DJ', 'Bittencourt D', 'Stallcup MR']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern California/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120427,United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (ESR1 protein, human)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '0 (TFF1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Trefoil Factor-1)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EHMT2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Estradiol/physiology', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/*metabolism', 'Estrogens/physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Receptors, Progesterone/genetics/metabolism', 'Response Elements', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Trefoil Factor-1', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2012/05/01 06:00,2012/09/21 06:00,['2012/05/01 06:00'],"['2012/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['me.2012-1066 [pii]', '10.1210/me.2012-1066 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2012 Jun;26(6):955-66. doi: 10.1210/me.2012-1066.

A systematic review.,38-42,10.1016/j.mehy.2012.03.026 [doi],"INTRODUCTION: Important data was recently published on the potential genotoxic or carcinogenic effects of antipsychotics, as well as on their cytotoxic properties on cancer cells, that must be considered by psychiatrists in the benefit/risk ratio of their prescriptions. AIM OF THE STUDY: To answer whether or not antipsychotics, as a class or only some specific molecules, may influence cancer risk among treated patients. METHODS ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: All studies (in vitro, animal studies and human studies) concerning effects of antipsychotic drugs on cancer development were included. The search paradigm [neoplasms AND (antipsychotic agents OR neuroleptic OR phenothiazine)] was applied to Medline (1966-present) and Web of Science (1975-present). RESULTS: Ninety-three studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. Results can be summarized as follows: (1) patients with schizophrenia may be less likely to develop cancer than the general population, (2) antipsychotics as a class cannot be considered at the moment as at risk for cancer, even if some antipsychotics have shown carcinogenic properties among rodents, (3) phenothiazines seem to have antiproliferative properties that may be useful in multidrug augmentation strategies in various cancer treatments, but their bad tolerance may decrease usage amongst non-psychotic patients, and (4) clozapine appears to have a separate status given that this molecule shows antiproliferative effects implied in agranulocytosis as well as a potential increased risk for leukemia. CONCLUSION: Benefit/risk ratio regarding cancer risk is in favor of treating patients with schizophrenia with antipsychotic drugs. The practicing clinician should be reassuring on the subject of cancer risk due to antipsychotic drugs.","['Fond, G', 'Macgregor, A', 'Attal, J', 'Larue, A', 'Brittner, M', 'Ducasse, D', 'Capdevielle, D']","['Fond G', 'Macgregor A', 'Attal J', 'Larue A', 'Brittner M', 'Ducasse D', 'Capdevielle D']","['Universite Montpellier 1, Montpellier F-34000, France. guillaume.fond@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20120428,United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,['0 (Antipsychotic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Risk Factors']",2012/05/01 06:00,2012/09/26 06:00,['2012/05/01 06:00'],"['2011/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0306-9877(12)00145-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mehy.2012.03.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 2012 Jul;79(1):38-42. doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2012.03.026.

The inherent light-scattering properties of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) combined with recent developments in NP design may confer significant advantages over traditional fluorescence probes. We report and evaluate the use of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) gold NPs (AuNPs) conjugated to therapeutic rituximab antibodies for selective targeting of CD20 molecules. SERS AuNPs were prepared by adsorbing a Raman-active dye onto the surface of 60 nm spherical AuNPs, coating the particles with 5 kDa polyethylene glycol, and conjugating rituximab to functional groups on polyethylene glycol. The effective targeting of CD20 on chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells by rituximab-conjugated SERS AuNPs was evaluated by dark-field imaging, Raman spectroscopy, and flow cytometry with both competitive binding and fluorescence detection procedures. Evidence of CD20 clustering within approximately 100 nm was observed. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: This study discusses the use of surface enhancement Raman scattering (SERS)-based plasmonic gold nanoparticles, which can be used for cell specific labeling. In this example rituximab, a commercially available CD20 humanized monoclonal antibody is used.

METHODS: Blood samples from 666 individuals (163 with recent onset psychosis, 268 with multi-episode schizophrenia, and 235 controls) were assayed for IgG antibodies to murine leukemia virus (MuLV), Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV), and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) by enzyme immunoassay utilizing whole virus and viral components. Antibody levels in the psychiatric groups were compared to controls by multivariate linear regression. Odds ratios associated with increased antibody levels were calculated based on values >/= 75th percentile of the controls. Samples were also tested for antibodies to viral proteins by Western blotting and for DNA from infectious retroviruses by real time PCR. Homology between the target virus and the prototype human genome was determined using sequence analysis methods. RESULTS: Compared with controls, individuals with recent onset of psychosis had increased levels of antibodies to MPMV and MuLV (both p<.001 adjusted for covariates), and increased antibody levels for defined portions of the MPMV and MuLV gag, pol and env proteins. The specificity of these antibodies was confirmed by Western blotting. Individuals with multi-episode schizophrenia did not show elevated antibody levels to any of the retroviruses measured. Infectious retroviruses were not detected in the blood of any participants. Homology analyses indicated that there are multiple regions of the human genome homologous with MPMV and MuLV proteins, the highest being with the MuLV gag protein. CONCLUSIONS: Antibodies to retroviral proteins are elevated in individuals with recent onset psychosis but not in individuals with multi-episode schizophrenia. The immunopathological consequences of this antibody response should be the subject of additional studies.","['Dickerson, Faith', 'Lillehoj, Erik', 'Stallings, Cassie', 'Wiley, Melanie', 'Origoni, Andrea', 'Vaughan, Crystal', 'Khushalani, Sunil', 'Sabunciyan, Sarven', 'Yolken, Robert']","['Dickerson F', 'Lillehoj E', 'Stallings C', 'Wiley M', 'Origoni A', 'Vaughan C', 'Khushalani S', 'Sabunciyan S', 'Yolken R']","['The Stanley Research Program at Sheppard Pratt, Baltimore, MD, USA. fdickerson@sheppardpratt.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120427,Netherlands,Schizophr Res,Schizophrenia research,8804207,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA, Viral/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mason-Pfizer monkey virus/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Psychotic Disorders/*immunology/virology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Schizophrenia/*immunology/virology']",2012/05/01 06:00,2012/10/25 06:00,['2012/05/01 06:00'],"['2012/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0920-9964(12)00190-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.schres.2012.03.037 [doi]']",ppublish,Schizophr Res. 2012 Jul;138(2-3):198-205. doi: 10.1016/j.schres.2012.03.037.

Recent studies question the traditional view that the level of asparagine synthetase (ASNS), an enzyme producing the intracellular asparagine, correlates with the response to L-asp treatment. However, the importance of ASNS in response to L-asp has neither been confirmed nor refuted so far. In this study, we wanted to elucidate the effect of ASNS expression level on the sensitivity of ALL cells to L-asp treatment. We used four ALL cell lines (NALM-6, RS4;11, REH, and UOCB6) and 30 diagnostic bone marrow samples of ALL patients to study the relationship between ASNS expression and sensitivity to L-asp using MTS proliferation assay. RNA interference was used to study the effect of a range of ASNS levels on the response to L-asp treatment. Using a cell line model with a gradually knocked-down ASNS gene, we defined a cutoff level below which ASNS gene expression does not correlate with sensitivity to L-asp. Importantly, ASNS gene expression in patients' ALL blasts is below this level. We confirmed that there was no correlation between ASNS gene expression and sensitivity to L-asp in ALL blasts. In addition, we show that cells with low ASNS expression level do not respond to asparagine deprivation by upregulation of ASNS gene expression. In conclusion, the ASNS expression level does not predict sensitivity to L-asp in leukemic blasts. Moreover, cell lines with high basal expression of ASNS cannot serve as a valid model for studies on the relationship between the ASNS and L-asp cytotoxic effect.","['Hermanova, Ivana', 'Zaliova, Marketa', 'Trka, Jan', 'Starkova, Julia']","['Hermanova I', 'Zaliova M', 'Trka J', 'Starkova J']","['Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120425,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 6.3.1.1 (Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Asparaginase/*pharmacology', 'Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",2012/05/01 06:00,2012/10/02 06:00,['2012/05/01 06:00'],"['2012/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/16 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(12)00139-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2012.04.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2012 Aug;40(8):657-65. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2012.04.005.

The evidence established that sub-populations of cells identified by antibodies to cell surface markers behaved like developmental stem cells in their capacity to re-grow the human tumour for several generations in experimental immune-deficient hosts. The experiments established that cells with tumourigenic capacity expressed 'cancer stem cell' (CSC) markers and that activity could also be measured by self-renewal of tumour sphere colonies in culture. In breast and other cancers, there is good evidence that CSCs are relatively resistant to radio- and chemotherapy indicating that novel CSC-targeted therapies are needed. Several pathways are promising targets in breast CSCs. There are several ways of combating CSC activity including inducing their apoptosis, inhibiting stem cell self-renewal to either stop their division or to promote their differentiation, or targeting the CSC niche that supports them. The first challenge for developing novel CSC therapies is to ascertain which of these CSC properties is being targeted. The second challenge is to determine suitable CSC biomarkers to measure the efficacy of the novel CSC therapies. We propose using biomarkers as a means to identify and assess CSC activity in clinical trials. This is likely to be demanding but feasible in the near future. Thus, we asked if CSCs are ready for the clinic, however, the emerging question becomes: is the clinic ready for cancer stem cells?","['Ablett, Matthew P', 'Singh, Jagdeep K', 'Clarke, Robert B']","['Ablett MP', 'Singh JK', 'Clarke RB']","['Breast Biology Group, School of Cancer and Enabling Sciences, University of Manchester, Wilmslow Road, Manchester M20 4BX, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120426,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Signal Transduction']",2012/05/01 06:00,2012/11/03 06:00,['2012/05/01 06:00'],"['2011/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(12)00303-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2012.03.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2012 Sep;48(14):2104-16. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2012.03.019.

Unstabilized DNA breaks can have free 3'-OH ends accessible to in situ addition of digoxygenin (DIG)-labeled dUTP using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. In the present work, we used a GFP-Tax (green fluorescent protein) plasmid, which produces a functionally active GFP-tagged Tax protein, to detect the cellular target(s) for Tax which might mechanistically explain the clastogenic phenomenon. We examined the induction of MN and unstabilized DNA breaks in wild type cells and cells individually knocked out for Ku80, PKcs, XRCC4, and H2AX proteins. We also assessed in the same cells, the signal strengths produced by DIG-dUTP incorporation at the unstable DNA breaks in the presence and absence of Tax. RESULTS: Cells mutated for PKcs, XRCC4 and H2AX showed increased frequency of MN and unstabilized DNA breaks in response to the expression of Tax, while cells genetically mutated for Ku80 were refractory to Tax's induction of these cytogenetic effects. Moreover, by measuring the size of DIG-dUTP incorporation signal, which indicates the extent of unstable DNA ends, we found that Tax induces larger signals than those in control cells. However, in xrs-6 cells deficient for Ku80, this Tax effect was not seen. CONCLUSIONS: The data here demonstrate that clastogenic DNA damage in Tax expressing cells is explained by Tax targeting of Ku80, but not PKcs, XRCC4 or H2AX, which are all proteins directly or indirectly related to the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair system. Of note, the Ku80 protein plays an important role at the initial stage of the NHEJ repair system, protecting and stabilizing DNA-breaks. Accordingly, HTLV-1 Tax is shown to interfere with a normal cellular protective mechanism for stabilizing DNA breaks. These DNA breaks, unprotected by Ku80, are unstable and are subject to erosion or end-to-end fusion, ultimately leading to additional chromosomal aberrations.","['Majone, Franca', 'Jeang, Kuan-Teh']","['Majone F', 'Jeang KT']","['Department of Biology, Via Bassi 58/b, 35131, Padua, Italy. franca.majone@unipd.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120427,England,Cell Biosci,Cell & bioscience,101561195,,,,2012/05/01 06:00,2012/05/01 06:01,['2012/05/01 06:00'],"['2012/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/01 06:01 [medline]']","['2045-3701-2-15 [pii]', '10.1186/2045-3701-2-15 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Biosci. 2012 Apr 27;2(1):15. doi: 10.1186/2045-3701-2-15.,,,PMC3448514,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report for the first time that inhibition of cellular caspase activity can induce differentiation of AML blasts, and can enhance vitamin D-induced cell differentiation of these cells. This was studied in blasts obtained from nine patients with AML and one patient with CML by ex vivo culture in the presence of Q-VD-OPh (QVD), a pan caspase inhibitor. Cell differentiation was manifested by the expression of markers of monocytic differentiation CD11b and CD14. Differentiation induced by 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) or its analogs PRI-1906 and PRI-2191 was enhanced by QVD to a varying degree, depending on the subtype of the leukemia. QVD and 1,25D-induced differentiation was accompanied by increased signaling by Hematopoietic Progenitor Kinase 1(HPK1), and the expression of transcription factors known to be involved in monocytic differentiation was increased. Although the magnitude and nature of these changes were not invariable, it is clear that caspase inhibitors warrant attention as components of differentiation therapy of leukemia, perhaps in combination with derivatives of vitamin D.","['Chen-Deutsch, Xiangwen', 'Kutner, Andrzej', 'Harrison, Jonathan S', 'Studzinski, George P']","['Chen-Deutsch X', 'Kutner A', 'Harrison JS', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120426,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (quinoline-val-asp(OMe)-CH2-OPH)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Quinolines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Vitamin D/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",2012/05/01 06:00,2012/08/03 06:00,['2012/05/01 06:00'],"['2012/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/25 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(12)00168-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2012.03.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2012 Jul;36(7):884-8. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2012.03.023.

PDT works by initiating damaging oxidation or redox-sensitive pathways to trigger cell death. PDT can also regulate tumor angiogenesis and modulate systemic antitumor immunity. The drawbacks to PDT--photosensitizer toxicity, a lack of selectivity and efficacy of photosensitizers, and a limited penetrance of light through deep tissues--are the same pitfalls associated with diagnostic imaging. Developments in the field of nanotechnology have generated novel platforms for optimizing the advantages while minimizing the disadvantages of PDT. Calcium phosphosilicate nanoparticles (CPSNPs) represent an optimal nano-system for both diagnostic imaging and PDT. In this review, we will discuss how CPSNPs can enhance optical agents and serve as selective, non-toxic, and functionally stable photosensitizers for PDT.

The current study was designed to investigate whether different types of commercial goat cheeses may possess antiproliferative activity, using an HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell line as a cancer cell model. Among 11 cheese extracts tested at 500mug/mL, 6 (Crottin de Chavignol, Pouligny Saint-Pierre, Chabichou du Poitou, Valencay, Kavli, and Sainte-Maure de Touraine) resulted in a significant decrease of cell viability, which is consistent with a decrease in viable cell number. Compared with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) value of individual cheeses in cellular proliferation assays, the Pouligny Saint-Pierre extract showed strong inhibition. Incubation of cells in the presence of Pouligny Saint-Pierre extract resulted in induction of cellular morphological changes and apoptotic DNA fragmentation as well as expression of the active form of caspase-3 protein. Based on the quantification of the ratio of free fatty acids to triglycerides in different cheese samples, a significant correlation was detected between lipolytic ripeness and IC(50) values for antiproliferative capacity tested in HL-60 cells. Collectively, these results support a potential role of highly lipolyzed goat cheeses in the prevention of leukemic cell proliferation.","['Yasuda, S', 'Kuwata, H', 'Kawamoto, K', 'Shirakawa, J', 'Atobe, S', 'Hoshi, Y', 'Yamasaki, M', 'Nishiyama, K', 'Tachibana, H', 'Yamada, K', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Igoshi, K']","['Yasuda S', 'Kuwata H', 'Kawamoto K', 'Shirakawa J', 'Atobe S', 'Hoshi Y', 'Yamasaki M', 'Nishiyama K', 'Tachibana H', 'Yamada K', 'Kobayashi H', 'Igoshi K']","['Department of Bioscience, School of Agriculture, Tokai University, Kawayo, Minamiaso, Aso, Kumamoto, Japan. shin.yasuda@agri.u-tokai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Dairy Sci,Journal of dairy science,2985126R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)', '0 (Triglycerides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Cheese/analysis', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/analysis', 'Goats', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/prevention & control', 'Lipolysis', 'Triglycerides/analysis']",2012/05/01 06:00,2012/09/05 06:00,['2012/05/01 06:00'],"['2011/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-0302(12)00193-2 [pii]', '10.3168/jds.2011-4153 [doi]']",ppublish,J Dairy Sci. 2012 May;95(5):2248-60. doi: 10.3168/jds.2011-4153.,"['Copyright (c) 2012 American Dairy Science Association.

However, techniques for maintaining undifferentiated ES cells are often inefficient and result in heterogeneous cell populations. Here, we determined effects of nanopattern polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as a culture substrate in promoting the self-renewal of mouse ES (mES) cells, compared to commercial plastic culture dishes. After many passages, mES cells efficiently maintained their undifferentiated state on nanopattern PDMS, but randomly differentiated on commercial plastic culture dishes, as indicated by partially altered morphologies and decreases in alkaline phosphatase activity and stage-specific expression of embryonic antigen-1. Under nanopattern PDMS conditions, we found increased activities of STAT3 and Akt, important proteins involved in maintaining the self-renewal of mES cells. The substrate-cell interactions also enhanced leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-downstream signaling and inhibited spontaneous differentiation, concomitant with reduced focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling. This reduction in FAK signaling was shown to be important for promoting mES cell self-renewal. Thus, our data demonstrates that nanopattern PDMS contributes to maintaining the self-renewal of mES cells and may be applicable in the large-scale production of homogeneously undifferentiated mES cells.","['Jeon, Kilsoo', 'Oh, Hyun-Jik', 'Lim, Hyejin', 'Kim, Jung-Hyun', 'Lee, Duk Hyun', 'Lee, Eung-Ryoung', 'Park, Bae Ho', 'Cho, Ssang-Goo']","['Jeon K', 'Oh HJ', 'Lim H', 'Kim JH', 'Lee DH', 'Lee ER', 'Park BH', 'Cho SG']","['Department of Animal Biotechnology (BK21), Animal Resources Research Center and SMART-IABS, Konkuk University, Seoul 143-702, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120427,Netherlands,Biomaterials,Biomaterials,8100316,"['0 (Dimethylpolysiloxanes)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '63148-62-9 (baysilon)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dimethylpolysiloxanes/*pharmacology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Focal Adhesions/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Surface Properties/drug effects']",2012/05/01 06:00,2012/09/18 06:00,['2012/05/01 06:00'],"['2012/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0142-9612(12)00408-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomaterials. 2012 Jul;33(21):5206-20. doi: 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.011.

The median white blood cell (WBC) count was 148.82 (5.51-546.0) x 10(9)/L. 15 cases out of them had leucocytosis (WBC >/= 80 x 10(9)/L), whose EFS period (P = 0.021) and OS time (P = 0.050) were reduced significantly. The similar condition was observed in 6 patients whose blood platelet (Plt) count was no more than 30 x 10(9)/L (P = 0.033 for EFS and P = 0.035 for OS, respectively); (2) Immunophenotypic analysis showed that from 22 cases 2 cases were of pro-T, 14 cases of pre-T, 3 cases of cortical-T and 3 cases of medullary-T. Supposing pro-T and pre-T as earlier period immunophenotype, cortical-T and medullary-T as advanced stage immunophenotype, there were significant differences between earlier period and advanced stage patients in terms of EFS and OS (P = 0.035 for EFS and P = 0.028 for OS, respectively); (3) Chromosome karyotype was analyzed in 19 cases at diagnosis, and among them 12 cases had normal karyotypes while abnormal karyotypes were observed in 7 cases. Correlation analysis showed that there were no significant differences between these two groups in time of EFS and OS; (4) The overall complete remission (CR) rate was 72.7 after the induction chemotherapy. The median CR period was 18.0 months. The EFS and OS rate were 57.9 and 67.1 for 1-year, and 23.0 EFS rate and 22.0 OS rate for 3-years, respectively. Six patients received allo-HSCT and the average EFS time and OS time were both 57.8 months, which were significantly longer than those of the intensive chemotherapy group (P = 0.001 and P = 0.002 for EFS and OS, respectively); (5) Cox regression analysis proved that allo-HSCT treatment was the independent favorable prognostic factor. It is concluded that higher CR rate can be achieved by using intensive induction chemotherapy in adult T-ALL, but the long term survival seems poor by chemotherapy only in consolidation treatment stage. Allo-HSCT is the optimal choice to improve the prognosis and the outcome.","['Zhang, Qing', 'Zhou, Chun-Lin', 'Fu, Ming-Wei', 'Wang, Jin-Yu', 'Lin, Dong', 'Liu, Bing-Cheng', 'Li, Wei', 'Mi, Ying-Chang', 'Wang, Jian-Xiang']","['Zhang Q', 'Zhou CL', 'Fu MW', 'Wang JY', 'Lin D', 'Liu BC', 'Li W', 'Mi YC', 'Wang JX']","['Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, China.']",['chi'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",2012/05/01 06:00,2012/12/21 06:00,['2012/05/01 06:00'],"['2012/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2012)02-0478-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2012 Apr;20(2):478-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bone marrow biopsy and prognosis of 62 patients with CR were retrospectively analyzed. The bone marrow was divided into the pre-relapse group and the no-relapse group according to prognosis of patients. In order to clarify the correlation of abnormal quantity and localization of pre-ALIP with AML relapse, the number of single and double-cluster precursor cells and the sum of both were calculated, and their distance from bone trabeculae was surveyed with the computer image segment method. The results showed that the number of pre-ALIP in pre-relapse group (11 +/- 11.71/mm(2)) and no-relapse group (8.33 +/- 9.17/mm(2)) were more than that in normal control group (5.29 +/- 4.00) (P < 0.01).

PI/Calcein staining technique was used to determine survival rate of transfected K562 cells at 48th hour after exposure to 1 micromol/L imatinib. MTS method was used to determine the proliferation changes of transfected K562 cell at 48th hour after exposure to different doses of imatinib, then half inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) was calculated. Expression of NAMPT at 3rd-48th hour after exposure to 1 micromol/L imatinib was determined by Western blot. To explore the effect of NAMPT-siRNA and imatinib on the expression of apoptosis-related genes, the microarray data from NCBI GEO Data-Sets was analyzed, then the results were confirmed by Western blot. The luciferase reporter assay was used to determine the effect of NAMPT and imatinib on transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB transcription factors. The results showed that after exposure to 1 micromol/L imatinib for 3 - 48 h, there was no significant change of NAMPT expression in K562 cells. The expression of NAMPT could be effectively inhibited by the NAMPT-siRNA. After exposure to 1 micromol/L of imatinib for 48 h, the survival rate of NAMPT-siRNA interference group was lower than that of negative control group (P < 0.05), indicating that suppression of NAMPT expression can increase the sensitivity of K562 cells to imatinib and enhance the killing effect of imatinib on K562 cells. The IC(50) of imatinib in NAMPT-siRNA interference group was the lowest compared with that of control group (P < 0.05) after exposure to different concentrations of imatinib for 48 h, the fitted survival curves showed that the slope of NAMPT-siRNA interference group was the largest ranging between 0.01 - 0.1 micromol/L of imatinib. Data mining of expression profiling indicated that the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 decreased in K562 cells treated with either NAMPT-siRNA or imatinib, which was confirmed by Western blot. The inhibitory effect was much more significant when both NAMPT-siRNA and imatinib were used. The results of luciferase reporter assay showed that either NAMPT-siRNA or imatinib decreased transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB. The decreased effect was much more significant when both NAMPT-siRNA and imatinib were used. It is concluded that survival of K562 cells affected by imatinib may not be due to regulation of expression of NAMPT. When expression of NAMPT decreases, the K562 cells are more sensitive to imatinib, this may be related with the decreased transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB and its downstream effector Bcl-2.","['Lin, Ping-Ping', 'Bai, Xue-Jia', 'Yue, Zhi-Xia', 'Yan, Shao-Fei', 'Li, Zong-Wen', 'Gao, Chao', 'Mei, Yan-Yan', 'Wang, Kai-Ling', 'Li, Wei-Jing', 'Ding, Wei', 'Li, Zhi-Gang']","['Lin PP', 'Bai XJ', 'Yue ZX', 'Yan SF', 'Li ZW', 'Gao C', 'Mei YY', 'Wang KL', 'Li WJ', 'Ding W', 'Li ZG']","['Hematology Center, Beijing Children Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100045, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.4.2.12 (Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.2.12 (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Cytokines/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2012/05/01 06:00,2012/12/21 06:00,['2012/05/01 06:00'],"['2012/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2012)02-0235-07 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2012 Apr;20(2):235-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of gossypol acetate on survival rates of Raji cells and mononuclear cells (MNC) from normal bone marrow were evaluated by MTT assay. After co-treatment with gossypol acetate and dexamethasone, the apoptosis rate of Raji cells was detected by FCM. The results showed that gossypol acetate was able to induce apoptosis in primary cultured ALL cells at concentrations of >/= 5 micromol/L. The effect was concentration and time dependent. Apoptosis-inducing concentration in CLL cells was higher than that in ALL cells. After exposing to 50 micromol/L gossypol acetate for 48 h, the apoptosis rate of ALL and CLL cells were (90.4 +/- 6.2)% and (51.7 +/- 10.3)% separately.

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal-dominant disease associated with reduction in the copy number of the D4Z4 repeat mapping to 4q35. By an unknown mechanism, D4Z4 deletion causes an epigenetic switch leading to de-repression of 4q35 genes. Here we show that the Polycomb group of epigenetic repressors targets D4Z4 in healthy subjects and that D4Z4 deletion is associated with reduced Polycomb silencing in FSHD patients. We identify DBE-T, a chromatin-associated noncoding RNA produced selectively in FSHD patients that coordinates de-repression of 4q35 genes. DBE-T recruits the Trithorax group protein Ash1L to the FSHD locus, driving histone H3 lysine 36 dimethylation, chromatin remodeling, and 4q35 gene transcription. This study provides insights into the biological function of repetitive sequences in regulating gene expression and shows how mutations of such elements can influence the progression of a human genetic disease.","['Cabianca, Daphne S', 'Casa, Valentina', 'Bodega, Beatrice', 'Xynos, Alexandros', 'Ginelli, Enrico', 'Tanaka, Yujiro', 'Gabellini, Davide']","['Cabianca DS', 'Casa V', 'Bodega B', 'Xynos A', 'Ginelli E', 'Tanaka Y', 'Gabellini D']","['Dulbecco Telethon Institute at San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Division of Regenerative Medicine, Stem Cells, and Gene Therapy, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120426,United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (ASH1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muscle, Skeletal/metabolism/pathology', 'Muscular Dystrophy, Facioscapulohumeral/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'RNA, Untranslated/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Response Elements', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2012/05/01 06:00,2012/07/03 06:00,['2012/05/01 06:00'],"['2011/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0092-8674(12)00463-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cell.2012.03.035 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 2012 May 11;149(4):819-31. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2012.03.035.

The obtained results indicate that the representative complexes (1, 3, 6) exhibit a strong ability to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and HMGB1 without influence on the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1RA in the LPS-activated macrophages. The complexes also significantly influence the formation of edema, caused by the intraplantar application of polysaccharide lambda-carrageenan to rats in vivo.

While conventional allografting can extend the cure rates, its application remains limited mostly to younger patients and those in remission. Limited efficacy of current therapies and improved understanding of the disease biology provided a spur for clinical trials examining novel agents and therapeutic strategies in AML. Clinical studies with novel chemotherapeutics, antibodies, different signal transduction inhibitors, and epigenetic modulators demonstrated their clinical activity; however, it remains unclear how to successfully integrate novel agents either alone or in combination with chemotherapy into the overall therapeutic schema for AML. Further studies are needed to examine their role in relation to standard chemotherapy and their applicability to select patient populations based on recognition of unique disease and patient characteristics, including the development of predictive biomarkers of response. With increasing use of nonmyeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning and alternative graft sources such as haploidentical donors and cord blood transplants, the benefits of allografting may extend to a broader patient population, including older AML patients and those lacking a HLA-matched donor.

The rapid advancement in understanding the biology of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and cancer stem cells (CSCs) in recent years has renewed interest in investigating the role of stem cells in benzene-induced malignancy and bone marrow depression. The interplay between benzene and stem cells is complex involving the stem cell, progenitor, and HSC niche compartments of the bone marrow. In this prospect, benzene metabolites formed through metabolism in the liver and bone marrow cause damage in hematopoietic cells via multiple mechanisms that, in addition to traditionally recognized chromosomal aberration and covalent binding, incorporate oxidative stress, alteration of gene expression, apoptosis, error-prone DNA repair, epigenetic regulation, and disruption of tumor surveillance. However, benzene-exposed individuals exhibit variable susceptibility to benzene effect that arises, in part, from genetic variations in benzene metabolism, DNA repair, genomic stability, and immune function. These new studies of benzene leukemogenesis and hematotoxicity are expected to provide insights into how environmental and occupational chemicals affect stem cells to cause cancer and toxicity, which impact the risk assessment, permissible level, and therapy of benzene exposure.","['Wang, Liping', 'He, Xiaoqing', 'Bi, Yongyi', 'Ma, Qiang']","['Wang L', 'He X', 'Bi Y', 'Ma Q']","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Toxicology, School of Public Health, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",20120524,United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzene/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Repair', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/chemistry/metabolism']",2012/05/01 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/05/01 06:00'],"['2012/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/tx3001169 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2012 Jul 16;25(7):1303-15. doi: 10.1021/tx3001169.

Early identification of poor mobilizers could avoid repeated attempts at mobilization, with the administration of pre-emptive rescue mobilization. METHODS: Data from the first mobilization schedule of 397 patients referred consecutively for autologous HSCT between 2000 and 2010 were collected. Poor mobilization was defined as the collection of < 2 x 10(6) CD34(+)cells/kg body weight (BW). RESULTS: The median age was 53 years (range 4-70) and 228 (57%) were males. Diagnoses were multiple myeloma in 133 cases, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 114, acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome in 81, Hodgkin's lymphoma in 42, solid tumors in 17 and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 10. The mobilization regimen consisted of recombinant human granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in 346 patients (87%) and chemotherapy followed by G-CSF (C + G-CSF) in 51 (13%). Poor mobilization occurred in 105 patients (29%), without differences according to mobilization schedule. Diagnosis, previous therapy with purine analogs and three or more previous chemotherapy lines were predictive factors for poor mobilization. A CD34(+)cell count in PB > 13.8/muL was enough to ensure >/= 2 x 10(6) CD34(+)cells/kg, with high sensitivity (90%) and specificity (91%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of poor mobilization was high, being associated with disease type, therapy with purine analogs and multiple chemotherapy regimens. The threshold of CD34(+) cell count in PB identified poor mobilizers, in whom the administration of immediate or pre-emptive plerixafor could be useful to avoid a second mobilization.","['Sancho, Juan-Manuel', 'Morgades, Mireia', 'Grifols, Joan-Ramon', 'Junca, Jordi', 'Guardia, Ramon', 'Vives, Susana', 'Ferra, Christelle', 'Batlle, Monsterrat', 'Ester, Anna', 'Gallardo, David', 'Milla, Fuensanta', 'Feliu, Evarist', 'Ribera, Josep-Maria']","['Sancho JM', 'Morgades M', 'Grifols JR', 'Junca J', 'Guardia R', 'Vives S', 'Ferra C', 'Batlle M', 'Ester A', 'Gallardo D', 'Milla F', 'Feliu E', 'Ribera JM']","['Clinical Hematology Department, ICO-Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Jose Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. jsancho@iconcologia.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120427,England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Antigens, CD34/blood/immunology', 'Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2012/05/01 06:00,2013/04/04 06:00,['2012/05/01 06:00'],"['2012/05/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3109/14653249.2012.681042 [doi]', 'S1465-3249(12)70697-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2012 Aug;14(7):823-9. doi: 10.3109/14653249.2012.681042.

METHODS: From 2004-2009, we analyzed bacteremia caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) (n = 100) and we compared with bacteremia caused by cephalosporin-susceptible E. coli (n = 100) in patients with hematologic malignancies. OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical features, risk factors, and outcome of ESBL-EC BSI in patients with hematologic malignancies, and to study the molecular epidemiology of ESBL-EC isolates. RESULTS: The main diagnosis was acute leukemia in 115 patients (57.5%). Death-related E. coli infection was significantly increased with ESBL-EC (34% vs. control group, 19%; p = 0.03). Treatment for BSI was considered appropriate in 64 patients with ESBL-EC (mean survival, 245 +/- 345 days), and in 45 control patients this was 443 +/- 613 (p = 0.03). In patients not receiving appropriate antimicrobial treatment, survival was significantly decreased in cases compared with controls (26 +/- 122 vs. 276 +/- 442; p = 0.001). Fifty six of the ESBL-EC isolates were characterized by molecular analysis: 47 (84%) expressed CTX-M-15, two (3.6%) SHV, and seven (12.5%) did not correspond to either of these two ESBL enzymes. No TLA-1 enzyme was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who had been previously hospitalized and who received cephalosporins during the previous month, have an increased risk of ESBL-EC bacteremia. Mortality was significantly increased in patients with ESBL-EC BSI. A polyclonal trend was detected, which reflects non-cross transmission of multiresistant E.coli isolates.","['Cornejo-Juarez, Patricia', 'Perez-Jimenez, Carolina', 'Silva-Sanchez, Jesus', 'Velazquez-Acosta, Consuelo', 'Gonzalez-Lara, Fernanda', 'Reyna-Flores, Fernando', 'Sanchez-Perez, Alejandro', 'Volkow-Fernandez, Patricia']","['Cornejo-Juarez P', 'Perez-Jimenez C', 'Silva-Sanchez J', 'Velazquez-Acosta C', 'Gonzalez-Lara F', 'Reyna-Flores F', 'Sanchez-Perez A', 'Volkow-Fernandez P']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Secretaria de Salud, Mexico City, Mexico. patcornejo@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120423,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', 'EC 3.5.2.6 (beta-Lactamases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology/isolation & purification', 'Escherichia coli Infections/drug therapy/*microbiology/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/complications/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'beta-Lactamases/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2012/04/28 06:00,2012/09/11 06:00,['2012/04/28 06:00'],"['2012/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0035780 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-00593 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e35780. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0035780.

Although E. chaffeensis lacks entire lipopolysaccharide and most peptidoglycan biosynthesis genes, it induces inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Ehrlichia chaffeensis components that induce inflammation and the responsive host cell pathway are not known. METHODS: Expression of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) in E. chaffeensis was analyzed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Bocillin FL binding assay. Next, recombinant PBP, which was high-pressure liquid chromatography purified, and native PBP of E. chaffeensis were investigated for their ability to induce proinflammatory cytokines in the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from wild-type and MyD88 knockout mice. RESULTS: Expression of PBP by E. chaffeensis was upregulated during its intracellular life cycle. PBP induced interleukin 8 or CXCL2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, and interleukin 10 in THP-1 cells and BMDMs. Cytokine induction by PBP was MyD88-dependent. Removal of PBP from E. chaffeensis lysate using penicillin affinity column and a complementation assay confirmed cytokine-inducing activity of native PBP. CONCLUSIONS: The cytokine-inducing activity by E. chaffeensis PBP provides novel insights into pathogen-associated molecular patterns and pathogenesis of E. chaffeensis infection.","['Rahman, Mohd Akhlakur', 'Cheng, Zhihui', 'Matsuo, Junji', 'Rikihisa, Yasuko']","['Rahman MA', 'Cheng Z', 'Matsuo J', 'Rikihisa Y']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210-1093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120426,United States,J Infect Dis,The Journal of infectious diseases,0413675,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL2)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', '0 (Penicillin-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CXCL2/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Ehrlichia chaffeensis/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Ehrlichiosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-1beta/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-8/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Macrophages/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Penicillin-Binding Proteins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology']",2012/04/28 06:00,2012/10/02 06:00,['2012/04/28 06:00'],"['2012/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['jis313 [pii]', '10.1093/infdis/jis313 [doi]']",ppublish,J Infect Dis. 2012 Jul 1;206(1):110-6. doi: 10.1093/infdis/jis313.

This transformation is driven by genomic instability, but mechanisms remain unknown. Telomere dysfunction might generate genomic instability leading to cytopenias and disease progression. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We undertook a pilot study of 94 patients with MDS (56 patients) and AML (38 patients). The MDS cohort consisted of refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (32 cases), refractory anemia (12 cases), refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB)1 (8 cases), RAEB2 (1 case), refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (2 cases), and MDS with isolated del(5q) (1 case). The AML cohort was composed of AML-M4 (12 cases), AML-M2 (10 cases), AML-M5 (5 cases), AML-M0 (5 cases), AML-M1 (2 cases), AML-M4eo (1 case), and AML with multidysplasia-related changes (1 case). Three-dimensional quantitative FISH of telomeres was carried out on nuclei from bone marrow samples and analyzed using TeloView. RESULTS: We defined three-dimensional nuclear telomeric profiles on the basis of telomere numbers, telomeric aggregates, telomere signal intensities, nuclear volumes, and nuclear telomere distribution. Using these parameters, we blindly subdivided the MDS patients into nine subgroups and the AML patients into six subgroups. Each of the parameters showed significant differences between MDS and AML. Combining all parameters revealed significant differences between all subgroups. Three-dimensional telomeric profiles are linked to the evolution of telomere dysfunction, defining a model of progression from MDS to AML. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show distinct three-dimensional telomeric profiles specific to patients with MDS and AML that help subgroup patients based on the severity of telomere dysfunction highlighted in the profiles.","['Gadji, Macoura', 'Adebayo Awe, Julius', 'Rodrigues, Prerana', 'Kumar, Rajat', 'Houston, Donald S', 'Klewes, Ludger', 'Dieye, Tandakha Ndiaye', 'Rego, Eduardo Magalhaes', 'Passetto, Roberto Falcao', 'de Oliveira, Fabio Morato', 'Mai, Sabine']","['Gadji M', 'Adebayo Awe J', 'Rodrigues P', 'Kumar R', 'Houston DS', 'Klewes L', 'Dieye TN', 'Rego EM', 'Passetto RF', 'de Oliveira FM', 'Mai S']","['The University of Manitoba, Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, Cancer Care Manitoba, The Genomic Centre for Cancer Research and Diagnosis, Section of Hematoloy/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, The University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120426,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/pathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Telomere/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Young Adult']",2012/04/28 06:00,2012/12/21 06:00,['2012/04/28 06:00'],"['2012/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-0087 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0087 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Jun 15;18(12):3293-304. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0087.

We previously observed that ANXA1 was proteolytically cleaved in lung extracts prepared from a murine OVA-induced asthma model. However, the cleavage and regulatory mechanisms of ANXA1 in the allergic response remain unclear. In this study, we found that ANXA1 was cleaved in both Ag-induced activated rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 (RBL-2H3) cells and bone marrow-derived mast cells. This cleavage event was inhibited when intracellular Ca(2+) signaling was blocked. ANXA1-knockdown RBL-2H3 cells produced a greater amount of eicosanoids with simultaneous upregulation of cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) activity. However, there were no changes in degranulation activity or cytokine production in the knockdown cells. We also found that cPLA(2) interacted with either full-length or cleaved ANXA1 in activated mast cells. cPLA(2) mainly interacted with full-length ANXA1 in the cytosol and cleaved ANXA1 in the membrane fraction. In addition, introduction of a cleavage-resistant ANXA1 mutant had inhibitory effects on both the phosphorylation of cPLA(2) and release of eicosanoids during the activation of RBL-2H3 cells and bone marrow-derived mast cells. These data suggest that cleavage of ANXA1 causes proinflammatory reactions by increasing the phosphorylation of cPLA(2) and production of eicosanoids during mast-cell activation.","['Kwon, Joon Hyun', 'Lee, Jea Hwang', 'Kim, Ki Soon', 'Chung, Youn Wook', 'Kim, Ick Young']","['Kwon JH', 'Lee JH', 'Kim KS', 'Chung YW', 'Kim IY']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Anam-Dong, Sungbuk-Ku, Seoul 136-701, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120425,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Annexin A1)', '0 (Eicosanoids)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2, Cytosolic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Annexin A1/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Eicosanoids/biosynthesis', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism/physiology', 'Mast Cells/enzymology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phospholipases A2, Cytosolic/*metabolism/physiology', 'Phosphorylation/immunology', '*Proteolysis']",2012/04/28 06:00,2012/08/15 06:00,['2012/04/28 06:00'],"['2012/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1102306 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1102306 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2012 Jun 1;188(11):5665-73. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1102306.

The high rate of postimplantation fetal loss in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice is believed to be related to an abnormal decidual production of interferon (IFN)gamma. To address whether diabetes alters the natural events associated with successful implantation, certain morphological and molecular features of uterine receptivity in diabetic NOD (dNOD) mice were examined in normally mated pregnancy and in concanavalin A (ConA)-induced pseudopregnancy. As opposed to normoglycemic NOD (cNOD) mice, dNOD mice expressed retarded maturation of their uterine pinopodes and overexpressed MUC1 mucin at implantation sites (P < 0.001). Uterine production of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and phosphorylation of uterine NFkappaBp65 and STAT3-Ty705 were found to be low (P < 0.01) during Day 4.5 postcoitum, whereas IFNgamma was aberrantly overexpressed. Loss of temporal regulation of progesterone receptor A (PR A) and PR B, together with aberrantly increased expression of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT-y (PIASy) (P < 0.01) and reduced recruitment (P < 0.01) of the latter to nuclear progesterone receptor sites were prominent features of decidualization failure occurring at peri-implantation in dNOD mice. In conclusion, the aberrant expression of endometrial IFNgamma in dNOD mice is associated with a nonreceptive endometrial milieu contributing to peri-implantation embryo loss in type 1 diabetes.","['Albaghdadi, Ahmad J H', 'Kan, Frederick W K']","['Albaghdadi AJ', 'Kan FW']","[""Department of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120802,United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Mucin-1)', '0 (Piasy protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '0 (Rela protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Abortion, Spontaneous/*etiology/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Concanavalin A', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*complications/metabolism', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Endometrium/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mucin-1/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT/metabolism', 'Receptors, Progesterone/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism']",2012/04/28 06:00,2013/01/03 06:00,['2012/04/28 06:00'],"['2012/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/03 06:00 [medline]']","['biolreprod.112.100016 [pii]', '10.1095/biolreprod.112.100016 [doi]']",epublish,Biol Reprod. 2012 Aug 2;87(2):30. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.112.100016.

The intermediate metabolites of arsenic, monomethylarsonous acid (MMA(III)) and dimethylarsinous acid (DMA(III)), are formed by methylation reactions, and they are more reactive and toxic than the inorganic precursor arsenite (iAs(III)); however, the detailed mechanism of toxicity is poorly understood. Here, we studied the effects of three arsenic compounds (i.e., iAs(III), MMA(III), and DMA(III)) on mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and release of apoptotic cytochrome c (Cyt c) after incubating with rat liver mitochondria. Inorganic iAs(III) had no effect on mitochondrial swelling even at higher concentrations ranging up to 100 muM, but swelling was significantly induced in the presence of Ca(2+). Additionally, mitochondrial swelling was strongly induced by exposure to the methylated forms of MMA(III) and DMA(III) in a dose-dependent manner in the absence of Ca(2+), suggesting that the methylated forms may have potent effects on cellular mitochondria. Although mitochondrial swelling was completely inhibited in the presence of cyclosporin-A (an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition) or ruthenium red (an inhibitor of Ca(2+) uniporter) following exposure to methylated arsenicals, the release of apoptotic Cyt c from mitochondria was not inhibited, indicating that release of Cyt c is probably not dependent on mPTP opening. In addition, inhibitors of Bax (e.g., Bax-inhibiting peptide) did not reduce the release of Cyt c from the mitochondria by formation of Bax-voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) complex, whereas the recombinant Bcl-x(L )proteins significantly reduced the release of Cyt c after exposure to DMA(III), suggesting that dimethylated DMA(III) directly interacted with the VDAC in mitochondria and caused the release of Cyt c from mitochondria.","['Naranmandura, Hua', 'Chen, Xuan', 'Tanaka, Mariko', 'Wang, Wen Wen', 'Rehman, Kanwal', 'Xu, Shi', 'Chen, Zhe', 'Chen, Shu Qing', 'Suzuki, Noriyuki']","['Naranmandura H', 'Chen X', 'Tanaka M', 'Wang WW', 'Rehman K', 'Xu S', 'Chen Z', 'Chen SQ', 'Suzuki N']","['Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Biochemical Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China. narenman@zju.edu.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120426,United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,"['0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (dimethylarsinous acid)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'AJ2HL7EU8K (Cacodylic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cacodylic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytochromes c/*metabolism', 'Ion Channels/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria, Liver/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Rats']",2012/04/28 06:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/04/28 06:00'],"['2012/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['kfs154 [pii]', '10.1093/toxsci/kfs154 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2012 Jul;128(1):137-46. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kfs154.

In contrast to the many studies addressing childhood leukemia, few have included adult patients. METHODS: In this register-based case-control study, we examined the association between parental age and incidence of acute leukemia in 2,660 childhood cases and 4,412 adult cases of acute leukemia, compared with 28,288 age-matched controls selected from a population-based register. Relative risks were estimated with conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: We found a small increased risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia with increasing paternal age (adjusted OR, 1.05 per 5-year increase in age). Risk estimates were similar for childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML), whereas no association was found with adult leukemia. Meanwhile, we observed a decreased risk of adult AML with increasing number of siblings, both older and younger. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the idea of a prenatal etiology of leukemia but indicate that parental age effects are limited to childhood cases. IMPACT: This is the first large study on parental age and leukemia risk, which includes adult cases. The finding on family size and risk of adult AML needs to be validated in future studies.","['Larfors, Gunnar', 'Hallbook, Helene', 'Simonsson, Bengt']","['Larfors G', 'Hallbook H', 'Simonsson B']","['Unit of Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. gunnar.larfors@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120426,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Down Syndrome/complications/epidemiology', '*Family Characteristics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', '*Parents', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2012/04/28 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/04/28 06:00'],"['2012/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-12-0178 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-0178 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2012 Jul;21(7):1185-90. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-0178.

RNAi can be exploited to experimentally knockdown the expression of one or more genes in cell lines or even in cells in vivo and also became an interesting tool to develop new therapeutic approaches. One of the major challenges of using RNAi is selecting effective shRNAs or siRNAs that sufficiently down-regulate the expression of the target gene. Here, we describe a system to select functional shRNAs or siRNAs that makes use of the leukemia cell line Ba/F3 that is dependent on the expression of a mutant form of the PDGFRalpha kinase for its proliferation and survival. The basis of this system is the generation of an expression construct, where part of the open reading frame of the gene of interest is linked to the mutant PDGFRalpha. Thus, shRNAs or siRNAs that effectively target the gene of interest also result in a reduction of the expression of the mutant PDGFRalpha protein, which can be detected by a reduction of the proliferation of the cells. We demonstrate that this validation system can be used for the selection of effective siRNAs as well as shRNAs. Unlike other systems, the system described here is not dependent on obtaining high-transduction efficiencies, and nonspecific effects of the siRNAs or shRNAs can be detected by comparing the effects in the presence or absence of the growth factor interleukin-3.","['Pieraets, Sofie', 'Cox, Luk', 'Gielen, Olga', 'Cools, Jan']","['Pieraets S', 'Cox L', 'Gielen O', 'Cools J']","['Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20120426,United States,RNA,"RNA (New York, N.Y.)",9509184,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Open Reading Frames', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2012/04/28 06:00,2012/07/24 06:00,['2012/04/28 06:00'],"['2012/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['rna.030015.111 [pii]', '10.1261/rna.030015.111 [doi]']",ppublish,RNA. 2012 Jun;18(6):1296-306. doi: 10.1261/rna.030015.111.

Zwitterionic structure was fabricated by 3-(diethylamino)propylamine (DEAPA) grafted onto the surface of ployacrylic acid coated magnetite nanoparticles via EDC/NHS [N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbo-diimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide] coupling chemistry. Zwitterionic particles demonstrated five times lower macrophage cell uptake than the original particles and low cell toxicity. Magnetic resonance angiography indicated that zwitterionic nanoparticles had much longer in vivo circulation time than the original particles and were an ideal candidate for blood pool contrast agent. We suppose that zwitterionic modification by DEAPA and EDC/NHS can be used generally for coating nanoparticles with carboxyl surface and to prolong their circulating time.","['Xiao, Wangchuan', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Li, Mingli', 'Ma, Yongjie', 'Chen, Yuxin', 'Zhang, Chunfu', 'Li, Dan', 'Gu, Hongchen']","['Xiao W', 'Lin J', 'Li M', 'Ma Y', 'Chen Y', 'Zhang C', 'Li D', 'Gu H']","['Med-X Research Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Contrast Media Mol Imaging,Contrast media & molecular imaging,101286760,"['0 (Contrast Media)', '0 (Dextrans)', '0 (Ferric Compounds)', '0 (Magnetite Nanoparticles)', '0 (ferumoxtran-10)', '0 (superparamagnetic blood pool agent)', '1K09F3G675 (ferric oxide)', '9002-89-5 (Polyvinyl Alcohol)', 'XM0M87F357 (Ferrosoferric Oxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aorta, Abdominal/*pathology', 'Cell Death', '*Contrast Media/chemistry', 'Dextrans', '*Ferric Compounds/chemistry', '*Ferrosoferric Oxide', 'Leukemia/pathology', '*Magnetic Resonance Angiography', '*Magnetite Nanoparticles/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Materials Testing', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Particle Size', 'Polyvinyl Alcohol/chemistry', 'Rabbits', 'Surface Properties', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vena Cava, Inferior/*pathology']",2012/04/28 06:00,2012/12/15 06:00,['2012/04/28 06:00'],"['2012/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cmmi.501 [doi]'],ppublish,Contrast Media Mol Imaging. 2012 May-Jun;7(3):320-7. doi: 10.1002/cmmi.501.,"['Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These specific biological characteristics are supported by signals from the surrounding niche and the stemcell-specific transcription factor set, including hypoxia and the machinery that senses low oxygen levels. These properties are essential for normal stem cells, and when defective may induce cellular senescence and tumorigenesis. In contrast, cancer stem cells in tumor tissue utilize these biological characters driven by stemcell-specific molecular mechanisms and acquire indefinite self-renewal capacity, drug resistance, and metastatic ability. A fuller understanding of the differences between normal and malignant stem cells in the biological and molecular context is, therefore, necessary to the development of therapies against cancer stem cells.

Amyloid plaques are primarily composed of aggregated amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), a proteolytic fragment of the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP). For APP to be proteolytically cleaved into Abeta, it must be internalized into the cell and trafficked to endosomes where specific protease complexes can cleave APP. Several recent genome-wide association studies have reported that several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the phosphatidylinositol clathrin assembly lymphoid-myeloid leukemia (PICALM) gene were significantly associated with Alzheimer disease, suggesting a role in APP endocytosis and Abeta generation. Here, we show that PICALM co-localizes with APP in intracellular vesicles of N2a-APP cells after endocytosis is initiated. PICALM knockdown resulted in reduced APP internalization and Abeta generation. Conversely, PICALM overexpression increased APP internalization and Abeta production. In vivo, PICALM was found to be expressed in neurons and co-localized with APP throughout the cortex and hippocampus in APP/PS1 mice. PICALM expression was altered using AAV8 gene transfer of PICALM shRNA or PICALM cDNA into the hippocampus of 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice. PICALM knockdown decreased soluble and insoluble Abeta levels and amyloid plaque load in the hippocampus. Conversely, PICALM overexpression increased Abeta levels and amyloid plaque load. These data indicate that PICALM, an adaptor protein involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, regulates APP internalization and subsequent Abeta generation. PICALM contributes to amyloid plaque load in brain likely via its effect on Abeta metabolism.","['Xiao, Qingli', 'Gil, So-Chon', 'Yan, Ping', 'Wang, Yan', 'Han, Sharon', 'Gonzales, Ernie', 'Perez, Ronaldo', 'Cirrito, John R', 'Lee, Jin-Moo']","['Xiao Q', 'Gil SC', 'Yan P', 'Wang Y', 'Han S', 'Gonzales E', 'Perez R', 'Cirrito JR', 'Lee JM']","['Hope Center for Neurological Disorders and Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120426,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (APP protein, human)', '0 (Amyloid)', '0 (Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor)', '0 (Clathrin)', '0 (Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins)', '0 (PICALM protein, human)', '0 (PICALM protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Amyloid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clathrin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Hippocampus/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Plaque, Amyloid/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2012/04/28 06:00,2012/08/25 06:00,['2012/04/28 06:00'],"['2012/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)49819-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.338376 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Jun 15;287(25):21279-89. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.338376.

Staining with anti-PLZF and anti-NK1.1 Abs allows the definition of two subsets of NKTalphabeta and NKTgammadelta thymocytes that differ phenotypically and functionally: a PLZF(+) NK1.1(-) subset composed of mostly quiescent cells that secrete more IL-4 than IFN-gamma upon activation and a PLZF(+/-) NK1.1(+) subset that expresses CD127, NK1.1, and other NK-cell markers, secrete more IFN-gamma than IL-4 upon activation and contains a sizable fraction of dividing cells. The size of the NK1.1(+) population is very tightly regulated and NK1.1(+) alphabeta and gammadelta thymocytes compete for a thymic niche. Furthermore, the relative representation of the PLZF(+) and NK1.1(+) subsets varies in a strain-specific manner with C57BL/6 (B6) mice containing more NK1.1(+) cells and (B6 x DBA/2)F1 (B6D2F1) mice more PLZF(+) cells. Consequently, activation of NKT cells in vivo is expected to result in higher levels of IL-4 secreted in B6D2F1 mice than in B6 mice.

Our hypothesis is that MTX side effects can be attenuated by directing the drug to the target cells (i.e., leukocytes) using (cyclo(1,12)PenPRGGSVLVTGC) peptide (cIBR). To test this hypothesis, MTX was conjugated to the N-terminus of cIBR peptide to give MTX-cIBR conjugate. MTX-cIBR (5.0 mg/kg) suppressed joint arthritis in adjuvant arthritis rats and prevented periarticular inflammation and bone resorption of the limb joints. In vitro, the toxicity of MTX-cIBR peptide against Molt-3 T cells was inhibited by anti-lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) antibody and cIBR peptide in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that the uptake of MTX-cIBR was partially mediated by LFA-1. Chemical stability studies indicated that MTX-cIBR was most stable at pH 6.0. The MTX portion of MTX-cIBR was unstable under acidic conditions, whereas the cIBR portion was unstable under basic conditions. In biological media, MTX-cIBR had short half lives in rat plasma (44 min) and homogenized rat heart tissue (38 min). This low plasma stability may contribute to the low in vivo efficacy of MTX-cIBR; therefore, there is a need to design a more stable conjugate to improve the in vivo efficacy.","['Majumdar, Sumit', 'Anderson, Meagan E', 'Xu, Christine R', 'Yakovleva, Tatyana V', 'Gu, Leo C', 'Malefyt, Thomas R', 'Siahaan, Teruna J']","['Majumdar S', 'Anderson ME', 'Xu CR', 'Yakovleva TV', 'Gu LC', 'Malefyt TR', 'Siahaan TJ']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The University of Kansas, Simons Research Laboratories, Lawrence, Kansas 66047, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120426,United States,J Pharm Sci,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2985195R,"['0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (cIBR peptide)', ""9007-81-2 (Freund's Adjuvant)"", 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antirheumatic Agents/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Arthritis, Experimental/chemically induced/immunology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/chemically induced/immunology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', '*Drug Carriers', 'Drug Stability', ""Freund's Adjuvant"", 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Peptides, Cyclic/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Technology, Pharmaceutical/methods', 'Time Factors']",2012/04/28 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/04/28 06:00'],"['2012/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1002/jps.23164 [doi]', 'S0022-3549(15)31442-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pharm Sci. 2012 Sep;101(9):3275-91. doi: 10.1002/jps.23164.

However, incomplete eradication of residual disease is a general problem of long-term TKI therapy. Activation of mouse haematopoietic stem cells by interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) stimulated the discussion of whether a combination treatment leads to accelerated eradication of the CML clone. METHODS: We base our simulation approach on a mathematical model describing human CML as a competition phenomenon between normal and malignant cells. We amend this model to incorporate the description of IFNalpha activity and simulate different scenarios for potential treatment combinations. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the overall sensitivity of CML stem cells to IFNalpha activation is a crucial determinant for the benefit of a potential combination therapy. We furthermore show that pulsed IFNalpha together with continuous TKI administration is the most promising strategy for a combination treatment in which the therapeutic benefit prevails adverse side effects. CONCLUSION: Our modelling approach is a highly beneficial tool to quantitatively address the competition between normal and leukaemic haematopoiesis in treated CML patients. We derive testable predictions for different experimental settings that are suggested before the clinical implementation of the combination treatment.","['Glauche, I', 'Horn, K', 'Horn, M', 'Thielecke, L', 'Essers, M A G', 'Trumpp, A', 'Roeder, I']","['Glauche I', 'Horn K', 'Horn M', 'Thielecke L', 'Essers MA', 'Trumpp A', 'Roeder I']","['Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry (IMB), Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden University of Technology, Fetscherstr. 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany. ingmar.glauche@tu-dresden.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120426,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/administration & dosage', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Mice', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage']",2012/04/28 06:00,2012/07/24 06:00,['2012/04/28 06:00'],"['2012/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2012142 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2012.142 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2012 May 22;106(11):1742-52. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2012.142.

Although both drugs avidly bind Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), and Bcl-w in vitro, we find that Bcl-2 is the critical target in vivo, suggesting that patients with tumors overexpressing Bcl-2 will probably benefit. In human non-Hodgkin lymphomas, high expression of Bcl-2 but not Bcl-x(L) predicted sensitivity to ABT-263. Moreover, we show that increasing Bcl-2 sensitized normal and transformed lymphoid cells to ABT-737 by elevating proapoptotic Bim. In striking contrast, increasing Bcl-x(L) or Bcl-w conferred robust resistance to ABT-737, despite also increasing Bim. Cell-based protein redistribution assays unexpectedly revealed that ABT-737 disrupts Bcl-2/Bim complexes more readily than Bcl-x(L)/Bim or Bcl-w/Bim complexes.

Results show that these apoptotic body-like liposomes carrying PA (ABL/PA) (i) are more efficiently internalized by human macrophages than by nonprofessional phagocytes, (ii) induce cytosolic Ca(2+) influx, (iii) promote Ca(2+)-dependent maturation of phagolysosomes containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), (iv) induce Ca(2+)-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, (v) inhibit intracellular mycobacterial growth in differentiated THP-1 cells as well as in type-1 and -2 human macrophages, and (vi) down-regulate tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-12, IL-1beta, IL-18, and IL-23 and up-regulate transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta without altering IL-10, IL-27, and IL-6 mRNA expression. Also, ABL/PA promoted intracellular killing of M. tuberculosis in bronchoalveolar lavage cells from patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis. Furthermore, the treatment of MTB-infected mice with ABL/PA, in combination or not with isoniazid (INH), dramatically reduced lung and, to a lesser extent, liver and spleen mycobacterial loads, with a concomitant 10-fold reduction of serum TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IFN-gamma compared with that in untreated mice.

While Notch is thought to exert the majority of its effects through transcriptional activation of Myc, it also likely has independent roles in T-ALL malignancy. Here, we utilized a zebrafish transgenic model of T-ALL, where Notch does not induce Myc transcription, to identify a novel Notch gene expression signature that is also found in human T-ALL and is regulated independently of Myc. Cross-species microarray comparisons between zebrafish and mammalian disease identified a common T-ALL gene signature, suggesting that conserved genetic pathways underlie T-ALL development. Functionally, Notch expression induced a significant expansion of pre-leukemic clones; however, a majority of these clones were not fully transformed and could not induce leukemia when transplanted into recipient animals. Limiting-dilution cell transplantation revealed that Notch signaling does not increase the overall frequency of leukemia-propagating cells (LPCs), either alone or in collaboration with Myc. Taken together, these data indicate that a primary role of Notch signaling in T-ALL is to expand a population of pre-malignant thymocytes, of which a subset acquire the necessary mutations to become fully transformed LPCs.","['Blackburn, J S', 'Liu, S', 'Raiser, D M', 'Martinez, S A', 'Feng, H', 'Meeker, N D', 'Gentry, J', 'Neuberg, D', 'Look, A T', 'Ramaswamy, S', 'Bernards, A', 'Trede, N S', 'Langenau, D M']","['Blackburn JS', 'Liu S', 'Raiser DM', 'Martinez SA', 'Feng H', 'Meeker ND', 'Gentry J', 'Neuberg D', 'Look AT', 'Ramaswamy S', 'Bernards A', 'Trede NS', 'Langenau DM']","['Department of Pathology, Molecular Pathology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120427,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Notch1/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thymocytes', 'Zebrafish/genetics/metabolism']",2012/04/28 06:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/04/28 06:00'],"['2012/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012116 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.116 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Sep;26(9):2069-78. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.116.

Expression of angiogenesis markers was assessed by RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence staining. Their angiogenesis potential was measured by differentiation into vascular endothelial cells and by supporting vascular tube network formed by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) on Matrigel. Their support of limbal epithelial progenitor cells (LEPC) was examined in sphere growth formed by reunion in 3D Matrigel. RESULTS: On plastic, limbal NC could be cultured only up to four passages before turning into myofibroblasts. In contrast, on coated Matrigel, they could be expanded for up to 12 passages with upregulation of markers suggestive of angiogenesis progenitors when reseeded in 3D Matrigel because they could differentiate into vascular endothelial cells and pericytes stabilizing the tube network formed by HUVEC. Although both expanded limbal NCs and HUVEC rejoined with LEPC to form spheres to upregulate expression of DeltaNp63alpha, CK15, and CEBPdelta, the former but not the latter abolished expression of CK12 keratin. CONCLUSIONS: Human limbal NCs continuously expanded on the basement membrane differentiate into angiogenesis progenitors that prevent differentiation of LEPC/SCs. They may partake in formation of the vascular niche and contribute to angiogenesis during wound healing.","['Li, Gui-Gang', 'Chen, Szu-Yu', 'Xie, Hua-Tao', 'Zhu, Ying-Ting', 'Tseng, Scheffer C G']","['Li GG', 'Chen SY', 'Xie HT', 'Zhu YT', 'Tseng SC']","[""Department of Ophthalmology, Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120605,United States,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (CEBPB protein, human)', '0 (Keratin-15)', '0 (TP63 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Blotting, Western', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Keratin-15/genetics', 'Limbus Corneae/*cytology/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/*physiology', 'RNA/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cell Niche/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2012/04/28 06:00,2012/08/17 06:00,['2012/04/28 06:00'],"['2012/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['iovs.11-9414 [pii]', '10.1167/iovs.11-9414 [doi]']",epublish,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2012 Jun 5;53(7):3357-67. doi: 10.1167/iovs.11-9414.,,"['R01 EY006819/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY06819/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3374622,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some patients suffer from hepatotoxicity, which occurs through an unknown mechanism. In the present study, we found that Dasatinib could induce hepatotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Dasatinib reduced the cell viability of rat primary hepatocytes, induced the release of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in vitro, and triggered the ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes in Sprague-Dawley rats in vivo. Apoptotic markers (chromatin condensation, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP) were detected to indicate that the injury induced by Dasatinib in hepatocytes in vitro was mediated by apoptosis. This result was further validated in vivo using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays. Here we found that Dasatinib dramatically increased the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in hepatocytes, reduced the intracellular glutathione (GSH) content, attenuated the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), generated malondialdehyde (MDA), a product of lipid peroxidation, decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential, and activated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) related to oxidative stress and survival. These results confirm that oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in Dasatinib-mediated hepatotoxicity. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a typical antioxidant, can scavenge free radicals, attenuate oxidative stress, and protect hepatocytes against Dasatinib-induced injury. Thus, relieving oxidative stress is a viable strategy for reducing Dasatinib-induced hepatotoxicity.","['Xue, Tao', 'Luo, Peihua', 'Zhu, Hong', 'Zhao, Yuqin', 'Wu, Honghai', 'Gai, Renhua', 'Wu, Youping', 'Yang, Bo', 'Yang, Xiaochun', 'He, Qiaojun']","['Xue T', 'Luo P', 'Zhu H', 'Zhao Y', 'Wu H', 'Gai R', 'Wu Y', 'Yang B', 'Yang X', 'He Q']","['Institute of Pharmacology & Toxicology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120417,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Separation', 'DNA/chemistry', 'Dasatinib', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Hepatocytes/*drug effects', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Indoles', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria, Liver/drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Swelling/drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Pyrimidines/*toxicity', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/*toxicity']",2012/04/28 06:00,2012/07/17 06:00,['2012/04/28 06:00'],"['2011/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0041-008X(12)00146-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2012.04.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2012 Jun 15;261(3):280-91. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2012.04.010.

METHODS: The case-control study involved 106 children with IM, 41 children with ALL and a control group of 100 children with non-hematologic and nontumorous diseases. The genetic polymorphisms of GSTT1 and GSTM1 were detected with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Distribution of the genotypes in the children was analyzed. RESULTS: The frequency of GSTT1 null genotype in children with IM was significantly higher than in the control group (P<0.05). The risk of IM in children carrying GSTT1 null genotype was 2.186 times higher than in those carrying GSTT1 non-null genotype. The children carrying both GSTT1 and GSTM1 null genotype had a higher risk of suffering from IM compared to those carrying only one of the null genotypes (OR=4.937). The frequency of GSTM1 null genotype in children with ALL was significantly higher than in the control group (P<0.05). The risk of ALL in children carrying GSTM1 null genotype was 2.242 times higher than in those in carrying GSTT1 non-null genotype.

This unfavorable environment results in gene expression modifications leading to loss of beta-cell functions. To study the contribution of microRNAs (miRNAs) in this process, we used microarray analysis to search for changes in miRNA expression in prediabetic NOD mice islets. We found that the levels of miR-29a/b/c increased in islets of NOD mice during the phases preceding diabetes manifestation and in isolated mouse and human islets exposed to proinflammatory cytokines. Overexpression of miR-29a/b/c in MIN6 and dissociated islet cells led to impairment in glucose-induced insulin secretion. Defective insulin release was associated with diminished expression of the transcription factor Onecut2, and a consequent rise of granuphilin, an inhibitor of beta-cell exocytosis. Overexpression of miR-29a/b/c also promoted apoptosis by decreasing the level of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl1. Indeed, a decoy molecule selectively masking the miR-29 binding site on Mcl1 mRNA protected insulin-secreting cells from apoptosis triggered by miR-29 or cytokines. Taken together, our findings suggest that changes in the level of miR-29 family members contribute to cytokine-mediated beta-cell dysfunction occurring during the initial phases of type 1 diabetes.","['Roggli, Elodie', 'Gattesco, Sonia', 'Caille, Dorothee', 'Briet, Claire', 'Boitard, Christian', 'Meda, Paolo', 'Regazzi, Romano']","['Roggli E', 'Gattesco S', 'Caille D', 'Briet C', 'Boitard C', 'Meda P', 'Regazzi R']","['Department of Cell Biology and Morphology, Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120426,United States,Diabetes,Diabetes,0372763,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (ONECUT2 protein, human)', '0 (ONECUT2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (SYTL4 protein, human)', '0 (Sytl4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/metabolism', 'Exocytosis/drug effects', 'Female', 'Glucose/administration & dosage', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Insulin/metabolism', 'Insulin Secretion', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Prediabetic State/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins/analysis']",2012/04/28 06:00,2012/09/11 06:00,['2012/04/28 06:00'],"['2012/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['db11-1086 [pii]', '10.2337/db11-1086 [doi]']",ppublish,Diabetes. 2012 Jul;61(7):1742-51. doi: 10.2337/db11-1086.

The past decade has seen an explosion of methodological advances in molecular cytogenetics technology. These cytogenetics techniques add color to the black and white world of conventional banding. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) study has emerged as an indispensable tool for both basic and clinical research, as well as diagnostics, in leukemia and cancers. FISH can be used to identify chromosomal abnormalities through fluorescent labeled DNA probes that target specific DNA sequences. Subsequently, FISH-based tests such as multicolor karyotyping, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and array CGH have been used in emerging clinical applications as they enable resolution of complex karyotypic aberrations and whole global scanning of genomic imbalances. More recently, crossspecies array CGH analysis has also been employed in cancer gene identification. The clinical impact of FISH is pivotal, especially in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment decisions for hematological diseases, all of which facilitate the practice of personalized medicine. This review summarizes the methodology and current utilization of these FISH techniques in unraveling chromosomal changes and highlights how the field is moving away from conventional methods towards molecular cytogenetics approaches.

IL-15 is postulated to play a role in the control of uterine natural killer (uNK) cell proliferation and function, and uNK cells are also known to play a role in implantation. The aims of this study was to (1) compare endometrial levels of IL-15 and the LIF in women with recurrent implantation failure (RIF) after IVF with those in fertile women (controls) and (2) examine the relation of IL-15 and LIF levels to the uNK cell number. METHODS: We investigated IL-15 and LIF in precisely timed endometrial biopsies (days LH + 7-LH + 9, where the day of the LH surge is LH + 0) obtained from control women (n = 15) and women with RIF (n = 45) by immunohistochemistry. A semi-quantitative analysis was performed by the H-score analysis of staining intensity in the stroma, glandular epithelium and luminal epithelium, separately. We also correlated expression of LIF and IL15 with uNK cell numbers (obtained in an earlier study of the same samples). RESULTS: The quantity of the LIF protein in endometrial glandular epithelium in women with RIF [median and range; 179 (70-365)] was lower (P = 0.01) than in control women [median and range; 247 (120-287)]. In contrast, the level of the IL-15 protein in the stroma in women with RIF [median and range; 90 (0-175)] was higher (P = 0.009) than in control women [median and range; 60 (15-150)]. There was a significant correlation between the uNK cell number and stromal expression of IL-15 (r = 0.427, P = 0.001). No correlation between the LIF expression in any compartment and the uNK cell number was seen. CONCLUSIONS: The results show an altered expression of LIF and IL-15 in the endometrium of women with RIF. Despite the limitation of not identifying uNK cells by phenotypic markers, the correlation between the uNK cell number and the stromal cell IL-15 suggests that IL-15 may play a role in the control of endometrial uNK cell function or proliferation.","['Mariee, N', 'Li, T C', 'Laird, S M']","['Mariee N', 'Li TC', 'Laird SM']","['Academic Unit of Reproductive and Developmental Medicine, University of Sheffield, Jessop Wing, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, Tree Root Walk, Sheffield S10 2SF, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120426,England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,"['0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Endometrium/*metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology', 'Female', 'Fertility', 'Fertilization in Vitro', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/pathology', 'Interleukin-15/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome']",2012/04/28 06:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/04/28 06:00'],"['2012/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['des134 [pii]', '10.1093/humrep/des134 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2012 Jul;27(7):1946-54. doi: 10.1093/humrep/des134.

METHODS: We examined the serum levels of sIL-2R in 57 adult patients with acute type leukemias: 32 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 14 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 11 chronic myelocytic leukemia in blast crisis (CMLBC), and in 29 adult patients with mature type LD, and assessed their cellular and clinical relevance in acute type leukemias. RESULTS: No significant differences were seen in the sIL-2R levels between acute type leukemias and mature type LD. In AML, serum sIL-2R levels were related to the cell surface CD4 expression on blast cells, and patients with higher levels >==2000U/ml had a poorer prognosis (lower response to chemotherapy and shorter overall survival). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that serum sIL-2R level elevates in acute type leukemias like mature type LD, and increased sIL-2R levels in adult AML are correlated with certain biological and clinical characteristics.","['Nakase, Kazunori', 'Kita, Kenkichi', 'Kyo, Taiichi', 'Tsuji, Kota', 'Katayama, Naoyuki']","['Nakase K', 'Kita K', 'Kyo T', 'Tsuji K', 'Katayama N']","['Cancer Center, Mie University Hospital, Tsu, Japan. k2nakase@clin.medic.mie-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120424,Netherlands,Cancer Epidemiol,Cancer epidemiology,101508793,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/blood', 'Blast Crisis/*immunology', 'CD4 Antigens/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/immunology/mortality', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/blood/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*blood/immunology', 'Serum/immunology', 'Survival Rate']",2012/04/28 06:00,2013/01/05 06:00,['2012/04/28 06:00'],"['2011/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/13 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1877-7821(12)00043-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canep.2012.03.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol. 2012 Oct;36(5):e306-9. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2012.03.011.

This deficit obstructs efforts to improve the care and survival rates of children in this part of the world. OBJECTIVE: Our study provides an overview of childhood cancer patients presenting for treatment in Western Kenya. DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of childhood cancer patients presenting for treatment in Western Kenya was carried out using information from three separate databases at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret. All patients aged 0-19 years first presenting between January 2006 and January 2010 with a newly diagnosed malignancy were included. RESULTS: A total of 436 children with cancer were registered during the period. There were 256 (59%) boys and 180 (41%) girls with a male/female ratio of 1.4:1. The group aged 6-10 years contained most children (29%). Median age at admission was 8 years. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was the most common type of cancer (34%), followed by acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (15%), Hodgkin's lymphoma (8%), nephroblastoma (8%), rhabdomyosarcoma (7%), retinoblastoma (5%) and Kaposi's sarcoma (5%). Only four (1%) children with brain tumours were documented. Ewing's sarcoma was not diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides an overview of childhood cancer patients presenting for treatment in Western Kenya. The distribution of malignancies is similar to findings from other equatorial African countries but differs markedly from studies in high-income countries. The new comprehensive cancer registration system will be continued and extended to serve as the basis for an evidence-based oncology program. Eventually this may lead to improved clinical outcomes.","['Mostert, Saskia', 'Njuguna, Festus', 'Kemps, Luc', 'Strother, Matthew', 'Aluoch, Louise', 'Buziba, Gyabi', 'Kaspers, Gertjan']","['Mostert S', 'Njuguna F', 'Kemps L', 'Strother M', 'Aluoch L', 'Buziba G', 'Kaspers G']","['Department of Paediatric Oncology-Haematology and Doctor 2 Doctor Program, VU University Medical Centre, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, 1081 HV, The Netherlands. s.mostert@vumc.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120425,England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kenya/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/classification/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",2012/04/27 06:00,2012/10/10 06:00,['2012/04/27 06:00'],"['2012/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/10 06:00 [medline]']","['archdischild-2011-300829 [pii]', '10.1136/archdischild-2011-300829 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 2012 Jun;97(6):508-12. doi: 10.1136/archdischild-2011-300829.

The identification and characterization of oncogenes and tumor suppressors has led to new treatment strategies that have significantly improved cancer outcome. The advent of next generation sequencing has allowed the elucidation of the fine structure of cancer genomes, however, the identification of pathogenic changes is complicated by the inherent genomic instability of cancer cells. Therefore, functional approaches for the identification of novel genes involved in the initiation and development of tumors are critical. Here we report the first whole human genome in vivo RNA interference screen to identify functionally important tumor suppressor genes. Using our novel approach, we identify previously validated tumor suppressor genes including TP53 and MNT, as well as several novel candidate tumor suppressor genes including leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). We show that LIFR is a key novel tumor suppressor, whose deregulation may drive the transformation of a significant proportion of human breast cancers. These results demonstrate the power of genome wide in vivo RNAi screens as a method for identifying novel genes regulating tumorigenesis.","['Iorns, Elizabeth', 'Ward, Toby M', 'Dean, Sonja', 'Jegg, Anna', 'Thomas, Dafydd', 'Murugaesu, Nirupa', 'Sims, David', 'Mitsopoulos, Costas', 'Fenwick, Kerry', 'Kozarewa, Iwanka', 'Naceur-Lombarelli, Cristina', 'Zvelebil, Marketa', 'Isacke, Clare M', 'Lord, Christopher J', 'Ashworth, Alan', 'Hnatyszyn, H James', 'Pegram, Mark', 'Lippman, Marc']","['Iorns E', 'Ward TM', 'Dean S', 'Jegg A', 'Thomas D', 'Murugaesu N', 'Sims D', 'Mitsopoulos C', 'Fenwick K', 'Kozarewa I', 'Naceur-Lombarelli C', 'Zvelebil M', 'Isacke CM', 'Lord CJ', 'Ashworth A', 'Hnatyszyn HJ', 'Pegram M', 'Lippman M']","['Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Miami, 1501 NW 10th Ave (BRB 701), Miami, FL 33136, USA. eiorns@med.miami.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120426,Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (MNT protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genes, p53', 'Genome, Human', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",2012/04/27 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/04/27 06:00'],"['2012/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10549-012-2068-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2012 Aug;135(1):79-91. doi: 10.1007/s10549-012-2068-7.

BPDCN is a very rare and aggressive disease clinically characterized by a skin revealing localization more or less rapidly disseminating to the bone marrow and other organs with or without and leukemia. The disease was initially phenotypically characterized by the expression of both CD4 and CD56 antigens, whereas lymphoid and myeloid lineage antigens were negative. A phenotypic link with alpha-interferon (IFN-I)-producing plasmacytoid dendritic cells was demonstrated. The data collected in this case report provide additional biological and genotypical data on tumor cells of BPDCN. This study confirms the capability of tumor cells to secrete IFN-I, demonstrated by biological IFN-I activity of cultured cells and immunohistochemical expression of Mx-1 protein. Although a common genetic profile involving chromosomes 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, and 15 has been identified, no specific genetic marker has been demonstrated that is specific to BPDCN. The demonstration of ETV6 gene deletion in this case deserves further investigations as a putative BPDCN marker.","['Petrella, Tony', 'Herve, Genevieve', 'Bonnotte, Bernard', 'Girodon, Francois', 'Carlson, John Andrew', 'Bour, Jean-Baptiste', 'Lebon, Pierre', 'Mugneret, Francine', 'Callier, Patrick']","['Petrella T', 'Herve G', 'Bonnotte B', 'Girodon F', 'Carlson JA', 'Bour JB', 'Lebon P', 'Mugneret F', 'Callier P']","['Department of Pathology, CHU, Dijon, France. tony.petrella@chu-dijon.fr']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Am J Dermatopathol,The American Journal of dermatopathology,7911005,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Dendritic Cells/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interferon-alpha/*metabolism', 'Karyotype', 'Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Skin Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/04/27 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/04/27 06:00'],"['2012/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/DAD.0b013e31824d689c [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Dermatopathol. 2012 Aug;34(6):626-31. doi: 10.1097/DAD.0b013e31824d689c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of twice-daily fludarabine and cytarabine (BIDFA) in patients with refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and chronic myeloid leukemia in myeloid blast phase (CML-BP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred seven patients with refractory/relapsed AML, intermediate and high-risk MDS, and CML-BP, with a performance status of 3 or less and normal organ function were treated. Patients received fludarabine 15 mg/m(2) intravenously (IV) every 12 hours on days 1 to 5 and cytarabine 0.5 g/m(2) IV over 2 hours every 12 hours on days 1 to 5. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) was administered at 3 mg/m(2) IV on day 1 in the first 59 patients. Patients with CML-BP were allowed to receive concomitant tyrosine kinase inhibitors. RESULTS: Overall, 27 (26%) patients responded with a complete remission (CR) rate of 21% and CR without platelet recovery of 5%. The overall 4-week mortality rate was 9%. The CR rates for patients with relapsed AML with first CR duration greater than or equal to 12 months, relapsed AML with first CR duration less than 12 months, and refractory/relapsed AML beyond first salvage were 56%, 26%, and 11%, respectively. With a median follow-up of 7 months, the 6-month event-free survival, overall survival, and complete remission CR duration rates were 18%, 35%, and 70%, respectively.

The methylation status of 1.8-2.3 million CpGs in the CLL genome was determined; about 45% of these CpGs were located in more than 23,000 CpG islands (CGIs). While global CpG methylation was similar between CLL and normal B-cells, 1764 gene promoters were identified as being differentially methylated in at least one CLL sample when compared with normal B-cell samples. Nineteen percent of the differentially methylated genes were involved in transcriptional regulation. Aberrant hypermethylation was found in all HOX gene clusters and a significant number of WNT signaling pathway genes. Hypomethylation occurred more frequently in the gene body including introns, exons, and 3'-UTRs in CLL. The NFATc1 P2 promoter and first intron was found to be hypomethylated and correlated with upregulation of both NFATc1 RNA and protein expression levels in CLL suggesting that an epigenetic mechanism is involved in the constitutive activation of NFAT activity in CLL cells.

We investigated the effects of certolizumab pegol, a TNFalpha blocker, on endothelial cell function and angiogenesis. METHODS: Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) were stimulated with TNFalpha with or without certolizumab pegol. TNFalpha-induced adhesion molecule expression and angiogenic chemokine secretion were measured by cell surface ELISA and angiogenic chemokine ELISA, respectively. We also examined the effect of certolizumab pegol on TNFalpha-induced myeloid human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cell adhesion to HMVECs, as well as blood vessels in RA synovial tissue using the Stamper-Woodruff assay. Lastly, we performed HMVEC chemotaxis, and tube formation. RESULTS: Certolizumab pegol significantly blocked TNFalpha-induced HMVEC cell surface angiogenic E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression and angiogenic chemokine secretion (P < 0.05). We found that certolizumab pegol significantly inhibited TNFalpha-induced HL-60 cell adhesion to HMVECs (P < 0.05), and blocked HL-60 cell adhesion to RA synovial tissue vasculature (P < 0.05). TNFalpha also enhanced HMVEC chemotaxis compared with the negative control group (P < 0.05) and this chemotactic response was significantly reduced by certolizumab pegol (P < 0.05). Certolizumab pegol inhibited TNFalpha-induced HMVEC tube formation on Matrigel (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our data support the hypothesis that certolizumab pegol inhibits TNFalpha-dependent leukocyte adhesion and angiogenesis, probably via inhibition of angiogenic adhesion molecule expression and angiogenic chemokine secretion.","['Shu, Qiang', 'Amin, Mohammad A', 'Ruth, Jeffrey H', 'Campbell, Phillip L', 'Koch, Alisa E']","['Shu Q', 'Amin MA', 'Ruth JH', 'Campbell PL', 'Koch AE']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, 1107 Jinan Culture Road, Jinan City, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120425,England,Arthritis Res Ther,Arthritis research & therapy,101154438,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'UMD07X179E (Certolizumab Pegol)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*physiology', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Certolizumab Pegol', 'Chemokines/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/*physiology', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/immunology', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology']",2012/04/27 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,['2012/04/27 06:00'],"['2011/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/20 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['ar3812 [pii]', '10.1186/ar3812 [doi]']",epublish,Arthritis Res Ther. 2012 Apr 25;14(2):R88. doi: 10.1186/ar3812.,,,PMC3446462,,,,,,['Nat Rev Rheumatol. 2012 Jun;8(6):307.

That was based on pooled analyses of epidemiological research that reported an association between exposure to low-level magnetic fields and childhood leukemia. In 2007 a task group of scientific experts convened by the World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledged the IARC categorization but found that the laboratory studies and other research results did not support the association. Taking all evidence into account WHO reported that it could not confirm the existence of any health consequences from exposure to low-level magnetic fields. There remains continuing concern by some people that exposure to power frequency magnetic fields may cause adverse health effects, particularly childhood leukemia. Public health authorities need to fully understand the reasons for that ongoing concern and effective ways to address it. This paper describes what drives the concern, including how people perceive risks, how WHO and other public health authorities assess scientific research to determine whether health risks exist and the conclusions they have reached about power frequency magnetic fields. This paper also addresses the scientific basis of international exposure guidelines for power frequency magnetic fields and what precautionary measures are warranted to address the concern.","['Repacholi, Michael']",['Repacholi M'],"['Department of Information Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications (DIET), University of Rome La Sapienza, Via Eudossiana 18, Rome, 00184 Italy. mrepacholi@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120424,Netherlands,Sci Total Environ,The Science of the total environment,0330500,,IM,"['Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/prevention & control/*statistics & numerical data', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Risk Assessment', 'World Health Organization']",2012/04/27 06:00,2012/08/16 06:00,['2012/04/27 06:00'],"['2012/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0048-9697(12)00391-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.03.030 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Total Environ. 2012 Jun 1;426:454-8. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.03.030.

The rarity of both birth defects and childhood cancers makes it challenging to study these associations, particularly for the very rare instances of each. To address this limitation, the authors conducted a record linkage-based cohort study among Texas children born between 1996 and 2005. Birth defects in the cohort were identified through the Texas Birth Defects Registry, and children who developed cancer were identified by using record linkage with Texas Cancer Registry data. Over 3 million birth records were included; 115,686 subjects had birth defects, and there were 2,351 cancer cases. Overall, children with a birth defect had a 3-fold increased risk of developing cancer (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 3.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.65, 3.50), with germ cell tumors (IRR = 5.19, 95% CI: 2.67, 9.41), retinoblastomas (IRR = 2.34, 95% CI: 1.21, 4.16), soft-tissue sarcomas (IRR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.09, 3.79), and leukemias (IRR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.75) having statistically significant elevated point estimates. All birth defect groups except for musculoskeletal had increased cancer incidence. Untangling the strong relation between birth defects and childhood cancers could lead to a better understanding of the genetic and environmental factors that affect both conditions.","['Carozza, Susan E', 'Langlois, Peter H', 'Miller, Eric A', 'Canfield, Mark']","['Carozza SE', 'Langlois PH', 'Miller EA', 'Canfield M']","['School of Biological and Population Health Sciences, College of Public Health and Human Sciences, Oregon State University, Corvallis, 97331, USA. susan.carozza@oregonstate.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120424,United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', '*Congenital Abnormalities', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Maternal Age', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/epidemiology/etiology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries', 'Retinoblastoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Risk', 'Sarcoma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Texas']",2012/04/27 06:00,2012/08/17 06:00,['2012/04/27 06:00'],"['2012/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['kwr470 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwr470 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2012 Jun 15;175(12):1217-24. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwr470.

Halofuginone (HF), a synthetic derivative of quinazolinone alkaloid, has recently been shown to have anti-cancer activity in various preclinical settings. This study demonstrated the anti-tumour activity of HF against a panel of human MM cell lines and primary patient-derived MM cells, regardless of their sensitivity to conventional therapy or novel agents. HF showed anti-MM activity in vivo using a myeloma xenograft mouse model. HF suppressed proliferation of myeloma cells alone and when co-cultured with bone marrow stromal cells. Similarly, HF induced apoptosis in MM cells even in the presence of insulin-like growth factor 1 or interleukin 6. Importantly, HF, even at high doses, did not induce cytotoxicity against CD40 activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal donors. HF treatment induced accumulation of cells in the G(0) /G(1) cell cycle and induction of apoptotic cell death associated with depletion of mitochondrial membrane potential; cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspases-3, 8 and 9 as well as down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins including Mcl-1 and X-IAP. Multiplex analysis of phosphorylation of diverse components of signalling cascades revealed that HF induced changes in P38MAPK activation; increased phosphorylation of c-jun, c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK), p53 and Hsp-27. Importantly, HF triggered synergistic cytotoxicity in combination with lenalidomide, melphalan, dexamethasone, and doxorubicin.

ANIMALS: 11 dogs with B-cell lymphoma and 1 clinically normal dog. PROCEDURES: Scintigraphic images were acquired 1 hour after IV injection of the RaPP. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around lymph nodes, liver, and spleen; ROI intensity (relative to that of an equally sized region of muscle in the same image) was measured. Each ROI was also subjectively categorized as positive or negative for increased RaPP uptake. Expression of BCL2 mRNA was determined via quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR assay of a lymph node sample from dogs with lymphoma. Associations among imaging results, TTP, and BCL2 mRNA expression were evaluated. RESULTS: Increased RaPP uptake was detected in affected tissues of dogs with lymphoma. Dogs with superficial cervical lymph node ROIs categorized as negative (n = 8) for increased RaPP uptake had a significantly longer TTP than did dogs for which this ROI was considered positive (2). Measured intensity of mandibular and superficial cervical lymph node ROIs was negatively associated with TTP. Associations among BCL2 mRNA and ROI intensity or TTP were not significant. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Increased RaPP uptake at mandibular or superficial cervical lymph node ROIs may be a negative prognostic indicator in dogs with lymphoma. A larger investigation is needed to determine clinical value of the RaPP for disease detection and prognostication.","['Statham-Ringen, Kimberly A', 'Selting, Kimberly A', 'Lattimer, Jimmy C', 'Henry, Carolyn J', 'Green, Jonathan A', 'Bryan, Jeffrey N', 'Jia, Fang', 'Lewis, Michael R']","['Statham-Ringen KA', 'Selting KA', 'Lattimer JC', 'Henry CJ', 'Green JA', 'Bryan JN', 'Jia F', 'Lewis MR']","['Department of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,"['0 (Indium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Peptide Nucleic Acids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Dog Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Dogs', 'Female', '*Indium Radioisotopes/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Injections, Intravenous/veterinary', 'Lymph Nodes/diagnostic imaging/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/metabolism/*veterinary', 'Male', '*Peptide Nucleic Acids/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Radionuclide Imaging/*methods/veterinary', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Tissue Distribution']",2012/04/27 06:00,2012/08/24 06:00,['2012/04/27 06:00'],"['2012/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2460/ajvr.73.5.681 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 2012 May;73(5):681-8. doi: 10.2460/ajvr.73.5.681.,,['CA103130/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rare familial cases are reported in which five disease genes have been identified to date (RUNX1, CEBPA, TERC, TERT and GATA2). Here we report the genetic categorization of 27 families with familial MDS/AML. All of these families were screened for RUNX1, CEBPA, TERC, TERT and GATA2 as well as TET2 and NPM1. Five of the 27 families had telomerase mutations; one had a RUNX1 mutation, while none were found to have TET2, CEBPA or NPM1 mutations. We identified four families with heterozygous GATA2 mutations, each associated with a different phenotype. While one of these mutations is novel, three have been previously reported: one has been described in dendritic cell, monocyte, B and NK lymphoid (DCML) deficiency and one is in a family that has been reported in a series with primary lymphoedema with a predisposition to AML (Emberger syndrome). In summary, genetic characterization was shown in 10 (four GATA2, three TERT, two TERC, one RUNX1) of these families; however 17 remain uncharacterized, highlighting marked genetic heterogeneity in familial MDS/AML and the scope for further functional pathways that could give rise to this group of disorders.","['Holme, Harriet', 'Hossain, Upal', 'Kirwan, Michael', 'Walne, Amanda', 'Vulliamy, Tom', 'Dokal, Inderjeet']","['Holme H', 'Hossain U', 'Kirwan M', 'Walne A', 'Vulliamy T', 'Dokal I']","[""Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, Barts and The London Children's Hospital, London, UK."", ""Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, Barts and The London Children's Hospital, London, UK."", ""Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, Barts and The London Children's Hospital, London, UK."", ""Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, Barts and The London Children's Hospital, London, UK."", ""Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, Barts and The London Children's Hospital, London, UK."", ""Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, Barts and The London Children's Hospital, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120426,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Pedigree', 'Phenotype', 'Young Adult']",2012/04/27 06:00,2012/09/22 06:00,['2012/04/27 06:00'],"['2012/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2012.09136.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2012 Jul;158(2):242-248. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2012.09136.x.

In functional studies, we assessed the influence of the proliferative response of leukemic B-cells induced by IL-4 and CD40L on PD-1 transcripts and expression on the protein level. The median level of PD-1, but not PD-L1, transcripts in CLL patients was higher in comparison to healthy volunteers (HVs, n = 43, p = 0.0057). We confirmed the presence of PD-1 and PD-L1 on the CLL cell surface, and found the expression of PD-1, but not PD-L1, to be higher among CLL patients in comparison to HVs (47.2% vs. 14.8%, p<0.0001). The Kaplan-Meier curves for the time to progression and overall survival in groups with high and low surface expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 revealed no prognostic value in CLL patients. After stimulation with IL-4 and CD40L, protein expression of PD-1 was significantly increased in samples that responded and up-regulated CD38. PD-1, which is aberrantly expressed both at mRNA and cell surface levels in CLL cells might represent a novel immunotolerant molecule involved in the pathomechanism of the disease, and could provide a novel target for future therapies.","['Grzywnowicz, Maciej', 'Zaleska, Joanna', 'Mertens, Daniel', 'Tomczak, Waldemar', 'Wlasiuk, Paulina', 'Kosior, Kamila', 'Piechnik, Agnieszka', 'Bojarska-Junak, Agnieszka', 'Dmoszynska, Anna', 'Giannopoulos, Krzysztof']","['Grzywnowicz M', 'Zaleska J', 'Mertens D', 'Tomczak W', 'Wlasiuk P', 'Kosior K', 'Piechnik A', 'Bojarska-Junak A', 'Dmoszynska A', 'Giannopoulos K']","['Department of Experimental Hematooncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120419,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'B7-H1 Antigen/genetics/*metabolism', 'CD40 Antigens/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/04/26 06:00,2012/08/04 06:00,['2012/04/26 06:00'],"['2011/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0035178 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-21931 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e35178. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0035178.

We wish to define the clinical features of this rare myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm and to compare its clinical outcome with that of refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts and essential thrombocythemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a collaborative retrospective study across Europe. Our database included 200 patients diagnosed with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts and marked thrombocytosis. For each of these patients, each patient diagnosed with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts was matched for age and sex. At the same time, a cohort of 454 patients with essential thrombocythemia was used to compare outcomes of the two diseases. RESULTS: In patients with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts and marked thrombocytosis, depending on the Janus Kinase 2 V617F mutational status (positive or negative) or platelet threshold (over or below 600 x 10(9)/L), no difference in survival was noted. However, these patients had shorter overall survival and leukemia-free survival with a lower risk of thrombotic complications than did patients with essential thrombocythemia (P<0.001) but better survival (P<0.001) and a higher risk of thrombosis (P=0.039) than patients with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical course of refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts and marked thrombocytosis is better than that of refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts and worse than that of essential thrombocythemia. The higher risk of thrombotic events in this disorder suggests that anti-platelet therapy might be considered in this subset of patients. From a clinical point of view, it appears to be important to consider refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts and marked thrombocytosis as a distinct entity.","['Broseus, Julien', 'Florensa, Lourdes', 'Zipperer, Esther', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Malcovati, Luca', 'Richebourg, Steven', 'Lippert, Eric', 'Cermak, Jaroslav', 'Evans, Jyoti', 'Mounier, Morgane', 'Raya, Jose Maria', 'Bailly, Francois', 'Gattermann, Norbert', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Garand, Richard', 'Allou, Kaoutar', 'Besses, Carlos', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Travaglino, Erica', 'Luno, Elisa', 'Pinan, Maria Angeles', 'Arenillas, Leonor', 'Rozman, Maria', 'Perez Sirvent, Maria Luz', 'Favre, Bernardine', 'Guy, Julien', 'Alonso, Esther', 'Ahwij, Nuhri', 'Jerez, Andres', 'Hermouet, Sylvie', 'Maynadie, Marc', 'Cazzola, Mario', 'Girodon, Francois']","['Broseus J', 'Florensa L', 'Zipperer E', 'Schnittger S', 'Malcovati L', 'Richebourg S', 'Lippert E', 'Cermak J', 'Evans J', 'Mounier M', 'Raya JM', 'Bailly F', 'Gattermann N', 'Haferlach T', 'Garand R', 'Allou K', 'Besses C', 'Germing U', 'Haferlach C', 'Travaglino E', 'Luno E', 'Pinan MA', 'Arenillas L', 'Rozman M', 'Perez Sirvent ML', 'Favre B', 'Guy J', 'Alonso E', 'Ahwij N', 'Jerez A', 'Hermouet S', 'Maynadie M', 'Cazzola M', 'Girodon F']","[""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Hopital du Bocage, CHU de Dijon, Dijon, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120424,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory/complications/mortality/*pathology', 'Anemia, Sideroblastic/complications/mortality/*pathology', 'Blood Platelets/pathology', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Platelet Count', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/complications/mortality/*pathology', 'Thrombocytosis/complications/mortality/*pathology']",2012/04/26 06:00,2013/01/01 06:00,['2012/04/26 06:00'],"['2012/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.053918 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.053918 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Jul;97(7):1036-41. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.053918.

In the current study, we analyzed the potential synergistic effect of bortezomib in conjunction with sirolimus in order to reduce-graft-versus-host disease without hampering graft-versus-leukemia effect in the allogeneic transplant setting. DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated the effect of sirolimus, bortezomib or the combination of both in the proliferation and activation of in vitro stimulated T lymphocytes. Pathways involved in this synergy were also analyzed using Western blot assays. Finally, BALB/c mice receiving C57BL/6 allogeneic donor bone marrow with splenocytes were used to measure in vivo the effect of this novel combination on the risk of graft-versus-host disease. RESULTS: The combination of both drugs synergistically inhibited both activation and proliferation of stimulated T cells. Also, the production of Th1 cytokines (IFN gamma, IL-2 and TNF) was significantly inhibited. This effect was due, at least in part, to the inhibition of Erk and Akt phosphorylation. In vivo, the combination reduced the risk of graft-versus-host disease without hampering graft-versus-leukemia effect, as shown in mice receiving graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis with sirolimus plus bortezomib being infused with tumor WEHI cells plus C57BL/6 donor BM and splenocytes.

We retrospectively analyzed 324 patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated with front-line induction chemotherapy between October 2004 and March 2010. Fifty-six patients had FLT3-ITD mutation at diagnosis. Fifty-one (91%) patients with FLT3-ITD achieved complete remission. Thirteen patients had FLT3 analysis at complete remission. None had FLT3-ITD. Twenty-five (49%) patients with FLT3-ITD relapsed. Of these, 13 (52%) had FLT3-ITD at relapse (3 negative and 9 not done). Among the 201 patients without FLT3-ITD at diagnosis who achieved complete remission, 77 (38%) relapsed among whom 8 (10%) patients acquired FLT3-ITD clone.

It was shown in vaccination trials that Receptor for Hyaluronic Acid Mediated Motility (RHAMM/HMMR) generates cellular immune responses in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and that these responses correlate with clinical benefit. It is not clear however whether this response actually targets the leukemic stem cell, especially since it was reported that RHAMM is expressed maximally during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. In addition, tumor specificity of RHAMM expression remains relatively unexplored. DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood, leukapheresis and bone marrow samples were collected from both acute myeloid leukemia patients and healthy controls. RHAMM expression was assessed at protein and mRNA levels on various sorted populations, either fresh or after manipulation. RESULTS: High levels of RHAMM were expressed by CD34(+)CD38(+) and CD34(-) acute myeloid leukemia blasts. However, only baseline expression of RHAMM was measured in CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemic stem cells, and was not different from that in CD34(+)CD38(-) hematopoietic stem cells from healthy controls. RHAMM was significantly up-regulated in CD34(+) cells from healthy donors during in vitro expansion and during in vivo engraftment. Finally, we demonstrated an explicit increase in the expression level of RHAMM after in vitro activation of T cells. CONCLUSIONS: RHAMM does not fulfill the criteria of an ideal target antigen for immunotherapy of acute myeloid leukemia. RHAMM expression in leukemic stem cells does not differ significantly from the expression in hematopoietic stem cells from healthy controls. RHAMM expression in proliferating CD34+ cells of healthy donors and activated T cells further compromises RHAMM-specific T-cell-mediated immunotherapy.","['Snauwaert, Sylvia', 'Vanhee, Stijn', 'Goetgeluk, Glenn', 'Verstichel, Greet', 'Van Caeneghem, Yasmine', 'Velghe, Imke', 'Philippe, Jan', 'Berneman, Zwi N', 'Plum, Jean', 'Taghon, Tom', 'Leclercq, Georges', 'Thielemans, Kris', 'Kerre, Tessa', 'Vandekerckhove, Bart']","['Snauwaert S', 'Vanhee S', 'Goetgeluk G', 'Verstichel G', 'Van Caeneghem Y', 'Velghe I', 'Philippe J', 'Berneman ZN', 'Plum J', 'Taghon T', 'Leclercq G', 'Thielemans K', 'Kerre T', 'Vandekerckhove B']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120424,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2012/04/26 06:00,2013/07/09 06:00,['2012/04/26 06:00'],"['2012/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.065581 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.065581 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Oct;97(10):1539-47. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.065581.

All patients underwent chemotherapy and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor combined mobilization protocols. PBSC collection began when white blood cell (WBC) count rebounded to >1.0 x 10(9)/L. Poor mobilization (PM) was defined as <2.0 x 10(6)/kg of ideal body weight CD34+ cells were collected from at least three leukapheresis procedures. PM incidence was 15% (9/60). On the first apheresis day, CD34+ cell yield was closely associated with the final yield. Failure to reach the first-day target of 0.7 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg was perfectly matched with PM. Circulating WBC and monocyte (MO) counts preleukapheresis had a positive correlation with final CD34+ cell yield. For the first-day apheresis target, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that MO count had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.806 (P = 0.004). An optimal predictive cutoff value for MO count was 1.455 x 10(9)/L with both high sensitivity and specificity of 0.739 and 0.899, respectively.

The aim of this study was to examine the mechanism of silymarin-induced apoptosis in K562 cells, with particular emphasis on its effect on telomerase activity. The antiproliferation effect of silymarin on K562 cells was evaluated by the MTT assay. To measure apoptosis, Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry were used. The telomerase activity was determined using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP)-ELISA assay. The treatment of the K562 cells with silymarin resulted in a significant inhibition of cell growth and telomerase activity. Also, a positive correlation was found between telomerase inhibition and induction of apoptosis in silymarin-treated K562 cells.

Co-incubation with imatinib and diclofenac resulted in a significantly lower viable cell number compared with imatinib alone. In contrast, ibuprofen led to a significant decrease in OA, an increase in IC50(imatinib) and thus reduced the cytotoxicity of imatinib. In primary CML samples, diclofenac significantly increased OA, particularly in patients with low OA (<4 ng per 200 000 cells), and significantly decreased IC50(imatinib). Ibuprofen induced significant decreases in OA in CML samples and healthy donors. CONCLUSION: On the basis of the expected impact of these two drugs on OA, ibuprofen should be avoided in combination with imatinib. Further studies are warranted regarding the potential benefit of diclofenac to improve OA in a clinical setting.","['Wang, J', 'Hughes, T P', 'Kok, C H', 'Saunders, V A', 'Frede, A', 'Groot-Obbink, K', 'Osborn, M', 'Somogyi, A A', ""D'Andrea, R J"", 'White, D L']","['Wang J', 'Hughes TP', 'Kok CH', 'Saunders VA', 'Frede A', 'Groot-Obbink K', 'Osborn M', 'Somogyi AA', ""D'Andrea RJ"", 'White DL']","['Department of Hematology, Centre for Cancer Biology/SA Pathology (RAH site), Adelaide, SA, Austarlia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120424,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Organic Cation Transporter 1)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '144O8QL0L1 (Diclofenac)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'WK2XYI10QM (Ibuprofen)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diclofenac/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions/physiology', 'Humans', 'Ibuprofen/*pharmacology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Organic Cation Transporter 1/*drug effects', 'Piperazines/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*metabolism']",2012/04/26 06:00,2012/07/24 06:00,['2012/04/26 06:00'],"['2012/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2012173 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2012.173 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2012 May 22;106(11):1772-8. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2012.173.

Flow cytometric CSF analysis on repeated lumber puncture detected lymphoblasts, while microscopic CSF examination did not definitively show relapse disease. The diagnosis of CNSL was thus made and confirmed by the response to leukemia treatment. Obesity can be the first manifestation of CNSL and the diagnosis can be challenging. A combination of CSF cytomorphology, CSF flow cytometry, and cranial MRI can be useful in the diagnosis of the disease. Two mechanisms of CNSL-related obesity are discussed based on the literature review.","['Zhang, Li-Dan', 'Li, Yan-Hong', 'Ke, Zhi-Yong', 'Huang, Li-Bin', 'Luo, Xue-Qun']","['Zhang LD', 'Li YH', 'Ke ZY', 'Huang LB', 'Luo XQ']","['Department of Paediatric, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhongshan Er Lu, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,India,J Cancer Res Ther,Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,101249598,,IM,"['Brain/pathology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Obesity/*complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/04/26 06:00,2012/08/23 06:00,['2012/04/26 06:00'],"['2012/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/23 06:00 [medline]']","['JCanResTher_2012_8_1_151_95200 [pii]', '10.4103/0973-1482.95200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Ther. 2012 Jan-Mar;8(1):151-3. doi: 10.4103/0973-1482.95200.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four mouse mAbs generated by hybridoma technology exhibited specific binding to human ROR1. Epitope mapping studies showed that two mAbs (2A2 and 2D11) recognized N-terminal epitopes in the extracellular region of ROR1 and the other two (1A1 and 1A7) recognized C-terminal epitopes. A ROR1- immunotoxin (BT-1) consisting of truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE38) and the VH and VL fragments of 2A2-IgG was made recombinantly. Both 2A2-IgG and BT-1 showed dose-dependent and selective binding to primary CLL and MCL cells and MCL cell lines. Kinetic analyses revealed 0.12-nM (2A2-IgG) to 65-nM (BT-1) avidity/affinity to hROR1, depicting bivalent and monovalent interactions, respectively. After binding to cell surface ROR1, 2A2-IgG and BT-1 were partially internalized by primary CLL cells and MCL cell lines, and BT-1 induced profound apoptosis of ROR1-expressing MCL cell lines in vitro (EC 50 = 16 pM-16 nM), but did not affect ROR1-negative cell lines. Our data suggest that ROR1-immunotoxins such as BT-1 could serve as targeted therapeutic agents for ROR1-expressing B cell malignancies and other cancers.","['Baskar, Sivasubramanian', 'Wiestner, Adrian', 'Wilson, Wyndham H', 'Pastan, Ira', 'Rader, Christoph']","['Baskar S', 'Wiestner A', 'Wilson WH', 'Pastan I', 'Rader C']","['Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA. baskars@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20120426,United States,MAbs,mAbs,101479829,"['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (toxA protein, Pseudomonas aeruginosa)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ROR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors)']",IM,"['ADP Ribose Transferases/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Bacterial Toxins/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Exotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/immunology', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Virulence Factors/*therapeutic use']",2012/04/26 06:00,2013/02/07 06:00,['2012/04/26 06:00'],"['2012/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['19870 [pii]', '10.4161/mabs.19870 [doi]']",ppublish,MAbs. 2012 May-Jun;4(3):349-61. doi: 10.4161/mabs.19870.

The debate began with the failure to detect XMRV in clinical PCa samples. Concerns about the potential health risk of XMRV exposure were reinforced by a study demonstrating the presence of XMRV in patients with CFS. However, serious concerns on whether XMRV plays a role in the development of PCa and/or CFS have been raised. However, inconsistent reports linking XMRV with PCa and/or CFS have led to conflicting views about the potential of XMRV as a human pathogen. Several recent studies suggest that contamination could account for the positive correlations between XMRV and PCa and/or CFS to date. At present, evidence does not indicate that XMRV plays any role in the pathogenesis of PCa or CFS.","['Hong, Ping', 'Li, Jinming']","['Hong P', 'Li J']","[""National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Beijing Hospital of the Ministry of Health, Beijing, People's Republic of China.

Archival bone marrow smears from 19 children collected at diagnosis and remission were used to derive a disease specific DNA methylation profile. The gene signature was confirmed in an independent cohort of 86 patients. A further 163 patients were analyzed for DNA methylation of a three gene signature. We found that the DNA methylation signature at diagnosis was unique from remission. Fifteen loci were sufficient to discriminate leukemia from disease-free samples and purified CD34+ cells. DNA methylation of these loci was recurrent irrespective of cytogenetic subtype of pre-B cell ALL.

In this study we investigated the application of a BRAF V600E mutation-specific antibody (clone VE1) to differentiate HCL from HCL mimics, such as HCL variant and splenic marginal zone lymphoma. A total of 52 routinely processed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens were investigated (bone marrow, n=46; spleen, n=6) for expression of V600E-mutated BRAF protein. All 32 cases of HCL were scored positive, and all non-HCL cases were scored negative. In 28 of 30 HCL cases the presence of a BRAF V600E mutation could be confirmed by direct sequencing, whereas no BRAF mutations were detected among 20 HCL mimics. We further screened 228 mature B-cell neoplasms with VE1 and detected 1 positive case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Sequencing confirmed the presence of a BRAF V600E mutation. In conclusion, we demonstrate that VE1 immunohistochemistry can be used to reliably differentiate HCL from HCL-mimicking entities.

This unfortunate outcome has led to the rapid initiation of studies examining various biological and pathological aspects of retroviral integration. This review summarizes recent findings from these studies, including the global integration patterns of various types of retroviruses, viral and cellular determinants of integration, implications of integration for gene therapy and retrovirus-mediated infectious diseases, and strategies to shift integration to safe host genomic loci. A more comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of retroviral integration processes will eventually make it possible to generate safer retroviral vector platforms in the near future.","['Lim, Kwang-il']",['Lim KI'],"[""Department of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Science, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul, Korea. klim@sm.ac.kr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Korea (South),BMB Rep,BMB reports,101465334,,IM,"['*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Retroviridae/*physiology', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",2012/04/26 06:00,2012/08/29 06:00,['2012/04/26 06:00'],"['2012/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5483/bmbrep.2012.45.4.207 [doi]'],ppublish,BMB Rep. 2012 Apr;45(4):207-12. doi: 10.5483/bmbrep.2012.45.4.207.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the relationship between household income and financial burden among patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) who have been treated with imatinib. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to 1200 patients between May and August 2009. We retrospectively surveyed their household incomes, out-of-pocket medical expenses, final co-payments after refunds, and the perceived financial burden of their medical expenses in 2000, 2005 and 2008. RESULTS: A total of 577 patients completed the questionnaire. Their median age was 61 years (range, 15-94). A financial burden was felt by 41.2 % (28 of 68) of the patients treated with imatinib in 2000, 70.8 % (201 of 284) in 2005, and 75.8 % (400 of 528) in 2008. Overall, 182 patients (31.7 %) considered its discontinuation because of the financial burden and 15 (2.6 %) temporarily stopped their imatinib prescription. In 2000, 2005 and 2008, the patients' median annual household incomes were 49,615 US Dollars (USD), 38,510 USD and 36,731 USD, respectively, with an average currency exchange rate of 104 Yen/USD in 2008. Their median annual out-of-pocket expenses were 11,548, 12,067 and 11,538 USD and their median final annual co-payments were 4,375, 4,327 and 3,558 USD, respectively. Older patients (OR = 0.96, 95 % CI: 0.95-0.98, p << 0.0001 for 1-year increments), and patients with higher household incomes (OR = 0.92, 95 % CI: 0.85-0.99, p = 0.03 for 10,000 USD-increments) were less likely to have considered discontinuing their imatinib treatment. Conversely, patients with higher annual final co-payments (OR = 2.21, 95 % CI: 1.28-4.28, p = 0.004 for 10,000 USD-increments) were more likely to have considered discontinuing their imatinib treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of CML patients who sensed a financial burden increased between 2000 and 2008. During this period, their annual incomes fell by 13,000 USD, although their medical expenses did not change. Financial support for patients being treated with expensive drugs remains a major problem in Japan.","['Kodama, Yuko', 'Morozumi, Ryoko', 'Matsumura, Tomoko', 'Kishi, Yukiko', 'Murashige, Naoko', 'Tanaka, Yuji', 'Takita, Morihito', 'Hatanaka, Nobuyo', 'Kusumi, Eiji', 'Kami, Masahiro', 'Matsui, Akihiko']","['Kodama Y', 'Morozumi R', 'Matsumura T', 'Kishi Y', 'Murashige N', 'Tanaka Y', 'Takita M', 'Hatanaka N', 'Kusumi E', 'Kami M', 'Matsui A']","['Division of Social Communication System for Advanced Clinical Research, the Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, 4-6-1, Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan. alice-smn@umin.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120424,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Health Care Costs/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*economics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",2012/04/26 06:00,2013/07/16 06:00,['2012/04/26 06:00'],"['2011/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-12-152 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-12-152 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2012 Apr 24;12:152. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-12-152.,,,PMC3502305,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vanadocene dichloride (VDC) belongs to the group of the most promising metallocene antitumor agents; however, its mechanism of action and cytotoxicity profile are not fully understood. In this paper we assess cytotoxic effects of VDC in comparison to cisplatin using opposite prototype of cells; human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMCs) cells and human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (MOLT-4). Our findings showed cytotoxic effect of VDC on leukemia cells, but unfortunately on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well. VDC induces apoptosis in leukemia cells; the induction is, however, lower than that of cisplatin, and in contrary to cisplatin, VDC does not induce p53 up-regulation. Cytotoxic effect of VDC on leukemia cells is less pronounced than that of cisplatin and more pronounced in PBMCs than in MOLT-4 cells.","['Havelek, Radim', 'Siman, Pavel', 'Cmielova, Jana', 'Stoklasova, Alena', 'Vavrova, Jirina', 'Vinklarek, Jaromir', 'Knizek, Jiri', 'Rezacova, Martina']","['Havelek R', 'Siman P', 'Cmielova J', 'Stoklasova A', 'Vavrova J', 'Vinklarek J', 'Knizek J', 'Rezacova M']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Med Chem,Medicinal chemistry (Shariqah (United Arab Emirates)),101240303,"['0 (Vanadium Compounds)', '4W2E0IDO21 (vanadocene dichloride)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects', 'Vanadium Compounds/*pharmacology']",2012/04/26 06:00,2012/12/19 06:00,['2012/04/26 06:00'],"['2011/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/18 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['MC-EPUB-20120424-009 [pii]', '10.2174/157340612801216364 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Chem. 2012 Jul;8(4):615-21. doi: 10.2174/157340612801216364.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the structural homology between Src and Abl, several compounds originally synthesized as Src inhibitors have also been shown to be Abl inhibitors, useful in overcoming the onset of some types of chronic myeloid leukemia resistances, which frequently appear in the advanced phases of pathology. In recent years, the development of such compounds has been promoted by both excellent preclinical and clinical results, and by the theory that dual or multi-targeted inhibitors might be more effective than selective inhibitors.

RESULTS: Significant association between XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism and childhood ALL risk was observed in total population analyses (OR(additive model) = 1.501, 95% CI 1.112-2.026, P(OR) = 0.008; OR(dominant model) = 1.316, 95% CI = 1.104-1.569, P(OR) = 0.002) and Asian subgroup analyses (OR(additive model) = 2.338, 95%CI = 1.254-4.359, P(OR) = 0.008; OR(dominant model) = 2.108, 95%CI = 1.498-2.967, P(OR) = 0.000). No association was detected in Caucasians, Metizo and mixed populations. Ethnicity was considered as a significant source of heterogeneity in the meta-regression model. For the other two XRCC1 polymorphisms, no association with childhood ALL risk was found. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis results suggested that XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism might be associated with elevated childhood ALL risk among Asian population.","['Wang, Libing', 'Yin, Fan', 'Xu, Xia', 'Hu, Xiaoxia', 'Zhao, Dongbao']","['Wang L', 'Yin F', 'Xu X', 'Hu X', 'Zhao D']","['Department of Hematology, Second Military Medical University, Changhai Hospital, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120418,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (X-ray Repair Cross Complementing Protein 1)', '0 (XRCC1 protein, human)']",IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Models, Statistical', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Publication Bias', 'Risk', 'X-ray Repair Cross Complementing Protein 1']",2012/04/25 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/04/25 06:00'],"['2011/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0034897 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-24446 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e34897. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0034897.

To date, however, the reprogramming efficiency of human adult cells is still low. Recent studies have revealed that cell cycle is a key parameter driving epigenetic reprogramming to pluripotency. As is well known, retroviruses such as the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) require cell division to integrate into the host genome and replicate, whereas the target primary cells for reprogramming are a mixture of several cell types with different cell cycle rhythms. Whether cell cycle synchronization has potential effect on retrovirus induced reprogramming has not been detailed. In this study, utilizing transient serum starvation induced synchronization, we demonstrated that starvation generated a reversible cell cycle arrest and synchronously progressed through G2/M phase after release, substantially improving retroviral infection efficiency. Interestingly, synchronized human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) and adipose stem cells (ASC) exhibited more homogenous epithelial morphology than normal FBS control after infection, and the expression of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and Epcam were strongly activated. Futhermore, synchronization treatment ultimately improved Nanog positive clones, achieved a 15-20 fold increase. These results suggested that cell cycle synchronization promotes the mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) and facilitates retrovirus mediated reprogramming. Our study, utilization of serum starvation rather than additional chemicals, provide a new insight into cell cycle regulation and induced reprogramming of human cells.","['Chen, Mengfei', 'Huang, Jingjing', 'Yang, Xuejiao', 'Liu, Bingqian', 'Zhang, Weizhong', 'Huang, Li', 'Deng, Fei', 'Ma, Jian', 'Bai, Yujing', 'Lu, Rong', 'Huang, Bing', 'Gao, Qianying', 'Zhuo, Yehong', 'Ge, Jian']","['Chen M', 'Huang J', 'Yang X', 'Liu B', 'Zhang W', 'Huang L', 'Deng F', 'Ma J', 'Bai Y', 'Lu R', 'Huang B', 'Gao Q', 'Zhuo Y', 'Ge J']","['State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120418,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cellular Reprogramming/*physiology', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2012/04/25 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/04/25 06:00'],"['2011/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0028203 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-13065 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e28203. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0028203.

In addition to the t(4;14), all tumor time points also shared 10 common single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) on WGS comprising shared initiating events. Interestingly, we observed genomic sequence variants that waxed and waned with time in progressive tumors, suggesting the presence of multiple independent, yet related, clones at diagnosis that rose and fell in dominance. Five newly acquired SNVs, including truncating mutations of RB1 and ZKSCAN3, were observed only in the final sPCL sample suggesting leukemic transformation events.

Recently, miR-3151 was discovered in intron 1 of BAALC. To evaluate the prognostic significance of miR-3151 expression levels and to gain insight into the biologic and prognostic interplay between miR-3151 and its host, miR-3151 and BAALC expression were measured in pretreatment blood of 179 CN-AML patients. Gene-expression profiling and miRNA-expression profiling were performed using microarrays. High miR-3151 expression was associated with shorter disease-free and overall survival, whereas high BAALC expression predicted failure of complete remission and shorter overall survival. Patients exhibiting high expression of both miR-3151 and BAALC had worse outcome than patients expressing low levels of either gene or both genes. In gene-expression profiling, high miR-3151 expressers showed down-regulation of genes involved in transcriptional regulation, posttranslational modification, and cancer pathways. Two genes, FBXL20 and USP40, were validated as direct miR-3151 targets. The results of the present study show that high expression of miR-3151 is an independent prognosticator for poor outcome in CN-AML and affects different outcome end points than its host gene, BAALC. The combination of both markers identified a patient subset with the poorest outcome.

However, this strategy requires identification of leukemia-associated antigens that are immunogenic and exhibit selective high expression in AML LSCs. Using microarray expression analysis of LSCs, hematopoietic cell subpopulations, and peripheral tissues to screen for candidate antigens, cyclin-A1 was identified as a candidate gene. Cyclin-A1 promotes cell proliferation and survival, has been shown to be leukemogenic in mice, is detected in LSCs of more than 50% of AML patients, and is minimally expressed in normal tissues with exception of testis. Using dendritic cells pulsed with a cyclin-A1 peptide library, we generated T cells against several cyclin-A1 oligopeptides. Two HLA A*0201-restricted epitopes were further characterized, and specific CD8 T-cell clones recognized both peptide-pulsed target cells and the HLA A*0201-positive AML line THP-1, which expresses cyclin-A1. Furthermore, cyclin-A1-specific CD8 T cells lysed primary AML cells. Thus, cyclin-A1 is the first prototypic leukemia-testis-antigen to be expressed in AML LSCs.

PubMed, Embase, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure were searched until 21 September 2011 to identify eligible studies. A total of 14 studies were included, with all studies investigating MTHFR C677T polymorphism while nine of them investigating MTHFR A1298C polymorphism only. Results suggested that MTHFR C677T polymorphism was associated with significantly increased risk of MTX-induced toxicity, specifically liver toxicity (TT/CT vs. CC: odds ratio (OR) = 1.70, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.05-2.75), myelosuppression (TT vs. CT/CC: OR = 2.82, 95 %CI = 1.25-6.34), oral mucositis (TT/CT vs. CC: OR = 3.68, 95 %CI = 1.73-7.85), gastrointestinal toxicity (TT/CT vs. CC: OR = 2.36, 95 %CI = 1.36-4.11), and skin toxicity (T vs. C: OR = 2.26, 95 %CI = 1.07-4.74).

Early diagnosis may allow effective interventions to minimize or ameliorate joint deterioration and obviate surgical intervention. We investigated the significance of MRI signal changes that precede the currently recognized ""double-line"" changes, which are considered pathognomic of osteonecrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed MRI scans acquired during prospective screening and follow-up of pediatric patients with leukemia for osteonecrosis. RESULTS: Of 481 patients, we identified 21 cases (4.3%; 12 boys; median age at leukemia diagnosis, 12.8 years) with subtle poorly defined geographically delineated MRI signal abnormalities in knees or hips, or both, that progressed over a median of 4 months (range, 1.6-18.5 months) to florid MRI signs of osteonecrosis. Articular surface collapse developed in three hips (two patients) and three knees (three patients). Three patients subsequently underwent surgical intervention (one bilateral total hip arthroplasty and one bilateral and one unilateral hip core decompression). The median duration of follow-up was 27 months (range, 1.9-90.7 months). CONCLUSION: The MRI signal abnormalities described here appear to herald extensive osteonecrosis and precede the typical MRI findings of osteonecrosis previously reported in the literature.","['Sansgiri, Rakhee Kisan', 'Neel, Michael D', 'Soto-Fourier, Manuel', 'Kaste, Sue C']","['Sansgiri RK', 'Neel MD', 'Soto-Fourier M', 'Kaste SC']","[""Department of Radiology, LeBonheur Children's Medical Center, Memphis, TN, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,AJR Am J Roentgenol,AJR.

This gene encodes a transcriptional repressor and is ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues but downexpressed in different tumor tissues where it is hypermethylated. The hypermethylation of this chromosomal region leads to epigenetic inactivation of HIC1, which would prompt cancer cells to alter survival and signaling pathways or specific transcription factors during the period of tumorigenesis. In vitro, HIC1 function is mainly a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor interacting with a still growing range of histone deacetylase(HDAC)-dependent and HDAC-independent corepressor complexes. Furthermore, a role for HIC1 in tumor development is firmly supported by Hic1 deficient mouse model and two double heterozygote models cooperate with p53 and Ptch1. Notably, our findings suggest that potential factors derived from tumor microenviroment may play a role in modulating HIC1 expression in tumor cells by epigenetic modification, which is responsible for tumor progression. In this review, we will describe genomic and proteinic structure of HIC1, and summary the potential role of HIC1 in human various solid tumors and leukemia, and explore the influence of tumor microenviroment on inducing HIC1 expression in tumor cells.","['Zheng, Jianghua', 'Xiong, Dan', 'Sun, Xueqing', 'Wang, Jinglong', 'Hao, Mingang', 'Ding, Tao', 'Xiao, Gang', 'Wang, Xiumin', 'Mao, Yan', 'Fu, Yuejie', 'Shen, Kunwei', 'Wang, Jianhua']","['Zheng J', 'Xiong D', 'Sun X', 'Wang J', 'Hao M', 'Ding T', 'Xiao G', 'Wang X', 'Mao Y', 'Fu Y', 'Shen K', 'Wang J']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular & Cell Biology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120413,Netherlands,Cancer Microenviron,Cancer microenvironment : official journal of the International Cancer Microenvironment Society,101322634,,,,2012/04/25 06:00,2012/04/25 06:01,['2012/04/25 06:00'],"['2012/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/25 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12307-012-0103-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Microenviron. 2012 Dec;5(3):285-93. doi: 10.1007/s12307-012-0103-1.

In mouse ES cells, extrinsic leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways play pivotal roles in maintaining the self-renewal status under serum and feeder free culture conditions. Intrinsic extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) activity is also important in determining mouse ES cell fate-low ERK activity keeps mouse ES cell self-renewal while high ERK activity drives differentiation. We recently found that while LIF signaling augments ERK activity, BMP signaling inhibits ERK activity in mouse ES cells via direct upregulation of an ERK phosphatase-dual-specificity phosphatase 9. The cooperative effects of LIF and BMP signaling keep appropriate ERK activity and maintain mouse ES cell self-renewal (Li et al., 2012). These findings shed light on how extrinsic signals converge to intrinsic signaling molecules to regulate cell fate determination. This perspective summarizes our recent new findings and discusses the current unsolved questions and future directions.","['Li, Zhongwei', 'Chen, Ye-Guang']","['Li Z', 'Chen YG']","['The State Key Laboratory of Biomembrane and Membrane Biotechnology, Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120419,Germany,Protein Cell,Protein & cell,101532368,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Signal Transduction']",2012/04/25 06:00,2013/06/29 06:00,['2012/04/25 06:00'],"['2012/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13238-012-2925-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Protein Cell. 2012 Jun;3(6):401-4. doi: 10.1007/s13238-012-2925-5.

However, the roles of AFF4 in the hypothalamus remain unclear. We show herein that expression of AFF4 increased upon addition of ghrelin and fasting in the growth hormone secretagogue receptor-expressing neurons of the hypothalamus. In the growth hormone secretagogue receptor-expressing hypothalamic neuronal cell line GT1-7, ghrelin markedly induced expression of AFF4 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Overexpression of AFF4 in GT1-7 cells specifically induced expression of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) alpha2 subunit but failed to induce other AMPK subunits and AMPK upstream kinases. The promoter activity of the AMPKalpha2 gene increased upon addition of AFF4, suggesting that AFF4 regulates transcription of the AMPKalpha2 gene. Additionally, AFF4 also increased the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACCalpha), a downstream target of AMPK. In GT1-7 cells, ghrelin phosphorylated ACCalpha through AMPKalpha phosphorylation in the early phase (15 min) of the activation. However, ghrelin-induced expression of AMPKalpha2 and phosphorylation of ACCalpha in the late phase (2 h) of the activation were independent of AMPKalpha phosphorylation. Attenuation of expression of AFF4 by its siRNA in GT1-7 cells decreased ghrelin-induced AMPKalpha2 expression and ACCalpha phosphorylation in the late phase of the activation. AFF4 may therefore help to maintain activation of AMPK downstream signaling under conditions of prolonged stimulation with ghrelin, such as during fasting.","['Komori, Tadasuke', 'Doi, Asako', 'Nosaka, Tetsuya', 'Furuta, Hiroto', 'Akamizu, Takashi', 'Kitamura, Toshio', 'Senba, Emiko', 'Morikawa, Yoshihiro']","['Komori T', 'Doi A', 'Nosaka T', 'Furuta H', 'Akamizu T', 'Kitamura T', 'Senba E', 'Morikawa Y']","['Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Wakayama Medical University, 811-1 Kimiidera, Wakayama 641-8509, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120423,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Aff4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ghrelin)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AMPK alpha2 subunit, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 6.4.1.2 (Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Fasting/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Ghrelin/pharmacology', 'Hypothalamus/cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neurons/cytology/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors']",2012/04/25 06:00,2012/09/22 06:00,['2012/04/25 06:00'],"['2012/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)49869-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.367854 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 Jun 8;287(24):19985-96. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.367854.

Cells with down-regulated expression of LRP16 were obtained by a shRNA interference strategy. Insulin content and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) were examined by radioimmunoassay. Western blotting was applied to detect protein expression. Glucose-stimulated sub-cellular localization of PDX-1 was immunocytochemically determined. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. Our results showed that LRP16 regulated insulin content in MIN6 cells by controlling expression of insulin and insulin transcription factors. LRP16 gene silence in MIN6 cells led to reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. The observation of phosphorylation of serine-473 Akt and the localization of PDX-1 to the nucleus under glucose-stimulation exhibited that LRP16 was a component mediating Akt signaling in MIN6 cells. These results suggest that LRP16 plays a key role in maintaining pancreatic beta-cell functions and may help us to understand the protective effects of estrogen on the functions of pancreatic beta-cells.,"['Li, Xiaojin', 'Xue, Bing', 'Wang, Xuan', 'Sun, Lianqing', 'Zhang, Tingting', 'Qu, Ling', 'Zou, Xiaoman', 'Mu, Yiming']","['Li X', 'Xue B', 'Wang X', 'Sun L', 'Zhang T', 'Qu L', 'Zou X', 'Mu Y']","['Department of Endocrinology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, China. muyiming@301hospital.com.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120420,China,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

However, cases in which these features are absent have been occasionally reported in Japan. Here, clinical and biological features of 13 T-PLL cases, diagnosed between 1992 and 2009 in the Tohoku region of Japan, were compared with three Western series. Median age was 64 (range 40-78) years old, and the male to female ratio (12:1) was higher than that of the Western series (P < 0.04). Presented manifestations were similar to those of Western cases, but central nervous system involvement, which is rare in Western cases, was observed in 3 of 13 cases (23 %) (P < 0.04). Immunophenotypic patterns were similar to those of Western cases, but HLA-DR was positive in 6 of 9 cases (67 %), which is distinct from Western cases (0-9 %) (P < 0.002). By chromosome analyses, 14q11 abnormality and trisomy 8q, which are common among Western cases (70-80 %), were not observed in any cases (P < 0.002). Morphologically, seven were classified as typical type, five as a small-cell variant, and one as a cerebriform variant. Seven cases experienced an aggressive course, whereas six experienced an indolent course over a median follow-up of 50 months. In contrast to Western cases, clinical courses were closely correlated with morphological types; 86 % of typical types were aggressive, whereas 83 % of small-cell types were indolent (P = 0.025). On the basis of these observations, together with previous Japanese cases in the literature, we propose that Japanese cases of T-PLL may constitute a variant.","['Kameoka, Junichi', 'Takahashi, Naoto', 'Noji, Hideyoshi', 'Murai, Kazunori', 'Tajima, Katsushi', 'Kameoka, Yoshihiro', 'Sato, Shinji', 'Shichishima, Tsutomu', 'Ishida, Yoji', 'Harigae, Hideo', 'Sawada, Kenichi']","['Kameoka J', 'Takahashi N', 'Noji H', 'Murai K', 'Tajima K', 'Kameoka Y', 'Sato S', 'Shichishima T', 'Ishida Y', 'Harigae H', 'Sawada K']","['Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1, Seiryo-cho, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8574, Japan. j-kame@med.tohoku.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120424,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Blood Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/classification/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2012/04/25 06:00,2012/11/09 06:00,['2012/04/25 06:00'],"['2011/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-012-1077-y [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2012 Jun;95(6):660-7. doi: 10.1007/s12185-012-1077-y.

Although detailed mechanisms are still not fully elucidated, recent studies suggest alterations of insulin-signaling transduction cascades underlie neuronal stresses in AD brains. In this study, we performed in vivo experiments to determine the impact of soluble Abeta oligomers on insulin-signaling transduction in rat hippocampi by utilizing lateral ventricular injection of amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers on male Wistar rats (225 +/- 25 g, 3-4 months old) as an AD rat model. The Abeta-infused rats manifested remarkably increased escape latency and significantly decreased proportions of time and pathway crossing the hidden platform as compared to the rats in the pseudo-injection group and the non-injection group in Morris water maze test implicating the damaging effect of soluble Abeta oligomers on rat learning and memory functions. Accordingly, our subsequent results demonstrated that the infusion of soluble Abeta oligomers significantly decreased the expressions of insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate-I, B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 and serine/threonine protein kinase B in rat hippocampal neurons, whereas the expression level of total cAMP response element-binding protein was not changed. This study suggests that soluble Abeta oligomers instigated insulin-signaling disturbances which are potentially associated with learning and memory deficits in the AD rat model.","['Han, Xiaojuan', 'Ma, Yan', 'Liu, Xiaohui', 'Wang, Lu', 'Qi, Shen', 'Zhang, Qinghua', 'Du, Yifeng']","['Han X', 'Ma Y', 'Liu X', 'Wang L', 'Qi S', 'Zhang Q', 'Du Y']","[""Department of Neurology, Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, 324# Jingwu Weiqi Road, Jinan 250021, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120417,Austria,J Neural Transm (Vienna),"Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",9702341,"['0 (Amyloid beta-Peptides)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins)', '0 (Irs1 protein, rat)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)']",IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/chemically induced/*complications/pathology', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides/toxicity', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'CREB-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Hippocampus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Insulin/*metabolism', 'Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Learning Disabilities/*etiology', 'Male', 'Maze Learning/drug effects/physiology', 'Memory Disorders/*etiology', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptor, Insulin/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology']",2012/04/25 06:00,2013/04/20 06:00,['2012/04/25 06:00'],"['2011/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00702-012-0803-1 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neural Transm (Vienna). 2012 Nov;119(11):1407-16. doi: 10.1007/s00702-012-0803-1.

Here we evaluate the roles of Mcl-1 in chemotherapy-associated apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. In addition, our study examined whether Mcl-1 contributed to apoptosis resistance in so-called cancer stem cell (CSC)-like populations in gastric cancer. METHODS: Seven gastric cancer cell lines were used. The expression of Mcl-1 was assessed by either real-time polymerase chain reaction or Western blot analysis. Apoptosis was quantitated by morphological observation and caspase activity measurement. Adenovirus-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) technology was used to knockdown the expression of Mcl-1. The release of cytochrome c was evaluated by subcellular fractionation and immunoblot analysis. To identify and isolate the CSC-like populations, we used the CSC-associated cell surface marker CD44 and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Six out of the 7 gastric cancer cell lines overexpressed Mcl-1 protein. These Mcl-1-expressing cell lines were relatively resistant to chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (CDDP). Depletion of Mcl-1 protein by RNAi technology effectively sensitized the cells to anticancer drug-induced mitochondrial cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and apoptosis. In addition, vast amounts of Mcl-1 mRNA were expressed in CD44-positive CSC-like cells. Mcl-1 suppression enhanced the apoptosis in CD44-positive cells to a level equivalent to that in CD44-negative cells, suggesting that Mcl-1 mediates chemotherapy resistance in CSC-like populations. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Mcl-1 mediates the resistance to apoptosis in gastric cancer cells by blocking the mitochondrial pathway of cell death. Mcl-1 depletion appears to be an attractive strategy to overcome chemotherapy resistance in gastric cancer cells.","['Akagi, Hideko', 'Higuchi, Hajime', 'Sumimoto, Hidetoshi', 'Igarashi, Toru', 'Kabashima, Ayano', 'Mizuguchi, Hiroyuki', 'Izumiya, Motoko', 'Sakai, Gen', 'Adachi, Masayuki', 'Funakoshi, Shinsuke', 'Nakamura, Shoko', 'Hamamoto, Yasuo', 'Kanai, Takanori', 'Takaishi, Hiromasa', 'Kawakami, Yutaka', 'Hibi, Toshifumi']","['Akagi H', 'Higuchi H', 'Sumimoto H', 'Igarashi T', 'Kabashima A', 'Mizuguchi H', 'Izumiya M', 'Sakai G', 'Adachi M', 'Funakoshi S', 'Nakamura S', 'Hamamoto Y', 'Kanai T', 'Takaishi H', 'Kawakami Y', 'Hibi T']","['Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120424,Japan,Gastric Cancer,Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,100886238,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology']",2012/04/25 06:00,2013/06/29 06:00,['2012/04/25 06:00'],"['2011/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10120-012-0153-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Gastric Cancer. 2013 Jan;16(1):100-10. doi: 10.1007/s10120-012-0153-6.

However, little is known about the anti-cancer effect of 2-pyrone derivatives including leukemia. Therefore, this present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of 2-pyrone derivatives in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Among 23 synthesized derivatives, 5-bromo-3-(3-hydroxyprop-1-ynyl)-2H-pyran-2-one (code name; pyrone 9) showed the most potent antileukemic activity with 5 x 10(-6) M to 5 x 10(-5) M of IC(50) in various AML cell lines as well as primary leukemic blasts from AML patients, while normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells was not affected by pyrone 9. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that pyrone 9 induced the G1 and G2 phase dual arrest of the cell cycle in HL-60 cells. To address the mechanism of the antileukemic effect of pyrone 9, we examined the effect of pyrone 9 on cell cycle-related proteins in HL-60 cell. The levels of CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, CDK1, cyclin B1 and cyclin E were decreased; in contrast, cyclin A was not altered. In addition, pyrone 9 not only increased the p27 level but also enhanced its binding to with CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 which resulted in the reduction of CDK2-, CDK4- and CDK6-associated kinase activities. Pyrone 9 also induced the apoptosis in HL-60 cells. The apoptotic process of HL-60 cells was associated with increased Bax, decreased Bcl-2 and activation of caspase-8, -9, -3 and PARP. Antileukemic effect of pyrone 9 was associated with activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, as evidenced by activation of p-ERK and p38 MAPK. In addition, pyrone 9 was influenced PI3 kinase pathway. Expressions of p-Akt (ser473), p-Raf, and p-PDK were down-regulated; in contrast, those of PTEN and p-PTEN were up-regulated. Furthermore, pyrone 9 suppressed NF-kappaB pathway signaling. To gain insights into the antileukemic activity of pyrone 9 in vivo, BALB/c mouse leukemic model was established using intraperitoneal inoculation of syngeneic WEHI-3BD(+) mouse leukemic cells. Pyrone 9 inhibited in vitro and in vivo the growth of WEHI-3BD(+) cells, and ultimately, prolonged the survival of pyrone 9-treated mice. These findings suggest that the pyrone 9 inhibits the cell proliferation of human AML cell line, HL-60, through MAPK and PI3 kinase pathway as well as induction of cell cycle arrest. In particular, pyrone 9 prolonged the survival of pyrone 9-treated leukemic mice.","['Yoon, Jin Sun', 'Won, Young Woong', 'Kim, Seo Ju', 'Oh, Suk Joong', 'Kim, Eun Shil', 'Kim, Byoung Kook', 'Cho, Cheon Gyu', 'Choi, Jung Hye', 'Park, Byeong Bae', 'Lee, Min Ho', 'Lee, Young Yiul']","['Yoon JS', 'Won YW', 'Kim SJ', 'Oh SJ', 'Kim ES', 'Kim BK', 'Cho CG', 'Choi JH', 'Park BB', 'Lee MH', 'Lee YY']","['Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120419,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrones)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Pyrones/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2012/04/25 06:00,2013/04/05 06:00,['2012/04/25 06:00'],"['2012/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-012-9814-x [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2012 Dec;30(6):2284-93. doi: 10.1007/s10637-012-9814-x.

METHODS: One patient was an HTLV-I carrier whereas the other was diagnosed with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM). Background data including serum HTLV-I titers, viral loads, and cytokine profiles were recorded. Azocarmine with aniline blue (Azan)-Mallory staining and immunohistochemistry of the labial salivary glands (LSGs) and a muscle biopsy specimen from the HAM patient were performed. RESULTS: Serum transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and HTLV-I viral load were high in the HAM-SS patient compared with the HTLV-I carrier. Fibrous change in LSG was prominent in the HAM-SS patient. Although TGF-beta expression was similar in the two patients, expression of HTLV-I-related proteins including p12, p28, group-specific antigen (GAG), and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) in the LSG were dominantly detected in the HAM-SS patient. Frequency of TGF-beta staining in HTLV-I-seropositive SS patients without ACA, HTLV-I-seronegative SS patients with ACA, and HTLV-I-seronegative SS patients without ACA was lower than that of the previous two patients. CONCLUSION: A high HTLV-I viral load in situ is supposed to promote the production of cytokines, especially TGF-beta, resulting in the fibrous change of LSG in ACA-seropositive SS patients.","['Nakamura, Hideki', 'Horai, Yoshiro', 'Tokuyama, Ayuko', 'Yoshimura, Shunsuke', 'Nakajima, Hideki', 'Ichinose, Kunihiro', 'Yamasaki, Satoshi', 'Nakamura, Tatsufumi', 'Hayashi, Tomayoshi', 'Kawakami, Atsushi']","['Nakamura H', 'Horai Y', 'Tokuyama A', 'Yoshimura S', 'Nakajima H', 'Ichinose K', 'Yamasaki S', 'Nakamura T', 'Hayashi T', 'Kawakami A']","['Unit of Translational Medicine, Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan. nakamura_hideki911@yahoo.co.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20120418,England,Mod Rheumatol,Modern rheumatology,100959226,"['0 (Antibodies, Antinuclear)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor alpha)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Antinuclear/*blood', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Carrier State', 'Centromere/*immunology', 'Female', 'Fibrosis/pathology', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/*complications/*pathology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lip', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Mucosa', 'Muscle, Skeletal/metabolism/pathology', 'Salivary Glands, Minor/metabolism/pathology/virology', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/blood/*pathology/*virology"", 'Transforming Growth Factor alpha/blood', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/blood', 'Viral Load', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', 'Xerostomia/diagnosis/etiology']",2012/04/25 06:00,2013/06/14 06:00,['2012/04/25 06:00'],"['2012/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10165-012-0641-x [doi]'],ppublish,Mod Rheumatol. 2013 Jan;23(1):133-9. doi: 10.1007/s10165-012-0641-x.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) may be indicated to (1) monitor adherence, (2) guide dosage, and (3) minimise the risk of drug-drug interactions and dose-related toxicity. On-line, automated sample preparation provided by TurboFlow technology (ThermoFisher Scientific) in conjunction with the sensitivity and selectivity of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) detection may be applied to the analysis of single drugs and metabolites. We report the use of TurboFlow LC-MS/MS for the analysis of nine TKIs and metabolites (imatinib, N-desmethylimatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, lapatinib, sorafenib, sunitinib) in human plasma or serum for TDM purposes. An Aria Transcend TLX-II system coupled with a TSQ Vantage was used. Samples (50 muL) were vortex mixed with internal standard solution (150 muL imatinib-D(8), gefitinib-D(8), sunitinib-D(10), and nilotinib-(13)C (2) (15) N(2) in acetonitrile) and, after centrifugation 100 muL supernatant were injected directly onto a 50 x 0.5-mm Cyclone TurboFlow column. Analytes were focussed onto a 50 x 2.1-mm (3 mum) Hypersil GOLD analytical column and eluted with an acetonitrile/water gradient. Analytes were monitored in selected reaction monitoring mode (positive APCI). Total analysis time was 7 min without multiplexing. Calibration was linear (R(2) > 0.99) for all analytes. Inter- and intra-assay precision (in percent relative standard deviation, RSD) was <11 % and accuracy 89-117 % for all analytes. No matrix effects were observed.

BetA can kill a broad range of tumor cell lines, but has no effect on untransformed cells. The chemical also kills melanoma, leukemia, lung, colon, breast, prostate and ovarian cancer cells via induction of apoptosis, which depends on caspase activation. However, no reports are yet available about the effects of BetA on nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a widely spread malignancy in the world, especially in East Asia. In this study, we first showed that BetA can effectively kill CNE2 cells, a cell line derived from NPC. BetA-induced CNE2 apoptosis was characterized by typical apoptosis hallmarks: caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, and cytochrome c release. Overexpression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL could partially prevent apoptosis caused by BetA. Moreover, Bax was not activated during the induction of apoptosis. Bax/Bak knockdown and wild-type CNE2 cells showed the same kinetics of cytochrome c release. We then showed that BetA may impair mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mPTPs), which may partially contribute to cytochrome c release. These observations suggest that BetA may serve as a potent and effective anticancer agent in NPC treatment. Further exploration of the mechanism of action of BetA could yield novel breakthroughs in anti-cancer drug discovery.","['Liu, Yang', 'Luo, Wenlong']","['Liu Y', 'Luo W']","['E.N.T Department, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing City 400000, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120417,Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore)', '0 (Pentacyclic Triterpenes)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '4G6A18707N (betulinic acid)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/*metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore', 'Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Pentacyclic Triterpenes', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*metabolism']",2012/04/25 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/04/25 06:00'],"['2012/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10059-012-0022-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cells. 2012 May;33(5):517-24. doi: 10.1007/s10059-012-0022-5.

Here we discuss 5 cases of candidemia caused by C. tropicalis in patients with hematological malignancies in our unit, and we note that 4 isolates were resistant to azole agents, including fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole. In addition, 2 patients developed breakthrough candidemia caused by C. tropicalis while receiving prophylaxis with azole agents. Interestingly, 2 of the 4 patients with azole-resistant C. tropicalis isolates had never received any antifungal drugs. We also examined the susceptibilities of C. tropicalis to antifungal agents, using 39 non-blood isolates detected from 2003 to 2009. Around 40 % of the isolates were resistant to azole agents, and all of them were highly sensitive to amphotericin B and micafungin. The resistance to azoles was not associated with previous exposure to those agents. In our unit, 2 of the 4 cases of candidemia caused by azole-resistant C. tropicalis resulted in a poor prognosis. These findings suggested that empirical therapeutic strategies for candidemia should be modified based on the local antifungal resistance pattern.","['Chong, Yong', 'Shimoda, Shinji', 'Yakushiji, Hiroko', 'Ito, Yoshikiyo', 'Miyamoto, Toshihiro', 'Shimono, Nobuyuki', 'Kamimura, Tomohiko', 'Akashi, Koichi']","['Chong Y', 'Shimoda S', 'Yakushiji H', 'Ito Y', 'Miyamoto T', 'Shimono N', 'Kamimura T', 'Akashi K']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Hara-Sanshin Hospital, 1-8 Taihaku-cho, Hakata-ku, Fukuoka, 812-0033, Japan. ychong@gj9.so-net.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20120418,Netherlands,J Infect Chemother,Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,9608375,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Azoles)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antifungal Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Azoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Candida tropicalis/drug effects/*isolation & purification', 'Candidemia/*blood/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Drug Resistance, Fungal', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*microbiology', 'Lymphoma/blood/microbiology', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged']",2012/04/25 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2012/04/25 06:00'],"['2011/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10156-012-0412-9 [doi]', 'S1341-321X(12)70253-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Infect Chemother. 2012 Oct;18(5):741-6. doi: 10.1007/s10156-012-0412-9.

CLL cells that express unmutated immunoglobulin variable domains likely underwent final development prior to their entry into the germinal center, whereas those that express mutated variable domains likely transited through the germinal center and then underwent final development. Regardless, the cellular origin of CLL remains unknown. The aim of this review is to summarize immunological aspects involved in this process and to provide insights about the complex biology and pathogenesis of this disease. We propose a mechanistic hypothesis to explain the origin of B-CLL clones into our current picture of normal B cell development. In particular, we suggest that unmutated CLL arises from normal B cells with self-reactivity for apoptotic bodies that have undergone receptor editing, CD5 expression, and anergic processes in the bone marrow. Similarly, mutated CLL would arise from cells that, while acquiring self-reactivity for autoantigens-including apoptotic bodies-in germinal centers, are also still subject to tolerization mechanisms, including receptor editing and anergy. We believe that CLL is a proliferation of B lymphocytes selected during clonal expansion through multiple encounters with (auto)antigens, despite the fact that they differ in their state of activation and maturation. Autoantigens and microbial pathogens activate BCR signaling and promote tolerogenic mechanisms such as receptor editing/revision, anergy, CD5+ expression, and somatic hypermutation in CLL B cells. The result of these tolerogenic mechanisms is the survival of CLL B cell clones with similar surface markers and homogeneous gene expression signatures. We suggest that both immunophenotypic surface markers and homogenous gene expression might represent the evidence of several attempts to re-educate self-reactive B cells.","['Garcia-Munoz, Ricardo', 'Roldan Galiacho, Veronica', 'Llorente, Luis']","['Garcia-Munoz R', 'Roldan Galiacho V', 'Llorente L']","['Hematology Department, Hospital San Pedro, c/Piqueras 98, Logrono, La Rioja, 26006, Spain. rgmunoz@riojasalud.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120412,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/physiology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/etiology/*immunology', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/physiology', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin/genetics/physiology']",2012/04/25 06:00,2012/08/10 06:00,['2012/04/25 06:00'],"['2010/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-012-1460-z [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2012 Jul;91(7):981-96. doi: 10.1007/s00277-012-1460-z.

An exposure with a modest effect size might, nevertheless, be associated with a substantial population burden if many children are exposed at levels at which the exposure is known to have a detrimental impact. This illustrates the important distinction between individual risk and population risk. A method is described that can be used to compare different risk factors in terms of their contributions to the population burden of neurodevelopmental impairment. Combining estimates of the incidence/prevalence/distribution of different conditions or exposures with estimates, derived from meta-analyses, for the impact of different risk factors on children's Full-Scale IQ scores (FSIQ), the total FSIQ losses associated with each were calculated for the U.S. population of children less than 5 years of age. The losses associated with non-chemical risk factors ranged widely: 34,000,000 FSIQ points for preterm birth, 17,000,000 for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, 9,000,000 for iron deficiency, 136,000 for acute lymphocytic leukemia, and 37,000 for brain tumors. The FSIQ losses could be estimated for three chemicals: lead, 23,000,000 points; methylmercury, 285,000 points; and organophosphate pesticides, 17,000,000 points. Many caveats attend these calculations, but the findings suggest that in continuing to apply standards appropriate to evaluating the impact of chemical exposures on an individual child rather than on the population as a whole, we risk underestimating the population burdens associated with them.","['Bellinger, David C']",['Bellinger DC'],"[""Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02115, United States. david.bellinger@childrens.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],['Lecture'],20120413,Netherlands,Neurotoxicology,Neurotoxicology,7905589,"['0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Methylmercury Compounds)', '0 (Organophosphates)', '2P299V784P (Lead)', 'RWZ4L3O1X0 (methylmercuric chloride)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Child Development/*drug effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Pollutants/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lead/adverse effects', 'Lead Poisoning, Nervous System, Childhood/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure/adverse effects', 'Mercury Poisoning, Nervous System/epidemiology', 'Methylmercury Compounds/adverse effects', 'Nervous System/*drug effects/growth & development/physiopathology', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Organophosphates/adverse effects', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",2012/04/25 06:00,2013/01/05 06:00,['2012/04/25 06:00'],"['2012/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0161-813X(12)00079-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neuro.2012.04.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurotoxicology. 2012 Aug;33(4):641-3. doi: 10.1016/j.neuro.2012.04.003.

One strategy for overcoming this problem is the concomitant use of natural dietary compounds as therapeutic agents. Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) is a promising chemopreventive agent found in cruciferous vegetables and papaya fruits. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of BITC on cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in human promyelocytic leukemia cells and normal human lymphocytes. The combined treatment of HL-60 cells with BITC followed by cisplatin (BITC/cisplatin) caused a significant decrease in cell viability. BITC also increased apoptotic cell death compared to cisplatin treatment alone. In normal human lymphocytes, BITC did not enhance the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin. Cellular exposure to BITC/cisplatin increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation but decreased the total glutathione (GSH) level in HL-60 cells. Pretreatment of HL-60 cells with N-acetylcysteine or glutathione monoethyl ester effectively decreased BITC/cisplatin-induced cell death. The addition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor PD98059 abolished BITC/cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our results suggest that BITC enhances cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity through the generation of ROS, depletion of GSH, and ERK signaling in HL-60 cells.","['Lee, Younghyun', 'Kim, Yang Jee', 'Choi, Young Joo', 'Lee, Joong Won', 'Lee, Sunyeong', 'Chung, Hai Won']","['Lee Y', 'Kim YJ', 'Choi YJ', 'Lee JW', 'Lee S', 'Chung HW']","['School of Public Health and Institute of Health and Environment, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanka-ro, Gwankak-gu, Seoul 151-742, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120416,England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '871J6YOR8Q (benzyl isothiocyanate)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Base Sequence', 'Cisplatin/*toxicity', 'DNA Primers', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/*toxicity', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2012/04/25 06:00,2012/10/13 06:00,['2012/04/25 06:00'],"['2011/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0278-6915(12)00296-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2012.04.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2012 Jul;50(7):2397-406. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2012.04.014.

The organization of the BM niches is critical for the function or dysfunction of normal or malignant BM(5). Therefore a better understanding of the in vivo microenvironment using an ex vivo mimicry would help us elucidate the molecular, cellular and microenvironmental determinants of leukemogenesis. Currently, hematopoietic cells are cultured in vitro in two-dimensional (2D) tissue culture flasks/well-plates requiring either co-culture with allogenic or xenogenic stromal cells or addition of exogenous cytokines. These conditions are artificial and differ from the in vivo microenvironment in that they lack the 3D cellular niches and expose the cells to abnormally high cytokine concentrations which can result in differentiation and loss of pluripotency. Herein, we present a novel 3D bone marrow culture system that simulates the in vivo 3D growth environment and supports multilineage hematopoiesis in the absence of exogenous growth factors. The highly porous scaffold used in this system made of polyurethane (PU), facilitates high-density cell growth across a higher specific surface area than the conventional monolayer culture in 2D. Our work has indicated that this model supported the growth of human cord blood (CB) mononuclear cells (MNC) and primary leukemic cells in the absence of exogenous cytokines. This novel 3D mimicry provides a viable platform for the development of a human experimental model to study hematopoiesis and to explore novel treatments for leukemia.","['Mortera-Blanco, Teresa', 'Rende, Maria', 'Macedo, Hugo', 'Farah, Serene', 'Bismarck, Alexander', 'Mantalaris, Athanasios', 'Panoskaltsis, Nicki']","['Mortera-Blanco T', 'Rende M', 'Macedo H', 'Farah S', 'Bismarck A', 'Mantalaris A', 'Panoskaltsis N']","['Department of Chemical Engineering and Chemical Technology, South Kensington campus, Imperial College London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",20120410,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,,IM,"['Biomimetics/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans']",2012/04/25 06:00,2012/07/07 06:00,['2012/04/25 06:00'],"['2012/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['3654 [pii]', '10.3791/3654 [doi]']",epublish,J Vis Exp. 2012 Apr 10;(62). pii: 3654. doi: 10.3791/3654.,,,PMC3466659,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated potential mechanisms of resistance to ABT-737 in leukemia cell lines. Compared with parental cells, cells that have developed acquired resistance to ABT-737 showed increased expression of Mcl-1 in addition to posttranslational modifications that facilitated both Mcl-1 stabilization and its interaction with the BH3-only protein Bim. To sensitize resistant cells, Mcl-1 was targeted by two pan-Bcl-2 family inhibitors, obatoclax and gossypol. Although gossypol was effective only in resistant cells, obatoclax induced cell death in both parental and ABT-737-resistant cells. NOXA levels were increased substantially by treatment with gossypol and its expression was critical for the gossypol response. Mechanistically, the newly generated NOXA interacted with Mcl-1 and displaced Bim from the Mcl-1/Bim complex, freeing Bim to trigger the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Together, our findings indicate that NOXA and Mcl-1 are critical determinants for gossypol-mediated cell death in ABT-737-resistant cells. These data therefore reveal novel insight into mechanisms of acquired resistance to ABT-737.","['Mazumder, Suparna', 'Choudhary, Gaurav S', 'Al-Harbi, Sayer', 'Almasan, Alexandru']","['Mazumder S', 'Choudhary GS', 'Al-Harbi S', 'Almasan A']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120423,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)', 'QN4128B52A (obatoclax)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gossypol/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",2012/04/25 06:00,2012/09/05 06:00,['2012/04/25 06:00'],"['2012/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-11-4106 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-4106 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2012 Jun 15;72(12):3069-79. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-4106.

We will review the biology of MLL leukemia, and explore the potential of targeting multiple signaling pathways deregulated in MLL leukemic stem cells (LSCs). RECENT FINDINGS: Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) plays a critical role in mediating Hox/MEIS1 transcriptional program and its inhibition shows promise in suppressing leukemia carrying MLL fusions or aberrant Hox expression. However, recent evidence indicates that GSK3 inhibition can be overcome by hyperactivation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in MLL LSCs, whereas suppression of beta-catenin resensitizes MLL LSCs to the GSK3 inhibitor treatment. These results suggest a differential GSK3 dependence in different subsets of leukemic populations during disease development. SUMMARY: On the basis of the results from preclinical model studies, a combination treatment targeting both GSK3 and the canonical Wnt signaling pathway emerges as a promising avenue to eradicate MLL LSCs. Future effort in identifying the key tractable components along these signaling pathways will be critical for the development of effective inhibitors to target this aggressive disease.","['Fung, Tsz K', 'Gandillet, Arnaud', 'So, Chi W E']","['Fung TK', 'Gandillet A', 'So CW']","[""Leukaemia and Stem Cell Biology Group, Department of Heamatological Medicine, The Rayne Institute, King's College London, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Wnt Proteins/*metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*physiology', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",2012/04/25 06:00,2012/09/20 06:00,['2012/04/25 06:00'],"['2012/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283545615 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2012 Jul;19(4):280-6. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283545615.,,"['11-0729/AICR_/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom', 'MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Polymerase chain reaction amplification of antigen receptor genes, one of the two main methods to study MRD in ALL, could be made more rapid, sensitive and informative by the application of next-generation sequencing technologies. Advances in flow cytometric detection of MRD, the other main method, include the identification of new immunophenotypic markers to recognize ALL cells, the development of computerized approaches to automate data analysis, and the generation of instruments that can rapidly screen large number of cells for immunophenotypic abnormalities while visualizing their morphology. Recent data further corroborate the prognostic value of MRD at early time points during therapy, demonstrate the prognostic significance of MRD among ALL subtypes, and indicate that presenting features can complement the prognostic utility of MRD. SUMMARY: MRD is replacing morphology to measure treatment response in ALL and is being used, with promising results, for risk-stratification in clinical protocols. Recent studies provide further evidence of its prognostic significance and point to possible strategies to increase the reliability, applicability and sensitivity of MRD testing.","['Campana, Dario']",['Campana D'],"['Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore. dario.campana@stjude.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Prognosis']",2012/04/25 06:00,2012/09/20 06:00,['2012/04/25 06:00'],"['2012/04/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283543d5c [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2012 Jul;19(4):313-8. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283543d5c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Symptoms of the disease were slight persistent fever, weight loss, asthenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia,and leukocytosis with high number of blasts in peripheral blood. After induction chemotherapy with ICE (Ifosfamide, Carboplatin, Etoposide), she developed neutropenia and high fever without apparent infective foci. She was treated with empiric antibiotic therapy, nevertheless she developed an intense diarrhea and ileo-cecal distention. Diagnostic exams didn't show signs of a focal lesion. Despite the change in antibiotic treatment and the transfusions of granulocytes and blood cells, the patient developed extremely critical conditions with persistence of neutropenia and abdominal distention. A surgical treatment was decided at the time. We treated the patient with a two steps surgical procedure. The first step was a right abdominal ileostomy followed by improvement of general conditions and then the second step a right colectomy. The histological morphology confirmed necrotizing colitis with Aspergillus ife. At that time , treatment with voriconazole was started. The general conditions of the patient improved rapidly and we were able to treat the patient with other medical anti-leukemic therapies. The patient is now cured and in healthy state.

In the present study, we screened 31 kinds of edible beans with biological activity similar to that of extracts from pine cone and Mucuna and found that the heat-stable extract from azuki bean (Vigna angula) stimulated differentiation of bone marrow cells into immature DCs with the greatest efficacy. The level of IL-6 produced by sequential treatment of DCs with azuki extract and lipopolysaccharide was the highest among the examined beans. Azuki extract also inhibited the growth of human leukemia U937 cells, leading to induction of apoptosis.

Bacteremia associated with this organism in immunocompromised patients was rapidly fatal as standard minocycline therapies failed. C. resistens DSM 45100 was isolated from a blood culture of samples taken from a patient with acute myelocytic leukemia. The complete genome sequence of C. resistens DSM 45100 was determined by pyrosequencing to identify genes contributing to multi-drug resistance, virulence, and the lipophilic lifestyle of this newly described human pathogen. RESULTS: The genome of C. resistens DSM 45100 consists of a circular chromosome of 2,601,311 bp in size and the 28,312-bp plasmid pJA144188. Metabolic analysis showed that the genome of C. resistens DSM 45100 lacks genes for typical sugar uptake systems, anaplerotic functions, and a fatty acid synthase, explaining the strict lipophilic lifestyle of this species. The genome encodes a broad spectrum of enzymes ensuring the availability of exogenous fatty acids for growth, including predicted virulence factors that probably contribute to fatty acid metabolism by damaging host tissue. C. resistens DSM 45100 is able to use external L-histidine as a combined carbon and nitrogen source, presumably as a result of adaptation to the hitherto unknown habitat on the human skin. Plasmid pJA144188 harbors several genes contributing to antibiotic resistance of C. resistens DSM 45100, including a tetracycline resistance region of the Tet W type known from Lactobacillus reuteri and Streptococcus suis. The tet(W) gene of pJA144188 was cloned in Corynebacterium glutamicum and was shown to confer high levels of resistance to tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: The detected gene repertoire of C. resistens DSM 45100 provides insights into the lipophilic lifestyle and virulence functions of this newly recognized pathogen. Plasmid pJA144188 revealed a modular architecture of gene regions that contribute to the multi-drug resistance of C. resistens DSM 45100.

These patients, classified as having F/P (+) chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), present with clonal eosinophilia and display a more aggressive disease phenotype than patients with F/P (-) HES patients. The mechanisms underlying predominant eosinophil lineage targeting and the cytotoxicity of eosinophils in this leukemia remain unclear. Given that the Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) signaling pathway is key to cytokine receptor-mediated eosinophil development and activated Stat3 and Stat5 regulate the expression of genes involved in F/P malignant transformation, we investigated whether and how JAK proteins were involved in the pathogenesis of F/P-induced CEL. F/P activation of JAK2, Stat3 and Stat5, were confirmed in all the 11 F/P (+) CEL patients examined. In vitro inhibition of JAK2 in EOL-1, primary F/P(+) CEL cells (PC) and T674I F/P Imatinib resistant cells(IR) by either JAK2-specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) or the tryphostin derivative AG490(AG490), significantly reduced cellular proliferation and induced cellular apoptosis. The F/P can enhance the IL-5-induced JAK2 activation, and further results indicated that JAK2 inhibition blocked IL-5-induced cellular migration and activation of the EOL-1 and PC cells in vitro. F/P-stimulation of the JAK2 suppressed cells led to a significantly reduction in Stat3 activation, but relatively normal induction of Stat5 activation. Interestingly, JAK2 inhibition also reduced PI3K, Akt and NF-kappaB activity in a dose-dependent manner, and suppressed expression levels of c-Myc and Survivin. These results strongly suggest that JAK2 is activated by F/P and is required for F/P stimulation of cellular proliferation and infiltration, possibly through induction of c-Myc and Survivin expression via activation of multiple signaling pathways, including NF-kappaB, Stat3, and PI3K/Akt.","['Li, Bin', 'Zhang, Guangsen', 'Li, Cui', 'He, Dan', 'Li, Xinying', 'Zhang, Chunfang', 'Tang, Faqing', 'Deng, Xiyun', 'Lu, Jingchen', 'Tang, Youhong', 'Li, Ruijuan', 'Chen, Zhuchu', 'Duan, Chaojun']","['Li B', 'Zhang G', 'Li C', 'He D', 'Li X', 'Zhang C', 'Tang F', 'Deng X', 'Lu J', 'Tang Y', 'Li R', 'Chen Z', 'Duan C']","[""Key Laboratory of Cancer Proteomics of Chinese Ministry of Health, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120416,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Eosinophils/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/enzymology/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interleukin-5/physiology', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*physiology', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/*physiology']",2012/04/24 06:00,2012/08/04 06:00,['2012/04/24 06:00'],"['2011/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0034912 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-17321 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e34912. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0034912.

Both towns have industrial tungsten facilities, but only Fallon has experienced a cluster of childhood leukemia. Fallon and Sweet Home are similar to one another by their particles of airborne tungsten being generally small in size. Meteorologically, much, if not most, of residential Fallon is downwind of its hard metal facility for at least some fraction of time at the annual scale, whereas little of residential Sweet Home is downwind of its tungsten facility. Geographically, most Fallon residents potentially spend time daily within an environment containing elevated levels of airborne tungsten. In contrast, few Sweet Home residents potentially spend time daily within an airborne environment with elevated levels of airborne tungsten. Although it cannot be concluded from environmental data alone that elevated airborne tungsten causes childhood leukemia, the lack of excessive cancer in Sweet Home cannot logically be used to dismiss the possibility of airborne tungsten as a factor in the cluster of childhood leukemia in Fallon.

We now report that TGHQ induces severe DNA damage, as evidenced by DNA ladder formation and H2AX phosphorylation. The subsequent activation of the DNA nick sensor enzyme, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), leads to the rapid depletion of ATP and NAD and the concomitant formation of poly(ADP-ribosylated) proteins (PARs). PJ-34 (a PARP-1 inhibitor) completely prevented the formation of PARs, partially attenuated TGHQ-mediated ATP depletion, but had little effect on NAD depletion. Intriguingly, although z-vad-fmk (a pan-caspase inhibitor) attenuated TGHQ-induced apoptosis, cotreatment with PJ-34 led to a further decrease in apoptosis, suggesting that PARP-1 participates in caspase-dependent apoptosis. Indeed, PARP-1 inhibition reduced TGHQ-induced caspase-3, -7, and -9 activation, at least partially by attenuating cytochrome c translocation from mitochondria to the cytoplasm. In contrast, PJ-34 potentiated TGHQ-induced caspase-8 activation, suggesting that PARP-1 plays a dual role in regulating TGHQ-induced apoptosis via opposing effects on the intrinsic (mitochondrial) and extrinsic (death-receptor) pathways. PARP-1 knockdown in HL-60 cells confirmed that PARP-1 participates in effector caspase activation. Finally, PJ-34 also inhibited TGHQ-induced apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) nuclear translocation, but neither c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase nor p38 MAPK (p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase) activation was required for AIF translocation. In summary, TGHQ-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells is accompanied by PARP-1, caspase activation, and AIF nuclear translocation. TGHQ-induced apoptosis appears to primarily occur via engagement of the mitochondrial-mediated pathway in a process amenable to PARP inhibition. Residual cell death in the presence of PJ-34 is likely mediated via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.","['Zhang, Fengjiao', 'Lau, Serrine S', 'Monks, Terrence J']","['Zhang F', 'Lau SS', 'Monks TJ']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona Health Sciences Center, Tucson, Arizona 85721, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120420,United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,"['0 (Hydroquinones)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '119212-33-8 (2,3,5-(triglutathion-S-yl)hydroquinone)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Curcumin/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glutathione/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/pharmacology', 'NAD/metabolism', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*metabolism']",2012/04/24 06:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/04/24 06:00'],"['2012/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['kfs142 [pii]', '10.1093/toxsci/kfs142 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2012 Jul;128(1):103-14. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kfs142.

METHODS: The data sources were the Croatian National Cancer Registry for incidence data, Croatian Bureau of Statistics for the numbers of deaths, and United Nations population estimates. Joinpoint regression analysis using the age-standardized rates was used to analyze incidence and mortality trends. RESULTS: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia incidence did not significantly change. Acute myeloid leukemia incidence significantly increased in women, with estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) of 2.6% during the whole period, and in men since 1998, with EAPC of 3.2%. Chronic myeloid leukemia incidence significantly decreased in women (EAPC -3.7%) and remained stable in men. Mortality rates were stable for both lymphoid and myeloid leukemia in both sexes. Hodgkin lymphoma non-significantly increased in incidence and significantly decreased in mortality (EAPCs of -5.6% in men and -3.7% in women). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma significantly increased in incidence in women (EAPC 3.2%) and non-significantly in men and in mortality in both men (EAPC 1.6%) and women (EAPC 1.8%). CONCLUSION: While Croatia had similar leukemia and lymphoma incidence trends as the other countries, the mortality trends were less favorable than in Western Europe. The lack of declines of leukemia incidence and non-Hodgkin lymphoma mortality could be attributed to late introduction of optimal therapies. As currently the most up-to-date diagnostics and treatments are available and covered by health insurance, we expect more favorable trends in the future.","['Novak, Ina', 'Jaksic, Ozren', 'Kulis, Tomislav', 'Batinjan, Katarina', 'Znaor, Ariana']","['Novak I', 'Jaksic O', 'Kulis T', 'Batinjan K', 'Znaor A']","['Croatian National Institute of Public Health, Rockefellerova 7, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Croatia,Croat Med J,Croatian medical journal,9424324,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child, Preschool', 'Croatia/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Young Adult']",2012/04/24 06:00,2012/09/26 06:00,['2012/04/24 06:00'],"['2012/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3325/cmj.2012.53.115 [doi]'],ppublish,Croat Med J. 2012 Apr;53(2):115-23. doi: 10.3325/cmj.2012.53.115.,,,PMC3342656,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) accumulation displayed specific signatures in acute myeloblastic and acute lymphoblastic leukemias. Using microarrays and high-throughput quantitative PCR (qPCR), we demonstrate here that snoRNA expression patterns are negatively altered in leukemic cells compared with controls. Interestingly, a specific signature was found in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with ectopic expression of SNORD112-114 snoRNAs located at the DLK1-DIO3 locus. In vitro experiments carried out on APL blasts demonstrate that transcription of these snoRNAs was lost under all-trans retinoic acid-mediated differentiation and induced by enforced expression of the PML-RARalpha fusion protein in negative leukemic cell lines. Further experiments revealed that the SNORD114-1 (14q(II-1)) variant promoted cell growth through cell cycle modulation; its expression was implicated in the G0/G1 to S phase transition mediated by the Rb/p16 pathways. This study thus reports three important observations: (1) snoRNA regulation is different in normal cells compared with cancer cells; (2) a relationship exists between a chromosomal translocation and expression of snoRNA loci; and (3) snoRNA expression can affect Rb/p16 cell cycle regulation. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that snoRNAs have a role in cancer development.","['Valleron, W', 'Laprevotte, E', 'Gautier, E-F', 'Quelen, C', 'Demur, C', 'Delabesse, E', 'Agirre, X', 'Prosper, F', 'Kiss, T', 'Brousset, P']","['Valleron W', 'Laprevotte E', 'Gautier EF', 'Quelen C', 'Demur C', 'Delabesse E', 'Agirre X', 'Prosper F', 'Kiss T', 'Brousset P']","['INSERM UMR1037-Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, University of Toulouse III, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120423,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DLK1 protein, human)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Nucleolar)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Blast Crisis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Nucleolar/*genetics/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/04/24 06:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/04/24 06:00'],"['2012/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012111 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.111 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Sep;26(9):2052-60. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.111.

We show that the inhibition of STAT5A expression or activity in the NALM6, 697 and Reh leukemic pre-B cell lines, results in a higher spontaneous apoptosis and an increased FAS-induced cell death. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the altered pre-B cell survival are unclear. We used a proteomic approach to identify proteins that are differentially regulated in cells expressing (NALM6Delta5A) or not a dominant negative form of STAT5A. Among the 14 proteins identified, six were involved in the control of the oxidative stress like glutathione (GSH) synthetase and DJ-1. Accordingly, we showed increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in NALM6Delta5A cells and suppression of the increased sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis by the GSH tripeptide.

Micro-size silica is well documented to induce hemolysis, but little is known about the hemolytic activities of nanostructured silica materials. In this study, the hemolytic properties of synthetic amorphous silica nanoparticles with primary sizes of 7-14 nm (hydrophilic vs. hydrophobic), 5-15 nm, 20 nm and 50 nm, and model meso/macroporous silica particles with pore diameters of 40 nm and 170 nm are investigated. A crystalline silica sample (0.5-10 mum) is included for benchmarking purposes. Special emphasis is given to investigations of how the temperature and solution complexity (solvent, plasma), as well as the physicochemical properties (such as size, surface charge, hydrophobicity and other surface properties), link to the hemolytic activities of these particles. Results suggests the potential importance of small size and large external surface area, as well as surface charge/structure, in the hemolysis of silica particles. Furthermore, a significant correlation is observed between the hemolytic profile of red blood cells and the cytotoxicity profile of human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) induced by nano- and porous silica particles, suggesting a potential universal mechanism of action. Importantly, the results generated suggest that the protective effect of plasma towards silica nanoparticle-induced hemolysis as well as cytotoxicity is primarily due to the protein/lipid layer shielding the silica particle surface. These results will assist the rational design of hemocompatible silica particles for biomedical applications.","['Shi, J', 'Hedberg, Y', 'Lundin, M', 'Odnevall Wallinder, I', 'Karlsson, H L', 'Moller, L']","['Shi J', 'Hedberg Y', 'Lundin M', 'Odnevall Wallinder I', 'Karlsson HL', 'Moller L']","['Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institutet, 141 83 Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120420,England,Acta Biomater,Acta biomaterialia,101233144,"['0 (Plasma Gases)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)']",IM,"['HL-60 Cells', '*Hemolysis', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', '*Nanoparticles', '*Plasma Gases', 'Silicon Dioxide/*chemistry', 'Surface Properties', 'X-Ray Diffraction']",2012/04/24 06:00,2012/12/12 06:00,['2012/04/24 06:00'],"['2011/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S1742-7061(12)00171-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.actbio.2012.04.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Biomater. 2012 Sep;8(9):3478-90. doi: 10.1016/j.actbio.2012.04.024.

However, the major limitation of SIH is represented by its labile hydrazone bond that makes it prone to plasma hydrolysis. Recently, nine new SIH analogues derived from aromatic ketones with improved hydrolytic stability were developed. Here we analyzed their antiproliferative potential in MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma and HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell lines. Seven of the tested substances showed greater selectivity than the parent agent SIH towards the latter cancer cell lines compared to non-cancerous H9c2 cardiomyoblast-derived cells. The tested chelators induced a dose-dependent dissipation of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential, an induction of apoptosis as evidenced by Annexin V positivity or significant increases of activities of caspases 3, 7, 8 and 9 and cell cycle arrest. With the exception of nitro group-bearing NHAPI, the studies of iron complexes of the chelators confirmed the crucial role of iron in the mechanism of their antiproliferative action. Finally, all the assayed chelators inhibited the oxidation of ascorbate by iron ions indicating lack of redox activity of the chelator-iron complexes. In conclusion, this study identified several important design criteria for improvement of the antiproliferative selectivity of the aroylhydrazone iron chelators. Several of the novel compounds--in particular the ethylketone-derived HPPI, NHAPI and acetyl-substituted A2,4DHAPI--merit deeper investigation as promising potent and selective anticancer agents.","['Mackova, Eliska', 'Hruskova, Katerina', 'Bendova, Petra', 'Vavrova, Anna', 'Jansova, Hana', 'Haskova, Pavlina', 'Kovarikova, Petra', 'Vavrova, Katerina', 'Simunek, Tomas']","['Mackova E', 'Hruskova K', 'Bendova P', 'Vavrova A', 'Jansova H', 'Haskova P', 'Kovarikova P', 'Vavrova K', 'Simunek T']","['Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Pharmacy in Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120411,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hydrazones)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Ketones)', '0 (salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Aldehydes/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Ascorbic Acid/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrazones/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Iron Chelating Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Ketones/chemistry', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Oxidation-Reduction']",2012/04/24 06:00,2012/08/14 06:00,['2012/04/24 06:00'],"['2011/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/13 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(12)00062-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2012.03.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2012 May 30;197(2-3):69-79. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2012.03.010.

Dasatinib and imatinib are two of the most commonly used tyrosine kinase inhibitors and both have been shown to impact T-cell function. Due to this activity, their use as potential immune suppressants has been proposed. In this report, we investigated drug interactions with cyclosporine A in suppressing T-cell proliferation. Dasatinib and imatinib were titrated against varying concentrations of cyclosporine in the cultures and T-cell proliferation assessed by 5-6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester dye dilution. These proliferation data were then used to determine the combination index to evaluate additive, synergistic, or antagonistic interactions between the drugs. This analysis uncovered a number of different drug interactions affecting T-cell proliferation. Cyclosporine had an additive or synergistic effect on T-cell proliferation when combined with dasatinib and imatinib for 3 of the 4 methods of stimulating T-cell proliferation. However, when T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, this interaction was found to be strongly antagonistic at low dasatinib concentrations. In contrast, this strong antagonism was not observed when imatinib was used in combination with cyclosporine A. This study suggests drug interactions affecting T cells may need to be carefully taken into account when using tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, the technique to evaluate drug interactions is novel, and applicable to study any interaction affecting proliferation.","['Blake, Stephen J', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Lyons, A Bruce']","['Blake SJ', 'Hughes TP', 'Lyons AB']","['Department of Haematology, SA Pathology, RAH Campus, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120419,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'CD28 Antigens/immunology', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'Cyclosporine/*administration & dosage', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Thiazoles/*administration & dosage']",2012/04/24 06:00,2012/10/02 06:00,['2012/04/24 06:00'],"['2012/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(12)00137-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2012.04.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2012 Aug;40(8):612-21.e6. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2012.04.003.

The diagnosis of B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia was considered clinically based on a markedly elevated leukocyte (up to 131.5x10(9)/L) or prolymphocyte (up to 86%) count. Splenectomy was performed in all patients, and spleen weight ranged from 1500 to 2380 g. In 3 patients, the neoplasms were classified as splenic marginal zone lymphoma, and in 1 patient, the neoplasm was classified as splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma. In 2 patients, splenectomy preceded a B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia-like picture, and the spleen showed splenic marginal zone lymphoma or splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma with increased (10%-20%) nucleolated cells consistent with prolymphocytes. In the other 2 patients, a B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia-like picture prompted splenectomy. Initial examination of bone marrow in these patients suggested splenic marginal zone lymphoma. The spleen specimens showed extensive involvement by splenic marginal zone lymphoma with numerous prolymphocytes. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping in all cases showed lymphocytes positive for monotypic surface immunoglobulin (bright), pan-B-cell antigens, CD11c, CD22, and FMC7.

The objective of this study was to describe overall and type-specific cancer incidence and mortality trends among AYAs in Western Australia from 1982-2007. METHODS: Age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates were calculated for all malignancies combined and for each of the most common diagnostic groups, using five-year age-specific rates. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to derive annual percentage changes (APC) for incidence and mortality rates. RESULTS: The annual incidence rate for all cancers combined increased in males from 1982 until 2000 (APC = 1.5%, 95%CI: 0.9%; 2.1%) and then plateaued, whilst rates for females remained stable across the study period (APC = -0.1%; 95%CI: -0.2%; 0.4%) across the study period. For males, significant incidence rate increases were observed for germ cell tumors, lymphoblastic leukemia and thyroid cancer. In females, the incidence of Hodgkin's lymphoma, colorectal and breast cancers increased. Significant incidence rate reductions were noted for cervical, central nervous system and lung cancers. Mortality rates for all cancers combined decreased from 1982 to 2005 for both males (APC = -2.6%, 95%CI:-3.3%;-2.0%) and females (APC = -4.6%, 95%CI:-5.1%;-4.1%). With the exception of bone sarcoma and lung cancer in females, mortality rates for specific cancer types decreased significantly for both sexes during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of certain AYA cancers increased, whilst it decreased for others. Mortality rates decreased for most cancers, with the largest improvement observed for breast carcinomas. Further research is needed to identify the reasons for the increasing incidence of certain cancers.","['Haggar, Fatima A', 'Preen, David B', 'Pereira, Gavin', 'Holman, Cashel D J', 'Einarsdottir, Kristjana']","['Haggar FA', 'Preen DB', 'Pereira G', 'Holman CD', 'Einarsdottir K']","['School of Population Health, Centre for Health Services Research, The University of Western Australia, Crawley, Australia. fhaggar@toh.on.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120420,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors', 'Young Adult']",2012/04/24 06:00,2012/12/22 06:00,['2012/04/24 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-12-151 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-12-151 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2012 Apr 20;12:151. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-12-151.,,,PMC3404933,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective was to evaluate the role of the endometrial expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and its glycoprotein 130 (gp130) receptor molecules and their secretion in uterine flushing during the window of implantation in cases of primary unexplained infertility CASE PRESENTATION: The study was conducted on 25 infertile women with unexplained infertility for at least two years and 10 normal fertile women as a control group . Endometrial tissue and uterine flushing were obtained. Each tissue specimen was divided into two pieces; one piece was used for histological dating of the endometrium and for immunostaining of progesterone receptors, and the second was used for RNA extraction and PCR assay of LIF and gp130 mRNA expression. Serum estrogen and progesterone were measured for all subjects. LIF mRNA was expressed in the endometrium of all normal fertile women but significantly decreased in infertile women. LIF was not detectable in 88% of infertile women while it was fairly detectable in 12% of them. Gp130 mRNA was hardly detectable in both fertile and infertile women with no difference between them. Infertile women secreted significantly less LIF and gp130 molecules in the uterine flushing compared with normal fertile women. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of LIF mRNA in endometrium could be used as a molecular marker of unexplained infertility. Assessment of secreted LIF and gp130 molecules in uterine flushing could be another useful and safe method for predicting successful implantation as well as for diagnosing and eventually treating women with impaired fertility using recombinant human LIF.","['Tawfeek, Manal A', 'Eid, Manal A', 'Hasan, Azza M', 'Mostafa, Manal', 'El-Serogy, Hesham A']","['Tawfeek MA', 'Eid MA', 'Hasan AM', 'Mostafa M', 'El-Serogy HA']","['Faculty of Medicine, Department of Clinical Pathology, Tanta University, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120420,England,BMC Womens Health,BMC women's health,101088690,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (glycoprotein 130, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Endometrium/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/*etiology/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Therapeutic Irrigation']",2012/04/24 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/04/24 06:00'],"['2011/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1472-6874-12-10 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6874-12-10 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Womens Health. 2012 Apr 20;12:10. doi: 10.1186/1472-6874-12-10.,,,PMC3448518,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two-hundred and seventy-five patients enrolled in the CETLAM 2003 protocol were analyzed. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were investigated by well-established melting curve-analysis and direct sequencing (R140 IDH2 mutations). To establish the percentage of the mutated allele a pyrosequencing method was used. Patients were also studied for NPM, FLT3, MLL, CEBPA, TET2 and WT1 mutations. IDH1 or IDH2 mutations were identified in 23.3% AML cases and in 22.5% of those with a normal karyotype. In this latter group, mutations were associated with short overall survival. This adverse effect was even more evident in patients with the NPM or CEBPA mutated/FLT3 wt genotype. In all the cases analyzed, the normal allele was detected, suggesting that both mutations act as dominant oncogenes. No adverse clinical impact was observed in cases with TET2 mutations.

While the currently available therapies have good systemic effects, they only minimally affect the neurodegenerative process. Based on the neuroprotective and tissue regenerative properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), we hypothesized that the administration of MSCs transduced with a murine leukemia virus (MLV) vector expressing IDUA to IDUA KO mouse brains could reduce GAG deposition in the brain and, as a result, improve neurofunctionality, as measured by exploratory activity. METHODS: MSCs infected with an MLV vector encoding IDUA were injected into the left ventricle of the brain of 12- or 25-month-old IDUA KO mice. The behavior of the treated mice in the elevated plus maze and open field tests was observed for 1 to 2 months. Following these observations, the brains were removed for biochemical and histological analyses. RESULTS: After 1 or 2 months of observation, the presence of the transgene in the brain tissue of almost all of the treated mice was confirmed using PCR, and a significant reduction in GAG deposition was observed. This reduction was directly reflected in an improvement in exploratory activity in the open field and the elevated plus maze tests. Despite these behavioral improvements and the reduction in GAG deposition, IDUA activity was undetectable in these samples. Overall, these results indicate that while the initial level of IDUA was not sustainable for a month, it was enough to reduce and maintain low GAG deposition and improve the exploratory activity for months. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that gene therapy, via the direct injection of IDUA-expressing MSCs into the brain, is an effective way to treat neurodegeneration in MPSI mice.","['da Silva, Flavia Helena', 'Pereira, Vanessa Goncalves', 'Yasumura, Eduardo G', 'Tenorio, Ligia Zacchi', 'de Carvalho, Leonardo Pinto', 'Lisboa, Bianca Cristina Garcia', 'Matsumoto, Priscila Keiko', 'Stilhano, Roberta Sessa', 'Samoto, Vivian Y', 'Calegare, Bruno Frederico Aguilar', 'Brandao, Leticia de Campos', ""D'Almeida, Vania"", 'Filippo, Thais Rm', 'Porcionatto, Marimelia', 'Toma, Leny', 'Nader, Helena Bonciani', 'Valero, Valderez Bastos', 'Camassola, Melissa', 'Nardi, Nance Beyer', 'Han, Sang Won']","['da Silva FH', 'Pereira VG', 'Yasumura EG', 'Tenorio LZ', 'de Carvalho LP', 'Lisboa BC', 'Matsumoto PK', 'Stilhano RS', 'Samoto VY', 'Calegare BF', 'Brandao Lde C', ""D'Almeida V"", 'Filippo TR', 'Porcionatto M', 'Toma L', 'Nader HB', 'Valero VB', 'Camassola M', 'Nardi NB', 'Han SW']","['Research center for gene therapy, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil. sang.han@unifesp.br.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120420,England,Genet Vaccines Ther,Genetic vaccines and therapy,101178414,,,,2012/04/24 06:00,2012/04/24 06:01,['2012/04/24 06:00'],"['2012/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/24 06:01 [medline]']","['1479-0556-10-2 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-0556-10-2 [doi]']",epublish,Genet Vaccines Ther. 2012 Apr 20;10(1):2. doi: 10.1186/1479-0556-10-2.,,,PMC3404940,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: In a retrospective registry analysis, we compared the use of blood stem cells (n = 1502) and BM (n = 760) from unrelated donors in patients aged 18-60 years with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) undergoing myeloablative conditioning between 1997 and 2008. The blood stem cell recipients were older (P < 0.01), had more advanced disease (P < 0.0001) and received less total body irradiation (P < 0.0001) and more antithymocyte globulin (P = 0.01). RESULTS: Recovery of neutrophils and platelets was faster with blood stem cells (P < 0.0001). The incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was similar, but there was more chronic GVHD in the blood stem cell group [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.29, P = 0.02]. There were no significant differences in nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse incidence and leukaemia-free survival (LFS) between the two groups amongst patients with AML in remission. In patients with advanced leukaemia, NRM was lower (HR = 0.61, P = 0.02) and LFS was prolonged (HR = 0.67, P = 0.002) when blood stem cells were used. At 3 years, LFS for all patients, regardless of remission status, was 41% for both treatment groups. The outcome was not affected after multivariable analysis adjusted for confounders. CONCLUSION: Blood stem cells compared with BM in MUD transplantation for patients with AML in remission resulted in the same rates of LFS. In patients with advanced leukaemia, the blood stem cell group had reduced NRM and improved LFS.","['Ringden, O', 'Labopin, M', 'Beelen, D W', 'Volin, L', 'Ehninger, G', 'Finke, J', 'Greinix, H T', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien, S', 'Bunjes, D', 'Brinch, L', 'Niederwieser, D', 'Arnold, R', 'Mohty, M', 'Rocha, V']","['Ringden O', 'Labopin M', 'Beelen DW', 'Volin L', 'Ehninger G', 'Finke J', 'Greinix HT', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien S', 'Bunjes D', 'Brinch L', 'Niederwieser D', 'Arnold R', 'Mohty M', 'Rocha V']","['Center for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden. olle.ringden@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120521,England,J Intern Med,Journal of internal medicine,8904841,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cells', '*Unrelated Donors', 'Young Adult']",2012/04/24 06:00,2013/01/11 06:00,['2012/04/24 06:00'],"['2012/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2796.2012.02547.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Intern Med. 2012 Nov;272(5):472-83. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2796.2012.02547.x.

In this study, we provided in vitro evidence that As(2)O(3) was a potent inducer of autophagy in leukemia K562 and its drug-resistant line K562/ADM cells. As(2)O(3) significantly activated autophagic cell death (programmed cell death type II) in leukemia cell lines. Numerous large cytoplasmic inclusions, abundant autophagic vacuoles, phagocytizing cytoplasm and organelles were observed in As(2)O(3)-treated cells using electron microscope. MDC-labeled autophagic vacuoles were observed by fluorescent inverted phase contrast microscopy and the enhanced MDC fluorescent staining was detected by flow cytometry in As(2)O(3)-treated cells. Furthermore, real-time quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the expression levels of Beclin-1 and LC3 genes, which play key roles in autophagy, increased in As(2)O(3) treated samples than in controls, indicating that autophagy can potentially be involved in the antitumor properties of As(2)O(3). The expression level of Bcl-2 gene, an anti-apoptotic molecule, decreased in As(2)O(3) treated samples than in controls, suggesting that Bcl-2 may be involved in accumulating Beclin-1 and triggering autophagic cell death in As(2)O(3)-treated leukemia cells. Western blotting also showed that As(2)O(3) up-regulated Beclin-1. Altogether, our data provide direct evidence that autophagic cell death is critical for the effects of As(2)O(3) on acute myelogenous leukemia cells.","['Cheng, Juan', 'Wei, Hu-Lai', 'Chen, Jing', 'Xie, Bei']","['Cheng J', 'Wei HL', 'Chen J', 'Xie B']","['School of Basic Medical Sciences, Lanzhou University, Key Laboratory of Preclinical Study for New Drugs of Gansu Province, Lanzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120522,England,Toxicol Mech Methods,Toxicology mechanisms and methods,101134521,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (MAP1LC3A protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Autophagy/*drug effects/genetics', 'Beclin-1', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Microscopy, Phase-Contrast', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vacuoles/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure']",2012/04/24 06:00,2013/01/15 06:00,['2012/04/24 06:00'],"['2012/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/15376516.2012.686534 [doi]'],ppublish,Toxicol Mech Methods. 2012 Sep;22(7):512-9. doi: 10.3109/15376516.2012.686534.

Targeted therapy with TKIs has continued to be an area of active research and development in the care of acute and chronic leukemia patients. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews current approved and investigational TKI treatments for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), Philadelphia-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph + ALL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). EXPERT OPINION: There are now more potent BCR-ABL TKIs approved, which allow for additional options when determining front-line and second-line CML and Ph + ALL treatments. The T315I mutation is an ever-present challenge. Ponatinib, a pan BCR-ABL TKI, while still under investigation, is very hopeful with its ability to overcome T315I mutations in resistant CML and Ph + ALL patients. Because nilotinib and dasatinib have not been directly compared, at present we recommend selecting one or the other based on the side-effect profile, drug interactions, patient comorbidities, and mutational status. FLT-3 inhibition is of particular interest in AML patients with FLT-3 internal tandem duplication mutations; this type of targeted therapy continues to be studied.","['Ohanian, Maro', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Jabbour, Elias']","['Ohanian M', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H', 'Jabbour E']","['The University of Texas, M.

We aimed to estimate the relevance of plasma LIGHT levels as a biomarker for atopic dermatitis (AD). In order to understand the putative role of LIGHT in AD pathogenesis, we also investigate the effects of LIGHT on a monocytic cell line, human acute monocytic leukaemia cell line (THP-1). We examined plasma LIGHT levels, total serum IgE, serum value of CCL17 and peripheral blood eosinophil counts in patients with AD and healthy subjects. The effects of LIGHT on activation and apoptosis in THP-1 cells were also investigated. The plasma concentrations of LIGHT in AD patients were significantly higher than those in healthy individuals and the concentrations decreased as the symptoms were improved by treatment. The LIGHT plasma concentrations correlated with IgE levels and the Severity Scoring of AD (SCORAD) index. In addition, LIGHT stimulation increased expression of CD86 and induced production of interleukin-1beta in THP-1 cells. Apoptosis was inhibited, the Bcl-2 level increased and the caspase-3 level decreased in THP-1 cells stimulated with LIGHT, compared to unstimulated control cells. These results suggest that plasma LIGHT levels may be one of the promising biomarkers for AD.","['Kotani, H', 'Masuda, K', 'Tamagawa-Mineoka, R', 'Nomiyama, T', 'Soga, F', 'Nin, M', 'Asai, J', 'Kishimoto, S', 'Katoh, N']","['Kotani H', 'Masuda K', 'Tamagawa-Mineoka R', 'Nomiyama T', 'Soga F', 'Nin M', 'Asai J', 'Kishimoto S', 'Katoh N']","['Department of Dermatology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Chemokine CCL17)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 14)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B7-2 Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CCL17/blood', 'Dermatitis, Atopic/*blood/*immunology', 'Disease Progression', 'Eosinophils/*drug effects/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/blood', 'Interleukin-1beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 14/*blood/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation', 'Young Adult']",2012/04/24 06:00,2012/06/21 06:00,['2012/04/24 06:00'],"['2012/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2249.2012.04576.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2012 Jun;168(3):318-24. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2249.2012.04576.x.,"['(c) 2012 The Authors.

The event-free survival for pediatric leukemia in low-income Countries is much lower than in high-income countries. Late diagnosis, which is regarded as a contributing factor, may be due to ""parental"" or ""medical"" delay. Procedures. The present study analyses determinants of lag time from first symptoms to diagnosis of leukemia, comparing pediatric (0-16 years old) patients in two referral centers, one in Nicaragua and one in Italy. An observational retrospective study was conducted to assess factors influencing the time to diagnosis. Results. 81 charts of children diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia or lymphoblastic leukemia were analyzed from each centre. Median lag time to diagnosis was higher in Nicaragua than in Italy (29 versus 14 days, P < 0.001) and it was mainly due to ""physician delay"" (16.5 versus 7 days, P < 0.001), whereas ""patient delay"" from symptoms to first medical assessment was similar in the two centers (7 versus 5 days, P = 0.27). Moreover, median lag time from symptoms to diagnosis was decreased in Nicaraguan districts were a specific training program upon childhood oncological diseases was carried out (20.5 versus 40 days, P = 0.0019). Conclusions. Our study shows that delay in diagnosis of childhood leukemia is mainly associated with ""physician delay"" and it may be overcome by programs of continuous medical education.","['De Angelis, C', 'Pacheco, C', 'Lucchini, G', 'Arguello, M', 'Conter, V', 'Flores, A', 'Biondi, A', 'Masera, G', 'Baez, F']","['De Angelis C', 'Pacheco C', 'Lucchini G', 'Arguello M', 'Conter V', 'Flores A', 'Biondi A', 'Masera G', 'Baez F']","['Pediatric Department, San Gerardo Hospital and University of Milano Bicocca, via Pergolesi 33, 20900 Monza (MB), Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120212,Egypt,Int J Pediatr,International journal of pediatrics,101517077,,,,2012/04/21 06:00,2012/04/21 06:01,['2012/04/21 06:00'],"['2011/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2011/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2012/129707 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Pediatr. 2012;2012:129707. doi: 10.1155/2012/129707.

However, it is now established that these cytokines play an important role in orchestrating both innate and adaptive immunity. Multiple studies have investigated the effects of both types I and II IFN on GVHD and GVL in preclinical transplant models. The results indicate variable effects that are dependent on the period of activity within the developing immune response, the presence and type of pretransplant conditioning and the differential mechanisms, and IFN sensitivity of immune pathology within individual target organs during GVHD.

It is unclear how leukemic blasts escape cytokine control that regulates normal hematopoiesis. We have recently demonstrated that FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD), when localized to the biosynthetic compartment, aberrantly activates STAT5. Here, we show that one of the target genes induced by STAT5 is suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)1-a surprising finding for a known tumor suppressor. Although SOCS1 expression in murine bone marrow severely impaired cytokine-induced colony growth, it failed to inhibit FLT3-ITD-supported colony growth, indicating resistance of FLT3-ITD to SOCS1. In addition, SOCS1 coexpression did not affect FLT3-ITD-mediated signaling or proliferation. Importantly, SOCS1 coexpression inhibited interferon-alpha and interferon-gamma signaling and protected FLT3-ITD hematopoietic cells from interferon-mediated growth inhibitory effects. In a murine bone marrow transplantation model, the coexpression of SOCS1 and FLT3-ITD significantly shortened the latency of a myeloproliferative disease compared with FLT3-ITD alone (P < .01). Mechanistically, SOCS proteins shield FLT3-ITD from external cytokine control, thereby promoting leukemogenesis. The data demonstrate that SOCS1 acts as a conditional oncogene, providing novel molecular insights into cytokine resistance in oncogenic transformation. Restoring cytokine control may provide a new way of therapeutic intervention.","['Reddy, Pavankumar N G', 'Sargin, Bulent', 'Choudhary, Chunaram', 'Stein, Stefan', 'Grez, Manuel', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Brandts, Christian H']","['Reddy PN', 'Sargin B', 'Choudhary C', 'Stein S', 'Grez M', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Berdel WE', 'Serve H', 'Brandts CH']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120419,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Socs1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Duplication', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/immunology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/immunology']",2012/04/21 06:00,2012/11/01 06:00,['2012/04/21 06:00'],"['2012/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49108-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-08-301416 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Aug 23;120(8):1691-702. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-08-301416.

APL blasts overexpress annexin II (ANXII), a receptor for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and plasminogen, thereby increasing plasmin generation. Previous studies suggested that ANXII plays a pivotal role in APL coagulopathy. ANXII binding to tPA can be inhibited by homocysteine and hyperhomocysteinemia can be induced by L-methionine supplementation. In the present study, we used an APL mouse model to study ANXII function and the effects of hyperhomocysteinemia in vivo. Leukemic cells expressed higher ANXII and tPA plasma levels (11.95 ng/mL in leukemic vs 10.74 ng/mL in wild-type; P = .004). In leukemic mice, administration of L-methionine significantly increased homocysteine levels (49.0 mumol/mL and < 6.0 mumol/mL in the treated and nontreated groups, respectively) and reduced tPA levels to baseline concentrations. The latter were also decreased after infusion of the LCKLSL peptide, a competitor for the ANXII tPA-binding site (11.07 ng/mL; P = .001).

However, the level of MRD that is most likely to preclude cure by HCT is unclear, and the benefit of further chemotherapy to reduce MRD before HCT is unknown. In 122 children with very-high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n = 64) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 58), higher MRD levels at the time of HCT predicted a poorer survival after HCT (P = .0019); MRD was an independent prognostic factor in a multivariate analysis (P = .0035). However, the increase in risk of death associated with a similar increment of MRD was greater in ALL than in AML, suggesting that a pretransplantation reduction of leukemia burden would have a higher impact in ALL. At any given MRD level, survival rates were higher for patients treated in recent protocols: the 5-year overall survival for patients with ALL was 49% if MRD was detectable and 88% if it was not and the corresponding rates for patients with AML were 67% and 80%, respectively. Although MRD before HCT is a strong prognostic factor, its impact has diminished and should not be regarded as a contraindication for HCT.","['Leung, Wing', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Coustan-Smith, Elaine', 'Yang, Jie', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Gan, Kwan', 'Srinivasan, Ashok', 'Hartford, Christine', 'Triplett, Brandon M', 'Dallas, Mari', 'Pillai, Asha', 'Shook, David', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Sandlund, John T', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Inaba, Hiroto', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Laver, Joseph H', 'Campana, Dario']","['Leung W', 'Pui CH', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Yang J', 'Pei D', 'Gan K', 'Srinivasan A', 'Hartford C', 'Triplett BM', 'Dallas M', 'Pillai A', 'Shook D', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Sandlund JT', 'Jeha S', 'Inaba H', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Handgretinger R', 'Laver JH', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Pl, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA. wing.leung@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120419,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Contraindications', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2012/04/21 06:00,2012/09/27 06:00,['2012/04/21 06:00'],"['2012/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47555-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-02-409813 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jul 12;120(2):468-72. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-02-409813.

Approximately 80%-90% of 5-azaC is believed to be incorporated into RNA, which disrupts nucleic acid and protein metabolism leading to apoptosis. A smaller fraction (10%-20%) of 5-azaC inhibits DNA methylation and synthesis through conversion to decitabine triphosphate and subsequent DNA incorporation. However, its precise mechanism of action remains unclear. Ribonucleotide reductase (RR) is a highly regulated enzyme comprising 2 subunits, RRM1 and RRM2, that provides the deoxyribonucleotides required for DNA synthesis/repair. In the present study, we found for the first time that 5-azaC is a potent inhibitor of RRM2 in leukemia cell lines, in a mouse model, and in BM mononuclear cells from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. 5-azaC-induced RRM2 gene expression inhibition involves its direct RNA incorporation and an attenuated RRM2 mRNA stability. Therefore, 5-azaC causes a major perturbation of deoxyribonucleotide pools. We also demonstrate herein that the initial RR-mediated 5-azaC conversion to decitabine is terminated through its own inhibition. In conclusion, we identify RRM2 as a novel molecular target of 5-azaC in AML. Our findings provide a basis for its more widespread clinical use either alone or in combination.","['Aimiuwu, Josephine', 'Wang, Hongyan', 'Chen, Ping', 'Xie, Zhiliang', 'Wang, Jiang', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Klisovic, Rebecca', 'Mims, Alice', 'Blum, William', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Chan, Kenneth K']","['Aimiuwu J', 'Wang H', 'Chen P', 'Xie Z', 'Wang J', 'Liu S', 'Klisovic R', 'Mims A', 'Blum W', 'Marcucci G', 'Chan KK']","['Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120419,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (ribonucleotide reductase M2)', 'EC 1.17.4.1 (RRM1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.17.4.1 (Ribonucleoside Diphosphate Reductase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Male', 'RNA Stability/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleoside Diphosphate Reductase/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2012/04/21 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2012/04/21 06:00'],"['2012/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47775-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-11-382226 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 May 31;119(22):5229-38. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-11-382226.

The TERT promoter is situated within a large CpG island, suggesting that expression is methylation-sensitive. Studies suggest a correlation between hypermethylation and TERT overexpression. We investigated the relationship between TERT promoter methylation and expression and telomerase activity in human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. DAC-induced demethylation and cell death were observed in all three cell lines, as well as telomere shortening in HL-60 cells. DAC treatment reduced TERT expression and telomerase activity in OCI/AML3 and HL-60 cells, but not in U937 cells. Control U937 cells expressed lower levels of TERT mRNA, carried a highly methylated TERT core promoter, and proved more resistant to DAC-induced repression of TERT expression and cell death. AML patients had significantly lower methylation levels at several CpGs than ""well elderly"" individuals. This study, the first to investigate the relationship between TERT methylation and telomerase activity in leukemia cells, demonstrated a differential methylation pattern and response to DAC in three AML cell lines. We suggest that, although DAC treatment reduces TERT expression and telomerase activity, this is unlikely to occur via direct demethylation of the TERT promoter.

Here, we give an overview on the role of Msi2 in the regulation and function of primitive hematopoietic cells as well as in leukaemic progression. We also discuss the molecular pathways in which Msi2 acts in both normal and leukaemic blood cells. RECENT FINDINGS: Msi2 gain and loss of function experiments have shown that it plays an important role in regulating the heamatopoietic stem cell pool. Msi2 has also been found to be overexpressed in human myeloid leukaemias correlating with poor prognosis, therefore Msi2 may be considered as a prognostic marker for acute myeloid leukaemia. SUMMARY: Further studies into the molecular pathways through which Msi2 modulates primitive progenitor function will provide insight into the regulation of normal haematopoiesis and a better understanding of the mechanisms governing the leukaemic transformation process. This will be crucial for the development of effective therapies.","['de Andres-Aguayo, Luisa', 'Varas, Florencio', 'Graf, Thomas']","['de Andres-Aguayo L', 'Varas F', 'Graf T']","['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Biology and Differentiation, Centre for Genomic Regulation, UPF bInstitucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis, Avancats , Pg.

Earlier studies demonstrated that clusters of differentiation 34-positive, Philadelphia chromosome-positive (CD34(+) Ph(+) ) cells are detectable in about 45% of patients with CML, despite being on long-term imatinib therapy and having achieved sustained CCyR. METHODS: CD34(+) cells from bone marrow of de novo CML patients in the chronic phase (n = 24) treated with nilotinib (median duration of therapy, 22 months) were isolated and scored for BCR-ABL by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Similar analysis was also performed in 5 de novo CML chronic phase patients who achieved CCyR within 3 months of nilotinib therapy. RESULTS: FISH evaluation of a median of 100 CD34(+) nuclei per patient revealed that only 1 of 20 (5%) evaluable patients showed residual Ph(+) progenitor cells. In this patient, just 1 of 140 (0.7%) CD34(+) interphase nuclei was found to be positive for BCR-ABL. Surprisingly, no CD34(+) Ph(+) cells were found even in those 5 patients evaluated after 3 months of nilotinib treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study assessed for the first time the persistence of CD34(+) Ph(+) cells during nilotinib first-line treatment. Preliminary results showed that in patients in CCyR, even after short-term nilotinib therapy, residual leukemic progenitors are very rarely detected compared with imatinib-treated CCyR patients. It is yet to be determined if these findings will have an impact in the path to a cure of CML with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Defina, Marzia', 'Ippoliti, Micaela', 'Gozzetti, Alessandro', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Crupi, Rosaria', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Salvucci, Marzia', 'Aprile, Lara', 'Barate, Claudia', 'Gozzini, Antonella', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Lauria, Francesco', 'Bocchia, Monica']","['Defina M', 'Ippoliti M', 'Gozzetti A', 'Abruzzese E', 'Castagnetti F', 'Crupi R', 'Tiribelli M', 'Breccia M', 'Salvucci M', 'Aprile L', 'Barate C', 'Gozzini A', 'Rosti G', 'Lauria F', 'Bocchia M']","['Department of Hematology, University of Siena, Siena, Italy. marziadefina@libero.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120419,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2012/04/21 06:00,2013/02/01 06:00,['2012/04/21 06:00'],"['2011/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/20 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.27506 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Nov 1;118(21):5265-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.27506.

The tests require definition of what is meant by 'around' the location, and this is achieved by specifying weights associated with surrounding locations. Different weight specifications will yield different levels of statistical significance, and because of the difficulty in knowing how to define the weights, it is tempting to try different definitions with the hope of finding one that is highly significant. This, however, introduces the problem of multiple testing; one will eventually be able to reject a null hypothesis if one tries often enough. This article describes approaches for adjusting the significance level when multiple tests, associated with varying definitions for the weights, are carried out. The approaches are developed for a local scan statistic, a maximum chi-square statistic, and a modified version of Stone's statistic.

METHODS: We evaluated the relationship between time to peripheral blood blast clearance after induction and disease status as assessed by day 14 and day 30 marrow biopsies in 162 patients with AML. Day 6 after induction was the optimal cutoff point determined by a receiver operating characteristic analysis and was selected to divide patients into early blast clearance (EBC; </=6 days; n = 119) and delayed blast clearance (DBC; >6 days; n = 43) groups. RESULTS: DBC patients were older, but otherwise the 2 groups were comparable. Marrow blast clearance on day 14 after induction chemotherapy was observed in 84% of patients in the EBC group and 60% in the DBC group. With a median follow-up of 1538 days, both relapse-free survival (RFS) (442 vs 202 days, P = .0017) and overall survival (OS) (930 vs 429 days, P < .0001) were longer in the EBC group, and a multivariable analysis showed that EBC independently predicted clearance of marrow blasts at day 14 (P = .0018), remission (P = .0179), RFS (P = .0171), and OS (P = .0122). CONCLUSIONS: Early clearance of peripheral blood blasts after induction chemotherapy predicts for early marrow blast clearance, complete remission, RFS, and OS.

Although BCR-ABL1 activation is present in all patients with CML, patients can present in 3 different phases characterized by an increasingly worse prognosis and diminished responsiveness to tyrosine kinase inhibitors: chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blastic phase. The biologic basis for progression from chronic phase to blastic phase and for regulating the homeostasis of tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant CML stem cells is not entirely understood. METHODS: To shed some light into these aspects of CML biology, the authors used reverse phase protein arrays probed with 112 individual monoclonal antibodies to compare protein expression patterns in 40 samples of leukemia-enriched fractions from patients with CML (25 in chronic phase, 5 in accelerated phase, and 10 in phase). RESULTS: An analysis of variance (significance cutoff, P < .01) unveiled a set of proteins that were overexpressed in blastic phase, including heat-shock protein 90 (hsp90); retinoblastoma (Rb); apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF); serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A); B-cell leukemia 2 (Bcl-2); X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (Xiap); human homolog of Drosophila Mad (mothers against decapentaplegic) and related Caenorhabditis elegans gene Sma, family member 1 (Smad1); single-stranded DNA binding protein 2 alpha (SSBP2alpha); poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP); GRB2-associated binding protein 2 (Gab2); and tripartite motif containing 24 (Trim24). It is noteworthy that several of these proteins also were overexpressed in the CD34-positive compartment, which putatively contains the CML stem cell population. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study indicated that reverse phase protein array analysis can unveil differentially expressed proteins in advanced phase CML that can be exploited therapeutically with targeted approaches.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Qiu, Yi Hua', 'Post, Sean M', 'Zhang, Yiqun', 'Creighton, Chad J', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kornblau, Steven M']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Qiu YH', 'Post SM', 'Zhang Y', 'Creighton CJ', 'Cortes J', 'Kornblau SM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

METHODS: A anti-mitochondrial antibodies-M2(AMA-M2), anti-BCOADC-E2 PDC-E2 OGDC-E2 antibodies (anti-3E/BPO), anti-SP100 antibodies (anti-SP100), anti-promyelocytic leukemia (anti-PML), anti-gp210 antibodies (anti-gp210),and anti-Ro-52 were detected respectively in 330 suspected PBC cases by Western blotting. RESULTS: (1) The sensitivity/specificity rates of AMA-M2,anti-3E/BPO,anti-SP100,anti-PML,anti-gp210,and anti-Ro-52 were 85.3%/84.8%, 79.4%/93.2 %, 35.3%/98.0%, 41.2%/96.3%, 44.1%/96.6%,61.8%/68.6% respectively; AMA-M2 were combined with the other antibodies. The specificity rates in the series tests were 94.9%, 99.3%, 99.3 %, 98.3%, and 92.2%, while the sensitivity rates in the parallel tests were 91.2%, 94.1%, 94.1%, 94.1%, and 1.2%,respectively .(2)There were 5 cases of AMA-M2 negative in patients with PBC,including 60% (3/5) cases of anti-gp210, anti-SP100 and anti-PML positive respectively. CONCLUSION: (1) AMA-M2 were more sensitive than other antibodies, while the specificity rates of anti-3E/BPO , anti-SP100, anti-PML, and anti-gp210 were higher than that of AMA-M2; Parallel tests helps to exclude the suspected PBC cases and series tests could be useful in clinics to confirm the PBC cases. (2) anti-gp210, anti-SP100, anti-PML antibodies appear to be more common in AMA-M2 negative PBC patients than in those who are AMA-M2 positive,and their presence in AMA-M2 negative PBC patients contributes to the PBC diagnosis.","['Xiao, Hua', 'Chen, Jin-wei', 'Xie, Xi', 'Liu, Yi-ming', 'Li, Fen']","['Xiao H', 'Chen JW', 'Xie X', 'Liu YM', 'Li F']","['Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Xiangya Second Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410011, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Beijing da xue xue bao.

Serum samples from dogs (35 healthy, 32 with lymphoma, 2 with leukemia, and 35 with solid tumors) and humans (18 healthy, 9 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 10 with myelodysplastic syndrome) were analyzed using the [(3)H]-dThd assay. Mean S-TK1 activities were 1.11 +/- 0.46 pmol/min/mL in healthy dogs and 1.15 +/- 0.32 pmol/min/mL in healthy humans. S-TK1 activities in dogs with hematological malignancies were 24.2 +/- 47.9 pmol/min/mL, and the receiver operating characteristic curve showed an area under the curve of 0.88. With a cut-off value of 1.9 pmol/min/mL (mean value +/- 2 SD), the sensitivity was 0.94 and the specificity was 0.68. Very similar results were obtained with human samples (healthy and lymphoma cases). S-TK1 activities measured during chemotherapy of six dogs with lymphoma were drastically reduced. In one case, S-TK1 activity increased prior to relapse. S-TK1 levels in dogs with solid tumors did not differ from the healthy group. S-TK1 activities correlated with those determined with the TK-REA and TK-Liaison assays (r=0.92 and r=0.96, respectively). In conclusion, this optimized [(3)H]-dThd assay is fast, sensitive and economical for measuring S-TK1 activity and should increase its clinical use as biomarker.","['Sharif, H', 'von Euler, H', 'Westberg, S', 'He, E', 'Wang, L', 'Eriksson, S']","['Sharif H', 'von Euler H', 'Westberg S', 'He E', 'Wang L', 'Eriksson S']","['Department of Anatomy, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, BMC, P.O.

In 57 specimens from 49 patients with MPNST (35 sporadic, 14 neurofibromatosis type 1-related), TA was determined using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol, and ALT was detected by assaying ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies (APB) and terminal restriction fragment (TRF) length distribution. TA or ALT (defined on the basis of APB) alone was found in 24.6% or 26.3% of the lesions, respectively, whereas 6 cases (10.5%) were TA+/ALT+. A concordance between APB and TRF results in defining the ALT status was observed in 44 of 57 cases (77.2%; P < .0001). TA was more frequently expressed in samples from patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 than in those with sporadic disease (60% vs 29.4%, P = 0.087). In the overall series, TA proved to be prognostic for 5-year disease-specific death (hazard ratio, 3.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60-8.95; P = .002), even when adjusted for the presence of neurofibromatosis type 1 (hazard ratio, 4.22; 95% CI, 1.804-9.874; P = .001) and margin status after surgery (hazard ratio, 5.78; 95% CI, 2.19-15.26; P < .001). Conversely, ALT did not significantly affect clinical outcome of MPNST using either APB expression (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% CI 0.54-2.89; P = 0.605) or TRF distribution (hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.17-1.96; P = .375) as the detection approach.

When the GC binds to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein, c-Myb and GR are recruited at the Glucocorticoid Response Unit in the DNA. Here we demonstrate that c-Myb interacts with the GR and that decreasing c-Myb amounts reduces the levels of GR transcripts and protein in 697 pre-B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Furthermore, the auto-upregulation of GR promoter 1C and promoter 1D is blunted at reduced c-Myb levels. Taken together, these data show that c-Myb is a direct, key regulator of the GR. Unexpectedly, the reduction in c-Myb levels increased the sensitivity of the cells to steroid-mediated apoptosis. This was because the reduction in c-Myb itself decreases cell viability, and the residual GR remained above the threshold needed to trigger apoptosis. These studies show the mutual importance of c-Myb and the GR in controlling survival of pre-B ALL cells.","['Sarvaiya, Purvaba J', 'Schwartz, Jason R', 'Geng, Chuan-dong', 'Vedeckis, Wayne V']","['Sarvaiya PJ', 'Schwartz JR', 'Geng CD', 'Vedeckis WV']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Stanley S.

TLX1/TLX3 abrogation or enforced TCRalphabeta expression leads to TCRalpha rearrangement and apoptosis.

The FMT patients had not only a similar pattern of engraftment and immune reconstitution as the WM-UDT and PM-UDT patients but also comparable incidences and severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease. The FMT patients did not experience any form of engraftment failure. However, the cumulative incidence of cytomegalovirus DNAemia was significantly higher in the FMT group compared with the other groups (P = .036). After a median follow-up of 28 months, overall survival, disease-free survival, relapse, and nonrelapse mortality were 83%, 74%, 20%, and 7%, respectively, for WM-UDT; 51%, 51%, 31%, and 18% for PM-UDT; and 66%, 64%, 26%, and 10% for FMT. This demonstrates a trend for favorable survival outcomes of WM-UDT over FMT and of FMT over PM-UDT. However, we found no significant statistical differences in survival according to donor type. These data need to be interpreted cautiously because of limited power calculations due to the small number of each donor group. This pilot study suggests the feasibility of FMT using our novel regimen with careful evaluation of CMV DNAemia compared with WM-UDT and PM-UDT. Further trials with larger numbers of patients, comparing FMT directly with transplantation with other donor types, are needed.","['Cho, Byung-Sik', 'Yoon, Jae-Ho', 'Shin, Seung-Hwan', 'Yahng, Seung-Ah', 'Lee, Sung-Eun', 'Eom, Ki-Seong', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Lee, Seok', 'Min, Chang-Ki', 'Cho, Seok-Goo', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Lee, Jong-Wook', 'Min, Woo-Sung', 'Park, Chong-Won', 'Kim, Hee-Je']","['Cho BS', 'Yoon JH', 'Shin SH', 'Yahng SA', 'Lee SE', 'Eom KS', 'Kim YJ', 'Lee S', 'Min CK', 'Cho SG', 'Kim DW', 'Lee JW', 'Min WS', 'Park CW', 'Kim HJ']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, Seoul St Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120416,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/etiology/*immunology/virology', 'Family', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Haplotypes', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Unrelated Donors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2012/04/21 06:00,2013/05/04 06:00,['2012/04/21 06:00'],"['2012/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(12)00147-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2012.04.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2012 Oct;18(10):1552-63. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2012.04.008.

This region is frequently associated with microsatellite instability and LOH and contains a relatively high density of known tumor suppressor genes, and several unidentified candidate tumor suppressor genes located distal to BRCA1. Spn is located in this locus and proposed to be a new tumor suppressor. Loss of Spn induces a proliferative response by increasing pRb phosphorylation, which in turn activates p53, thereby, neutralizing the proliferative response. The absence of p53 bypasses this barrier and enhances the malignant phenotype. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of SPN in human tumor cells from different types of malignancies greatly reduced cell growth. Spn knock-out mice had decreased lifespan with increased cellular proliferation in tissues such as the mammary ducts and early appearance of tumors. Furthermore, the combined loss of Spn and mutant p53 activity led to increased mammary carcinomas, confirming the functional relationship between p53 and Spn. In human tumors, Spn is absent in 20% and reduced in another 37% of human lung tumors. Spn reduction correlates with malignant grade and p53 mutations. Furthermore, Spn mRNA is lost in a percentage of renal carcinomas and lung adenocarcinomas. Finally, lower levels of Spn mRNA correlate with higher grade of ovarian carcinoma and chronic myelogenous leukemia. Therefore, Spn may be the tumor suppressor gene that is located at 17q21.33 and that its tumor suppressive function is dependent on the absence of p53.","['Carnero, A']",['Carnero A'],"['Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Avda.

It has been reported under different names; however, the exact classification and nomenclature of this eruption have been the subject of much debate, and a more precise term is still awaiting. Herein, we review the different aspects of this reaction and suggest a new term that might help to minimize the confusion about its nomenclature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe a 68-year-old woman who had been on long-term hydroxyurea therapy for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia for nine years. She presented with typical dermatomyositis-like lesions and many of the other mucocutaneous adverse effects of hydroxyurea. RESULTS: Skin examination revealed typical Gottron's papules on the dorsa of the hands, atrophy, xerosis, acquired ichthyosis, photosensitivity, cutaneous, oral and nail hyperpigmentation, acral erythema, palmoplantar keratoderma, actinic keratoses, and leg ulcers. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence of proximal muscle weakness. Cessation of hydroxyurea was associated with remarkable improvement of the skin lesions. CONCLUSION: Hydroxyurea-induced dermatomyositis is a rare drug-induced dermatomyositis characterized by skin lesions identical to classic dermatomyositis without clinical or laboratory evidence of myositis. We propose that the term hydroxyurea-induced amyopathic dermatomyositis that adequately describes the findings reported in this subset of patients would be more precise and specific.","['Nofal, Ahmad', 'El-Din, Eman Salah']","['Nofal A', 'El-Din ES']","['Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt. ahmadnofal5@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Int J Dermatol,International journal of dermatology,0243704,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Dermatomyositis/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Drug Eruptions/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Terminology as Topic', 'Withholding Treatment']",2012/04/21 06:00,2012/09/13 06:00,['2012/04/21 06:00'],"['2012/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-4632.2011.05105.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Dermatol. 2012 May;51(5):535-41. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-4632.2011.05105.x.,['(c) 2012 The International Society of Dermatology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This remarkable progress was achieved by combining conventional chemotherapy with monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab and alemtuzumab. Despite this improvement, CLL remains an incurable disease and all patients will eventually relapse and become refractory to treatment. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only curative option but is feasible only in a minority of patients due to the comorbidity and impaired physical fitness of many patients, since the mean age at first diagnosis lies between 70 and 75 years. Therefore, novel less-toxic therapeutic agents are needed, particularly for patients with comorbidities or high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities. Research in the field of CLL and growing understanding of the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphomas has produced a wide variety of new substances for different targets, e.g. different novel monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulatory agents and inhibitors targeting different kinases of B-cell receptor signalling cascade, such as Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K).

One postulated mechanism of action in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the ability of bortezomib to ameliorate molecular dysregulation in NF-kappaB activation and regain cell cycle control. Results of clinical trials have varied widely based on lymphoma subtype. While response to bortezomib has been dismal in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma, reasonable responses have been attained in mantle cell lymphoma leading to its US FDA approval as a second-line agent for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma in 2006. Bortezomib in combination with R-CHOP has also been suggested to improve response in certain molecular subgroups of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The role of bortezomib in follicular and marginal zone lymphomas remains less clear.","['Koprivnikar, Jamie L', 'Cheson, Bruce D']","['Koprivnikar JL', 'Cheson BD']","['Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Washington, DC 20007, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Future Oncol,"Future oncology (London, England)",101256629,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Boronic Acids/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/*drug therapy', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Pyrazines/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence']",2012/04/21 06:00,2012/08/16 06:00,['2012/04/21 06:00'],"['2012/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/fon.12.23 [doi]'],ppublish,Future Oncol. 2012 Apr;8(4):359-71. doi: 10.2217/fon.12.23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, new strategies are needed to improve the outcome of older patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Tosedostat is an orally available aminopeptidase inhibitor shown to have activity in leukemia. This commentary discusses the background and results of an ongoing Phase II evaluation of tosedostat in elderly patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.

Previously, our laboratory showed that dietary I3C is an effective transplacental chemopreventive agent in a dibenzo[def,p]chrysene (DBC)-dependent model of murine T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. The primary objective of the present study was to extend our chemoprevention studies in mice to an analogous human neoplasm in cell culture. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that I3C or DIM may be chemotherapeutic in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells. Treatment of the T-ALL cell lines CCRF-CEM, CCRF-HSB2, SUP-T1 and Jurkat with DIM in vitro significantly reduced cell proliferation and viability at concentrations 8- to 25-fold lower than the parent compound I3C. DIM (7.5 microM) arrested CEM and HSB2 cells at the G(1) phase of the cell cycle and 15 microM DIM significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells in all T-ALL lines. In CEM cells, DIM reduced protein expression of cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4, CDK6) and D-type cyclin 3 (CCND3); DIM also significantly altered expression of eight transcripts related to human apoptosis (BCL2L10, CD40LG, HRK, TNF, TNFRSF1A, TNFRSF25, TNFSF8, TRAF4). Similar anticancer effects of DIM were observed in vivo. Dietary exposure to 100 ppm DIM significantly decreased the rate of growth of human CEM xenografts in immunodeficient SCID mice, reduced final tumor size by 44% and increased the apoptotic index compared to control-fed mice. Taken together, our results demonstrate a potential for therapeutic application of DIM in T-ALL.","['Shorey, Lyndsey E', 'Hagman, Amanda M', 'Williams, David E', 'Ho, Emily', 'Dashwood, Roderick H', 'Benninghoff, Abby D']","['Shorey LE', 'Hagman AM', 'Williams DE', 'Ho E', 'Dashwood RH', 'Benninghoff AD']","['Department of Environmental and Molecular Toxicology, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120413,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Indoles)', ""SSZ9HQT61Z (3,3'-diindolylmethane)""]",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/04/20 06:00,2012/08/31 06:00,['2012/04/20 06:00'],"['2011/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0034975 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-13727 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e34975. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0034975.

Flt3, a key regulator of hematopoietic cell growth, is frequently deregulated in AML (acute myeloid leukemia). Here, we report that loss of N-CoR-mediated transcriptional control of Flt3 due to misfolding, contributes to malignant growth in AML of the M5 subtype (AML-M5). An analysis of hematopoietic genes in AML cells led to the identification of Flt3 as a transcriptional target of N-CoR. Flt3 level was inversely related to N-CoR status in various leukemia cells. N-CoR was associated with the Flt3 promoter in-vivo, and a reporter driven by the Flt3 promoter was effectively repressed by N-CoR. Blocking N-CoR loss with Genistein; an inhibitor of N-CoR misfolding, significantly down-regulated Flt3 levels regardless of the Flt3 receptor mutational status and promoted the differentiation of AML-M5 cells. While stimulation of the Flt3 receptor with the Flt3 ligand triggered N-CoR loss, Flt3 antibody mediated blockade of Flt3 ligand-receptor binding led to N-CoR stabilization. Genetic ablation of N-CoR potentiated Flt3 ligand induced proliferation of BA/F3 cells. These findings suggest that N-CoR-induced repression of Flt3 might be crucial for limiting the contribution of the Flt3 signaling pathway on the growth potential of leukemic cells and its deregulation due to N-CoR loss in AML-M5, could contribute to malignant growth by conferring a proliferative advantage to the leukemic blasts. Therapeutic restoration of N-CoR function could thus be a useful approach in restricting the contribution of the Flt3 signaling pathway in AML-M5 pathogenesis.","['Nin, Dawn Sijin', 'Kok, Wai Kay', 'Li, Feng', 'Takahashi, Shinichiro', 'Chng, Wee Joo', 'Khan, Matiullah']","['Nin DS', 'Kok WK', 'Li F', 'Takahashi S', 'Chng WJ', 'Khan M']","['Cancer Science Institute, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120413,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (NCOR1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA Interference', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/04/20 06:00,2012/08/31 06:00,['2012/04/20 06:00'],"['2011/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0034501 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-20500 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e34501. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0034501.

Furthermore, pseudotyping of the polytropic MuLV genome within ecotropic virions was nearly complete in coinoculated mice. In an effort to better understand these phenomena, we examined mixed retrovirus infections by utilizing in vitro cell lines. Similar to in vivo mixed infections, the polytropic MuLV genome was extensively pseudotyped within ecotropic virions; polytropic virus release was profoundly elevated in coinfected cells, and the ecotropic virus release was unchanged. A reduced level of polytropic SU protein on the surfaces of coinfected cells was observed and correlated with a reduced level of nonpseudotyped polytropic virion release. Marked amplification and pseudotyping of the polytropic MuLV were also observed in mixed Fr98-F-MuLV infections of cell lines derived from the central nervous system (CNS), the target for Fr98 pathogenesis. Additional experiments indicated that pseudotyping contributed to the elevated polytropic virus titer by increasing the efficiency of packaging and release of the polytropic genomes within ecotropic virions. Mixed infections are the rule rather than the exception in retroviral infection, and the ability to examine them in vitro should facilitate a more thorough understanding of retroviral interactions in general.","['Rosenke, Kyle', 'Lavignon, Marc', 'Malik, Frank', 'Kolokithas, Angelo', 'Hendrick, Duncan', 'Virtaneva, Kimmo', 'Peterson, Karin', 'Evans, Leonard H']","['Rosenke K', 'Lavignon M', 'Malik F', 'Kolokithas A', 'Hendrick D', 'Virtaneva K', 'Peterson K', 'Evans LH']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, Montana, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20120418,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Coinfection/*virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*growth & development/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Viral Load', '*Virus Release']",2012/04/20 06:00,2012/08/16 06:00,['2012/04/20 06:00'],"['2012/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00225-12 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00225-12 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Jul;86(13):7241-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00225-12.

Heart disease includes a broad range of diseases that affect the development and/or function of the cardiovascular system. Some of these diseases, such as congenital heart defects, are present at birth. Others develop over time and may be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Many of the known heart diseases are associated with abnormal expression of genes. Understanding the factors and mechanisms that regulate gene expression in the heart is essential for the detection, treatment, and prevention of heart diseases. Polycomb Group (PcG) and Trithorax Group (TrxG) proteins are special families of chromatin factors that regulate developmental gene expression in many tissues and organs. Accumulating evidence suggests that these proteins are important regulators of development and function of the heart as well.

Unfortunately, state of the art approaches to impedance measuring as applied to cell detection do not perform well in regions characterized by non-homogeneous physical parameters due, for example, to the presence of air-liquid interfaces or when the particle-electrode distance is relatively high. This paper presents a robust impedance measurement technique and a circuit for detecting cells flowing in microstructures such as microchannels and microwells. Our solution makes use of an innovative three-electrode measurement scheme with asymmetric polarization in order to increase cell detection ability in microstructures featuring large electrode distances of up to 100 mum as well as to limit signal loss due to cell position relative to the electrodes. Compared to standard techniques, numerical simulations show that, with the proposed approach, the cell detection sensitivity is increased by more than 40%. In addition, we propose a custom circuit based on division instead of difference between signals, as in standard differential circuits, so as to reduce the baseline signal drift induced by non-homogeneous conductivity. A simplified analytical model shows an increase in the signal-to-noise-ratio comprised in the range 3.9-5.9. Experimental results, carried out using an open-microwell device made with flexible printed circuit board technology, are in agreement with simulations, suggesting a six-fold increase of the signal-to-noise ratio compared to the differential measurement technique. We were thus able to successfully monitor the process of isolating K562 leukemia cells inside open-microwells determining all single-cell events with no false positive detection.","['Faenza, Andrea', 'Bocchi, Massimo', 'Pecorari, Nicola', 'Franchi, Eleonora', 'Guerrieri, Roberto']","['Faenza A', 'Bocchi M', 'Pecorari N', 'Franchi E', 'Guerrieri R']","['ARCES-University of Bologna, Viale Pepoli 3/2, I-40123 Bologna, Italy. afaenza@arces.unibo.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120418,England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,,IM,"['Air', 'Electric Impedance', 'Electrodes', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Lab-On-A-Chip Devices', 'Signal-To-Noise Ratio']",2012/04/20 06:00,2012/09/11 06:00,['2012/04/20 06:00'],"['2012/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c2lc40158d [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2012 May 8;12(11):2046-52. doi: 10.1039/c2lc40158d.

In this study, we aimed to clarify whether human nevus cells can be distinguished from primary and transformed melanocytes by examining the expression of eight senescence markers, including those previously purported to define nevi as senescent tumors. Specifically, we analyzed effectors of senescence, including p16(INK4a), p53, and DNA damage (gamma-H2AX), as well as predictive markers of senescence including Ki67, PML, senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, heterochromatic foci (H3K9Me, 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), and nuclear size. We found that these commonly accepted senescence markers do not in fact distinguish nevi from precursor/normal and transformed/malignant melanocytes.

Until recently, interactions of Notch with specific ADAMs in different contexts were unclear. ADAM10 is now known to be specifically essential for development and homeostasis of mouse epidermis and cardiovascular structures, and ADAM17 may not be able to fully replace ADAM10 in these contexts. However, Notch from T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients can be cleaved by both ADAMs 10 and 17.

Here, we investigated the effects of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 in combination with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) or agonistic TRAIL receptor 1 (DR4)-specific monoclonal antibody, AY4, on sensitization of TRAIL- and AY4-resistant human HNSCC cell lines. Combination treatment of HNSCC cells synergistically induced apoptotic cell death accompanied by caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 activation and Bid cleavage into truncated Bid (tBid). Generation and accumulation of tBid through the cooperative action of MG132 with TRAIL or AY4 and Bik accumulation through MG132-mediated proteasome inhibition are critical to the synergistic apoptosis. In HNSCC cells, Bak was constrained by Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L), but not by Bcl-2. Conversely, Bax did not interact with Mcl-1, Bcl-X(L), or Bcl-2. Importantly, tBid plays a major role in Bax activation, and Bik indirectly activates Bak by displacing it from Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L), pointing to the synergistic mechanism of the combination treatment. In addition, knockdown of both Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L) significantly sensitized HNSCC cells to TRAIL and AY4 as a single agent, suggesting that Bak constraint by Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L) is an important resistance mechanism of TRAIL receptor-mediated apoptotic cell death. Our results provide a novel molecular mechanism for the potent synergy between MG132 proteasome inhibitor and TRAIL receptor agonists in HNSCC cells, suggesting that the combination of these agents may offer a new therapeutic strategy for HNSCC treatment.","['Sung, Eun-Sil', 'Park, Kyung-Jin', 'Choi, Hye-Ji', 'Kim, Chul-Ho', 'Kim, Yong-Sung']","['Sung ES', 'Park KJ', 'Choi HJ', 'Kim CH', 'Kim YS']","['Department of Molecular Science and Technology, Ajou University, Suwon 443-749, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120410,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BIK protein, human)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leupeptins/*administration & dosage', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*agonists', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/administration & dosage', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2012/04/20 06:00,2012/08/25 06:00,['2012/04/20 06:00'],"['2012/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(12)00172-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.04.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2012 Aug 1;318(13):1564-76. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2012.04.003.

We conclude that DLK1 dysfunction may contribute to abnormal hematopoiesis of MDS and may be 1 of the antioncogenes. Delta-like-1 (DLK1) is frequently expressed at elevated levels in CD34(+) cells from patients with MDS. To investigate its role in the pathogenesis of MDS, we tested bone marrow samples from a panel of patients with MDS, AML, or myeloproliferative neoplasms, with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We show here that DLK1 mRNA levels are higher in MDS patients and lower in AML patients than in healthy individuals. Myeloid progenitor 32D cells overexpressing DLK1 display increased apoptosis, reduced differentiation, and decreased cell number expansion, which is also accompanied by changes in cell cycle progression. Immortalized fibroblastic 3T3 cells can grow into tumors in nude mice but the size of tumors are smaller from those overexpressing DLK1. These observations suggest that DLK1 dysfunction may contribute to the ineffective hematopoiesis of MDS.","['Ma, Xiaotang', 'Zhang, Yue', 'Yang, Lin', 'Xu, Zefeng', 'Xiao, Zhijian']","['Ma X', 'Zhang Y', 'Yang L', 'Xu Z', 'Xiao Z']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120417,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DLK1 protein, human)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection']",2012/04/20 06:00,2013/02/15 06:00,['2012/04/20 06:00'],"['2011/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/31 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(12)00049-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2012.03.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2012 Aug;12(4):261-8. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2012.03.002.

Subsequent investigations have revealed that it is a member of the lipocalin family of proteins that transport small, hydrophobic ligands. Since then, NGAL expression has been reported in several normal tissues where it serves to provide protection against bacterial infection and modulate oxidative stress. Its expression is also dysregulated in several benign and malignant diseases. Its small size, secreted nature and relative stability have led to it being investigated as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in numerous diseases including inflammation and cancer. Functional studies, conducted primarily on lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), the mouse homologue of human NGAL have revealed that Lcn2 has a strong affinity for iron complexed to both bacterial siderophores (iron-binding proteins) and certain human proteins like norepinephrine. By sequestering iron-laden siderophores, Lcn2 deprives bacteria of a vital nutrient and thus inhibits their growth (bacteriostatic effect). In malignant cells, its proposed functions range from inhibiting apoptosis (in thyroid cancer cells), invasion and angiogenesis (in pancreatic cancer) to increasing proliferation and metastasis (in breast and colon cancer). Ectopic expression of Lcn2 also promotes BCR-ABL induced chronic myelogenous leukemia in murine models. By transporting iron into and out of the cell, NGAL also regulates iron responsive genes. Further, it stabilizes the proteolytic enzyme matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) by forming a complex with it, and thereby prevents its autodegradation. The factors regulating NGAL expression are numerous and range from pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukins, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferons to vitamins like retinoic acid. The purpose of this review article is to examine the expression, structure, regulation and biological role of NGAL and critically assess its potential as a novel diagnostic and prognostic marker in both benign and malignant human diseases.","['Chakraborty, Subhankar', 'Kaur, Sukhwinder', 'Guha, Sushovan', 'Batra, Surinder K']","['Chakraborty S', 'Kaur S', 'Guha S', 'Batra SK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-5870, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",20120331,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (LCN2 protein, human)', '0 (Lipocalin-2)', '0 (Lipocalins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '126469-30-5 (Lcn2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lipocalin-2', 'Lipocalins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2012/04/20 06:00,2013/03/13 06:00,['2012/04/20 06:00'],"['2012/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-419X(12)00022-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbcan.2012.03.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2012 Aug;1826(1):129-69. doi: 10.1016/j.bbcan.2012.03.008.

The aim of the present empirical qualitative study was to investigate how patients with cancer perceive and experience the process of donation to biobanks, focussing on the subjective meanings associated with their decisions when they are asked in a routine context to agree to their own biological specimens being used for research projects. DESIGN: A qualitative study, using semi-structured interviews to explore in depth the reasons why patients with cancer agree to participating in biobanking. Participants Nineteen patients (aged 28-82 years) being treated for colorectal cancer or leukaemia at a French cancer centre participated in this study. RESULTS: Contributing to biobanks was experienced here as a rewarding and empowering individual experience because of the psychological issues involved, such as feelings of hope associated with research, because it makes the relationship with researchers and clinicians less asymmetrical, revalorization of otherwise 'wasted' tissue, and also as an act of solidarity and reciprocity, which makes patients part of a community. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Patients seem to regard contributing to biobanks as an act of benevolence, which they are motivated to perform because of societal welfare considerations as well as the hope of subjective benefits. Knowledge about the patients' perspective and of the psychological rewards associated with tumour donation should be taken into account by physicians and caregivers discussing this topic with their patients.","['Pellegrini, Isabelle', 'Chabannon, Christian', 'Mancini, Julien', 'Viret, Frederic', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Julian-Reynier, Claire']","['Pellegrini I', 'Chabannon C', 'Mancini J', 'Viret F', 'Vey N', 'Julian-Reynier C']","['Inserm UMR912 SE4S, Marseille Cedex 9IRD, UMR912, Marseille cedex 9Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille Cedex 9Inserm UMR891 CRCM, Marseille Cedex 9Aix-Marseille Univ, UMR912, Marseille cedex 9Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Marseille, Timone Hospital, Public Health Department, Marseille Cedex 5, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120419,England,Health Expect,Health expectations : an international journal of public participation in health care and health policy,9815926,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Altruism', '*Biological Specimen Banks', '*Biomedical Research', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Patients/*psychology', 'Power, Psychological', 'Qualitative Research', 'Tissue Donors/*psychology']",2012/04/20 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2012/04/20 06:00'],"['2012/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1369-7625.2012.00781.x [doi]'],ppublish,Health Expect. 2014 Aug;17(4):523-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1369-7625.2012.00781.x.

Diagnostic criteria have been established by the WHO using histopathological, molecular and biochemical parameters. Treatment of systemic mastocytosis remains a challenge for the clinician due to variability and complexity of the disease. There is, in addition, a lack of a standard and efficient treatment.

We investigated the reversion of multi-drug resistance and the possible mechanism by which the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib affects the expression of the multi-drug resistance gene mdrl in the K562/DNR cell line. The drug resistance of the cells and the cellular toxicity of bortezomib were confirmed by MTT. Intracellular drug concentrations and cell apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. The expression of mdrl mRNA was examined by fluorescence quantitative PCR. The expression levels of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB) and P-gp were detected by western blotting, and NF-kappaB activity was detected by ELISA. DNR-induced apoptosis increased in a dose-dependent manner after adding bortezomib. Bortezomib decreased IkappaB degradation, decreased NF-kappaB and NF-kappaB p65 activity, reduced P-gp/mdr1 mRNA expression, and increased the intracellular DNR concentration in K562/DNR cells in vitro. The bortezomib reversed leukemic multi-drug resistance in a dose-dependent manner as the result of decreasing IkappaB degradation, thus preventing the translocation of NF-kappaB into the nucleus and leading the down-regulation of mdr1 and a reduction in P-gp expression. Therefore, the intracellular drug concentration increased, and then apoptosis was induced.","['Wang, Huihan', 'Wang, Xiaobin', 'Li, Yingchun', 'Liao, Aijun', 'Fu, Beibei', 'Pan, Hongyu', 'Liu, Zhuogang', 'Yang, Wei']","['Wang H', 'Wang X', 'Li Y', 'Liao A', 'Fu B', 'Pan H', 'Liu Z', 'Yang W']","['Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Pharmazie,Die Pharmazie,9800766,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coloring Agents', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'K562 Cells', 'NF-kappa B/biosynthesis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles', 'Transcription Factor RelA/biosynthesis/genetics']",2012/04/20 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2012/04/20 06:00'],"['2012/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Pharmazie. 2012 Feb;67(2):187-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the role of miRNAs in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Our objective is to decipher a miRNA expression signature associated with CML and to determine potential target genes and signaling pathways affected by these signature miRNAs. RESULTS: Using miRNA microarrays and miRNA real-time PCR we characterized the miRNAs expression profile of CML cell lines and patients in reference to non-CML cell lines and healthy blood. Of all miRNAs tested, miR-31, miR-155, and miR-564 were down-regulated in CML cells. Down-regulation of these miRNAs was dependent on BCR-ABL activity. We next analyzed predicted targets and affected pathways of the deregulated miRNAs. As expected, in K562 cells, the expression of several of these targets was inverted to that of the miRNA putatively regulating them. Reassuringly, the analysis identified CML as the main disease associated with these miRNAs. MAPK, ErbB, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were the main molecular pathways related with these expression patterns. Utilizing Venn diagrams we found appreciable overlap between the CML-related miRNAs and the signaling pathways-related miRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: The miRNAs identified in this study might offer a pivotal role in CML. Nevertheless, while these data point to a central disease, the precise molecular pathway/s targeted by these miRNAs is variable implying a high level of complexity of miRNA target selection and regulation. These deregulated miRNAs highlight new candidate gene targets allowing for a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the development of CML, and propose possible new avenues for therapeutic treatment.","['Rokah, Oshrat Hershkovitz', 'Granot, Galit', 'Ovcharenko, Adelina', 'Modai, Shira', 'Pasmanik-Chor, Metsada', 'Toren, Amos', 'Shomron, Noam', 'Shpilberg, Ofer']","['Rokah OH', 'Granot G', 'Ovcharenko A', 'Modai S', 'Pasmanik-Chor M', 'Toren A', 'Shomron N', 'Shpilberg O']","['Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Beilinson Hospital, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120412,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN31 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN564 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology', '*Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism']",2012/04/19 06:00,2012/12/29 06:00,['2012/04/19 06:00'],"['2011/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0035501 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-09187 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e35501. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0035501.

JAMs are localized at intercellular contacts and participated in the assembly and maintenance of junctions, and control of cell permeability. Because Jam2 is highly expressed in the luminal epithelium on day 4 of pregnancy, this study was to determine whether Jam2 plays a role in uterine receptivity and blastocyst attachment in mouse uterus. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Jam2 is highly expressed in the uterine luminal epithelium on days 3 and 4 of pregnancy. Progesterone induces Jam2 expression in ovariectomized mice, which is blocked by progesterone antagonist RU486. Jam2 expression on day 4 of pregnancy is also inhibited by RU486 treatment. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) up-regulates Jam2 protein in isolated luminal epithelium from day 4 uterus, which is blocked by S3I-201, a cell-permeable inhibitor for Stat3 phosphorylation. Under adhesion assay, recombinant Jam2 protein increases the rate of blastocyst adhesion. Both soluble recombinant Jam2 and Jam3 can reverse this process. CONCLUSION: Jam2 is highly expressed in the luminal epithelium of receptive uterus and up-regulated by progesterone and LIF via tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3. Jam2 may play a role in the interaction between hatched blastocyst and receptive uterus.","['Su, Ren-Wei', 'Jia, Bo', 'Ni, Hua', 'Lei, Wei', 'Yue, Shun-Li', 'Feng, Xu-Hui', 'Deng, Weng-Bo', 'Liu, Ji-Long', 'Zhao, Zhen-Ao', 'Wang, Tong-Song', 'Yang, Zeng-Ming']","['Su RW', 'Jia B', 'Ni H', 'Lei W', 'Yue SL', 'Feng XH', 'Deng WB', 'Liu JL', 'Zhao ZA', 'Wang TS', 'Yang ZM']","['Department of Biology, Shantou University, Shantou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120412,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Jam2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/cytology/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis/*physiology', 'Embryo Implantation', 'Epithelium/metabolism', 'Female', 'Intercellular Junctions/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mifepristone/pharmacology', 'Pregnancy', 'Progesterone/*pharmacology', 'Uterus/metabolism']",2012/04/19 06:00,2012/12/29 06:00,['2012/04/19 06:00'],"['2011/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0034325 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-22275 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e34325. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0034325.

The aim of this population-based study was to assess the results of reinduction treatment and allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients in second complete remission. DESIGN AND METHODS: Between 2003-2007, 76 adults (<66 years) with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Burkitt's leukemia excluded) were prospectively reported to The Swedish Adult Acute Leukemia Registry and later evaluated. RESULTS: Reinduction with: (i) mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine (MEA); (ii) fludarabine, cytarabine, pegylated-asparaginase plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (FLAG-Asp); and (iii) cytarabine, betamethasone, cyclophosphamide, daunorubicin, and vincristine (ABCDV) resulted in complete remission in 6/9 (67%), 10/16 (63%) and 9/21 (43%) of the patients, respectively. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation was performed during second complete remission in 29 patients. Multivariate analysis regarding overall survival after relapse revealed that age over 35 years at diagnosis and relapse within 18 months were negative prognostic factors. Overall survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 22% (95% CI: 13-32) and 15% (95% CI: 7-24). Of 19 patients less than 35 years at diagnosis who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation in second remission, ten (53%) are still alive at a median of 5.5 years (range, 4.2-8.3) after relapse, whereas all patients over 35 years old at diagnosis have died. CONCLUSIONS: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the treatment of choice for young adults with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Both (i) mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine and (ii) fludarabine, cytarabine, pegylated-asparaginase plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor seem effective as reinduction treatments and should be further evaluated.

These cells were termed leukemic stem cells since they exist at the apex of a loose hierarchy, possess extensive self-renewal and the ability to undergo limited differentiation into leukemic blasts. Acute myeloid leukemia is a heterogeneous condition at both the phenotypic and molecular level with a variety of distinct genetic alterations giving rise to the disease. Recent studies have highlighted that this heterogeneity extends to the leukemic stem cell, with this dynamic compartment evolving to overcome various selection pressures imposed upon it during disease progression. The result is a complex situation in which multiple pools of leukemic stem cells may exist within individual patients which differ both phenotypically and molecularly. Since leukemic stem cells are thought to be resistant to current chemotherapeutic regimens and mediate disease relapse, their study also has potentially profound clinical implications. Numerous studies have generated important recent advances in the field, including the identification of novel leukemic stem cell-specific cell surface antigens and gene expression signatures. These tools will no doubt prove invaluable for the rational design of targeted therapies in the future.","['Horton, Sarah J', 'Huntly, Brian J P']","['Horton SJ', 'Huntly BJ']","['Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Hills Road, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120417,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics', 'Antigens, Surface/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Signal Transduction']",2012/04/19 06:00,2013/01/01 06:00,['2012/04/19 06:00'],"['2012/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.054734 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.054734 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Jul;97(7):966-74. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.054734.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-seven pre-treated patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase were randomly assigned to continuous treatment with a standard dose of imatinib (400 mg/day; n=113) or to 6 months of high-dose induction with imatinib (800 mg/day) followed by a standard dose of imatinib as maintenance therapy (n=114). RESULTS: The rates of major and complete cytogenetic responses were significantly higher in the high-dose arm than in the standard-dose arm at both 3 and 6 months (major cytogenetic responses: 36.8% versus 21.2%, P=0.01 and 50.0% versus 34.5%, P=0.018; complete cytogenetic responses: 22.8% versus 6.2%, P<0.001 and 40.4% versus 16.8%, P<0.001) on the basis of an intention-to-treat analysis. At 12 months, the difference between treatment arms remained statistically significant for complete cytogenetic responses (40.4% versus 24.8%, P=0.012) but not for major cytogenetic responses (49.1% versus 44.2%, P=0.462). The rate of major molecular responses was also significantly better at 3 and 6 months in the high-dose arm (month 3: 14.9% versus 3.5%, P=0.003; month 6: 32.5% versus 8.8%, P<0.001).

Typically, mBCC is not taken into consideration during the workup of a patient with multifocal metastatic disease who has a history of BCC. The objective of the current review, in which the authors evaluated the time from the first BCC diagnosis to metastasis, location of disease, and radiographic features, was to contribute to the general knowledge and awareness among providers, patients, and support groups about mBCC and to provide an outlook for the future of treatments for mBCC. A literature review on mBCC and a review of records from patients with mBCC who presented to Virginia G. Piper Cancer Center Clinical Trials (an oncology clinical trials center) were conducted. The clinical and radiographic findings of 22 patients with mBCC who were evaluated at that center from the initiation of smoothened (SMO) antagonist trials were analyzed along with a review of BCC epidemiology and pathogenesis, the HHSP, and current and future treatments for this rare presentation of the most common malignancy. The results indicated that, in the last 5 years, there has been a plethora of new agents targeting SMO, a key component of the HHSP that, for the majority of patients with mBCC, may be a good match for targeting tumor genetic vulnerability. Like with other targeted therapy for uncommon malignancies, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, the authors anticipate that there will be clinical development of next-generation HHSP inhibitors to combat mBCCs that are nonresponsive to or progress on current SMO antagonists.","['Weiss, Glen J', 'Korn, Ronald L']","['Weiss GJ', 'Korn RL']","['Virginia G.

In our study, we present the long-term follow-up (the median follow-up was 22.4 years with a range of 3.8-32.0 years) of 54 newborns, whose mothers received chemotherapy during the first trimester of pregnancy with an intent-to-cure HM. Physical and neurological development were carefully assessed, and cardiac and chromosomal studies were performed until the age of 20 years to evaluate late toxicities. The obstetrical development of pregnancy was normal, chemotherapy was used at doses and schedules used in normal patients. Low-weight birth was the most frequent finding. No congenital abnormalities were detected. Physical, psychological and neurological developments were normal. Education and academic degree were according to the economical and social factors. Cardiac function and chromosomal examination were normal. No neoplasm or acute leukemia has been observed in these children. Forty-three mothers are alive and disease-free and can be considered cured. The use of cytotoxic drugs during the first trimester to treat HM seems to be beneficial to both the mother and fetus, and chemotherapy during the first trimester can be considered if the cure of the patient is the goal.","['Aviles, Agustin', 'Neri, Natividad', 'Nambo, Maria-Jesus']","['Aviles A', 'Neri N', 'Nambo MJ']","['Oncology Research Unit, Oncology Hospital, National Medical Center, IMSS, Mexico, D.F., Mexico. agustin.aviles@imss.gob.mx']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120418,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic/*drug therapy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*drug therapy', 'Pregnancy Trimester, First', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*diagnosis']",2012/04/19 06:00,2013/03/09 06:00,['2012/04/19 06:00'],"['2012/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.27560 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2012 Dec 1;131(11):2678-83. doi: 10.1002/ijc.27560.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study using EMR data of all 10,715 patients who received genetic testing by physicians trained in a primary care specialty or subspecialty at an academic medical center between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2010. RESULTS: Patients had a mean+/-SD age of 38.3+/-15.8 years (median 36.1, IQR 30.0-43.8). The proportion of female subjects in the study population was larger than in the general patient population (77.2% vs 55.0%, p<0.001) and they were younger than the male subjects in the study (36.5+/-13.2 vs 44.6+/-21.2 years, p<0.001). Approximately 1.1% of all patients received genetic testing. There were 942 physicians who ordered a total of 15,320 genetic tests. By volume, commonly tested genes involved mutations for cystic fibrosis (36.7%), prothrombin (13.7%), Tay-Sachs disease (6.7%), hereditary hemochromatosis (4.4%), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (4.1%). EMRs stored reports as free text with categorical descriptions of mutations and an average length of 269.4+/-153.2 words (median 242, IQR 146-401). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, genetic tests were often ordered by a diverse group of physicians for women of childbearing age being evaluated for diseases that may affect potential offspring. EMRs currently serve primarily as a storage warehouse for textual reports that could potentially be transformed into meaningful structured data for next-generation clinical decision support. Further studies are needed to address the design, development, and implementation of EMRs capable of managing the critical genetic health information challenges of the future.","['Ronquillo, Jeremiah Geronimo', 'Li, Cheng', 'Lester, William T']","['Ronquillo JG', 'Li C', 'Lester WT']","['Laboratory of Computer Science, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA. jronquillo@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120417,England,J Am Med Inform Assoc,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,9430800,,IM,"['Adult', 'Data Collection', '*Electronic Health Records/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', '*Genetic Testing/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Massachusetts', ""*Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Primary Health Care', 'Retrospective Studies']",2012/04/19 06:00,2012/12/21 06:00,['2012/04/19 06:00'],"['2012/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/21 06:00 [medline]']","['amiajnl-2011-000621 [pii]', '10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000621 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2012 Jul-Aug;19(4):570-4. doi: 10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000621.

He was treated with high dose of steroids resulting in a rapid suppression of the eosinophilia. Two weeks later, the eosinophilia had relapsed, so a bone marrow aspiration was performed. Cytomorphological examination of the bone marrow showed typical ALL features, while flow cytometric analysis revealed an My+pre-B-ALL immunophenotype, and chromosome analysis of bone marrow showed a normal karyotype. He received chemotherapy according to the standard protocol for ALL and died from refractory respiratory failure and congestive heart failure immediately after antileukemic therapy.

The exact mechanisms have remained elusive until now, however. LCs synthesize the highest amounts of IL-15R-alpha mRNA and protein, which binds IL-15 for presentation to responder lymphocytes, thereby signaling the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (pSTAT5). LCs electroporated with Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) mRNA achieve sufficiently sustained presentation of antigenic peptides, which together with IL-15R-alpha/IL-15, break tolerance against WT1 by stimulating robust autologous, WT1-specific cytolytic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). These CTLs develop from healthy persons after only 7 days' stimulation without exogenous cytokines and lyse MHC-restricted tumor targets, which include primary WT1(+) leukemic blasts. In contrast, moDCs require exogenous rhuIL-15 to phosphorylate STAT5 and attain stimulatory capacity comparable to LCs. LCs therefore provide a more potent costimulatory cytokine milieu for T-cell activation than do moDCs, thus accounting for their superior stimulation of MHC-restricted Ag-specific CTLs without need for exogenous cytokines. These data support the use of mRNA-electroporated LCs, or moDCs supplemented with exogenous rhuIL-15, as vaccines for cancer immunotherapy to break tolerance against self-differentiation antigens shared by tumors.","['Romano, Emanuela', 'Cotari, Jesse W', 'Barreira da Silva, Rosa', 'Betts, Brian C', 'Chung, David J', 'Avogadri, Francesca', 'Fink, Mitsu J', 'St Angelo, Erin T', 'Mehrara, Babak', 'Heller, Glenn', 'Munz, Christian', 'Altan-Bonnet, Gregoire', 'Young, James W']","['Romano E', 'Cotari JW', 'Barreira da Silva R', 'Betts BC', 'Chung DJ', 'Avogadri F', 'Fink MJ', 'St Angelo ET', 'Mehrara B', 'Heller G', 'Munz C', 'Altan-Bonnet G', 'Young JW']","['Laboratory of Cellular Immunobiology, Immunology Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120417,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (IL15 protein, human)', '0 (IL15RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-15)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['*Antigen Presentation', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Cancer Vaccines/genetics/immunology/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Interleukin-15/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Langerhans Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Receptors, Interleukin-15/genetics/*immunology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/pathology', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics/*immunology']",2012/04/19 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2012/04/19 06:00'],"['2012/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47769-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-09-382200 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 May 31;119(22):5182-90. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-09-382200.

OPN suppresses the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells in vitro and may regulate the hematopoietic stem cell pool. Increased serum OPN concentrations occur in chronic myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In the present study, we analyzed the prognostic impact of OPN in AML by investigating the expression and relevance of OPN in newly diagnosed AML patients from 2 large study groups (the German AML Cooperative Group and the Dutch-Belgian Hematology Oncology Cooperative group). IHC (n = 84), ELISAs of blood/BM sera (n = 41), and microarray data for mRNA levels (n = 261) were performed. Expression of OPN protein was increased in AML patients both in BM blasts (IHC) and in BM serum (ELISA) compared with healthy controls. Patients expressing high levels of OPN within the BM (IHC) experienced shortened overall survival (OS; P = .025). Multivariate analysis identified karyotype, blast clearance (day 16), and the level of OPN expression as independent prognostic factors for OS. This prompted us to analyze microarray data from 261 patients from a third cohort. The analysis confirmed OPN as a prognostic marker. In summary, high OPN mRNA expression indicated decreased event-free survival (P = .0002) and OS (P = .001). The prognostic role of OPN was most prominent in intermediate-risk AML. These data provide evidence that OPN expression is an independent prognostic factor in AML.","['Liersch, Ruediger', 'Gerss, Joachim', 'Schliemann, Christoph', 'Bayer, Michael', 'Schwoppe, Christian', 'Biermann, Christoph', 'Appelmann, Iris', 'Kessler, Torsten', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Mesters, Rolf']","['Liersch R', 'Gerss J', 'Schliemann C', 'Bayer M', 'Schwoppe C', 'Biermann C', 'Appelmann I', 'Kessler T', 'Lowenberg B', 'Buchner T', 'Hiddemann W', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Berdel WE', 'Mesters R']","['Department of Medicine A--Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Muenster, Germany. rliersch@uni-muenster.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20120417,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blast Crisis/*metabolism/*mortality', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteopontin/*biosynthesis', 'Survival Rate']",2012/04/19 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2012/04/19 06:00'],"['2012/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47773-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-11-389692 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 May 31;119(22):5215-20. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-11-389692.

Polypeptides translated from truncated transcripts encoded by the NOTCH1 deletion allele retain the transmembrane domain of the receptor and are constitutively cleaved by the gamma-secretase complex, resulting in high levels of NOTCH1 signaling that can be effectively blocked by gamma-secretase inhibitors.

The small molecule 4EG-I selectively inhibits the cap-dependent translation of mRNAs. As multiple myeloma is an incurable disease that requires new therapeutic approaches, we investigated whether targeting the translation initiation pathway could be a target for myeloma therapy. METHODS: Six myeloma cell lines and primary samples were included in this study. The 4EGI-1 effect was determined by AnnexinV staining and caspase activation. Modification of Bcl-2 protein expression was analysed, and the significance of modified proteins was analysed by knock-down experiments. RESULTS: We demonstrated that 4EGI-1 impaired the assembly of the eIF4F complex and decreased the expression of the eIF4E-regulated proteins in myeloma cells. Furthermore, we showed that 4EGI-1 induced strong apoptosis in five out of six myeloma cell lines. Apoptosis is associated with the activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. The 4EGI-1 triggered Noxa induction only in cells undergoing apoptosis through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Furthermore, Noxa silencing prevented myeloma cells from 4EGI-1-induced apoptosis. Finally, Noxa induction led to a disruption of Mcl-1/Bim complexes in parallel to the generation of 'Mcl-1-free Noxa'. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that the use of inhibitors that directly target the translation initiation complex eIF4F could represent a potential novel approach for multiple myeloma therapy.","['Descamps, G', 'Gomez-Bougie, P', 'Tamburini, J', 'Green, A', 'Bouscary, D', 'Maiga, S', 'Moreau, P', 'Le Gouill, S', 'Pellat-Deceunynck, C', 'Amiot, M']","['Descamps G', 'Gomez-Bougie P', 'Tamburini J', 'Green A', 'Bouscary D', 'Maiga S', 'Moreau P', 'Le Gouill S', 'Pellat-Deceunynck C', 'Amiot M']","['Inserm, U892, Univ Nantes, CNRS, UMR 6299, Nantes, F-44000, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120417,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (4EGI-1 compound)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F)', '0 (Hydrazones)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitro Compounds)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Thiazoles)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4F/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Humans', 'Hydrazones', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitro Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/metabolism/*physiology', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology']",2012/04/19 06:00,2012/07/21 06:00,['2012/04/19 06:00'],"['2012/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2012139 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2012.139 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2012 May 8;106(10):1660-7. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2012.139.

Conversely, transcription repression depends primarily on the inhibitory interaction of c-Myc/Max with Miz-1 at DNA initiator elements. We recently described a distinct mechanism of c-Myc gene regulation, in which c-Myc interacts with the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) and is recruited to RAR DNA binding sequences (RAREs). In leukemia cells, this c-Myc/RARalpha complex functions either as an activator or a repressor of RARalpha-dependent targets through a phosphorylation switch. Unphosphorylated c-Myc interacts with RARalpha to repress the expression of RAR targets required for differentiation, thereby aggravating leukemia malignancy. However, if c-Myc is phosphorylated by the kinase Pak2, the c-Myc/RARalpha complex activates transcription of those same genes to stimulate differentiation, thus reducing tumor burden. Here, we discuss the role of c-Myc in balancing proliferation and differentiation and how modulating this previously unidentified c-Myc activity might provide alternative therapies against leukemia and possibly other types of tumors.","['Uribesalgo, Iris', 'Benitah, Salvador Aznar', 'Di Croce, Luciano']","['Uribesalgo I', 'Benitah SA', 'Di Croce L']","['Centre de Regulacio Genomica (CRG) and UPF, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120501,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (p21-Activated Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Epidermis/metabolism/pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', '*Genes, myc', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Niche', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'p21-Activated Kinases/metabolism']",2012/04/19 06:00,2012/09/18 06:00,['2012/04/19 06:00'],"['2012/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['19883 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.19883 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2012 May 1;11(9):1757-64. doi: 10.4161/cc.19883.

Different types and subtypes of acute leukemia require different treatments. In order to assign the correct treatment, a physician must identify the leukemia type or subtype. Advanced and precise methods are available for identifying leukemia types, but they are very expensive and not available in most hospitals in developing countries. Thus, alternative methods have been proposed. An option explored in this paper is based on the morphological properties of bone marrow images, where features are extracted from medical images and standard machine learning techniques are used to build leukemia type classifiers. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This paper studies the use of ensemble particle swarm model selection (EPSMS), which is an automated tool for the selection of classification models, in the context of acute leukemia classification. EPSMS is the application of particle swarm optimization to the exploration of the search space of ensembles that can be formed by heterogeneous classification models in a machine learning toolbox. EPSMS does not require prior domain knowledge and it is able to select highly accurate classification models without user intervention. Furthermore, specific models can be used for different classification tasks. RESULTS: We report experimental results for acute leukemia classification with real data and show that EPSMS outperformed the best results obtained using manually designed classifiers with the same data. The highest performance using EPSMS was of 97.68% for two-type classification problems and of 94.21% for more than two types problems. To the best of our knowledge, these are the best results reported for this data set. Compared with previous studies, these improvements were consistent among different type/subtype classification tasks, different features extracted from images, and different feature extraction regions. The performance improvements were statistically significant. We improved previous results by an average of 6% and there are improvements of more than 20% with some settings. In addition to the performance improvements, we demonstrated that no manual effort was required during acute leukemia type/subtype classification. CONCLUSIONS: Morphological classification of acute leukemia using EPSMS provides an alternative to expensive diagnostic methods in developing countries. EPSMS is a highly effective method for the automated construction of ensemble classifiers for acute leukemia classification, which requires no significant user intervention. EPSMS could also be used to address other medical classification tasks.","['Escalante, Hugo Jair', 'Montes-y-Gomez, Manuel', 'Gonzalez, Jesus A', 'Gomez-Gil, Pilar', 'Altamirano, Leopoldo', 'Reyes, Carlos A', 'Reta, Carolina', 'Rosales, Alejandro']","['Escalante HJ', 'Montes-y-Gomez M', 'Gonzalez JA', 'Gomez-Gil P', 'Altamirano L', 'Reyes CA', 'Reta C', 'Rosales A']","['National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics, Department of Computational Sciences, Luis Enrique Erro # 1, Tonantzintla, Puebla 72840, Mexico. hugojair@inaoep.mx']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120415,Netherlands,Artif Intell Med,Artificial intelligence in medicine,8915031,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*classification/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Leukemia/*classification/diagnosis', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated/*methods']",2012/04/19 06:00,2012/10/30 06:00,['2012/04/19 06:00'],"['2011/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/13 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0933-3657(12)00045-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.artmed.2012.03.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Artif Intell Med. 2012 Jul;55(3):163-75. doi: 10.1016/j.artmed.2012.03.005.

Deregulation of several miRNAs has been identified in RB, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis. Recent evidence suggests that many dietary components like folate, retinoids and curcumin act as potential anticancer/antiproliferative agents by regulating the expression of miRNA. In this study, we investigated the effect of phenolic compound curcumin on miRNA expression in Y79 RB cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the expression profile of miRNA by microarray analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in curcumin-treated Y79 RB cells. Transfection of miR-22 was performed using Lipofectamine 2000. Cell viability, in vitro scratch migration assay, prediction of miRNA targets and Western blot analysis were performed to determine the biological function of miR-22 in Y79 RB cells. RESULTS: In Y79 RB cells treated with curcumin, 5 human miRNAs were upregulated and 16 were downregulated as detected with the miRNA microarray analysis. miR-22, a tumor-suppressor miRNA was one of the miRNA which was upregulated by curcumin. Transfected miR-22 Y79 cells inhibited the cell proliferation and reduced the migration, and erythoblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3 (Erbb3) was confirmed to be the target gene of miR-22. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that curcumin modulate the miRNA expression profile, thereby exerting its anticancer effects on RB cells.","['Sreenivasan, Seethalakshmi', 'Thirumalai, Karthiyaini', 'Danda, Ravikanth', 'Krishnakumar, Subramanian']","['Sreenivasan S', 'Thirumalai K', 'Danda R', 'Krishnakumar S']","['L&T Department of Ocular Pathology, Vision Research Foundation, Sankara Nethralaya, Nungambakkam, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Curr Eye Res,Current eye research,8104312,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Genes, Retinoblastoma/drug effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retina/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Retinal Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/04/19 06:00,2012/07/17 06:00,['2012/04/19 06:00'],"['2012/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/02713683.2011.647224 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Eye Res. 2012 May;37(5):421-8. doi: 10.3109/02713683.2011.647224.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: With interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, we looked for 11q22 deletion, 17p13 deletion, and trisomy 12. A second FISH was performed approximately 3 yr after the first one or earlier in case of disease progression. RESULTS: High-risk CE, defined as the acquisition of a new 11q or 17p deletion, was observed in 11.5% (11/95) of patients with CLL. The relative risk of CE was not influenced by CD38 and ZAP-70 expression, mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgVH), lymphocyte doubling time, and genomic aberrations observed with the first FISH or by treatment given between the sequential genetic analyses. Patients with high-risk CE had a significant shorter survival time (59 months vs. not reached, P = 0.0367). Multivariate analysis identified CE as the strongest independent prognostic marker regarding survival [hazard ratio (HR) 4.1, P = 0.01]. Clonal fluctuation, defined as disappearance of the 11q or 17p deletion, was seen in 11.5% (11/95) of patients. Most patients lost the high-risk clone after treatment despite persistence of a malignant clone. The disappearance of these genomic aberrations did not ameliorate outcome. A few patients have lost spontaneously a small 17p clone. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that CE and clonal fluctuation are common phenomena in CLL. CE was not limited to patients with pre-existing adverse prognostic factors. Acquiring high-risk CE was identified as the strongest independent prognostic factor for impaired survival.","['Janssens, Ann', 'Van Roy, Nadine', 'Poppe, Bruce', 'Noens, Lucien', 'Philippe, Jan', 'Speleman, Frank', 'Offner, Fritz']","['Janssens A', 'Van Roy N', 'Poppe B', 'Noens L', 'Philippe J', 'Speleman F', 'Offner F']","['Department of Haematology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.

We have previously reported that PTEN and SHIP- 1, PIP3 inositol phosphatases that negatively regulate the PI3-kinase signaling cascade, are disrupted in ATLL neoplasias. Overactivation of PI3-kinase signaling has an essential role in onset of ATLL. We report here that both PTEN and SHIP-1 are downregulated by Tax through the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Tax expression upregulated phosphorylated Akt, a downstream serine/threonine kinase in the PI3-kinase signaling cascade. Activation of NF-kappaB pathway also suppressed these phosphatases. An IkappaBDeltaN mutant which inhibits the activation of NF-kappaB prevented PIP3 phosphatase downregulation by Tax. The underlying mechanism of NF-kappaB mediated suppression of PIP3 phosphatases involved sequestration of the coactivator p300 by p65. These down-regulations of PIP3 phosphatases were found to be essential for the Tax-induced cell proliferation. Thus, our results suggest that HTLV-I Tax downregulates PIP3 phosphatases through the NF-kappaB pathway, resulting in increased activation of the PI3-kinase signaling cascade in human T-cells and contributing to leukemogenesis.","['Fukuda, Ryu-Ich', 'Tsuchiya, Kiyohito', 'Suzuki, Koji', 'Itoh, Katsuhiko', 'Fujita, Jun', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Tsuji, Takashi']","['Fukuda RI', 'Tsuchiya K', 'Suzuki K', 'Itoh K', 'Fujita J', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Tsuji T']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120320,United States,Int J Biochem Mol Biol,International journal of biochemistry and molecular biology,101532076,,,,2012/04/18 06:00,2012/04/18 06:01,['2012/04/18 06:00'],"['2012/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/18 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Biochem Mol Biol. 2012;3(1):95-104.

HA22 produced a high rate of complete remissions in drug-resistant hairy cell leukemia and has a lower response rate in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To understand why patients with ALL have poorer responses, we isolated an ALL cell line that is resistant to killing by HA22. The resistance is unstable; without HA22 the cells revert to HA22 sensitivity in 4 mo. We showed that in the resistant cell line, HA22 is unable to ADP ribosylate and inactivate elongation factor-2 (EF2), owing to a low level of DPH4 mRNA and protein, which prevents diphthamide biosynthesis and renders EF2 refractory to HA22. Analysis of the promoter region of the DPH4 gene shows that the CpG island was hypomethylated in the HA22-sensitive cells, heavily methylated in the resistant cells, and reverted to low methylation in the revertant cells. Our data show that immunotoxin resistance is associated with reversible CpG island methylation and silencing of DPH4 gene transcription. Incubation of sensitive cells with the methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine prevented the emergence of resistant cells, suggesting that this agent in combination with HA22 may be useful in the treatment of some cases of ALL.","['Wei, Hui', 'Xiang, Laiman', 'Wayne, Alan S', 'Chertov, Oleg', 'FitzGerald, David J', 'Bera, Tapan K', 'Pastan, Ira']","['Wei H', 'Xiang L', 'Wayne AS', 'Chertov O', 'FitzGerald DJ', 'Bera TK', 'Pastan I']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20120416,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNAJC24 protein, human)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factor 2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '2NDX4B6N8F (immunotoxin HA22)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Bacterial Toxins/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Exotoxins/*pharmacology', 'HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Elongation Factor 2/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/immunology']",2012/04/18 06:00,2012/07/11 06:00,['2012/04/18 06:00'],"['2012/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/11 06:00 [medline]']","['1204523109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1204523109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 May 1;109(18):6898-903. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1204523109.

Despite its role in a broad range of biological processes, the precise molecular mechanism of BRD4 function remains unknown.

Compared with a leukemia with a low frequency of LSCs, a leukemia with a high frequency of LSCs showed hypomethylation of the Gpx3 promoter region, and expressed high levels of Gpx3 and low levels of ROS. LSCs and normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) engineered to express Gpx3 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were much less competitive in vivo than control cells. However, progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation was not affected by Gpx3 shRNA. Consistent with this, HSCs overexpressing Gpx3 were significantly more competitive than control cells in long-term repopulation experiments, and overexpression of the self-renewal genes Prdm16 or Hoxb4 boosted Gpx3 expression.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 652 untreated AML patients with median age 47 years (range, 17 to 60 years) were randomly assigned to receive one of three induction regimens: DA (daunorubicin plus cytarabine), DAC (DA plus cladribine), or DAF (DA plus fludarabine). Postremission treatment was the same for all arms. RESULTS: Complete remission rate in the DAC arm was higher compared with the DA arm (67.5% v 56%; P = .01) as a consequence of reduced incidence of resistant disease (21% v 34%; P = .004). There was no significant difference in early outcome between the DAF and DA arms. The probability of overall survival was improved for the DAC arm (45% +/- 4% at 3 years) compared with the DA arm (33% +/- 4%; P = .02), and leukemia-free survival was comparable. Long-term outcome did not differ significantly for the comparison of the DAF and DA arms. A survival advantage of the DAC arm over the DA arm was observed among patients age 50 years or older (P = .005), those with initial leukocyte count above 50 x 10(9)/L (P = .03), and those with unfavorable karyotype (P = .03). DAF revealed a significant advantage over DA in patients with adverse karyotype (P = .02). CONCLUSION: The addition of cladribine to the standard induction regimen is associated with increased rate of complete remission and improved survival of adult patients with AML.","['Holowiecki, Jerzy', 'Grosicki, Sebastian', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien, Slawomira', 'Kuliczkowski, Kazimierz', 'Skotnicki, Aleksander B', 'Hellmann, Andrzej', 'Sulek, Kazimierz', 'Dmoszynska, Anna', 'Kloczko, Janusz', 'Jedrzejczak, Wieslaw W', 'Zdziarska, Barbara', 'Warzocha, Krzysztof', 'Zawilska, Krystyna', 'Komarnicki, Mieczyslaw', 'Kielbinski, Marek', 'Piatkowska-Jakubas, Beata', 'Wierzbowska, Agnieszka', 'Wach, Malgorzata', 'Haus, Olga']","['Holowiecki J', 'Grosicki S', 'Giebel S', 'Robak T', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien S', 'Kuliczkowski K', 'Skotnicki AB', 'Hellmann A', 'Sulek K', 'Dmoszynska A', 'Kloczko J', 'Jedrzejczak WW', 'Zdziarska B', 'Warzocha K', 'Zawilska K', 'Komarnicki M', 'Kielbinski M', 'Piatkowska-Jakubas B', 'Wierzbowska A', 'Wach M', 'Haus O']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center M.

The clinical presentation included small papules on the nose and cheeks and around the eyes mimicking granulomatous rosacea; nodules on the nose, cheeks, chin, or forehead mimicking phymatous rosacea; or a combination of both. Three patients had preexisting erythematotelangiectatic rosacea and 1 had rhinophyma. Based on a clinicopathologic correlation and B-cell clonality analysis, the diagnosis was primary cutaneous follicular center B-cell lymphoma in 4 cases, primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma in 6, and skin involvement of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 2. All patients had an indolent course as expected for their disease. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous involvement of B-cell neoplasms may mimic granulomatous rosacea or rhinophyma. This unusual clinical presentation is more common in women and appears in the setting of preexisting rosacea or as a new eruption. Proliferative B-cell disorders should be added to the differential diagnosis of symmetric papular or papulonodular eruptions of the face.","['Barzilai, Aviv', 'Feuerman, Hana', 'Quaglino, Pietro', 'David, Michael', 'Feinmesser, Meora', 'Halpern, Marisa', 'Feldberg, Edit', 'Tomasini, Carlo', 'Tabibian-Keissar, Hilla', 'Amarilgio, Ninette', 'Hodak, Emmilia']","['Barzilai A', 'Feuerman H', 'Quaglino P', 'David M', 'Feinmesser M', 'Halpern M', 'Feldberg E', 'Tomasini C', 'Tabibian-Keissar H', 'Amarilgio N', 'Hodak E']","['Department of Dermatology, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. avivb@post.tau.ac.il']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Face', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rhinophyma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Rosacea/diagnosis/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology']",2012/04/18 06:00,2012/09/28 06:00,['2012/04/18 06:00'],"['2012/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['archdermatol.2011.3575 [pii]', '10.1001/archdermatol.2011.3575 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 2012 Jul;148(7):824-31. doi: 10.1001/archdermatol.2011.3575.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine if mitoxantrone efflux from AML blasts would correlate with response to induction chemotherapy. METHODS: Flow cytometry was used to measure the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) for AML blasts incubated with mitoxantrone [an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter substrate] with or without coincubation with cyclosporine A (a broad-spectrum inhibitor of ABC transporters) and a ratio (MFIR) between the inhibited and uninhibited MFI was calculated. RESULTS: Among 174 AML patient blast samples, the mean MFIR for complete remission (CR) patients was lower than that obtained for induction failure (IF) patients (mean MFIR +/- SD 1.62 +/- 0.53 for CR after one cycle of chemotherapy vs. 2.22 +/- 1.29 for CR after two cycles and 2.59 +/- 0.98 for IF, P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis determined 2.45 as the MFIR threshold above which 29% of patients achieved CR vs. a CR rate of 84% when the MFIR was </= 2.45 (P < 0.0001). In AML patients with normal karyotype (n = 80), CR was obtained for 33% of patients with an MFIR > 2.45 vs. 89% of those with MFIR </= 2.45 (P < 0.0001). In patients > age 60 (n = 77), 30% vs. 87% of those with MFIR > vs. </= 2.45 achieved CR (P < 0.0001).

It is suggested to be expressed more weakly in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The analysis of MNDA therefore may improve diagnostic capabilities of multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) in MDS. METHODS: We used MFC for detection of MNDA expression in 269 patients with suspected or known MDS, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), cytopenia of unknown cause or without malignancy (negative controls). Results were compared with the diagnoses revealed by cytomorphology (CM) and cytogenetics (CG). RESULTS: Percentages of granulocytes and monocytes with diminished MNDA expression (dimG and dimM) were higher in patients with MDS (mean +/- SD, 20% +/- 20%, P < 0.001 and 31% +/- 24%, P < 0.001) and AML (27% +/- 27%, P = 0.007 and 45% +/- 31%, P = 0.001) diagnosed by CM, vs. patients without MDS (8% +/- 10% and 16% +/- 11%), respectively. Significant differences were also found for mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of MNDA in monocytes which was lower in MDS (mean +/- SD, 71 +/- 36, P = 0.004) and AML (55 +/- 39, P < 0.001) vs. no MDS samples (85 +/- 28), respectively. Within patients with MDS, cases with cytogenetic aberrations showed a trend to higher %dimG (24% +/- 18%, P = 0.083) compared with those without (16% +/- 21%). Cut-off values for %dimG (12%) and %dimM (22%) as well as for MFI in monocytes (72) were defined capable of discriminating between MDS and non-MDS. CONCLUSION: MNDA expression in bone marrow cells can be assessed reliably by MFC and may facilitate evaluation of dyspoiesis when added to a standard MDS MFC panel.","['Bellos, Frauke', 'Alpermann, Tamara', 'Gouberman, Elena', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Kern, Wolfgang']","['Bellos F', 'Alpermann T', 'Gouberman E', 'Haferlach C', 'Schnittger S', 'Haferlach T', 'Kern W']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20120517,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

A total of 27 patients (1.8%) were classified as having PPCL. As a group, these patients more often had low hemoglobin, high beta-2-microglobulin, high lactate dehydrogenase, low albumin and cytogenetic abnormalities. Among 866 patients with GEP results, the PPCL group more often had disease that was classified as high risk, and in CD-1 and MF molecular subgroups. Regardless of the therapeutic protocol, patients with PPCL had shorter median overall survival (OS; 1.8 years), progression-free survival (PFS; 0.8 years) and complete response duration (CRD; 1.3 years) than the remainder, whose clinical outcomes had improved markedly with successive protocols. Multivariate analyses of pretreatment parameters showed that PPCL was a highly significant independent adverse feature linked to OS, PFS and CRD. In GEP analyses, 203 gene probes distinguished PPCL from non-PPCL; the identified genes were involved in the LXR/RXR activation, inositol metabolism, hepatic fibrosis/hepatic stellate-cell activation and lipopolysaccharide/interleukin-1-mediated inhibition of RXR function pathways.

In addition, a large proportion of hepatic lymphomas are of B-cell origin. The molecular signals that regulate normal and malignant B-cell recruitment into peripheral tissue from blood are poorly understood, leading us to study human B-cell migration through hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells in flow-based adhesion assays. In such assays, human blood-derived B cells were captured from shear flow without a previous rolling phase and underwent firm adhesion mediated by vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Unlike T cells, which displayed vigorous crawling behavior on the endothelium, B cells remained static before a proportion underwent transendothelial migration mediated by a combination of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular adhesion protein-1, common lymphatic endothelial and vascular endothelial receptor-1/stabilin-1, and the chemokine receptors, CXCR3 and CXCR4. B-cell lymphoma cell lines and primary malignant B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and marginal zone B cell lymphoma also underwent integrin-mediated firm adhesion involving ICAM-1 and/or VCAM-1 and demonstrated ICAM-1-dependent shape-change and crawling behavior. Unlike primary lymphocytes, the malignant cells did not undergo transendothelial migration, which could explain why lymphomas are frequently characterized by the intravascular accumulation of malignant cells in the hepatic sinusoids. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that distinct combinations of signals promote B-cell recruitment to the liver, suggesting the possibility of novel targets to modulate liver inflammation in disease. Certain features of lymphocyte homing are maintained in lymphoma recruitment to the liver, suggesting that therapeutic targets for lymphocyte recruitment may also prevent hepatic lymphoma dissemination.","['Shetty, Shishir', 'Bruns, Tony', 'Weston, Christopher J', 'Stamataki, Zania', 'Oo, Ye H', 'Long, Heather M', 'Reynolds, Gary M', 'Pratt, Guy', 'Moss, Paul', 'Jalkanen, Sirpa', 'Hubscher, Stefan G', 'Lalor, Patricia F', 'Adams, David H']","['Shetty S', 'Bruns T', 'Weston CJ', 'Stamataki Z', 'Oo YH', 'Long HM', 'Reynolds GM', 'Pratt G', 'Moss P', 'Jalkanen S', 'Hubscher SG', 'Lalor PF', 'Adams DH']","['Center for Liver Research, School of Immunity and Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom. s.shetty@bham.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Communication/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured/*cytology/physiology', 'Endothelial Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hepatocytes/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Liver/cytology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology', 'Male', 'Reference Values', 'Sampling Studies']",2012/04/18 06:00,2013/01/18 06:00,['2012/04/18 06:00'],"['2012/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hep.25790 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2012 Oct;56(4):1521-31. doi: 10.1002/hep.25790.,['Copyright (c) 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.'],"['G0700301/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G1002552/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The anti-proliferative activity of these agents against human leukemia and various solid tumor cell growth in vitro was studied. The structure-activity relationship studies revealed that the bis(alkylcarbamates) derivatives are generally more cytotoxic than the corresponding bis(hydroxymethyl) congeners in inhibiting human lymphoblastic leukemia CCRF-CEM and various human solid tumor cell growth in culture. These agents have no cross-resistance to taxol or vinblastine.

It is likely that each subtype of acute leukemia represents a different setting for the development of thrombosis and the risk of bleeding. This is perhaps due to a combination of different disease-specific pathogenic mechanisms of thrombosis, including the type of chemotherapy protocol chosen, the underlying patients health, associated risk factors, as well as the biology of the disease itself. The risk of thrombosis may also vary according to ethnicity and prevalence of hereditary risk factors for thrombosis; thus, it is advisable for Latin American, Asian, and African countries to report on their specific patient population.","['Crespo-Solis, Erick']",['Crespo-Solis E'],"['Clinica de Leucemia Aguda, Departamento de Hematologia y Oncologia, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Mexico City, Mexico. erickerickmx@yahoo.com.mx']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'Thrombophilia, hereditary']",IM,"['Adult', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombophilia/complications', 'Thrombosis/*etiology/prevention & control/therapy']",2012/04/25 06:00,2012/08/15 06:00,['2012/04/18 06:00'],"['2012/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453312X13336169156852 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2012 Apr;17 Suppl 1:S169-73. doi: 10.1179/102453312X13336169156852.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in these countries is considered salvage therapy for eligible patients who failed TKI or progress to advanced disease stages. In Latin America, treatment for CML also changed with availability of TKI in the region. However, many challenges remain, as the cost of this class of medication and recommended monitoring is high. CML treatment practices in Latin America demonstrate that the majority of patients are treated with TKI at some point after diagnosis, most commonly imatinib mesylate, but still TKI can only be used after interferon failure in some countries. Other treatment practices are different from established international guidelines, outlying the importance of continuing medical education. Allogeneic HCT is a treatment option for CML in this region and could be considered a cost-effective approach in a small subset of young patients with available donors, as the overall cost of long-term non-transplant treatment may surpass the cost of transplantation. However, there are many challenges with HCT in Latin America such as access to experienced transplant centers, donor availability, and cost of essential drugs used after transplant, which further impacts expansion of this treatment approach in patients in need. In conclusion, Latin American patients with CML have access to state of the art CML treatment. Yet, drug costs have a tremendous impact on developing health systems. Optimization of CML treatment in the region with appropriate monitoring, recognizing patients who would be transplant candidates, and expanding access to transplantation for eligible patients may curtail these costs and further improve patient care.","['Pasquini, Marcelo C']",['Pasquini MC'],"['Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation (CIBMTR), Medical College of Wisconsin, 9200 W.

Although a number of molecular markers and pathways have been identified and may serve as potential therapeutic targets, the best studied amongst these include FMS like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and Janus kinase (JAK-2). In this review we discuss the molecular biology of AML, with a special focus on the above mentioned pathways. We discuss novel molecular targeted therapies that are in preclinical and clinical development. These include AC-220, sorafenib and midostaurin in FLT3 mutated patients; GSK1120212 and MSC1936369B in RAS mutated patients; and INCB018424 in JAK2 mutated patients.

Most AML patients in complete remission now can undergo allogeneic HCT procedures with an anticipated result that approaches that obtained with sibling donors and myeloablative conditioning (MAC). Treatment-related mortality (TRM), relapse, GVHD and, for umbilical cord blood (UCB) grafts, slow engraftment/engraftment failures, however, continue to plague HCT. Newer strategies include the use of double unit UCB HCT and ex vivo expansion of UCB units using: multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs); polyamine copper chelator tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA); and Notch ligand. Haploidentical bone marrow and blood HCT are increasing in numbers given the improved outcome with post-HCT cyclophosphamide therapy. Novel chemotherapeutic preparative regimens incorporating agents such as clofarabine and treosulfan, and novel radiation preparative regimens utilizing selective radiation approaches (helical tomotherapy) and targeted myeloablative radioimmunotherapy appear to enhance the anti-AML effect. Immunological approaches with chimeric antigen receptor-redirected T lymphocytes have been added to the armamentarium. Other novel maneuvers include more sophisticated T-cell depletion of the donor graft and post-transplant immunotherapy with regulatory T cell (Treg) therapy and MSCs for GVHD prevention.

The experience of International Consortium on Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (IC-APL).,S36-8,10.1179/102453312X13336169155376 [doi],"OBJECTIVES: Several clinical trials conducted in Europe and US reported favorable outcomes of patients with APL treated with the combination of all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and anthracyclines. Nevertheless, the results observed in developing countries with the same regimen was poorer, mainly due to high early mortality mainly due bleeding. The International Consortium on Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (IC-APL) is an initiative of the International Members Committee of the ASH and the project aims to reduce this gap through the establishment of international network, which was launched in Brazil, Mexico and Uruguay. METHODS: The IC-APL treatment protocol is similar to the PETHEMA 2005, but changing idarubicin to daunorubicin. All patients with a suspected diagnosis of APL were immediately started on ATRA, while bone marrow samples were shipped to a national central lab where genetic verification of the diagnosis was performed. The immunofluorescence using an anti-PML antibody allowed a rapid confirmation of the diagnosis and, the importance of supportive measures was reinforced. RESULTS: The interim analysis of 97 patients enrolled in the IC-APL protocol showed that complete remission (CR) rate was 83% and the 2-year overall survival and disease-free survival were 80% and 90%, respectively. Of note, the early mortality rate was reduced to 7.5%. DISCUSSION: The results of IC-APL demonstrate the impact of educational programs and networking on the improvement of the leukemia treatment outcome in developing countries.","['Rego, Eduardo M', 'Kim, Haesook T', 'Ruiz-Arguelles, Guillermo J', 'Uriarte, Maria del Rosario', 'Jacomo, Rafael H', 'Gutierrez-Aguirre, Homero', 'Melo, Raul A M', 'Bittencourt, Rosane', 'Pasquini, Ricardo', 'Pagnano, Katia', 'Fagundes, Evandro M', 'Chauffaille, Maria de Lourdes', 'Chiattone, Carlos', 'Martinez, Lem', 'Meillon, Luis A', 'Gomez-Almaguer, David', 'Kwaan, Hau', 'Garces-Eisele, Javier', 'Gallagher, Robert', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte M', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Ribeiro, Raul', 'LoCoco, Francesco', 'Sanz, Miguel A']","['Rego EM', 'Kim HT', 'Ruiz-Arguelles GJ', 'Uriarte Mdel R', 'Jacomo RH', 'Gutierrez-Aguirre H', 'Melo RA', 'Bittencourt R', 'Pasquini R', 'Pagnano K', 'Fagundes EM', 'Chauffaille Mde L', 'Chiattone C', 'Martinez L', 'Meillon LA', 'Gomez-Almaguer D', 'Kwaan H', 'Garces-Eisele J', 'Gallagher R', 'Niemeyer CM', 'Lowenberg B', 'Ribeiro R', 'LoCoco F', 'Sanz MA']","['Hematology Service, Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil. emrego@hcrp.fmrp.usp.br']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Brazil', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'Daunorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Developing Countries', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Education, Medical', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mexico', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Uruguay']",2012/04/25 06:00,2012/08/15 06:00,['2012/04/18 06:00'],"['2012/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453312X13336169155376 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2012 Apr;17 Suppl 1:S36-8. doi: 10.1179/102453312X13336169155376.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequently, a novel RNA retrovirus, human T-cell leukemia/lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) was isolated from a cell line established from the leukemic cells of an ATL patient, and the finding of a clear association with ATL led to its inclusion among human carcinogenic pathogens. The three major routes of HTLV-1 transmission are mother-to-child infections via breast milk, sexual intercourse, and blood transfusions. HTLV-1 infection early in life, presumably from breast feeding, is crucial in the development of ATL. The diversity in clinical features and prognosis of patients with this disease has led to its subtype-classification into four categories, acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types defined by organ involvement, and LDH and calcium values. In cases of acute, lymphoma, or unfavorable chronic subtypes (aggressive ATL), intensive chemotherapy such as VCAP-AMP-VECP is usually recommended. In cases of favorable chronic or smoldering ATL (indolent ATL), watchful waiting until disease progression has been recommended although the long term prognosis was inferior to those of, for instance, chronic lymphoid leukemia. Retrospective analysis suggested that the combination of interferon alpha and zidovudine was apparently promising for the treatment of ATL, especially for types with leukemic manifestation. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is also promising for the treatment of aggressive ATL possibly reflecting graft vs. ATL effect. Several new agent-trials for ATL are ongoing and in preparation, including a defucosylated humanized anti-CC chemokine receptor 4 monoclonal antibody. Two steps should be considered for the prevention of HTLV-1-associated ATL. The first is the prevention of HTLV-1 infections and the second is the prevention of ATL among HTLV-1 carriers. So far, no agent has been found to be effective for the latter. Further investigation on the pathogenesis of ATL is crucial for the prevention and treatment of this refractory leukemia-lymphoma.","['Tsukasaki, Kunihiro']",['Tsukasaki K'],"['Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Science, Nagasaki, Japan. tsukasak@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'RSA8KO39WH (Vindesine)', 'LSG15 regimen']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Carboplatin/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/therapeutic use', 'HTLV-I Infections/complications/prevention & control/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology/*therapy/*virology', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/therapeutic use', 'Prednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use', 'Vindesine/therapeutic use']",2012/04/25 06:00,2012/08/15 06:00,['2012/04/18 06:00'],"['2012/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453312X13336169155330 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2012 Apr;17 Suppl 1:S32-5. doi: 10.1179/102453312X13336169155330.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Telomeres are repeated hexanucleotides and their associated proteins; the protect chromosomes from recognition as damaged DNA, and their inevitable gradual loss with DNA replication is harmless as they are noncoding. However, when telomeres become critically short in a cell, senescence, apoptosis, or, rarely malignant transformation results. In individuals with mutations in genes involved in telomere repair, especially the enzymatic telomerase complex, telomere attrition is accelerated. Severe deficiencies result in dyskeratosis congenita, a congenital aplastic anemia with associated mucocutaneous abnormalities. Mutations in TERT, the catalytic component, and TERC, the RNA template, can behave as risk factors for the development of bone marrow failure, pulmonary fibrosis, and hepatic cirrhosis. Both penetrance and organ specificity are variable and not well understood. Chromosome instability is a result of critical shortening of telomeres and cancer. For example, short telomeres are the major prognostic risk factor for clonal evolution to myelodysplasia and acute leukemia. Practically, hematologists need to recognize the multisystem presentation of telomere disease, implications for outcomes, and options for therapy.","['Young, Neal S']",['Young NS'],"['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA. youngns@nhlbi.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/genetics/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/genetics/*pathology', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Dyskeratosis Congenita/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Telomerase/genetics/metabolism', 'Telomere/*genetics/*pathology']",2012/04/25 06:00,2012/08/15 06:00,['2012/04/18 06:00'],"['2012/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453312X13336169155132 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2012 Apr;17 Suppl 1:S18-21. doi: 10.1179/102453312X13336169155132.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the main route of exposure to these compounds is inhalation, in order to gain new insights regarding their systemic genotoxicity, Fisher 344 male rats were exposed in full-body inhalation chambers, 6 h/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks to styrene-7,8-oxide (25, 50, and 75 ppm) or styrene (75, 300, and 1000 ppm). Then, the induction of micronuclei in circulating reticulocytes and DNA strand breaks in leukocytes using the comet assay was studied at the end of the 3rd and 20th days of exposure. Our results showed that neither styrene nor styrene-7,8-oxide induced a significant increase of the micronucleus frequency in reticulocytes or DNA strand breaks in white blood cells. However, in the presence of the formamidopyridine DNA glycosylase, an enzyme able to recognize and excise DNA at the level of some oxidized DNA bases, a significant increase of DNA damages was observed at the end of the 3rd day of treatment in leukocytes from rats exposed to styrene but not to styrene-7,8-oxide. This experimental design helped to gather new information regarding the systemic genotoxicity of these two chemicals and may be valuable for the risk assessment associated with an occupational exposure to these molecules.","['Gate, Laurent', 'Micillino, Jean-Claude', 'Sebillaud, Sylvie', 'Langlais, Cristina', 'Cosnier, Frederic', 'Nunge, Herve', 'Darne, Christian', 'Guichard, Yves', 'Binet, Stephane']","['Gate L', 'Micillino JC', 'Sebillaud S', 'Langlais C', 'Cosnier F', 'Nunge H', 'Darne C', 'Guichard Y', 'Binet S']","['Institut National de Recherche et Securite, Rue du Morvan, CS 60027, 54519 Vandoeuvre les Nancy Cedex, France.

Using alpha-dystrobrevin as indicator, we aimed to elucidate the interaction network of the DAPC with other proteins during apoptosis of promyelocytic HL-60 cells. The precise role(s) of DBs are not known, but we and others have shown that they play a role in intracellular signal transduction and cellular organization. Apoptosis was induced with etoposide in the absence or presence of Z-VAD to block caspase activity, and we then followed the cellular distribution of alpha-DB and its association with other proteins, using confocal imaging and cell fractions analyses after immune-precipitation with anti-alpha-DB and mass spectrometry. Confocal imaging revealed distinct spatial relocalizations of alpha-DB between the cell membrane, cytosol and nucleus after induction of apoptosis. The expression levels of the identified proteins were evaluated with computer-assisted image analysis of the gels. We thus identified associations with structural and transport proteins (tropomyosin, myosin), membrane (ADAM21, syntrophin), ER-Golgi (TGN51, eIF38) and nuclear (Lamins, ribonucleoprotein C1/C2) proteins. These results suggest that apoptosis-induction in HL-60 cells involves not only classical markers of apoptosis but also a network alpha-DB-associated proteins at the cell membrane, the cytoplasm and nucleus, affecting key cellular transport processes and cellular structure.","['Navakauskiene, Ruta', 'Treigyte, Grazina', 'Borutinskaite, Veronika-Viktorija', 'Matuzevicius, Dalius', 'Navakauskas, Dalius', 'Magnusson, Karl-Eric']","['Navakauskiene R', 'Treigyte G', 'Borutinskaite VV', 'Matuzevicius D', 'Navakauskas D', 'Magnusson KE']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania. ruta.navakauskiene@bchi.vu.lt']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120404,Netherlands,J Proteomics,Journal of proteomics,101475056,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Dystrophin-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-valyl-alanyl-aspartic acid)', '0 (dystrobrevin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Dystrophin-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology']",2012/04/18 06:00,2012/10/04 06:00,['2012/04/18 06:00'],"['2011/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1874-3919(12)00192-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jprot.2012.03.041 [doi]']",ppublish,J Proteomics. 2012 Jun 18;75(11):3291-303. doi: 10.1016/j.jprot.2012.03.041.

The hepatic stellate cell (HSC) is a key target of anti-fibrotic therapies. Imatinib mesylate is a small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor indicated for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia and GI stromal tumours. DESIGN: Because imatinib inhibits beta-PDGFR signalling, which stimulates HSC proliferation, we assessed its activity in culture and in vivo, and examined downstream targets in a human stellate cell line (LX-2) using cDNA microarray. METHODS AND RESULTS: Imatinib inhibited proliferation of LX-2 cells (0.5-10 mM) but not primary human stellate cells, with no effect on viability, associated with attenuated beta-PDGFR phosphorylation. Mitochondrial activity and superoxide anion production were decreased in response to imatinib. cDNA microarray uncovered up-regulation of 29 genes in response to imatinib, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA, which was correlated with progressive IL-6 secretion. Imatinib also decreased gene expression of collagen alpha(1) (I), alpha smooth muscle actin, beta-PDGFR, transforming growth factor beta receptor type 1, matrix metalloproteinase 2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2. In vivo, imatinib administered to rats beginning 4 weeks after starting thioacetamide (TAA) led to reduced collagen content, with significant reductions in portal pressure and down-regulation of fibrogenic genes in whole liver. Importantly, hepatic IL-6 mRNA levels were significantly increased in TAA-treated animals receiving imatinib. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reinforce the anti-fibrotic activity of imatinib and uncover an unexpected link between inhibition of HSC activation by imatinib and enhanced secretion of IL-6, a regenerative cytokine.","['Kim, Youngchul', 'Fiel, Maria I', 'Albanis, Efsevia', 'Chou, Hsin I', 'Zhang, Weijia', 'Khitrov, Gregory', 'Friedman, Scott L']","['Kim Y', 'Fiel MI', 'Albanis E', 'Chou HI', 'Zhang W', 'Khitrov G', 'Friedman SL']","['Division of Liver Diseases, Department of Medicine, The Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029-6574, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120416,United States,Liver Int,Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,101160857,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '075T165X8M (Thioacetamide)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Hepatic Stellate Cells/*drug effects/enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Liver Cirrhosis, Experimental/chemically induced/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Thioacetamide', 'Time Factors', 'Up-Regulation']",2012/04/18 06:00,2012/10/12 06:00,['2012/04/18 06:00'],"['2011/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1478-3231.2012.02806.x [doi]'],ppublish,Liver Int. 2012 Jul;32(6):1008-17. doi: 10.1111/j.1478-3231.2012.02806.x.

Using immunoproteomics, we report the identification of immunogenic 43 kDa fragment of band 3 in 68% of CML samples compared to their detection in only 38% of healthy individuals. Thus, excessive fragmentation of band 3 in CML, detected in our study, corroborated with the eryptotic phenotype.

CD40 ligation on CLL cells, which can be achieved using adenovirus encoding chimeric CD154 (Ad-ISF35), enhances their ability to function as antigen-presenting cells and increases their sensitivity to clearance by immune-effector mechanisms. In this study, we report the results of a first-in-man phase I trial of intranodal direct injection (IDI) of Ad-ISF35 in patients with CLL to evaluate toxicity, safety, and tolerability. Fifteen patients received a single IDI of 1 x 10(10) to 33 x 10(10) Ad-ISF35 viral particles (vp), with a defined maximum tolerated dose as 1 x 10(11) vp. Although the most common adverse events were transient grade 1 to 2 pain at the injection site and flu-like symptoms following IDI, some patients receiving the highest dose had transient, asymptomatic grade 3 to 4 hypophosphatemia, neutropenia, or transaminitis. Increased expression of death receptor, immune costimulatory molecules, and Ad-ISF35 vector DNA was detected in circulating CLL cells. Notably, we also observed preliminary clinical responses, including reductions in leukemia cell counts, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. Six patients did not require additional therapy for more than 6 months, and three achieved a partial remission. In conclusion, Ad-ISF35 IDI was safely delivered in patients with CLLs and induced systemic biologic and clinical responses. These results provide the rationale for phase II studies in CLLs, lymphomas, and CD40-expressing solid tumors.","['Castro, Januario E', 'Melo-Cardenas, Johanna', 'Urquiza, Mauricio', 'Barajas-Gamboa, Juan S', 'Pakbaz, Ramin S', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Castro JE', 'Melo-Cardenas J', 'Urquiza M', 'Barajas-Gamboa JS', 'Pakbaz RS', 'Kipps TJ']","['University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20120413,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Aged', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'CD40 Ligand/*genetics/*immunology', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Female', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology']",2012/04/17 06:00,2012/09/05 06:00,['2012/04/17 06:00'],"['2012/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-11-3368 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-3368 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2012 Jun 15;72(12):2937-48. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-3368.

Here we present the laboratory evaluation of the commercially available kit. METHODS: Mononuclear cells were isolated, lysed and processed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Anti-BCR antibodies adsorbed to capture beads bind the BCR-ABL fusion proteins of the lysed cells, a phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-ABL antibody is the detector reagent and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) signals were recorded by flow cytometry. Detection of t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation was carried out with a quantitative PCR assay. RESULTS: MFI results of 20 normal peripheral blood samples were 88+/-8 (mean+/-SD), CV 9%. K562 cells were used as positive control. Within-batch imprecision was excellent (3.7% in the normal and 10% in the pathological range). Cut-off was chosen at MFI 112, where both sensitivity and specificity were 100%. Altogether 17 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and 16 acute leukemia samples were analyzed. All PCR positive samples (n=14) were positive with the FC method and negative results were also concordant (n=15). Frozen cell lysates can be stored up to 4 weeks without significant decrease of MFI signal. CONCLUSIONS: The FC BCR-ABL assay is a fast, reproducible and reliable method that may be incorporated into standard flow cytometric protocols to help clinical decision-making.","['Hevessy, Zsuzsanna', 'Hudak, Renata', 'Kiss-Sziraki, Valeria', 'Antal-Szalmas, Peter', 'Udvardy, Miklos', 'Rejto, Laszlo', 'Szerafin, Laszlo', 'Kappelmayer, Janos']","['Hevessy Z', 'Hudak R', 'Kiss-Sziraki V', 'Antal-Szalmas P', 'Udvardy M', 'Rejto L', 'Szerafin L', 'Kappelmayer J']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111217,Germany,Clin Chem Lab Med,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,9806306,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Flow Cytometry/*methods/standards', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*blood/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay/*methods/standards', '*Laboratories', 'Leukemia/blood', '*Microspheres', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reference Standards']",2012/04/17 06:00,2012/08/11 06:00,['2012/04/17 06:00'],"['2011/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1515/cclm.2011.834 [doi]', '/j/cclm.2012.50.issue-4/cclm.2011.834/cclm.2011.834.xml [pii]']",epublish,Clin Chem Lab Med. 2011 Dec 17;50(4):689-92. doi: 10.1515/cclm.2011.834.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though efforts have been made to decrease received doses to as low as reasonably achievable, the possibility of accidental exposure has to be considered as well. Mammalian gestation is usually divided into three periods. Radiation exposure during the 'pre-implantation period' may essentially result in embryonic mortality while exposure during the 'organogenesis period' may characteristically lead to malformations. In humans, the 'fetal period' is one of particular sensitivity to radiation induction of mental retardation, especially if the exposure occurs between weeks 8-15 of gestation. It is also admitted that prenatal irradiation may increase the risk of leukemia and childhood cancer, with an equal risk over the whole pregnancy. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of moderate to high doses of X-irradiation on mouse skin fetal fibroblasts, one of the cell types subjected to the highest dose of radiation. Exposure of the cells to X-rays led to a rapid and significant increase in gamma-H2AX foci, indicative of high levels of DNA double strand breaks. High doses (>2 Gy) also led to a pronounced G2-arrest and a decrease in the number of cells in the S phase, which was followed after 24 h by a decrease in cell survival and an increase in the level of apoptosis and necrosis. This study shows that mouse fetal skin fibroblasts are sensitive to high doses of X-irradiation. Furthermore, we report a better repair for higher doses than lower, which seems to indicate that little DNA damage is not necessarily repaired immediately. However, more sensitive approaches are necessary to identify the risk associated with low doses of radiation.","['Beck, Michael', 'Moreels, Marjan', 'Jacquet, Paul', 'Van Oostveldt, Patrick', 'De Vos, Winnok H', 'Baatout, Sarah']","['Beck M', 'Moreels M', 'Jacquet P', 'Van Oostveldt P', 'De Vos WH', 'Baatout S']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Institute for Environment, Health and Safety, Belgian Nuclear Research Centre, SCK*CEN, Mol, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120410,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (gamma-H2AX protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/*radiation effects', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/*radiation effects', 'DNA Damage/radiation effects', 'DNA Repair/radiation effects', 'Fetus/*radiation effects', 'Fibroblasts/*radiation effects', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/radiation effects', 'Histones/biosynthesis/radiation effects', 'Mice', 'Necrosis', 'Skin/*embryology/radiation effects', 'X-Rays']",2012/04/17 06:00,2012/09/29 06:00,['2012/04/17 06:00'],"['2012/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijmm.2012.964 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2012 Jul;30(1):114-8. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.2012.964.

Here, we characterized the interaction between PF-03084014, a clinically relevant GSI, and dexamethasone in preclinical models of glucocorticoid-resistant T-ALL. Combination treatment of the GSI PF-03084014 with glucocorticoids induced a synergistic antileukemic effect in human T-ALL cell lines and primary human T-ALL patient samples. Mechanistically PF-03084014 plus glucocorticoid treatment induced increased transcriptional upregulation of the glucocorticoid receptor and glucocorticoid target genes. Treatment with PF-03084014 and glucocorticoids in combination was highly efficacious in vivo, with enhanced reduction of tumor burden in a xenograft model of T-ALL. Finally, glucocorticoid treatment effectively reversed PF-03084014-induced gastrointestinal toxicity via inhibition of goblet cell metaplasia.

METHODS: NPC cell lines, HNE1 and CNE1-LMP1, were treated with various concentrations of celecoxib for 48 h. The antiproliferative effect of celecoxib was assessed using MTT assay. Both cell cycle profiles and apoptosis were analyzed using flow cytometry. Western blot was used to measure the levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), phosphorylated STAT3(Y705) (pSTAT3(Y705)), COX-2, Survivin, Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Cyclin D1. RESULTS: Celecoxib (10-75 mumol/L) inhibited the proliferation of the NPC cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Celecoxib (25 and 50 mumol/L) induced apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest at the G(0)/G(1) checkpoint in the NPC cell lines, which was associated with significantly reduced STAT3 phosphorylation. The genes downstream of STAT3 (ie, Survivin, Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Cyclin D1) were significantly down-regulated after exposure to celecoxib (25 and 50 mumol/L). CONCLUSION: The anticancer effects of celecoxib on NPC cell lines results from inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, which may be partly mediated through the STAT3 pathway.","['Liu, Dong-bo', 'Hu, Guang-yuan', 'Long, Guo-xian', 'Qiu, Hong', 'Mei, Qi', 'Hu, Guo-qing']","['Liu DB', 'Hu GY', 'Long GX', 'Qiu H', 'Mei Q', 'Hu GQ']","['Cancer Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120416,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'JCX84Q7J1L (Celecoxib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma', 'Celecoxib', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",2012/04/17 06:00,2012/08/29 06:00,['2012/04/17 06:00'],"['2012/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['aps201218 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2012.18 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2012 May;33(5):682-90. doi: 10.1038/aps.2012.18.

However, whether iPS cells are capable of producing male germ cells is not known. The objective of this study was to investigate the differentiation potential of mouse iPS cells into spermatogonial stem cells and late-stage male germ cells. We used an approach that combines in vitro differentiation and in vivo transplantation. Embryoid bodies (EBs) were obtained from iPS cells using leukaemia inhibitor factor (LIF)-free medium. Quantitative PCR revealed a decrease in Oct4 expression and an increase in Stra8 and Vasa mRNA in the EBs derived from iPS cells. iPS cell-derived EBs were induced by retinoic acid to differentiate into spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), as evidenced by their expression of VASA, as well as CDH1 and GFRalpha1, which are markers of SSCs. Furthermore, these germ cells derived from iPS cells were transplanted into recipient testes of mice that had been pre-treated with busulfan. Notably, iPS cell-derived SSCs were able to differentiate into male germ cells ranging from spermatogonia to round spermatids, as shown by VASA and SCP3 expression. This study demonstrates that iPS cells have the potential to differentiate into late-stage male germ cells. The derivation of male germ cells from iPS cells has potential applications in the treatment of male infertility and provides a model for uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying male germ cell development.","['Zhu, Yong', 'Hu, Hong-Liang', 'Li, Peng', 'Yang, Shi', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Ding, Hui', 'Tian, Ru-Hui', 'Ning, Ye', 'Zhang, Ling-Ling', 'Guo, Xi-Zhi', 'Shi, Zhan-Ping', 'Li, Zheng', 'He, Zuping']","['Zhu Y', 'Hu HL', 'Li P', 'Yang S', 'Zhang W', 'Ding H', 'Tian RH', 'Ning Y', 'Zhang LL', 'Guo XZ', 'Shi ZP', 'Li Z', 'He Z']","['Renji Hospital, Sperm Development and Genetics Laboratory, Shanghai Human Sperm Bank, Shanghai Institute of Andrology, Department of Urology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200001, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120416,China,Asian J Androl,Asian journal of andrology,100942132,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Cdh1 Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fzr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gfra1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Stra8 protein, mouse)', '0 (Sycp3 protein, mouse)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Ddx4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Busulfan/pharmacology', 'Cdh1 Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Embryoid Bodies/metabolism', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors/metabolism', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Seminiferous Tubules/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Spermatogonia/*cytology/transplantation', 'Spermatozoa/*cytology', 'Testis/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2012/04/17 06:00,2012/12/22 06:00,['2012/04/17 06:00'],"['2012/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['aja20123 [pii]', '10.1038/aja.2012.3 [doi]']",ppublish,Asian J Androl. 2012 Jul;14(4):574-9. doi: 10.1038/aja.2012.3.

On a cellular level, typical features of the disorder are a high degree of genomic instability and an increased sensitivity to bi-functionally alkylating agents. So far, germ-line defects in 15 different FA genes have been identified. Some of these FA genes are also established as tumor susceptibility genes for familiar cancers.In recent years, the prevention and therapy of HNSCCs in FA patients has become more important as the percentage of patients surviving into adulthood is rising. HNSCCs appear in very young FA patients without common risk factors. Since cisplatin-based chemotherapy in combination with radiotherapy, essential parts of the standard treatment approach for sporadic HNSCCs, cannot be used in FA patients due to therapy-associated toxicities and mortalities even with reduced dosing, surgery is the most important treatment option for HNSCCs, in FA patients and requires an early and efficient detection of malignant lesions. So far, no uniform treatment protocol for the management of HNSCCs in FA patients exists. Therefore, we propose that the information on affected FA patients should be collected worldwide, practical therapeutic guidelines developed and national treatment centers established.","['Scheckenbach, K', 'Wagenmann, M', 'Freund, M', 'Schipper, J', 'Hanenberg, H']","['Scheckenbach K', 'Wagenmann M', 'Freund M', 'Schipper J', 'Hanenberg H']","['Department of Otorhinolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120413,Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,['Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)'],IM,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/diagnosis/*epidemiology/genetics/therapy', 'Chemoradiotherapy', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Fanconi Anemia/diagnosis/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology/genetics/therapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Mass Screening', 'Otorhinolaryngologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology/genetics/prevention & control', 'Papillomavirus Infections/diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics/therapy', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Risk Factors', 'Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck', 'Treatment Outcome']",2012/04/17 06:00,2012/09/29 06:00,['2012/04/17 06:00'],"['2012/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0032-1308989 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2012 Apr;224(3):132-8. doi: 10.1055/s-0032-1308989.

The main focus of the article is the function of some evolutionary conserved microRNAs that are abundantly expressed and tightly regulated during myelopoiesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Global microRNA depletion studies in hematopoietic stem cells have shown the importance of microRNA-controlled pathways for hematopoiesis. Recent insights from genetic mouse models and overexpression or deletion of microRNAs in developmental cell intermediates demonstrate strong evidence for evolutionary conserved microRNA-regulated pathways involved in tight control of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis at different stages of blood cell development. It is becoming evident that the myeloid transcription factor PU.1 regulates the expression of critical microRNAs including miR-17 approximately 92 and miR-146a during myelopoiesis. Furthermore, there is evidence for the contribution of aberrant miR-125 activities in hematopoietic disorders including myeloid leukemia. SUMMARY: Despite the large number of articles describing differential microRNA expression during hematopoiesis, microRNA functions and their downstream pathways in myeloid lineage decisions and leukemia are only recently emerging. Here we discuss new findings concerning PU.1-controlled microRNAs and miR-125-regulated networks in normal and malignant myelopoiesis.","['Alemdehy, Mir Farshid', 'Erkeland, Stefan J']","['Alemdehy MF', 'Erkeland SJ']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'Myelopoiesis/*genetics/physiology']",2012/04/17 06:00,2012/09/20 06:00,['2012/04/17 06:00'],"['2012/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e328353d4e9 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2012 Jul;19(4):261-7. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e328353d4e9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations of PTPN11 cause the congenital disorder Noonan syndrome and pathologically promote human leukemias. Given the high frequency of PTPN11 mutations in human disease, several animal models have been generated to investigate Shp2 in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function and leukemic transformation. RECENT FINDINGS: Two independent animal models bearing knockout of Shp2 in hematopoietic tissues clearly demonstrate the necessity of Shp2 in HSC repopulating capacity. Reduced HSC quiescence and increased apoptosis accounts for diminished HSC function in the absence of Shp2. The germline mutation Shp2D61G enhances HSC activity and induces myeloproliferative disease (MPD) in vivo by HSC transformation. The somatic mutation Shp2D61Y produces MPD in vivo but fails to induce acute leukemia, whereas somatic Shp2E76K produces MPD in vivo that transforms into full-blown leukemia. HSCs expressing Shp2D61Y do not generate MPD in recipient animals upon transplantation, whereas Shp2E76K-expressing HSCs yield MPD as well as acute leukemia in recipient animals. The mechanisms underlying the unique functions of Shp2D61Y and Shp2E76K in HSC transformation and leukemogenesis continue to be under investigation.

Translational studies of clinically active targeted therapeutics can definitively discriminate driver from passenger lesions and provide valuable insights into human cancer biology. Activating internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) are detected in approximately 20% of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients and are associated with a poor prognosis. Abundant scientific and clinical evidence, including the lack of convincing clinical activity of early FLT3 inhibitors, suggests that FLT3-ITD probably represents a passenger lesion. Here we report point mutations at three residues within the kinase domain of FLT3-ITD that confer substantial in vitro resistance to AC220 (quizartinib), an active investigational inhibitor of FLT3, KIT, PDGFRA, PDGFRB and RET; evolution of AC220-resistant substitutions at two of these amino acid positions was observed in eight of eight FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients with acquired resistance to AC220. Our findings demonstrate that FLT3-ITD can represent a driver lesion and valid therapeutic target in human AML. AC220-resistant FLT3 kinase domain mutants represent high-value targets for future FLT3 inhibitor development efforts.","['Smith, Catherine C', 'Wang, Qi', 'Chin, Chen-Shan', 'Salerno, Sara', 'Damon, Lauren E', 'Levis, Mark J', 'Perl, Alexander E', 'Travers, Kevin J', 'Wang, Susana', 'Hunt, Jeremy P', 'Zarrinkar, Patrick P', 'Schadt, Eric E', 'Kasarskis, Andrew', 'Kuriyan, John', 'Shah, Neil P']","['Smith CC', 'Wang Q', 'Chin CS', 'Salerno S', 'Damon LE', 'Levis MJ', 'Perl AE', 'Travers KJ', 'Wang S', 'Hunt JP', 'Zarrinkar PP', 'Schadt EE', 'Kasarskis A', 'Kuriyan J', 'Shah NP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120415,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Benzothiazoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",2012/04/17 06:00,2012/06/26 06:00,['2012/04/17 06:00'],"['2011/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['nature11016 [pii]', '10.1038/nature11016 [doi]']",epublish,Nature. 2012 Apr 15;485(7397):260-3. doi: 10.1038/nature11016.,,"['R01 CA128864/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA166616/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA12886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3390926,['NIHMS377906'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, deep molecular responses (MRs), as measured by reductions in BCR-ABL transcript levels below the threshold of major MR, were achieved only by a small proportion of patients. With the advent of the second-generation TKIs nilotinib and dasatinib for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP, the proportion of patients who achieve the deepest levels of MR is likely to increase significantly. With these changes, the potential for patient eligibility in TKI cessations studies is becoming a more widely discussed topic and area for research. These developments highlight the need for robust, standardized and workable definitions of deep MRs. Specifically, it is critical that the measurement of MR is standardized in a manner to withstand both intra- and inter-laboratory variability, as well as new methodological developments. This review summarizes the relevant clinical background and proposes a framework within which standardization of MR can be taken forward.","['Cross, N C P', 'White, H E', 'Muller, M C', 'Saglio, G', 'Hochhaus, A']","['Cross NC', 'White HE', 'Muller MC', 'Saglio G', 'Hochhaus A']","['Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120416,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']",2012/04/17 06:00,2012/12/22 06:00,['2012/04/17 06:00'],"['2012/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012104 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.104 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Oct;26(10):2172-5. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.104.

However, the quality and sustainability of achievable remissions and clinical variables that influence the outcome of sorafenib monotherapy are largely undefined. To address these questions, we evaluated sorafenib monotherapy in 65 FLT3-ITD AML patients treated at 23 centers. All but two patients had relapsed or were chemotherapy-refractory after a median of three prior chemotherapy cycles. Twenty-nine patients (45%) had undergone prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). The documented best responses were: hematological remission in 24 patients (37%), bone marrow remission in 5 patients (8%), complete remission (with and without normalization of peripheral blood counts) in 15 patients (23%) and molecular remission with undetectable FLT3-ITD mRNA in 10 patients (15%), respectively. Seventeen of the patients without prior allo-SCT (47%) developed sorafenib resistance after a median treatment duration of 136 days (range, 56-270 days). In contrast, allo-SCT patients developed sorafenib resistance less frequently (38%) and significantly later (197 days, range 38-225 days; P=0.03). Sustained remissions were seen exclusively in the allo-SCT cohort. Thus, sorafenib monotherapy has significant activity in FLT3-ITD AML and may synergize with allogeneic immune effects to induce durable remissions.","['Metzelder, S K', 'Schroeder, T', 'Finck, A', 'Scholl, S', 'Fey, M', 'Gotze, K', 'Linn, Y C', 'Kroger, M', 'Reiter, A', 'Salih, H R', 'Heinicke, T', 'Stuhlmann, R', 'Muller, L', 'Giagounidis, A', 'Meyer, R G', 'Brugger, W', 'Vohringer, M', 'Dreger, P', 'Mori, M', 'Basara, N', 'Schafer-Eckart, K', 'Schultheis, B', 'Baldus, C', 'Neubauer, A', 'Burchert, A']","['Metzelder SK', 'Schroeder T', 'Finck A', 'Scholl S', 'Fey M', 'Gotze K', 'Linn YC', 'Kroger M', 'Reiter A', 'Salih HR', 'Heinicke T', 'Stuhlmann R', 'Muller L', 'Giagounidis A', 'Meyer RG', 'Brugger W', 'Vohringer M', 'Dreger P', 'Mori M', 'Basara N', 'Schafer-Eckart K', 'Schultheis B', 'Baldus C', 'Neubauer A', 'Burchert A']","['Philipps Universitat Marburg, Universitatsklinikum Giessen und Marburg, Standort Marburg, Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und Immunologie, Marburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120416,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Pyridines)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzenesulfonates/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Pyridines/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sorafenib', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*metabolism']",2012/04/17 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/04/17 06:00'],"['2012/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012105 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.105 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Nov;26(11):2353-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.105.

METHODS: PML and Sp100 were expressed in Escherichia coli, and analysed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody and MALDI-ToF fingerprinting. A quantitative PML and Sp100 LIA were developed and testing was performed in 150 anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA) positive, 20 AMA-PBCs and 130 controls. RESULTS: Thirty-five (23%) of 150 AMA+ PBCs (18 anti-MND+) were anti-PML+ (12%) or anti-Sp100+ (20%), 10 being anti-PML+/Sp100+, 5 single anti-PML+ and 20 single anti-Sp100+. Six (30%, 5 anti-MND+) AMA-PBCs were anti-PML+ or Sp100+. Only 2 (1.7%) pathological controls were anti-PML+ and/or anti-Sp100+. Levels of anti-PML correlated with those of anti-Sp100 (R=0.64, p<0.0001). The autoantibody profile largely remained unchanged over a 10year-follow up (52 patients, 352 samples). Anti-PML, Sp100 or MND-reactive PBCs were younger and had longer disease duration than the seronegative (p=0.06, for both). Anti-Sp100 levels correlated with the Mayo risk score (r=0.63, p=0.01). Anti-PML+/Sp100+ patients had more advanced disease compared to patients negative for anti-PML/Sp100 (p=0.04).

A major area of research in experimental animals is to ascertain that immunosuppressants that will be used at UTx do not negatively affect the potential of the uterus to implant an embryo and to carry a pregnancy to term. This study investigates the effects on a uterine transplant in the rat of the calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporine A (CsA), on uterine morphology and expression patterns of some mediators involved in implantation/inflammation. STUDY DESIGN: Donor rats were of Brown Norway strain and recipients were of Lewis strain. The uterus was transplanted to an orthotopic site by vascular anastomosis. The recipients were given CsA (10mg/kg) sc once daily or no CsA until they were sacrificed at postoperative day 7. Syngenic transplanted Lewis rats were used as controls. Uteri were analyzed regarding histology, immunohistochemistry against T-cells and mRNA levels of the implantation/inflammation-related markers leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), galectin-1, CD200, interleukin (IL)-1alpha, and IL-15. RESULT(S): There was pronounced inflammation with abundance of CD8-lymphocytes in uterine grafts of non-CsA-treated animals and only mild inflammation in treated animals. The uterine mRNA levels of IL-1alpha were decreased after CsA in comparison to uteri of non-treated transplanted animals. The mRNA levels of galectin-1 were decreased in the rejected uteri and were higher in the CsA-treated. The levels of mRNA of IL-15 were lower in the syngenic transplanted group compared to the CsA-treated transplanted. There was no difference between the groups concerning mRNA levels of CD200, or LIF, with wide variation of the levels of the two latter mediators in all groups. CONCLUSION(S): Cyclosporine A suppresses rejection of an allogenic rat uterine transplant, with normalization of mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1alpha and the glycan-binding protein galectin-1.","['Groth, Klaus', 'Akhi, Shamima N', 'Molne, Johan', 'Wranning, Caiza A', 'Brannstrom, Mats']","['Groth K', 'Akhi SN', 'Molne J', 'Wranning CA', 'Brannstrom M']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg, S-413 45 Gothenburg, Sweden. klaus.groth@vgregion.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120413,Ireland,Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",0375672,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Galectin 1)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-1alpha)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'UQ4V77A8VA (antigens, CD200)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cyclosporine/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Galectin 1/biosynthesis', 'Graft Rejection/prevention & control', 'Gynecologic Surgical Procedures/methods', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Inflammation/etiology', 'Interleukin-15/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-1alpha/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Uterus/*transplantation']",2012/04/17 06:00,2012/10/16 06:00,['2012/04/17 06:00'],"['2010/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-2115(12)00146-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejogrb.2012.03.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol. 2012 Jul;163(1):97-103. doi: 10.1016/j.ejogrb.2012.03.026.

Glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) are phase II metabolizing enzymes whose various genotypes have been associated with increased risk of different types of cancer. Null mutations caused by the deletion of the entire gene result in the absence of the enzymatic activity and increase in the risk of developing cancer including chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). In the present case-control study we evaluated the effect of null mutations in GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes on the risk of developing CML. The study included 75 CML patients (43 males and 32 females; age (mean +/- S.D) 42.3 +/- 13.4 years) and unrelated non-malignant controls (76 male and 48 females; age (mean +/- S.D) 41.5 +/- 12.9). The distribution of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes in CML patients and controls was assessed by multiplex-PCR method. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes and risk of CML. Chi-square test was used to evaluate the trend in modulating the risk to CML by one or more potential high risk genotype. Although GSTM1 null genotype frequency was higher in CML patients (41%) than in the controls (35%), it did not reached a statistical significance (OD = 1.32, 95% CI: 0.73-2.40; P value = 0.4295). The frequency of GSTT1 null genotypes was higher in the CML patients (36%) than in the controls (21%) and the difference was found to be statistically significant (OD = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.12-4.02; P value = 0.0308). This suggests that the presence of GSTT1 genotype may have protective role against the CML. We found a statistically significant (OD = 3.09, 95% CI: 1.122-8.528; P value = 0.0472) interaction between the GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes and thus individuals carrying null genotypes of both GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes are at elevated risk of CML.","['Bhat, Gulzar', 'Bhat, Ashaqullah', 'Wani, Aadil', 'Sadiq, Nida', 'Jeelani, Samoon', 'Kaur, Rajinder', 'Masood, Akbar', 'Ganai, Bashir']","['Bhat G', 'Bhat A', 'Wani A', 'Sadiq N', 'Jeelani S', 'Kaur R', 'Masood A', 'Ganai B']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Kashmir, India.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",2012/04/17 06:00,2012/08/15 06:00,['2012/04/17 06:00'],"['2012/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.1.069 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2012;13(1):69-73. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.1.069.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GCs provide an important source of humoral immunity by generating high affinity antibodies against a pathogen. The GC response is tightly regulated during clonal expansion, immunoglobulin modification, and affinity maturation, whereas its deregulation has a detrimental effect on immune function, leading to development of diseases, such as lymphoma and autoimmunity. LRF (lymphoma/leukemia-related factor), encoded by the ZBTB7A gene, is a transcriptional repressor belonging to the POK (POZ and Kruppel)/ZBTB (zing finger and BTB) protein family. LRF was originally identified as a PLZF (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger) homolog that physically interacts with BCL6 (B-cell lymphoma 6), whose expression is required for GC formation and associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

One of the most readily recognized targets in metastatic melanoma is the oncogenic 'driver' mutations KIT, which is thought to be an important driver mutation in up to 3% of melanomas. AREAS COVERED: We review the current state of development of KIT-targeted agents in melanoma with KIT mutations. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of nilotinib are presented, as well its safety clinical activity data. Finally, we present the knowledge learned from the experience of nilotinib in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) to guide its development for melanoma. EXPERT OPINION: Given its favorable safety and efficacy profile in CML and imatinib-resistant GISTs, nilotinib, a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor with greater potency than imatinib, emerges as a promising agent in the treatment of metastatic melanoma harboring the KIT mutation and warrants clinical investigation in this setting.","['Tran, An', 'Tawbi, Hussein A']","['Tran A', 'Tawbi HA']","['University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20120416,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Skin Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology']",2012/04/17 06:00,2012/09/08 06:00,['2012/04/17 06:00'],"['2012/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2012.679341 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2012 Jun;21(6):861-9. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2012.679341.

METHODS: The human acute leukemia cell strain U937 and human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell strain HL-60 were treated with ASD at different doses (10, 30, 50, and 100 microg/mL). The proliferation inhibition of ASD was observed using MTT assay. Apoptosis was detected by Annexin-V staining. The expressions of correlated genes were detected by PCR. Changes of p53 were detected using Western blot. The nitrite content, as the metabolite of nitric oxide (NO) was detected by Griess spectrophotometry. RESULTS: 50 microg/mL ASD could obviously inhibit the growth of U937 and HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner, accompanied with the down-regulation of bcl-2 mRNA expression. Results of Western blot showed that the P53 expression increased along with the dose of ASD. Besides, ASD could elevate the content of NO in U937 and HL-60 cells (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ASD could inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of U937 and HL-60 cells. The mechanism might be correlated with down-regulating the bcl-2 expression, up-regulating the p53 expression, and increasing the NO content in U937 and HL-60 cells.","['Zhou, Peng', 'Ma, Liang', 'Zhou, Jun']","['Zhou P', 'Ma L', 'Zhou J']","['Central Lab, The First Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, Suzhou.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,China,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong xi yi jie he za zhi Zhongguo Zhongxiyi jiehe zazhi = Chinese journal of integrated traditional and Western medicine,9211576,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (akebia saponin D)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Saponins/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2012/04/17 06:00,2014/01/01 06:00,['2012/04/17 06:00'],"['2012/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi. 2012 Jan;32(1):84-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is paucity of literature that describes the morphological spectrum. AIM: This study was aimed at studying the morphological spectrum of leukemic MCL and to correlate the morphology with other features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty six such cases diagnosed over a period of four years were studied. Peripheral blood and bone marrow aspiration smears stained with Wrights stain were examined by three hematopathologists. Immunophenotyping was done using multicolor flow cytometry. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) done in 12 cases showed t(11;14)(q13:q32). RESULTS: Six cases had de-novo leukemic involvement; while 20 cases had secondary involvement. Morphologically, the cells were small (less than twice the size of red blood cell) or large. Small cell morphology in turn showed irregular nuclear border (n=13) or round nuclear contour (n=6). Large cells had blastic morphology (n=5) or had central prominent nucleoli resembling prolymhphocytes (n=2). Twenty cases showed characteristic immunophenotype of CD5+/CD19+/CD20+/FMC7+/CD10-/CD23- and light chain restrictions. Three cases expressed CD23 and two cases were negative for FMC7. Five out of 12 cases, where FISH was done, showed cytogenetic abnormalities in addition to t(11;14)(q13;q32). CONCLUSION: Morphological spectrum of leukemic MCL ranges from small cells resembling chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or follicular lymphoma (FL) to large cell mimicking prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) or acute leukemia. Large cell morphology was associated with more frequent additional cytogenetic abnormality as well as a poorer outcome.","['Rahman, Khaliqur', 'Subramanian, P G', 'Kadam, Pratibha Amare', 'Gadage, Vijaya', 'Galani, Komal', 'Mittal, Neha', 'Ghogale, Sitaram', 'Badrinath, Yajamanam', 'Ansari, Rashida', 'Kushte, Shilpa', 'Nair, Reena', 'Sengar, Manju', 'Menon, Hari', 'Gujral, Sumeet']","['Rahman K', 'Subramanian PG', 'Kadam PA', 'Gadage V', 'Galani K', 'Mittal N', 'Ghogale S', 'Badrinath Y', 'Ansari R', 'Kushte S', 'Nair R', 'Sengar M', 'Menon H', 'Gujral S']","['Hematopathologist, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research, New Delhi, India. drkhaliq81@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,7605904,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Cells/*cytology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy', 'Middle Aged']",2012/04/14 06:00,2012/08/07 06:00,['2012/04/14 06:00'],"['2012/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJPatholMicrobiol_2012_55_1_66_94860 [pii]', '10.4103/0377-4929.94860 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Pathol Microbiol. 2012 Jan-Mar;55(1):66-71. doi: 10.4103/0377-4929.94860.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has to be distinguished from chronic lymphoproliferative disorders because of different treatment protocol and clinical course. AIMS: To evaluate clinicopathological features including immunophenotypic analysis of cases diagnosed as HCL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study included 28 cases diagnosed over a period of nine years (2002-2010). Clinical presentation, complete blood count, bone marrow aspirate, and flow cytometric analysis of cases were reviewed. Treatment and follow-up details (ranging from 3-90 months) were noted. RESULTS: This study revealed 28 cases (referrals-7, indoor-21), aged 26-69 years with a median age of 47 years, with a male predominance (M:F=6:1). The presenting complaints were weakness (80%) followed by fever (56%) and abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed splenomegaly in most patients (92%) and hepatomegaly in a minority (28%). The common laboratory features were anemia in 23 cases, pancytopenia in 14 cases, while two patients had leukocytosis and three patients had normal WBC count. Dry tap was observed in 84% of the cases where hairy cells constituted 16-97% of non-erythroid nucleated cells. Tartarte resistant acid phosphate staining was positive in all the eight cases where it was done.

DATA SOURCES: PubMed searches using the terms chronic lymphocytic leukemia, elderly, practice guidelines, and controlled clinical trials were performed from 1949 through August 2011. Reference lists from relevant articles were examined for additional studies, review articles, and guidelines. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Eighty-three articles were generated and abstracted articles were chosen based on trial results that changed clinical practice, resulted in approval of new drugs for CLL by the Food and Drug Administration and/or had clinical relevance to the elderly population. DATA SYNTHESIS: Fit elderly CLL patients have more treatment options than frail elderly. Most studies include patients younger than 65 years of age, and recent advances in treatment may not prove beneficial for all ages. Clinicians should use available evidence and clinical judgment when treating and monitoring elderly CLL patients. CONCLUSION: Treatment armamentarium has improved over the last decade, yet clinical trials research should include more elderly cohorts as new agents are developed. Increased awareness of supportive care issues improves quality of life for a population with multiple disease complications.","['Johnson, Tali M']",['Johnson TM'],"['Pharmaceutical Management Branch, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland 20852, USA. tmjohnson@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Consult Pharm,The Consultant pharmacist : the journal of the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists,9013983,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic/methods', 'Drug Approval', 'Frail Elderly', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Pharmacists/organization & administration', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Quality of Life', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",2012/04/14 06:00,2012/05/04 06:00,['2012/04/14 06:00'],"['2012/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['0681072625453575 [pii]', '10.4140/TCP.n.2012.274 [doi]']",ppublish,Consult Pharm. 2012 Apr;27(4):274-85. doi: 10.4140/TCP.n.2012.274.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Volume perfusion computed tomographic data from 21 consecutive immunocompromised patients presenting with atypical parenchymal opacity of consolidation were analyzed with respect to the degree of perfusion of their pneumonias. All patients presented with clinical and laboratory signs of infection. Seventeen patients (10 men, seven women; mean age, 57 years; age range, 19-76 years) were found with proven (n = 9), probable (n = 2), or possible (n = 6) angioinvasive mycosis. One patient was diagnosed with bronchoinvasive aspergillosis. Four patients (all men; mean age, 71 years; age range, 67-79 years) were diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. Volume perfusion computed tomography of the involved pulmonary areas was performed at 80 kV and 60 mAs, with 26 measurement points distributed over 65.9 seconds. Fifty milliliters of contrast material was injected at a rate of 5 mL/s, followed by a 50-mL saline chaser. Entire coverage of the pneumonic parenchymal consolidation was obtained in all patients, with the generation of parametric maps of blood flow (BF) using the maximal slope model and blood volume (BV) using Patlak analysis. The results of perfusion measurements were then analyzed and evaluated for all patients. RESULTS: Patients with proven, probable, or possible angioinvasive pulmonary fungal infection revealed very low levels of perfusion of their parenchymal consolidations, with BFs ranging from 0.01 to 23.86 mL/100 mL tissue/min and BVs ranging from 0.88 to 10.67 mL/100 mL tissue, lower than those of the adjacent thoracic musculature and of bacterial pneumonias. Bacterial pneumonias showed all increased perfusion parameters, with BFs ranging from 30.49 to 41.65 mL/100 mL tissue/min and BVs ranging from 10.07 to 49.90 mL/100 mL tissue. The cutoff BF value for differentiation was 23.89 mL/100 mL tissue/min, and the cutoff BV value was 9.6 mL/100 mL tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with angioinvasive pulmonary mycosis showed lower perfusion parameters on volume perfusion computed tomography compared to those experiencing bacterial pneumonia.","['Schulze, Maximilian', 'Vogel, Wichard', 'Spira, Daniel', 'Sauter, Alexander', 'Hetzel, Juergen', 'Horger, Marius']","['Schulze M', 'Vogel W', 'Spira D', 'Sauter A', 'Hetzel J', 'Horger M']","['Department of Radiology, Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen, Hoppe Seyler Strasse 3, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120411,United States,Acad Radiol,Academic radiology,9440159,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Cone-Beam Computed Tomography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Lung/*blood supply', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/complications/*diagnostic imaging/physiopathology', 'Lymphoma/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Perfusion Imaging', 'Pneumonia, Bacterial/complications/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology', 'Young Adult']",2012/04/14 06:00,2012/10/17 06:00,['2012/04/14 06:00'],"['2011/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S1076-6332(12)00142-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.acra.2012.03.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Acad Radiol. 2012 Jul;19(7):842-50. doi: 10.1016/j.acra.2012.03.002.

On the other hand, only scarce information is available on PU.1-regulated genes involved in cell survival. We now identified the glycolytic enzyme hexokinase 3 (HK3), a gene with cytoprotective functions, as transcriptional target of PU.1. Interestingly, HK3 expression is highly associated with the myeloid lineage and was significantly decreased in acute myeloid leukemia patients compared with normal granulocytes. Moreover, HK3 expression was significantly lower in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) compared with non-APL patient samples. In line with the observations in primary APL patient samples, we observed significantly higher HK3 expression during neutrophil differentiation of APL cell lines. Moreover, knocking down PU.1 impaired HK3 induction during neutrophil differentiation. In vivo binding of PU.1 and PML-RARA to the HK3 promoter was found, and PML-RARA attenuated PU.1 activation of the HK3 promoter. Next, inhibiting HK3 in APL cell lines resulted in significantly reduced neutrophil differentiation and viability compared with control cells. Our findings strongly suggest that HK3 is: (1) directly activated by PU.1, (2) repressed by PML-RARA, and (3) functionally involved in neutrophil differentiation and cell viability of APL cells.","['Federzoni, Elena A', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Torbett, Bruce E', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Fey, Martin F', 'Tschan, Mario P']","['Federzoni EA', 'Valk PJ', 'Torbett BE', 'Haferlach T', 'Lowenberg B', 'Fey MF', 'Tschan MP']","['Experimental Oncology/Hematology, Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120412,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (Hexokinase)']",IM,"['Anthracyclines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/physiology', 'Glycolysis/genetics', 'Hexokinase/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/metabolism/pathology/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2012/04/14 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/04/14 06:00'],"['2012/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47818-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-09-378117 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 May 24;119(21):4963-70. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-09-378117.

It has been reported that full-length AML1-ETO blocks AML1 function and requires additional mutagenic events to promote leukemia. We have previously shown that the expression of AE9a, a splice isoform of AML1-ETO, can rapidly cause leukemia in mice. To understand how AML1-ETO is involved in leukemia development, we took advantage of our AE9a leukemia model and sought to identify its interacting proteins from primary leukemic cells. Here, we report the discovery of a novel AE9a binding partner PRMT1 (protein arginine methyltransferase 1). PRMT1 not only interacts with but also weakly methylates arginine 142 of AE9a. Knockdown of PRMT1 affects expression of a specific group of AE9a-activated genes. We also show that AE9a recruits PRMT1 to promoters of AE9a-activated genes, resulting in enrichment of H4 arginine 3 methylation, H3 Lys9/14 acetylation, and transcription activation. More importantly, knockdown of PRMT1 suppresses the self-renewal capability of AE9a, suggesting a potential role of PRMT1 in regulating leukemia development.","['Shia, Wei-Jong', 'Okumura, Akiko J', 'Yan, Ming', 'Sarkeshik, Ali', 'Lo, Miao-Chia', 'Matsuura, Shinobu', 'Komeno, Yukiko', 'Zhao, Xinyang', 'Nimer, Stephen D', 'Yates, John R 3rd', 'Zhang, Dong-Er']","['Shia WJ', 'Okumura AJ', 'Yan M', 'Sarkeshik A', 'Lo MC', 'Matsuura S', 'Komeno Y', 'Zhao X', 'Nimer SD', 'Yates JR 3rd', 'Zhang DE']","['Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120412,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (PRMT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism/physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism/physiology', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology', '*Transcriptional Activation/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics/physiology']",2012/04/14 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/04/14 06:00'],"['2012/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47817-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-04-347476 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 May 24;119(21):4953-62. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-04-347476.

In contrast to p53, the homologs p73 and p63 play critical roles in development of the central nervous system and skin/limbs, respectively. Moreover, dependent on the context they can exert tumor suppressor activities that cooperate with p53. Unlike p53, p73 and p63 are rarely mutated in cancers. Instead, up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic dominant-negative DeltaNp73 and DeltaNp63 isoforms is the most frequent abnormality in solid cancers. In hematological malignancies the most frequent p73 defect is promoter methylation and loss of expression, associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. This suggests an essential tumor suppressor role of p73 in blood cells, also supported by genetic mouse models. Many therapeutic approaches aiming to restore p73 activity are currently being investigated. In contrast, the most frequent p63 abnormality is protein overexpression, associated with higher disease grade and poorer prognosis. Surprisingly, although available data are still scarce, the emerging picture is up-regulation of transactivation-competent TAp63 isoforms, suggesting a tumor-promoting role in this context.","['Alexandrova, Evguenia M', 'Moll, Ute M']","['Alexandrova EM', 'Moll UM']","['Department of Pathology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120521,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (CKAP4 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Trp73 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (delta Np73 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/genetics', 'Lymphoma/*etiology/genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology']",2012/04/14 06:00,2013/06/20 06:00,['2012/04/14 06:00'],"['2012/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.684348 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Nov;53(11):2116-29. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.684348.

Additionally, some banks offer the opportunity to retain stem cells privately. CB is discursively presented as clinical 'waste', a 'by-product' of birthing. In this way CB units are made available to a global exchange-based bioeconomy. Crucially, CB collection has developed in parallel with several necessary obstetric practices, especially the immediate clamping of the cord following delivery, essential to high volume collection. However, this article strongly suggests the promotional basis of CB banking (such as by gift, waste or donation) is in tension with the growing preference of new parents to delay cord clamping. Based on focus groups with expectant parents, the promotion of CB banking can in fact be seen to feed into critical reflection on the value of CB for newborn infants, potentially reinvigorating a tradition of delayed umbilical cord clamping. Theoretically, these contradictory systems of valuing are conceptualised through recent literature on bioeconomy and Marx's writings on the contrasting tensions between use and exchange value.","['Brown, Nik']",['Brown N'],"['Department of Sociology, University of York, Heslington, York Y01 5DD. nik.brown@york.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120412,England,Sociol Health Illn,Sociology of health & illness,8205036,,IM,"['Adult', 'Biological Specimen Banks/*economics', 'Commerce', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*economics', 'Female', '*Fetal Blood', 'Focus Groups', 'Humans', 'International Cooperation', 'Male', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Pregnancy', 'Registries', 'Sociology, Medical', 'United Kingdom']",2012/04/14 06:00,2013/09/24 06:00,['2012/04/14 06:00'],"['2012/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1467-9566.2012.01474.x [doi]'],ppublish,Sociol Health Illn. 2013 Jan;35(1):97-112. doi: 10.1111/j.1467-9566.2012.01474.x.

In myeloblastic HL-60, promyelocytic NB4, monocytic U937, immature KG-1 and erythro-megakaryocytic K562 cell lines, rapamycin alone had modest inhibitory effects, DMSO inhibited proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, and the combination of rapamycin and DMSO reduced the number of viable cells significantly more than either agent alone. In NB4 cells, rapamycin had no statistically significant effects on the DMSO-mediated increase in expression of CD11b, but increased apoptosis.

Although previous investigations have shown that Rbm15 has broad regulatory effects within murine hematopoiesis through modulating Notch-induced transcriptional activation, which plays key roles in leukemogenesis, it is not clear what the functions of RBM15 are in the regulation of hematological malignancies. In the present study, we show that RBM15 expression was significantly increased in patients with blast-crisis chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) compared with chronic-phase or accelerated-phase disease by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. To further elucidate the role of RBM15 in CML, we introduced RBM15 small interfering RNA (siRNA) using pSUPER into CML cells. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), real-time RT-PCR and Western blot were used to study changes in RBM15 expression levels in transduced cells by comparing with control cells. Decreasing RBM15 levels with RNA interference could inhibit the growth and proliferation, block the cell cycle and induce apoptosis in CML cells. Knockdown of RBM15 may also act to inhibit clonogenicity and induce differentiation of CML cells along the myeloid lineage. Our studies also show that the effects of RBM15 on CML cells may be mediated, at least in part, via its effect on Notch signaling. These findings demonstrate that RBM15 does indeed play a critical role in the survival of CML cells, which may have potential application in designing molecular therapies for CML treatment.","['Yang, Yuxia', 'Wang, Saifeng', 'Zhang, Yanju', 'Zhu, Xiaoling']","['Yang Y', 'Wang S', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhu X']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Peking University, Beijing, China. yangyx@bjmu.edu.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein)', '0 (RBM15 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein/analysis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*etiology/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology']",2012/04/14 06:00,2013/06/20 06:00,['2012/04/14 06:00'],"['2012/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.684350 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Nov;53(11):2237-44. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.684350.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the majority of patients initially respond well to treatment with imatinib, wider clinical experience with this drug has resulted in the development of imatinib resistance being increasingly documented. There is therefore an unmet medical need for novel therapies to override imatinib resistance in CML. AIMS: This review summarizes the emerging evidence for the potential use of dasatinib in the treatment of imatinib-resistant CML. DISEASE AND TREATMENT: Dasatinib is a novel small molecule that has shown potent antileukemic activity in imatinib-resistant cell lines, malignant marrow cells isolated from patients with imatinib-resistant CML, and in mouse xenograft models of imatinib-resistant CML. Preliminary data from an initial phase I dose escalation trial have been encouraging, indicating that dasatinib is generally well tolerated and produces hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients with imatinib-resistant CML in all phases of the disease. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has not yet been reached, and dose escalation continues to determine the dose range that yields optimal results. PROFILE: Although dasatinib is still in the early stages of development, the potential impact of this molecule on the treatment of CML could be revolutionary, not only providing a much needed treatment option for patients with imatinib-resistant CML, but also, combined with imatinib, could possibly prove useful in delaying the onset of resistance to treatment. Furthermore, combined with other agents active in CML, dasatinib could have potential utility in purging residual leukemic cells in patients whose disease is controlled by imatinib.","['Haslam, Sonya']",['Haslam S'],"['Core Medical Publishing, Knutsford, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20050331,New Zealand,Core Evid,Core evidence,101256593,,,,2005/01/01 00:00,2005/01/01 00:01,['2012/04/13 06:00'],"['2012/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2005/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Core Evid. 2005;1(1):1-12.

In PML(-)/(-) MEFs the co-localization of MRE11, Tag, and PyV DNA remained unchanged, suggesting that the PML protein itself was not responsible for their association. Furthermore, PyV-infected PML(-)/(-) MEFs and PML(-)/(-) mice replicated wild-type levels of infectious virus. Therefore, although the PML protein may identify sites of PyV replication, neither the observed ""virus factories"" nor virus assembly were dependent on PML. The ultrastructure of the tubes suggests a new model for the encapsidation of small DNA viruses.","['Erickson, Kimberly D', 'Bouchet-Marquis, Cedric', 'Heiser, Katie', 'Szomolanyi-Tsuda, Eva', 'Mishra, Rabinarayan', 'Lamothe, Benjamin', 'Hoenger, Andreas', 'Garcea, Robert L']","['Erickson KD', 'Bouchet-Marquis C', 'Heiser K', 'Szomolanyi-Tsuda E', 'Mishra R', 'Lamothe B', 'Hoenger A', 'Garcea RL']","['Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120405,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Mre11a protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (MRE11 Homologue Protein)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/metabolism/*virology', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'MRE11 Homologue Protein', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polyomavirus/*physiology', 'Polyomavirus Infections/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Assembly/*physiology']",2012/04/13 06:00,2012/08/21 06:00,['2012/04/13 06:00'],"['2012/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1002630 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-12-00085 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2012;8(4):e1002630. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002630.

Nausea, emesis, and anorexia are common features of these disorders. TNF action on vagal afferent terminals in the brainstem is a likely cause of the malaise associated with these disorders. Our previous work has shown that TNF action to excite vagal afferents occurs as a result of sensitization of ryanodine channels in afferent nerve terminals. For millennia, cannabinoids (CB) have been used to combat the visceral malaise associated with chronic disease, although the mechanism of action has not been clear. Previous work in culture systems suggests that CB1 agonists can suppress neurotransmission by downregulating ryanodine channels through a protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent mechanism. Laser confocal calcium imaging methods were used to directly examine effects of CB1 cannabinoid agonists and TNF on visceral afferent signaling in the rat hindbrain. CB1 agonists blocked the effects of TNF to amplify vagal afferent responsiveness; blockade of PKA with H89 also eliminated the TNF amplification effect. These results help to explain the effectiveness of cannabinoids in blocking the malaise generated by TNF-releasing disease processes by opposing effects on ryanodine channels.","['Rogers, Richard C', 'Hermann, Gerlinda E']","['Rogers RC', 'Hermann GE']","['Laboratory of Autonomic Neuroscience, Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70808, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Cannabinoids)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'M876330O56 (N-(2-(4-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain Stem/physiology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cannabinoids/*pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Diffusion Chambers, Culture', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Female', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Neurons, Afferent/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Presynaptic Terminals/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Long-Evans', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1/agonists', 'Solitary Nucleus/physiology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Vagus Nerve/*drug effects/*physiology']",2012/04/13 06:00,2012/06/16 06:00,['2012/04/13 06:00'],"['2012/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['32/15/5237 [pii]', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6220-11.2012 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2012 Apr 11;32(15):5237-41. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6220-11.2012.,,"['R01 DK056373/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK052142-09/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK052142-10A1/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'NS52142/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK052142/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK56373/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK056373-11/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS060664-02/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS60664/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS060664/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3342927,['NIHMS370512'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Naa10p is involved in controlling cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy and neuronal development. Our group and others had reported prognostic value of Naa10p expression in various types of cancer. Despite the efforts to elucidate the biological function of Naa10p, it remains controversial regarding its roles in tumor development. Herein, we report that depletion of Naa10p inhibited the growth of xenograft tumors in nude mice. Microarray analysis identified MCL1 gene as one of targets downstream of Naa10p. Naa10p positively regulated MCL1 expression, as exogenous Naa10p promoted MCL1 expression, whereas Naa10p silencing decreased MCL1 expression. Ablation of Naa10p sensitized cancer cells to stimuli-induced apoptosis, and the anti-apoptotic function of Naa10p was, at least in part, mediated by MCL1. Mechanistically, we found a physical interaction between Naa10p and RelA/p65. Transcriptional activation of the MCL1 gene required the recruitment of Naa10p-RelA/p65 complex to the p65-binding site of MCL1 promoter region. We also demonstrated a positive correlation between MCL1 and Naa10p messenger RNA levels in both colon cancer and lung cancer tissues. These results indicate that Naa10p inhibits apoptosis through Naa10p-RelA/p65-dependent MCL1 transcriptional activation.","['Xu, Huiyu', 'Jiang, Beihai', 'Meng, Lin', 'Ren, Tingting', 'Zeng, Yan', 'Wu, Jian', 'Qu, Like', 'Shou, Chengchao']","['Xu H', 'Jiang B', 'Meng L', 'Ren T', 'Zeng Y', 'Wu J', 'Qu L', 'Shou C']","['Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research, Ministry of Education, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120410,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RELA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.258 (N-Terminal Acetyltransferase E)', 'EC 2.3.1.88 (N-Terminal Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.88 (NAT10 protein, human)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'N-Terminal Acetyltransferase E', 'N-Terminal Acetyltransferases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Transcription Factor RelA/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2012/04/13 06:00,2012/09/18 06:00,['2012/04/13 06:00'],"['2012/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['bgs144 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgs144 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2012 Jun;33(6):1193-202. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgs144.

The published data on this manifestation include predominantly case reports and do not provide any statistical information. PURPOSE: To identify clinical signs and radiological features of breast leukemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: PubMed and Medline databases between 1980 and 2010 were screened using 'breast leukemia' and 'leukemia of the breast' as keywords. Secondary references were also reviewed. By this search, a total of 139 patients were identified from the literature. RESULTS: In most patients (n = 85, 61.2%) acute myeloid leukemia was diagnosed. Acute lymphatic leukemia occurred in 35 patients (25.2%). Isolated BL before bone marrow infiltration was seen in 24 patients (17.3%). Involvement of the breast during the course of leukemia was diagnosed in 25 cases (18%). Intramammary leukemic relapse after therapy/stem cell transplantation occurred in 59 patients (42.4%). In 71 cases (51.1%) the lesions were solitary and in 57 (41%) multiple. The number of lesions was not reported in 11 patients (7.9%). There was no significant difference between the number of lesions in ML and LL. Clinically, 73% of the patients presented with palpable breast masses. Most of them were painless. Mammography was performed in 39 patients, allowing the identification of the following three mammographic patterns: breast masses (28 patients, 72%), architectural distortion (5 patients, 13%), no abnormalities (6 patients, 15%). On ultrasound, most identified masses were homogeneously hypoechoic with microlobulated or indistinct margins. On MRI, on T2-weighted images breast lesions were hyperintense. After venous administration of contrast medium, BL showed marked inhomogeneous contrast enhancement. Treatment of BL is the same as for other localizations and is based on chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: In the present study the clinical and radiological features of BL are described. They are non-specific. However, BL should be considered in the differential diagnosis of breast disorders, especially in patients with leukemia.","['Surov, Alexey', 'Wienke, Andreas', 'Abbas, Jasmin']","['Surov A', 'Wienke A', 'Abbas J']","['Department of Radiology, Martin-Luther-University of Halle-Wittenberg, Germany. alex.surow@medizin.uni-halle.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Acta Radiol,"Acta radiologica (Stockholm, Sweden : 1987)",8706123,['0 (Contrast Media)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast/pathology', 'Breast Diseases/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Contrast Media', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image Enhancement/methods', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods', 'Male', 'Mammography/*methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Ultrasonography, Mammary/*methods', 'Young Adult']",2012/04/13 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2012/04/13 06:00'],"['2012/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['53/3/261 [pii]', '10.1258/ar.2011.110470 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Radiol. 2012 Apr 1;53(3):261-6. doi: 10.1258/ar.2011.110470.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, information on the factors determining the risk for such complications is limited. In the present study, we investigated whether constitutional genetic variations in DNA repair predispose to leukemic transformation and new nonmyeloid neoplasias in patients with ET and PV. Case-control studies for predisposition to both types of malignancies were nested in a cohort of 422 subjects diagnosed with ET or PV during the period 1973-2010 in several institutions in Spain. A total of 64 incidence cases of leukemia and 50 cases of primary nonmyeloid cancers were accrued. At conditional regression analysis, the Gln/Gln genotype in the XPD codon 751 showed the strongest association with both leukemic transformation (odds ratio [OR] = 4.9; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.0-12) and development of nonmyeloid malignancies (OR = 4.2; 95% CI, 1.5-12). Additional predictive factors were exposure to cytoreductive agents for leukemic transformation (OR = 3.5; 95% CI, 2.0-6.2) and age for nonmyeloid malignancies (OR = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-2.8).

Previously, we identified a characteristic relapse-specific gene expression and methylation signature associated with chemoresistance using a large cohort of matched-diagnosis relapse samples. We hypothesized that ""reversing"" such a signature might restore chemosensitivity. In the present study, we demonstrate that the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat not only reprograms the aberrant gene expression profile of relapsed blasts by epigenetic mechanisms, but is also synergistic when applied before chemotherapy in primary patient samples and leukemia cell lines. Furthermore, incorporation of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine led to reexpression of genes shown to be preferentially methylated and silenced at relapse. Combination pretreatment with vorinostat and decitabine resulted in even greater cytotoxicity compared with each agent individually with chemotherapy. Our results indicate that acquisition of chemo-resistance at relapse may be driven in part by epigenetic mechanisms. Incorporation of these targeted epigenetic agents to the standard chemotherapy backbone is a promising approach to the treatment of relapsed pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Bhatla, Teena', 'Wang, Jinhua', 'Morrison, Debra J', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Burke, Michael J', 'Brown, Patrick', 'Carroll, William L']","['Bhatla T', 'Wang J', 'Morrison DJ', 'Raetz EA', 'Burke MJ', 'Brown P', 'Carroll WL']","['New York University Cancer Institute, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120411,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Gene Silencing/*drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Vorinostat']",2012/04/13 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2012/04/13 06:00'],"['2012/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47771-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-01-401687 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 May 31;119(22):5201-10. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-01-401687.

METHODS: We evaluated hematological findings of 43 children with SLE diagnosed and followed at the Pediatric Rheumatology Division of Hacettepe University, Turkey. Thirty-seven patients with hematological abnormalities were analyzed in detail. RESULTS: Median age at presentation was 13 years. Hematological involvement was seen in 86% of patients. The most common hematological finding was anemia (n = 30). Anemia was either a Coombs (+) hemolytic one, or was due to other causes. Hemolytic anemia was treated with steroids and intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG). Leucopenia and thrombocytopenia were detected in 35.1 % and 37.8 %, respectively. Bone marrow aspiration was performed in 15, mainly for cytopenia. Secondary dysplastic changes were common. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was diagnosed in one patient. Six patients were diagnosed as having macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). One patient died due to secondary infections and multiorgan failure despite aggressive treatment. In patients diagnosed early, treatment with steroids and cyclosporine resulted in an excellent response. Thrombotic microangiopathy was detected in two patients. Both were treated successfully with steroids and plasma exchange. Antiphospholipid and anticardiolipin antibodies were positive in 12 and 15 of the patients, respectively. Five developed deep vein thrombosis (DVT), one cerebral sinus thrombosis and one presented with purpura fulminans. They were effectively treated with anticoagulation protocol. CONCLUSION: Hematological findings should be carefully assessed and treated vigorously to prevent the morbidity and possible mortality.","['Gokce, M', 'Bilginer, Y', 'Besbas, N', 'Ozaltin, F', 'Cetin, M', 'Gumruk, F', 'Ozen, S']","['Gokce M', 'Bilginer Y', 'Besbas N', 'Ozaltin F', 'Cetin M', 'Gumruk F', 'Ozen S']","['Hacettepe University, School of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120411,England,Lupus,Lupus,9204265,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Cardiolipins)', '0 (Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Steroids)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia, Hemolytic/drug therapy/etiology', 'Antibodies/blood', 'Anticoagulants/therapeutic use', 'Antiphospholipid Syndrome/drug therapy/etiology', 'Cardiolipins/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/therapeutic use', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukopenia/drug therapy/etiology', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*blood/complications/*drug therapy', 'Macrophage Activation Syndrome/etiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Phospholipids/immunology', 'Plasma Exchange', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/etiology', 'Steroids/therapeutic use', 'Thrombotic Microangiopathies/etiology/therapy', 'Venous Thrombosis/drug therapy/etiology']",2012/04/13 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/04/13 06:00'],"['2012/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['0961203312443721 [pii]', '10.1177/0961203312443721 [doi]']",ppublish,Lupus. 2012 Jul;21(8):878-84. doi: 10.1177/0961203312443721.

The growth-inhibitory effects of the tanshinones on K562 and Raji cells were assessed using a modified MTT assay; the apoptosis-inducing effects were assessed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry analysis. The changes in cellular morphology were observed using an inverted phase-contrast microscope. MTT results revealed that these tanshinones inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. The IC50 values of dihydrotanshinone, tanshinone I, tanshinone IIA, and cryptotanshinone for K562 cells were 3.50, 13.52, 19.32, and 47.52 mumol/l at 24 h; 1.36, 4.70, 5.67, and 22.72 mumol/l at 48 h; and 1.15, 1.59, 2.82, and 19.53 mumol/l at 72 h, and the values for Raji cells were 3.30, 4.37, 12.92, and 52.36 mumol/l at 24 h; 1.55, 1.71, 6.54, and 25.45 mumol/l at 48 h; and 1.07, 1.38, 1.89, and 18.47 mumol/l at 72 h. The flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that these tanshinones induced apoptosis of K562 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, and dihydrotanshinone as well as tanshinone I were more potent than tanshinone IIA and cryptotanshinone. Some noticeable apoptotic morphologies could be observed by fluorescence microscopy on tanshinones-treated Raji cells. Collectively, these tanshinones caused growth inhibition and apoptosis in hematological malignancy cell lines, with dihydrotanshinone being the most potent, followed by tanshinone I, tanshinone IIA, and cryptotanshinone.

Because neutrophil elastase (NE) and proteinase-3 (P3) expression is increased in myeloid leukemia, we investigated whether NE and P3 are cross-presented by dendritic cells (DC) and B cells, and whether the NE and P3 source determines immune outcomes. We show that NE and P3 are elevated in leukemia patient serum and that levels correlate with remission status. We demonstrate cellular uptake of NE and P3 into lysosomes, ubiquitination, and proteasome processing for cross-presentation. Using anti-PR1/human leukocyte antigen-A2 monoclonal antibody, we provide direct evidence that B-cells cross-present soluble and leukemia-associated NE and P3, whereas DCs cross-present only leukemia-associated NE and P3. Cross-presentation occurred at early time points but was not associated with DC or B-cell activation, suggesting that NE and P3 cross-presentation may favor tolerance. Furthermore, we show aberrant subcellular localization of NE and P3 in leukemia blasts to compartments that share common elements of the classic major histocompatibility class I antigen-presenting pathway, which may facilitate cross-presentation. Our data demonstrate distinct mechanisms for cross-presentation of soluble and cell-associated NE and P3, which may be valuable in understanding immunity to PR1 in leukemia.","['Alatrash, Gheath', 'Ono, Yoko', 'Sergeeva, Anna', 'Sukhumalchandra, Pariya', 'Zhang, Mao', 'St John, Lisa S', 'Yang, Tian-Hui', 'Ruisaard, Kathryn', 'Armistead, Paul M', 'Mittendorf, Elizabeth A', 'He, Hong', 'Qiao, Na', 'Rodriguez-Cruz, Tania', 'Liang, Shoudan', 'Clise-Dwyer, Karen', 'Wieder, Eric D', 'Lizee, Gregory', 'Lu, Sijie', 'Molldrem, Jeffrey J']","['Alatrash G', 'Ono Y', 'Sergeeva A', 'Sukhumalchandra P', 'Zhang M', 'St John LS', 'Yang TH', 'Ruisaard K', 'Armistead PM', 'Mittendorf EA', 'He H', 'Qiao N', 'Rodriguez-Cruz T', 'Liang S', 'Clise-Dwyer K', 'Wieder ED', 'Lizee G', 'Lu S', 'Molldrem JJ']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cross-Priming/*immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Elastase/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Myeloblastin/*immunology/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Signal Transduction', 'Ubiquitination']",2012/04/13 06:00,2012/08/14 06:00,['2012/04/13 06:00'],"['2012/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CJI.0b013e31824b3b14 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother. 2012 May;35(4):309-20. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0b013e31824b3b14.,,"['R00 CA133244/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA081247-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049639-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81247/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL113594/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA081247/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA133244-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '4R00CA133244-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3326226,['NIHMS357671'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of level of neighborhood deprivation on mortality after a wide range of cancer diagnoses. This 1990-2004 follow-up study included all individuals in Sweden aged 25-74 years and used multilevel logistic regression with individual-level variables at the first level and the level of neighborhood deprivation at the second level. There was a relationship between the level of neighborhood deprivation and mortality for both men and women with cancer. The model accounted for age and socioeconomic factors. For individuals with cancer, the overall risk of mortality was 24% higher for men and 20% higher for women living in the most deprived neighborhoods than in those living in the least deprived neighborhoods. In men and women with kidney, urinary bladder, and endocrine gland cancers, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, mortality differed according to the level of neighborhood deprivation. In men with cancer of the prostate, testes, upper aerodigestive tract, colon, rectum, and lung, mortality differed according to the level of neighborhood deprivation. Mortality differences were also found in women with cancer of the breast, cervix, endometrium, and small intestine, and leukemia.

The purposes of this study are to evaluate the clinical outcome of NHLs of the oral cavity and maxillofacial region in a group of 58 patients who were diagnosed in our clinic and to discuss the clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical features of these malignant neoplasms, as well as the prognosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 58 patients with extranodal NHLs of the oral cavity and maxillofacial region. There were 32 male and 26 female patients. The patients' ages ranged from 7 to 81 years. The most frequent sites of occurrence were the salivary glands (24 patients) and intraoral mucosa (21 patients). Other sites were the paranasal sinus (3 patients), Waldeyer ring (4 patients), bone of the jaws (3 patients), and orbit (3 patients). The histologic subtype was extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) in 21 patients, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in 19, chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 10, mantle cell lymphoma in 4, follicular lymphoma in 2, Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia in 1, and B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) in 1. Of the DLBCL cases, 13 were stage IIE and 6 were stage IE. All the MALT lymphomas were stage IE. RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 5 years after the initial diagnosis. A better prognosis was found in patients with MALT lymphomas (19 of 21 patients are alive) compared with those with DLBCLs (10 of 19 patients are alive). CONCLUSIONS: MALT lymphomas have a more favorable outcome (about 90%) in comparison with DLBCLs. Careful examination of the oral cavity and neck by the maxillofacial surgeon is essential for the diagnosis and staging of lymphomas.","['Triantafillidou, Katherine', 'Dimitrakopoulos, John', 'Iordanidis, Fotis', 'Gkagkalis, Asterios']","['Triantafillidou K', 'Dimitrakopoulos J', 'Iordanidis F', 'Gkagkalis A']","['Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Department of Pathology, G.

Several genes have been identified in AML, such as FLT3, KIT, NPM1, and JAK2. This study investigated the frequency of novel mutations in IDH1 (amino acid R132) and IDH2 (R140 and R172) and analyzed their impact on disease biology and interaction with other mutations in Chinese patients with de novo AML. METHODS: A total of 195 patients were screened for mutations in the IDH1, IDH2, JAK2 V617F, NPM1, FLT3, and KIT genes, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based and direct sequencing assays. RESULTS: IDH mutations occurred at a considerable frequency of 15.89% in Chinese AML cases; IDH2 R140Q was the most frequent genetic alteration and was associated with older age, normal karyotype, and French-American-British classification M2 at diagnosis. There was a strong association of IDH2 mutation with NPM1 mutations and a trend with FLT3-internal-tandem duplication. CONCLUSION: IDH mutations may be a novel genetic marker in cytogenetically normal AML and may cooperate in leukemogenesis.","['Chao, H-Y', 'Jia, Z-X', 'Chen, T', 'Lu, X-Z', 'Cen, L', 'Xiao, R', 'Jiang, N-K', 'Ying, J-H', 'Zhou, M', 'Zhang, R']","['Chao HY', 'Jia ZX', 'Chen T', 'Lu XZ', 'Cen L', 'Xiao R', 'Jiang NK', 'Ying JH', 'Zhou M', 'Zhang R']","['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Changzhou Second Hospital of NanJing Medical University, Changzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120411,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Asians/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'China', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*genetics', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/ethnology/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2012/04/13 06:00,2013/02/13 06:00,['2012/04/13 06:00'],"['2012/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1751-553X.2012.01422.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2012 Oct;34(5):502-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2012.01422.x.

METHODS: We identified induction failure, defined by the persistence of leukemic blasts in blood, bone marrow, or any extramedullary site after 4 to 6 weeks of remission-induction therapy, in 1041 of 44,017 patients (2.4%) 0 to 18 years of age with newly diagnosed ALL who were treated by a total of 14 cooperative study groups between 1985 and 2000. We analyzed the relationships among disease characteristics, treatments administered, and outcomes in these patients. RESULTS: Patients with induction failure frequently presented with high-risk features, including older age, high leukocyte count, leukemia with a T-cell phenotype, the Philadelphia chromosome, and 11q23 rearrangement. With a median follow-up period of 8.3 years (range, 1.5 to 22.1), the 10-year survival rate (+/-SE) was estimated at only 32+/-1%. An age of 10 years or older, T-cell leukemia, the presence of an 11q23 rearrangement, and 25% or more blasts in the bone marrow at the end of induction therapy were associated with a particularly poor outcome. High hyperdiploidy (a modal chromosome number >50) and an age of 1 to 5 years were associated with a favorable outcome in patients with precursor B-cell leukemia. Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation from matched, related donors was associated with improved outcomes in T-cell leukemia. Children younger than 6 years of age with precursor B-cell leukemia and no adverse genetic features had a 10-year survival rate of 72+/-5% when treated with chemotherapy only. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric ALL with induction failure is highly heterogeneous. Patients who have T-cell leukemia appear to have a better outcome with allogeneic stem-cell transplantation than with chemotherapy, whereas patients who have precursor B-cell leukemia without other adverse features appear to have a better outcome with chemotherapy.

Recent gene expression profile analysis of human leukemia stem cells and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations identified a key transcriptional program shared by leukemia stem cells and HSC, which is associated with adverse outcomes in AML patients. One molecule that has been established as a pivotal regulator in fine-tuning of stem cell properties as well as a potent oncogenic determinant is ecotropic viral integration site 1 (EVI1). EVI1 is a transcription factor that has stem cell-specific expression pattern and is essential for the regulation of HSC self-renewal. This gene is notorious for its involvement in AML, as its activation confers extremely poor prognosis in patients with AML. Molecular analysis has identified a variety of gene products that are involved in HSC regulation as downstream targets or interacting proteins of EVI1. Thus, exploration of the molecular pathogenesis underlying EVI1-related leukemogenesis provides insight into how shared stemness transcriptional programs contribute to leukemia progression and therapeutic resistance in AML. Here, we review the current knowledge regarding the role of EVI1 in HSC self-renewal and leukemogenesis and highlight the relationship between stem cell self-renewal properties and adverse outcome in myeloid malignancies.","['Kataoka, Keisuke', 'Kurokawa, Mineo']","['Kataoka K', 'Kurokawa M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120518,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2012/04/13 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2012/04/13 06:00'],"['2012/02/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/02 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2012.02303.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2012 Aug;103(8):1371-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2012.02303.x.

Hypoxia induced differentiation of K562 cells as seen by modifications in their morphological features, up-regulation of C/EBPalpha (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha), and marked IL-8 (interleukin-8) release. Inhibition of NHE1 under hypoxia additionally enhanced the level of C/EBPalpha and further promoted leukaemic cells differentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) also significantly suppressed C/EBPalpha expression under hypoxia conditions after NHE1 inhibition. These results indicate the enhancement of hypoxia-induced K562 differentiation by NHE1 inhibition, which may be due to up-regulation of C/EBPalpha via p38 MAPK signalling pathway, which suggests a possible therapeutic target of NHE1 under hypoxia microenvironment in the treatment of leukaemic diseases.","['Jin, Weina', 'Li, Qinghua', 'Wang, Jian', 'Chang, Guoqiang', 'Lin, Yani', 'Li, Huawen', 'Wang, Lihong', 'Gao, Wei', 'Pang, Tianxiang']","['Jin W', 'Li Q', 'Wang J', 'Chang G', 'Lin Y', 'Li H', 'Wang L', 'Gao W', 'Pang T']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Nanjing Road 288, Tianjin 300020, Peoples Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SLC9A1 protein, human)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchanger 1)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers)', '0 (Sulfones)', '3G0H8C9362 (Cobalt)', '7E3392891K (cariporide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EVS87XF13W (cobaltous chloride)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Cation Transport Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cobalt/pharmacology', 'Guanidines/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration/drug effects', 'Interleukin-8/genetics/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchanger 1', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sulfones/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",2012/04/13 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/04/13 06:00'],"['2012/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['CBI20100919 [pii]', '10.1042/CBI20100919 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2012 Aug 1;36(8):739-45. doi: 10.1042/CBI20100919.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After many years of use is still not well understood their mode of action. Recently, several groups have found that thiopurines can activate autophagy by different mechanisms. Autophagy is a process of auto-digestion. After an infection, radiation, injury, oxidative stress, or after drug treatment, the cellular organelles may be damaged. In those cases the damaged structures are recognized by the cell, isolated in a double-membrane vacuole and finally degraded in autolysosomes. The digestion gives rise to biosynthetic precursors needed to regenerate partially destroyed structures, so as to produce the energy essential in the anabolic process. During fasting, the protein aggregates, lipid droplets and glycogen deposits are degraded by this pathway for releasing nutrients to the blood. Therefore this process is of vital importance in the maintaining of cellular functions and in the systemic homeostasis of whole organism. The therapy with thiopurines leads to adverse effects such as myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity whose mechanism is not well understood today. Autophagy is also involved in liver degeneration induced by drugs, alcohol or viruses. Therefore, seems to be very attractive know whether the autophagy induced by thiopurines is the cause of the hepatotoxicity associated with these drugs, or rather, autophagy is a compensatory response that protects the liver against the deleterious effects of the thiopurines. Our results and previous data suggest that autophagy is beneficial for the liver because protects it against the deleterious effects of thiopurines.","['Guijarro, Luis G', 'Roman, Irene D', 'Fernandez-Moreno, Ma Dolores', 'Gisbert, Javier P', 'Hernandez-Breijo, Borja']","['Guijarro LG', 'Roman ID', 'Fernandez-Moreno MD', 'Gisbert JP', 'Hernandez-Breijo B']","['Unidad de Toxicologia Molecular Hepatica, Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Universidad de Alcala, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Hepaticas y Digestivas (CIBEREHD),Alcala de Henares 28871, Spain. luis__guijarro@telefonica.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Drug Metab,Current drug metabolism,100960533,['0 (Purines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Autophagy/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Purines/*pharmacology']",2012/04/13 06:00,2013/05/23 06:00,['2012/04/13 06:00'],"['2011/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/01 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['CDM-EPUB-20120410-002 [pii]', '10.2174/138920012803341366 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Metab. 2012 Nov;13(9):1267-76. doi: 10.2174/138920012803341366.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a custom-designed assay, we measured the methylation levels of 1,320 CpG sites in regulatory regions of 413 genes that were analyzed because they display allele-specific gene expression (ASE) in ALL cells. The rationale for our selection of CpG sites was that ASE could be the result of allele-specific methylation in the promoter regions of the genes. We found that the ALL cells had methylation profiles that allowed distinction between ALL cells and control cells. Using stringent criteria for calling differential methylation, we identified 28 CpG sites in 24 genes with recurrent differences in their methylation levels between ALL cells and control cells. Twenty of the differentially methylated genes were hypermethylated in the ALL cells, and as many as nine of them (AMICA1, CPNE7, CR1, DBC1, EYA4, LGALS8, RYR3, UQCRFS1, WDR35) have functions in cell signaling and/or apoptosis. The methylation levels of a subset of the genes were consistent with an inverse relationship with the mRNA expression levels in a large number of ALL cells from published data sets, supporting a potential biological effect of the methylation signatures and their application for diagnostic purposes.","['Nordlund, Jessica', 'Milani, Lili', 'Lundmark, Anders', 'Lonnerholm, Gudmar', 'Syvanen, Ann-Christine']","['Nordlund J', 'Milani L', 'Lundmark A', 'Lonnerholm G', 'Syvanen AC']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120406,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'CpG Islands/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Remission Induction']",2012/04/12 06:00,2012/09/05 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0034513 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-01632 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e34513. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0034513.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Icariside II blocked the growth U937 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In this anti-proliferation process, this herb compound rendered the cells susceptible to apoptosis, manifested by enhanced accumulation of sub-G1 cell population and increased the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells. Icariside II was able to activate caspase-3 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in a time-dependent manner. Concurrently, the anti-apoptotic proteins, such as bcl-x(L) and survivin in U937 cells, were downregulated by Icariside II. In addition, Icariside II could inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation and function and subsequently suppress the activation of Janus activated kinase 2 (JAK2), the upstream activators of STAT3, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Icariside II also enhanced the expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) SH2 domain-containing phosphatase (SHP)-1, and the addition of sodium pervanadate (a PTP inhibitor) prevented Icariside II-induced apoptosis as well as STAT3 inactivation in STAT3 positive U937 cells. Furthermore, silencing SHP-1 using its specific siRNA significantly blocked STAT3 inactivation and apoptosis induced by Icariside II in U937 cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrated that via targeting STAT3-related signaling, Icariside II sensitizes U937 cells to apoptosis and perhaps serves as a potent chemotherapeutic agent for AML.","['Kang, Sang-Hun', 'Jeong, Soo-Jin', 'Kim, Sun-Hee', 'Kim, Ji-Hyun', 'Jung, Ji Hoon', 'Koh, Wonil', 'Kim, Jung Hyo', 'Kim, Dae Keun', 'Chen, Chang-Yan', 'Kim, Sung-Hoon']","['Kang SH', 'Jeong SJ', 'Kim SH', 'Kim JH', 'Jung JH', 'Koh W', 'Kim JH', 'Kim DK', 'Chen CY', 'Kim SH']","['College of Oriental Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120406,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '113558-15-9 (baohuoside I)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epimedium/*chemistry', 'Flavonoids/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry', 'Plant Roots/*chemistry', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Survivin', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",2012/04/12 06:00,2012/09/05 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2011/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0028706 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-07002 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(4):e28706. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0028706.

The inhibitory effects of propranolol on tumor cells growth and also its cytotoxicity on cancerous cells have been revealed by several studies. In this study the sensitivity of a number of human leukemic cell lines to propranolol was evaluated in vitro. METHODS: Two human leukemic T cells (Molt-4 and Jurkat) and a monocyte (U937) cell line were used in this study. The cells were cultured in complete RPMI medium and then incubated with different concentrations of propranolol (0.0004 -0.4 mM) in the presence or absence of phytoheamagglutinin (20 mug/ml) for 12, 24 and 48 hours. The cytotoxic effect of the drug was then assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion and also 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide) (MTT) reduction methods. RESULTS: Propranolol induced a significant dose dependent cytotoxic effect at >/= 0.2 mM concentration on all three human cell lines (Molt-4, Jurkat and U937) used in this study, after 12 hours incubation onwards, compared to untreated control cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that leukemic cell lines used in this study were sensitive to propranolol at >/= 0.2 mM concentration of the drug. These results suggest that propranolol may have potential implication in chemoprevention of lymphoproliferative disorders along with its chronic long-term usage in cardiac problems.

Surprisingly, the self-ligand cell surface receptor Slamf1 functions not only as a co-stimulatory molecule but also as a microbial sensor of several Gram-negative bacteria. Upon entering the phagosome of macrophages Slamf1 induces production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, which positively regulates the activity of the NOX2 enzyme and phagolysosomal maturation. Here, we report that in Escherichia coli-containing phagosomes of mouse macrophages, Slamf1 interacts with the class III PI3K Vps34 in a complex with Beclin-1 and UVRAG. Upon phagocytosis of bacteria the NOX2 activity was reduced in macrophages isolated from Beclin-1(+/-) mice compared with wild-type mice. This Slamf1/Beclin-1/Vps34/UVRAG protein complex is formed in intracellular membrane compartments as it is found without inducing phagocytosis in macrophages, human chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, and transfectant HEK293 cells. Elimination of its cytoplasmic tail abolished the interaction of Slamf1 with the complex, but deletion or mutation of the two ITAM motifs did not. Both the BD and CCD domains of Beclin-1 were required for efficient binding to Slamf1. Because Slamf1 did not interact with Atg14L or Rubicon, which can also form a complex with Vps34 and Beclin-1, we conclude that Slamf1 recruits a subset of Vps34-associated proteins, which is involved in membrane fusion and NOX2 regulation.","['Ma, Chunyan', 'Wang, Ninghai', 'Detre, Cynthia', 'Wang, Guoxing', ""O'Keeffe, Michael"", 'Terhorst, Cox']","['Ma C', 'Wang N', 'Detre C', 'Wang G', ""O'Keeffe M"", 'Terhorst C']","['Division of Immunology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. cma@bidmc.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120409,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Becn1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (SLAMF1 protein, human)', '0 (Slamf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (UVRAG protein, human)', '0 (UVRAG protein, mouse)', '169535-43-7 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family Member 1)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (CYBB protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (Cybb protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class III Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Beclin-1', 'Cell Line', 'Class III Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Membrane Fusion/*physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NADPH Oxidase 2', 'NADPH Oxidases/*metabolism', 'Phagosomes/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/*physiology', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family Member 1', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']",2012/04/12 06:00,2012/08/16 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)50078-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.367060 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2012 May 25;287(22):18359-65. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.367060.

In contrast, TP53 defects are not associated with resistance to the anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab or methylprednisolone. In an attempt to improve the treatment of TP53-defective CLL, a multicenter phase II study was developed to evaluate alemtuzumab and methylprednisolone in combination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with TP53-deleted CLL (17 untreated and 22 previously treated) received up to 16 weeks of treatment with alemtuzumab 30 mg three times a week and methylprednisolone 1.0 g/m(2) for five consecutive days every 4 weeks. Antimicrobial prophylaxis consisted of cotrimoxazole, itraconazole, and aciclovir (or valganciclovir for asymptomatic cytomegalovirus viremia). The primary end point was response as assigned by an end-point review committee. Secondary end points were safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The overall response rate, complete response rate (including with incomplete marrow recovery), median PFS, and median OS were 85%, 36%, 11.8 months, and 23.5 months, respectively, in the entire cohort and 88%, 65%, 18.3 months, and 38.9 months, respectively, in previously untreated patients. Grade 3 to 4 hematologic and glucocorticoid-associated toxicity occurred in 67% and 23% of patients, respectively. Grade 3 to 4 infection occurred in 51% of the overall cohort and in 29% of patients less than 60 years of age. Treatment-related mortality was 5%. CONCLUSION: Alemtuzumab plus methypredisolone is the most effective induction regimen hitherto reported in TP53-deleted CLL. The risk of infection is age related and, in younger patients, seems only marginally higher than that associated with rituximab, fludarabine, and cyclophosphamide.","['Pettitt, Andrew R', 'Jackson, Richard', 'Carruthers, Stacey', 'Dodd, James', 'Dodd, Susanna', 'Oates, Melanie', 'Johnson, Gillian G', 'Schuh, Anna', 'Matutes, Estella', 'Dearden, Claire E', 'Catovsky, Daniel', 'Radford, John A', 'Bloor, Adrian', 'Follows, George A', 'Devereux, Stephen', 'Kruger, Anton', 'Blundell, Julie', 'Agrawal, Samir', 'Allsup, David', 'Proctor, Stephen', 'Heartin, Earnest', 'Oscier, David', 'Hamblin, Terry J', 'Rawstron, Andrew', 'Hillmen, Peter']","['Pettitt AR', 'Jackson R', 'Carruthers S', 'Dodd J', 'Dodd S', 'Oates M', 'Johnson GG', 'Schuh A', 'Matutes E', 'Dearden CE', 'Catovsky D', 'Radford JA', 'Bloor A', 'Follows GA', 'Devereux S', 'Kruger A', 'Blundell J', 'Agrawal S', 'Allsup D', 'Proctor S', 'Heartin E', 'Oscier D', 'Hamblin TJ', 'Rawstron A', 'Hillmen P']","['University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK. arp@liverpool.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120409,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Academies and Institutes', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis/methods', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Deletion', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/*administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United Kingdom']",2012/04/12 06:00,2012/07/13 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/13 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.35.9695 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.35.9695 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2012 May 10;30(14):1647-55. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.35.9695.

Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec((R)), ST1571, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland) is a selective inhibitor of break point cluster-Ableson (BCR-ABL), c-Kit, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha) tyrosine kinases. Imatinib has been approved in the U.S. for the treatment of Philadelphia-chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia, KIT (CD117)-positive unresectable and metastatic malignant GIST and adjuvant treatment of adult patients following resection. Ocular side effects are commonly reported with Gleevec((R)), the most common being periorbital edema and epiphora. CASE REPORT: Here we present the case of a 62-year-old male with a history of GIST in the jejunum who was started with imatinib mesylate at 400 milligrams daily. Seven months into his therapy, he reported blurry vision. He was evaluated by an ophthalmologist, and was ultimately found to have retinal hemorrhage and neovascularization. His dose was reduced by 50% to 200 milligrams daily with an almost complete resolution of symptoms within several weeks. No recurrence of symptoms or signs was noticed at 6 months follow-up. DISCUSSION: This patient's Naranjo scale was calculated to be 7, indicating a probable adverse drug reaction. Our patient's symptoms significantly improved with a dose reduction of imatinib, and this hints that there was a dose-dependent effect. The World Health Organization has categorized retinal hemorrhage as an unlikely side-effect of therapy, and to our knowledge this has never been reported before in a patient receiving imatinib mesylate for GIST treatment. Neovascularization also has not been previously reported in patients receiving this medication. It is important to identify less common ocular toxicity in patients receiving imatinib.","['Gulati, Anthony Paul', 'Saif, Muhammad Wasif']","['Gulati AP', 'Saif MW']","['Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Retinal Hemorrhage/*chemically induced', 'Retinal Neovascularization/*chemically induced']",2012/04/12 06:00,2012/05/25 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['32/4/1375 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2012 Apr;32(4):1375-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we investigated the transcriptional control of CCR4 expression in ATLL and have found that an activating protein 1 (AP1) family member, FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FOS)-related antigen 2 (FRA2), is consistently expressed at high levels in ATLL and, together with v-JUN avian sarcoma virus 17 oncogene homolog D (JUND), up-regulates the expression of CCR4 as well as that of several proto-oncogenes such as v-MYB myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB), murine double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), and B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6). Here, we examined the expression of these genes in clinical samples of CTCLs. We detected the transcripts of FRA2, JUND, CCR4, MYB, MDM2, and BCL6 at high levels in CTCL skin lesions. Except for BCL6, we confirmed protein expression of FRA2, JUND, CCR4, MYB, and MDM2 in CTCL skin lesions. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of FRA2 or JUND suppressed cell growth and the expression of CCR4, MYB, MDM2, and BCL6 in CTCL cell lines.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data of twenty patients with untreated AML or high-risk MDS who were ineligible for standard-dose Ara-C plus anthracycline and received CA as remission-induction therapy were analyzed. CA consisted of low-dose Ara-C (10 mg/m(2), subcutaneous injection every 12 hours, for 14 days) and aclarubicin (14 mg/m(2) for patients <70 years old and 10 mg/m(2) for patients >/=70 years old in a one-hour infusion for 4 days). Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was used from day 1 of CA to white blood cell count (WBC) recovery, except for patients with initial WBC of more than 20.0x10(3)/mm(3). RESULTS: Eleven patients (55%) achieved complete remission. All four patients whose WBC were >/=20.0x10(3)/mm(3) and did not receive G-CSF were refractory to CA. The predicted 2-year overall survival rate and median survival duration of all 20 patients were 37.9% and 363 days, respectively. The predicted 1-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rate and median duration of RFS of 11 patients who achieved complete remission were 30.3% and 332 days, respectively. Only one patient died due to transfusion-related acute lung injury. No patients died due to severe infections. CONCLUSION: CA combination with G-CSF as remission-induction therapy is promising and well-tolerated in patients with previously untreated AML or high-risk MDS who are ineligible for standard-dose Ara-C plus anthracycline without leukocytosis.

On one hand, angiogenic factors secreted by stem cells are known to be essential for tumor vascularization. On the other hand, stem cell-derived factors can reportedly induce tumor differentiation or direct death of tumor cells. Both the placenta and umbilical cord are rich sources of stem cells with immune modulatory and tissue-healing properties; however, the effects of placental components on cancer cells have not been fully defined. Here we demonstrate that extracts of placental lysates reduce the malignancy of a variety of human tumor cell lines in a species-unrestricted manner. Using a standard model of leukemia cell differentiation, we demonstrated that addition of placental extracts to tumor cells, or co-culture of tumor cells with the CD34(+) cells from umbilical cord blood, induced tumor cell differentiation. Inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis in vivo was also observed following administration of placental extracts. These data support the concept of non-toxic biological therapy of cancer using stem cell derivatives, possibly through the induction of tumor cell differentiation.","['Marleau, Annette M', 'McDonald, Greg', 'Koropatnick, James', 'Chen, Chien-Shing', 'Koos, David']","['Marleau AM', 'McDonald G', 'Koropatnick J', 'Chen CS', 'Koos D']","['Department of Immunology, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Huntington Beach, CA 92647, USA. amarleau@immed.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/*pathology', 'Placenta/*cytology', 'Pregnancy']",2012/04/12 06:00,2012/05/25 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['32/4/1153 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2012 Apr;32(4):1153-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the susceptibility to chromosomal aberrations in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) progenitors after exposure to ionizing radiation. In normal progenitors, ionizing radiation induced both stable and unstable chromosomal lesions, but only stable aberrations persisted after multiple divisions. In contrast, radiation of chronic phase CML progenitors resulted in enhanced generation of unstable lesions that persisted after multiple divisions. CML progenitors demonstrated active cell cycle checkpoints and increased nonhomologous end joining DNA repair, suggesting that persistence of unstable aberrations was the result of continued generation of these lesions. CML progenitors demonstrated enhanced susceptibility to repeated cycles of chromosome damage, repair, and damage through a breakage-fusion-bridge mechanism. Perpetuation of breakage-fusion-bridge cycles in CML progenitors was mediated by classic nonhomologous end joining repair. These studies reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism of chromosomal instability in leukemia progenitors because of continued generation of unstable chromosomal lesions through repeated cycles of breakage and repair of such lesions.","['Chakraborty, Sujata', 'Stark, Jeremy M', 'Sun, Can-Lan', 'Modi, Hardik', 'Chen, WenYong', ""O'Connor, Timothy R"", 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Bhatia, Smita', 'Bhatia, Ravi']","['Chakraborty S', 'Stark JM', 'Sun CL', 'Modi H', 'Chen W', ""O'Connor TR"", 'Forman SJ', 'Bhatia S', 'Bhatia R']","['Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120404,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics/physiology/radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomal Instability/*genetics/radiation effects', '*Chromosome Breakage/radiation effects', 'DNA Damage/physiology', 'DNA End-Joining Repair/genetics/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Gene Fusion/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Recurrence']",2012/04/12 06:00,2012/09/11 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47600-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-05-352252 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jun 28;119(26):6187-97. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-05-352252.

We detected up-regulation of miR-29a and miR-142-3p during myeloid differentiation in leukemia cell lines and CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. By gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrated that both miRNAs promote the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced monocytic and all-trans-retinoic acid-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL-60, THP-1, or NB4 cells. Both the miRNAs directly inhibited cyclin T2 gene, preventing the release of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma and resulting in induction of monocytic differentiation. In addition, a target of miR-29a, cyclin-dependent kinase 6 gene, and a target of miR-142-3p, TGF-beta-activated kinase 1/MAP3K7 binding protein 2 gene, are involved in the regulation of both monocytic and granulocytic differentiation. A significant decrease of miR-29a and 142-3p levels and an obvious increase in their target protein levels were also observed in blasts from acute myeloid leukemia. By lentivirus-mediated gene transfer, we demonstrated that enforced expression of either miR-29a or miR-142-3p in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from healthy controls and acute myeloid leukemia patients down-regulated expression of their targets and promoted myeloid differentiation. These findings confirm that miR-29a and miR-142-3p are key regulators of normal myeloid differentiation and their reduced expression is involved in acute myeloid leukemia development.","['Wang, Xiao-Shuang', 'Gong, Jia-Nan', 'Yu, Jia', 'Wang, Fang', 'Zhang, Xin-Hua', 'Yin, Xiao-Lin', 'Tan, Zhen-Qing', 'Luo, Zi-Mian', 'Yang, Gui-Hua', 'Shen, Chao', 'Zhang, Jun-Wu']","['Wang XS', 'Gong JN', 'Yu J', 'Wang F', 'Zhang XH', 'Yin XL', 'Tan ZQ', 'Luo ZM', 'Yang GH', 'Shen C', 'Zhang JW']","['National Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120404,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (MIRN142 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/physiology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Myeloid Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2012/04/12 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47821-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-10-385716 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 May 24;119(21):4992-5004. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-10-385716.

A total of 547 patients with a median age of 33 years (range, 15-55) experiencing their first relapse (406 vs 141 shorter or longer than 18 months from diagnosis) were evaluated. The aim of salvage therapy was to achieve a complete remission (CR) with subsequent a stem cell transplantation (SCT).

After failure of first salvage (n = 82), the CR rate after second salvage was 33%. In relapse after SCT (n = 48) the CR rate after first salvage was 23%. The median overall survival after relapse was 8.4 months and survival was 24% at 3 years. Prognostic factors for survival were relapse localization, response to salvage, performance of SCT, and age. Overall survival appeared superior compared with previously published studies, likely because of the high rate of SCT in the present study (75%).

During normal hematopoiesis, HoxA10 facilitates myeloid progenitor expansion and impedes myeloid differentiation. To better understand the molecular mechanisms that control these events, we have been identifying and characterizing HoxA10 target genes. In this study, we identified the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf2 or basic fibroblast growth factor) as a target gene that is relevant to the biological effects of HoxA10. We identified two cis elements in the proximal FGF2 promoter that are activated by HoxA10 in myeloid progenitor cells and differentiating phagocytes. We determined that Fgf2 expression and secretion are regulated in a HoxA10-dependent manner in these cells. We found that increased Fgf2 production by HoxA10-overexpressing myeloid progenitor cells induced a phosphoinositol 3-kinase-dependent increase in beta-catenin protein. This resulted in autocrine stimulation of proliferation in HoxA10-overexpressing cells and hypersensitivity to other cytokines that share this pathway. Therefore, these studies identified expression of Fgf2 as a mechanism by which HoxA10 controls the size of the myeloid progenitor population. These studies also suggested that aberrant production of Fgf2 may contribute to leukemogenesis in the subset of AML with dysregulated Hox expression. Therapeutic targeting of Fgf2-stimulated signaling pathways might be a rational approach to this poor prognosis subset of AML.","['Shah, Chirag A', 'Bei, Ling', 'Wang, Hao', 'Platanias, Leonidas C', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A']","['Shah CA', 'Bei L', 'Wang H', 'Platanias LC', 'Eklund EA']","['Feinberg School of Medicine and Robert H.

Additionally, high BAALC expression occurs in glioblastoma, melanoma, and childhood gastrointestinal stroma tumors, suggesting an oncogenic role for BAALC. However, the mechanisms underlying the deregulated expression are unknown. We hypothesized that a common heritable genetic feature located in cis might account for overexpression of BAALC in an allele-specific manner. By sequencing the genomic region of BAALC we identified nine informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and tested them for a possible association with BAALC expression levels. We show that BAALC overexpression occurs in the presence of the T allele of SNP rs62527607[GT], which creates a binding site for the activating RUNX1 transcription factor in the BAALC promoter region. The mechanism is demonstrated experimentally in vitro using luciferase reporter assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis. The association of high BAALC expression with the T allele and its correlations with RUNX1 expresser status are shown in vivo in a test set (n = 253) and validation set (n = 105) of samples from cytogenetically normal AML patients from different populations. Thus, we identify a heritable genomic feature predisposing to overexpression of an oncogene, thereby possibly leading to enhanced AML leukemogenesis.

The study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of long-term trends in cancer mortality in China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used joinpoint analysis to detect changes in trends and generalized additive models to study birth cohort effect of risk factors between 1987 and 2009. RESULTS: Mortality of all cancers declined steadily in urban areas, but not in rural areas. Decreasing mortality from cancers of the stomach, esophagus, nasopharynx, and cervix uteri was observed, while lung and female breast cancer mortality increased. Mortality from leukemia remained relatively stable, and cancer of liver, colorectal, and bladder had different trends between the rural and urban areas. Generational risks peaked in the cohorts born around 1925-1930 and tended to decline in successive cohorts for most cancers except for leukemia, whose relative risks were rising in the very recent cohorts. CONCLUSION: The observed trends primarily reflect dramatic changes in socioeconomic development and lifestyle in China over the past two decades, and mortality from cancers of lung and female breast still represents a major public health priority for the government.","['Guo, P', 'Huang, Z L', 'Yu, P', 'Li, K']","['Guo P', 'Huang ZL', 'Yu P', 'Li K']","['Department of Preventive Medicine.', 'Department of Laboratory of Cell Senescence, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine.

Thus, TCF1 and beta-catenin regulate the generation of PLZF-expressing thymocytes and thereby facilitate the generation of memory-like CD8 T cells in the thymus.","['Sharma, Archna', 'Chen, Qinghua', 'Nguyen, Trang', 'Yu, Qing', 'Sen, Jyoti Misra']","['Sharma A', 'Chen Q', 'Nguyen T', 'Yu Q', 'Sen JM']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Immunology, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Eomes protein, mouse)', '0 (Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-alpha)', '0 (Hnf1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (T Cell Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD8 Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Movement/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-alpha', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4/genetics/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'T Cell Transcription Factor 1/deficiency/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Thymocytes/cytology/*immunology/physiology', 'beta Catenin/genetics/*immunology']",2012/04/12 06:00,2012/06/22 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['188/8/3859 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1103729 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2012 Apr 15;188(8):3859-68. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1103729.,,['Z99 AG999999/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3471543,['NIHMS405487'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The master regulator of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells GATA-2 was cloned almost 20 years ago, and elegant genetic analyses demonstrated its essential function to promote hematopoiesis. While certain GATA-2 target genes are implicated in leukemogenesis, only recently have definitive insights emerged linking GATA-2 to human hematologic pathophysiologies. These pathophysiologies include myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia and an immunodeficiency syndrome with complex phenotypes including leukemia. As GATA-2 has a pivotal role in the etiology of human cancer, it is instructive to consider mechanisms underlying normal GATA factor function/regulation and how dissecting such mechanisms may reveal unique opportunities for thwarting GATA-2-dependent processes in a therapeutic context. This article highlights GATA factor mechanistic principles, with a heavy emphasis on GATA-1 and GATA-2 functions in the hematopoietic system, and new links between GATA-2 dysregulation and human pathophysiologies.","['Bresnick, Emery H', 'Katsumura, Koichi R', 'Lee, Hsiang-Ying', 'Johnson, Kirby D', 'Perkins, Archibald S']","['Bresnick EH', 'Katsumura KR', 'Lee HY', 'Johnson KD', 'Perkins AS']","['Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research, Paul Carbone Cancer Center, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705, USA. ehbresni@wisc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120405,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (GATA Transcription Factors)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)']",IM,"['GATA Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational']",2012/04/12 06:00,2012/10/23 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['gks281 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gks281 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2012 Jul;40(13):5819-31. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks281.

Furthermore, treatment with sulfuretin caused mitochondrial dysfunctions, including the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, and the translocations of Bax and tBid. Sulfuretin also activated the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, that is, it increased the expressions of Fas and FasL, the activation of caspase-8, and the cleavage of Bid. Furthermore, blocking the FasL-Fas interaction with NOK-1 monoclonal antibody prevented the sulfuretin-induced apoptosis.

The objective of this study was to explore the ability of neratinib to reverse tumor multidrug resistance attributable to overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Our results showed that neratinib remarkably enhanced the sensitivity of ABCB1-overexpressing cells to ABCB1 substrates. It is noteworthy that neratinib augmented the effect of chemotherapeutic agents in inhibiting the growth of ABCB1-overexpressing primary leukemia blasts and KBv200 cell xenografts in nude mice. Furthermore, neratinib increased doxorubicin accumulation in ABCB1-overexpressing cell lines and Rhodamine 123 accumulation in ABCB1-overexpressing cell lines and primary leukemia blasts. Neratinib stimulated the ATPase activity of ABCB1 at low concentrations but inhibited it at high concentrations. Likewise, neratinib inhibited the photolabeling of ABCB1 with [(125)I]iodoarylazidoprazosin in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50) = 0.24 muM). Neither the expression of ABCB1 at the mRNA and protein levels nor the phosphorylation of Akt was affected by neratinib at reversal concentrations. Docking simulation results were consistent with the binding conformation of neratinib within the large cavity of the transmembrane region of ABCB1, which provides computational support for the cross-reactivity of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with human ABCB1. In conclusion, neratinib can reverse ABCB1-mediated multidrug resistance in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo by inhibiting its transport function.","['Zhao, Xiao-qin', 'Xie, Jing-dun', 'Chen, Xing-gui', 'Sim, Hong May', 'Zhang, Xu', 'Liang, Yong-ju', 'Singh, Satyakam', 'Talele, Tanaji T', 'Sun, Yueli', 'Ambudkar, Suresh V', 'Chen, Zhe-Sheng', 'Fu, Li-wu']","['Zhao XQ', 'Xie JD', 'Chen XG', 'Sim HM', 'Zhang X', 'Liang YJ', 'Singh S', 'Talele TT', 'Sun Y', 'Ambudkar SV', 'Chen ZS', 'Fu LW']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510060, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120404,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'JJH94R3PWB (neratinib)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics/*metabolism', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Quinolines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rhodamines/pharmacology', 'rho-Associated Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",2012/04/12 06:00,2012/10/30 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.111.076299 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.111.076299 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2012 Jul;82(1):47-58. doi: 10.1124/mol.111.076299.

PTEN mutations have been proposed as secondary mutations that follow NOTCH1-activating mutations and cause cellular resistance to gamma-secretase inhibitors. DESIGN AND METHODS: The impact of PTEN, PI3K and AKT aberrations was studied in a genetically well-characterized pediatric T-cell leukemia patient cohort (n=146) treated on DCOG or COALL protocols. RESULTS: PTEN and AKT E17K aberrations were detected in 13% and 2% of patients, respectively. Defective PTEN-splicing was identified in incidental cases. Patients without PTEN protein but lacking exon-, splice-, promoter mutations or promoter hypermethylation were present. PTEN/AKT mutations were especially abundant in TAL- or LMO-rearranged leukemia but nearly absent in TLX3-rearranged patients (P=0.03), the opposite to that observed for NOTCH1-activating mutations. Most PTEN/AKT mutant patients either lacked NOTCH1-activating mutations (P=0.006) or had weak NOTCH1-activating mutations (P=0.011), and consequently expressed low intracellular NOTCH1, cMYC and MUSASHI levels. T-cell leukemia patients without PTEN/AKT and NOTCH1-activating mutations fared well, with a cumulative incidence of relapse of only 8% versus 35% for PTEN/AKT and/or NOTCH1-activated patients (P=0.005).

No risk factors for these complications have so far been identified. The aim of this study was to classify the hematologic complications occurring in patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and to investigate the risk factors for these complications. DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and two patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, with a median follow-up of 11.6 years, were studied. Major hematologic complications were considered in the case of definitive severe cytopenia (i.e. anemia <7 g/dL or thrombocytopenia <20 x 10(9)/L), classified as malignant (myelodysplasia/leukemia) according to the 2008 World Health Organization classification or as non-malignant. RESULTS: Severe cytopenia was observed in 21 patients and classified as malignant severe cytopenia (n=9), non-malignant severe cytopenia (n=9) and malignant severe cytopenia preceded by non-malignant severe cytopenia (n=3). The 20-year cumulative risk of severe cytopenia was 24.3% (95% confidence interval: 15.3%-38.5%). Young age at first symptoms (<3 months) and low hematologic parameters both at diagnosis of the disease and during the follow-up were associated with severe hematologic complications (P<0.001). Fifteen novel SBDS mutations were identified. Genotype analysis showed no discernible prognostic value. CONCLUSIONS Patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome with very early symptoms or cytopenia at diagnosis (even mild anemia or thrombocytopenia) should be considered at a high risk of severe hematologic complications, malignant or non-malignant. Transient severe cytopenia or an indolent cytogenetic clone had no deleterious value.","['Donadieu, Jean', 'Fenneteau, Odile', 'Beaupain, Blandine', 'Beaufils, Sandrine', 'Bellanger, Florence', 'Mahlaoui, Nizar', 'Lambilliotte, Anne', 'Aladjidi, Nathalie', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Mialou, Valerie', 'Perot, Christine', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Fouyssac, Fanny', 'Paillard, Catherine', 'Gandemer, Virginie', 'Boutard, Patrick', 'Schmitz, Jacques', 'Morali, Alain', 'Leblanc, Thierry', 'Bellanne-Chantelot, Christine']","['Donadieu J', 'Fenneteau O', 'Beaupain B', 'Beaufils S', 'Bellanger F', 'Mahlaoui N', 'Lambilliotte A', 'Aladjidi N', 'Bertrand Y', 'Mialou V', 'Perot C', 'Michel G', 'Fouyssac F', 'Paillard C', 'Gandemer V', 'Boutard P', 'Schmitz J', 'Morali A', 'Leblanc T', 'Bellanne-Chantelot C']","[""AP-HP Registre Francais des Neutropenies Congenitales, Hopital Trousseau, Service d'Hemato-oncologie Pediatrique, APHP, Paris, France. jean.donadieu@trs.aphp.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120404,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['Shwachman syndrome'],IM,"['Bone Marrow Diseases/*complications/mortality', 'Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency/*complications/mortality', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'France', 'Hematologic Diseases/*classification/*etiology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lipomatosis/*complications/mortality', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome', 'Survival Rate']",2012/04/12 06:00,2015/04/15 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.057489 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.057489 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Sep;97(9):1312-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.057489.

Several cytokines have been identified as modulators of NKG2D receptor expression. However, little is known about NKG2D gene regulation. In this study, we found that microRNA 1245 attenuated the expression of NKG2D in natural killer cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the potential interactions between the 3'-untranslated region of the NKG2D gene and microRNA as well as their functional roles in the regulation of NKG2D expression and cytotoxicity in natural killer cells. RESULTS: Transforming growth factor-beta1, a major negative regulator of NKG2D expression, post-transcriptionally up-regulated mature microRNA-1245 expression, thus down-regulating NKG2D expression and impairing NKG2D-mediated immune responses in natural killer cells. Conversely, microRNA-1245 down-regulation significantly increased the expression of NKG2D expression in natural killer cells, resulting in more efficient NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS These results reveal a novel NKG2D regulatory pathway mediated by microRNA-1245, which may represent one of the mechanisms used by transforming growth factor-beta1 to attenuate NKG2D expression in natural killer cells.","['Espinoza, J Luis', 'Takami, Akiyoshi', 'Yoshioka, Katsuji', 'Nakata, Katsuya', 'Sato, Tokiharu', 'Kasahara, Yoshihito', 'Nakao, Shinji']","['Espinoza JL', 'Takami A', 'Yoshioka K', 'Nakata K', 'Sato T', 'Kasahara Y', 'Nakao S']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kanazawa University Hospital 13-1 Takaramachi, Kanazawa, 920-8641, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120404,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/chemistry/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/metabolism']",2012/04/12 06:00,2015/04/15 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.058529 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.058529 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Sep;97(9):1295-303. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.058529.

Epigenetic alterations may serve as markers of disease, and may potentially be used for classification, prognostication and to monitor minimal residual disease. In addition, we now have the capability to pharmaceutically target epigenetic modifications, and there is an urgent need for early validation of the efficacy of the drugs. Also, an improved understanding of the functionality of epigenetic modifications may further pave the road towards individualized therapy. The recent advances in biotechnology and bioinformatics provide a plethora of novel tools for characterizing the epigenome in clinical samples, but at this point the practical, clinical utility of these methodologies needs further exploration.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixty-one adults with a median age of 46 years (range 19-65 years) have been enrolled. Diagnoses were acute myeloid leukemia (n=38), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=8), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=6), myeloma (n=4), chronic myeloid leukemia (n=3), chronic lymphatic leukemia (n=1) and myelodysplastic syndrome (n=1). Patients were considered high risk because of refractory disease (n=18), cytogenetics (n=6), complete remission (>/= 2) (n=9), chemosensitive relapse in partial remission (n=4) or relapse after prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (n=15 allogeneic, n=8 autologous, n=1 both). At haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 30 patients were in complete remission and 31 in partial remission. Grafts contained a median of 7.0 x 10(6) (range 3.2-22) CD34(+) cells/kg, 4.2 x 10(4) (range 0.6-44) CD3(+) T cells/kg and 2.7 x 10(7) (range 0.00-37.3) CD56(+) cells/kg. RESULTS: Engraftment was rapid with a median of 12 days to granulocytes more than 0.5 x 10(9)/L (range 9-50 days) and 11 days to platelets more than 20 x 10(9) (range 7-38 days). Incidence of grade IIIV acute graft-versus-host-disease and chronic graft-versus-host-disease was 46% and 18%, respectively. Non-relapse mortality on Day 100 was 23% and 42% at two years. Cumulative incidence of relapse/progression at two years was 31%. Kaplan-Meier estimated 1-year and 2-year overall survival with median follow up of 869 days (range 181-1932) is 41% and 28%, respectively.

We studied the protective effect of leptin on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by using mice transient focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury model. METHODS: The distribution of 125I-leptin in the mouse brain was assessed by radioimmunoassay method. Mouse models of transient focal cerebral ischemia were established by occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery for two hours followed by 24 hours reperfusion. The neurologic deficits and infarct volume were determined using the Longa's score and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, respectively. Regional cerebral blood flow was monitored by a laser-Doppler blood flowmeter. The levels of malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, nitric oxide synthase, and superoxide dismutase were detected according to respective assay kit. The histologic changes and neuronal apoptosis were observed with hematoxylin and eosin and transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling staining, respectively. The expression of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and cysteineasparateprotease-3 (caspase-3) were investigated by Western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS: Leptin decreased infarct volume and neurologic defects and improved regional cerebral blood flow and microvascular branch blood flow after injury. The malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels were reduced, and superoxide dismutase level was increased after leptin treatment, which also minimized histologic changes and neuronal apoptosis, led to the upregulation of Bcl-2 and downregulation of caspase-3 expression after injury. CONCLUSIONS: Peripherally administered leptin crossed the blood-brain barrier and was distributed into multiple regions of the brain; in the brain, leptin directly alleviated the injury-evoked damages by reducing oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis.","['Zhang, Jin-Ying Jr', 'Si, Yi-Ling', 'Liao, Jie', 'Yan, Guang-Tao', 'Deng, Zi-Hui', 'Xue, Hui', 'Wang, Lu-Huan', 'Zhang, Kai']","['Zhang JY Jr', 'Si YL', 'Liao J', 'Yan GT', 'Deng ZH', 'Xue H', 'Wang LH', 'Zhang K']","[""Research Laboratory of Biochemistry, Basic Medical Institute, Basic Medical Institute, Chinese General Hospital of PLA, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing 100853, People's Republic China. yan301@263.net""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Trauma Acute Care Surg,The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,101570622,"['0 (Leptin)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Brain Chemistry/drug effects', 'Brain Ischemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cerebral Infarction/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Leptin/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Malondialdehyde/analysis', 'Mice', 'Nitric Oxide/analysis', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism']",2012/04/12 06:00,2012/06/28 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/TA.0b013e3182405459 [doi]', '01586154-201204000-00025 [pii]']",ppublish,J Trauma Acute Care Surg. 2012 Apr;72(4):982-91. doi: 10.1097/TA.0b013e3182405459.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While EBNA1 is known to play several important roles in latent infection, the reason for its continued expression in lytic infection is unknown. Here we identified two roles for EBNA1 in the reactivation of latent EBV to the lytic cycle in epithelial cells. First, EBNA1 depletion in latently infected cells was shown to positively contribute to spontaneous EBV reactivation, showing that EBNA1 has a role in suppressing reactivation. Second, when the lytic cycle was induced, EBNA1 depletion decreased lytic gene expression and DNA amplification, showing that it positively contributed to lytic infection. Since we have previously shown that EBNA1 disrupts promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, we investigated whether this function could account for the effects of EBNA1 on lytic infection by repeating the experiments with cells lacking PML proteins. In the absence of PML, EBNA1 did not promote lytic infection, indicating that the EBNA1-mediated PML disruption is responsible for promoting lytic infection. In keeping with this conclusion, PML silencing was found to be sufficient to induce the EBV lytic cycle. Finally, by generating cells with single PML isoforms, we showed that individual PML isoforms were sufficient to suppress EBV lytic reactivation, although PML isoform IV (PML IV) was ineffective because it was most efficiently degraded by EBNA1. Our results provide the first function for EBNA1 in lytic infection and show that EBNA1 interactions with PML IV lead to a loss of PML nuclear bodies (NBs) that promotes lytic infection.","['Sivachandran, Nirojini', 'Wang, Xueqi', 'Frappier, Lori']","['Sivachandran N', 'Wang X', 'Frappier L']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120404,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'O5GA75RST7 (EBV-encoded nuclear antigen 1)']",IM,"['Epithelial Cells/virology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens/*metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*growth & development/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', '*Virus Activation', '*Virus Replication']",2012/04/12 06:00,2012/07/10 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00013-12 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00013-12 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Jun;86(11):6146-58. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00013-12.

Tf1 reverse transcriptase (RT) was found earlier to generate the self-primer in vitro. Here, we show that this RT can remove from the synthesized cDNA the entire self-primer as well as the complete polypurine tract (PPT) sequence (serving as a second primer for cDNA synthesis). However, these primer removals, mediated by the RNase H activity of Tf1 RT, are quite inefficient. Interestingly, the integrase of Tf1 stimulated the specific Tf1 RT-directed cleavage of both the self-primer and PPT, although there was no general enhancement of the RT's RNase H activity (and the integrase by itself is devoid of any primer cleavage). The RTs of two prototype retroviruses, murine leukemia virus and human immunodeficiency virus, showed only a partial and nonspecific cleavage of both Tf1-associated primers with no stimulation by Tf1 integrase. Mutagenesis of Tf1 integrase revealed that the complete Tf1 integrase protein (excluding its chromodomain) is required for stimulating the Tf1 RT primer removal activity. Nonetheless, a double mutant integrase that has lost its integration functions can still stimulate the RT's activity, though heat-inactivated integrase cannot enhance primer removals. These findings suggest that the enzymatic activity of Tf1 integrase is not essential for stimulating the RT-mediated primer removal, while the proper folding of this protein is obligatory for this function. These results highlight possible new functions of Tf1 integrase in the retrotransposon's reverse transcription process.","['Herzig, Eytan', 'Voronin, Nickolay', 'Hizi, Amnon']","['Herzig E', 'Voronin N', 'Hizi A']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120404,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (RNA primers)', '0 (Retroelements)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'HIV/enzymology', 'Integrases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation, Missense', 'RNA/*metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/*metabolism', '*Retroelements', 'Ribonuclease H/metabolism']",2012/04/12 06:00,2012/07/10 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00009-12 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00009-12 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Jun;86(11):6222-30. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00009-12.

It results from alloreactive processes induced by minor MHC incompatibilities triggered by activated APCs, such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), and leading to the activation of CD4 T cells. Therefore, we tested whether CD4(+) and pDCs, activated cells that produce high levels of reactive oxygen species, could be killed by arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)), a chemotherapeutic drug used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Indeed, As(2)O(3) exerts its cytotoxic effects by inducing a powerful oxidative stress that exceeds the lethal threshold. Sclerodermatous GVHD was induced in BALB/c mice by body irradiation, followed by B10.D2 bone marrow and spleen cell transplantation. Mice were simultaneously treated with daily i.p. injections of As(2)O(3). Transplanted mice displayed severe clinical symptoms, including diarrhea, alopecia, vasculitis, and fibrosis of the skin and visceral organs. The symptoms were dramatically abrogated in mice treated with As(2)O(3). These beneficial effects were mediated through the depletion of glutathione and the overproduction of H(2)O(2) that killed activated CD4(+) T cells and pDCs. The dramatic improvement provided by As(2)O(3) in the model of sclerodermatous GVHD that associates fibrosis with immune activation provides a rationale for the evaluation of As(2)O(3) in the management of patients affected by chronic GVHD.","['Kavian, Niloufar', 'Marut, Wioleta', 'Servettaz, Amelie', 'Laude, Helene', 'Nicco, Carole', 'Chereau, Christiane', 'Weill, Bernard', 'Batteux, Frederic']","['Kavian N', 'Marut W', 'Servettaz A', 'Laude H', 'Nicco C', 'Chereau C', 'Weill B', 'Batteux F']","['Laboratoire EA 1833, Faculte de Medecine, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Universite Paris Descartes, 75679 Paris Cedex 14, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120409,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/pathology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Fibrosis/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Random Allocation', 'Scleroderma, Systemic/immunology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Spleen/immunology/pathology/transplantation']",2012/04/12 06:00,2012/08/08 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1103538 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1103538 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2012 May 15;188(10):5142-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1103538.

Mouse models lacking SCL/TAL1 (stem cell leukemia/T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1) do not survive beyond early embryogenesis because of complete absence of hematopoiesis, indicating that SCL is a master early hematopoietic regulator. SCL is commonly found rearranged in human leukemias. However, there is barely information on the role of SCL on human embryonic hematopoietic development. Differentiation and sorting assays show that endogenous SCL expression parallels hematopoietic specification of hESCs and that SCL is specifically expressed in hematoendothelial progenitors (CD45(-)CD31(+)CD34(+)) and, to a lesser extent, on CD45(+) hematopoietic cells. Enforced expression of SCL in hESCs accelerates the emergence of hematoendothelial progenitors and robustly promotes subsequent differentiation into primitive (CD34(+)CD45(+)) and total (CD45(+)) blood cells with higher clonogenic potential. Short-hairpin RNA-based silencing of endogenous SCL abrogates hematopoietic specification of hESCs, confirming the early hematopoiesis-promoting effect of SCL. Unfortunately, SCL expression on its own is not sufficient to confer in vivo engraftment to hESC-derived hematopoietic cells, suggesting that additional yet undefined master regulators are required to orchestrate the stepwise hematopoietic developmental process leading to the generation of definitive in vivo functional hematopoiesis from hESCs.","['Real, Pedro J', 'Ligero, Gertrudis', 'Ayllon, Veronica', 'Ramos-Mejia, Veronica', 'Bueno, Clara', 'Gutierrez-Aranda, Ivan', 'Navarro-Montero, Oscar', 'Lako, Majlinda', 'Menendez, Pablo']","['Real PJ', 'Ligero G', 'Ayllon V', 'Ramos-Mejia V', 'Bueno C', 'Gutierrez-Aranda I', 'Navarro-Montero O', 'Lako M', 'Menendez P']","['Pfizer-Universidad de Granada-Junta de Andalucia Centre for Genomics and Oncological Research (GENyO), Granada, Spain. pedro.real@genyo.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120410,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Mice', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1']",2012/04/12 06:00,2013/01/17 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)32575-8 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2012.49 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2012 Jul;20(7):1443-53. doi: 10.1038/mt.2012.49.

Although the increased risk for developing solid tumors among TC survivors is largely attributed to radiotherapy, chemotherapy may also be associated with excess risks. However, the baseline risks of developing site-specific SMNs in TC survivors have not yet been quantified, nor have interactions between treatments and other risk factors been elucidated. Studies to date report overall relative risks ranging from 1.4- to 2.8-fold for SMN in TC survivors, with significantly elevated risks apparent for more than 35 years. Analytic investigations show relationships between increasing radiation dose and/or field size and solid tumor risk. Small excess risks of leukemia follow treatment with either chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Recently, concern has been expressed about the increased risk of SMN from radiation exposure during imaging surveillance for recurrence. A small number of studies have examined this issue, generating inconclusive results. Given the current changes in TC treatment that result in lower radiation doses, in the future solid tumors will likely have a considerably lower impact on the lives of TC survivors, although diligent follow-up will be required to accurately quantify long-term risks and to ascertain risks associated with chemotherapy.","['Fung, Chunkit', 'Fossa, Sophie D', 'Beard, Clair J', 'Travis, Lois B']","['Fung C', 'Fossa SD', 'Beard CJ', 'Travis LB']","['Department of Medical Oncology, James P.

We exploited the developmental similarities between normal and malignant T lymphoblasts to screen a small molecule library for activity against immature T cells with a simple visual readout in zebrafish larvae. After screening 26 400 molecules, we identified Lenaldekar (LDK), a compound that eliminates immature T cells in developing zebrafish without affecting the cell cycle in other cell types. LDK is well tolerated in vertebrates and induces long-term remission in adult zebrafish with cMYC-induced T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). LDK causes dephosphorylation of members of the PI3 kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway and delays sensitive cells in late mitosis. Among human cancers, LDK selectively affects survival of hematopoietic malignancy lines and primary leukemias, including therapy-refractory B-ALL and chronic myelogenous leukemia samples, and inhibits growth of human T-ALL xenografts. This work demonstrates the utility of our method using zebrafish for antineoplastic candidate drug identification and suggests a new approach for targeted leukemia therapy. Although our efforts focused on leukemia therapy, this screening approach has broad implications as it can be translated to other cancer types involving malignant degeneration of developmentally arrested cells.","['Ridges, Suzanne', 'Heaton, Will L', 'Joshi, Deepa', 'Choi, Henry', 'Eiring, Anna', 'Batchelor, Lance', 'Choudhry, Priya', 'Manos, Elizabeth J', 'Sofla, Hossein', 'Sanati, Ali', 'Welborn, Seth', 'Agarwal, Archana', 'Spangrude, Gerald J', 'Miles, Rodney R', 'Cox, James E', 'Frazer, J Kimble', 'Deininger, Michael', 'Balan, Kaveri', 'Sigman, Matthew', 'Muschen, Markus', 'Perova, Tatiana', 'Johnson, Radia', 'Montpellier, Bertrand', 'Guidos, Cynthia J', 'Jones, David A', 'Trede, Nikolaus S']","['Ridges S', 'Heaton WL', 'Joshi D', 'Choi H', 'Eiring A', 'Batchelor L', 'Choudhry P', 'Manos EJ', 'Sofla H', 'Sanati A', 'Welborn S', 'Agarwal A', 'Spangrude GJ', 'Miles RR', 'Cox JE', 'Frazer JK', 'Deininger M', 'Balan K', 'Sigman M', 'Muschen M', 'Perova T', 'Johnson R', 'Montpellier B', 'Guidos CJ', 'Jones DA', 'Trede NS']","['Department of Oncological Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120409,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (1H-indole-3-carbaldehyde quinolin-8-yl-hydrazone)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hydrazones)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinolines)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Hydrazones/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Quinolines/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'Zebrafish/*metabolism']",2012/04/12 06:00,2012/08/25 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47675-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-12-398818 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jun 14;119(24):5621-31. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-12-398818.

METHODS: Acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4 and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1-deficient U3A cells were used. The protein levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT2 in ATRA-treated NB4 cells were detected by Western blot. The culture supernatants of NB4 cells treated with ATRA for different time or U3A cells transfected with interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 were respectively collected. And the concentration of IFN-alpha was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The effects of NB4 cell culture supernatants on the phosphorylation of STAT2 and the expression of RIG-G were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: The level of phosphorylated-STAT2 was obviously up-regulated in NB4 cells treated with ATRA for 72 hours, as well as the concentration of IFN-alpha in culture supernatants. The concentration of IFN-alpha increased from (1.5 +/- 0.5) pg/ml in the untreated group to (7.6 +/- 0.3) pg/ml (P < 0.05). After a 96-hour treatment, the concentration of IFN-alpha was up to (63.8 +/- 5.8) pg/ml. And these culture supernatants could induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT2 and up-regulate the protein level of RIG-G. As for U3A cells transfected with IRF-1, the concentration of IFN-alpha from the culture supernatant also increased 3-fold versus the control group transfected with empty vectors [(8.8 +/- 1.4) pg/ml vs (3.4 +/- 0.4) pg/ml, P < 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: RIG-G gene expression is closely correlated with the cross-talk between ATRA and IFN-alpha-induced signaling pathways. ATRA increases the secretion of IFN-alpha by up-regulating the protein level of IRF-1. Then the secreted IFN-alpha may induce the phosphorylation of STAT2 and reinforce the expression of RIG-G.","['Lou, Ye-jiang', 'Pan, Xiao-rong', 'Xu, Gui-ping', 'Zhuang, Li-kun', 'Jia, Pei-min', 'Tong, Jian-hua']","['Lou YJ', 'Pan XR', 'Xu GP', 'Zhuang LK', 'Jia PM', 'Tong JH']","['Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (IFIT3 protein, human)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT2 protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1/metabolism', 'Interferon-alpha/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'STAT2 Transcription Factor/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2012/04/12 06:00,2013/01/01 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2012 Jan 10;92(2):124-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of factors have been reported to impact PBSC mobilization, but the predictive factors varied from one study to another. This retrospective study assessed our current mobilization and collection protocols, and explored the factors predictive of PBSC mobilization in patients with hematologic malignancies. METHODS: Data of 64 consecutive patients with hematologic malignancies (multiple myeloma, n = 22; acute leukemia, n = 27; lymphoma, n = 15) who underwent PBSC mobilization for over 1 year were analyzed. Four patients with response to treatment of near complete remission or better were administered granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to mobilize PBSCs. Sixty patients received G-CSF followed by chemotherapy mobilizing regimens. Poor mobilization (PM) was defined as when </= 2.0'10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg body weight were collected within three leukapheresis procedures. RESULTS: The incidence of PM at the first mobilization attempt was 19% (12/64). The PM group was older than the non-PM group (median age, 51 vs. 40 years; P = 0.013). In univariate analysis, there were no significant differences in gender, diagnosis, and body weight between the PM and non-PM groups. A combination of chemotherapy and G-CSF was more effective than G-CSF alone as a mobilizing regimen (P = 0.019). Grade III or IV hematopoietic toxicity of chemotherapy had no significant effect on the mobilization efficacy. Supportive care and the incidence of febrile neutropenia were not significantly different between the two groups. In multivariate analysis, age (odds ratio (OR), 9.536; P = 0.002) and number of previous chemotherapy courses (OR 3.132; P = 0.024) were two independent negative predictive factors for CD34(+) cell yield. PM patients could be managed well by remobilization. CONCLUSION: Older age and a heavy load of previous chemotherapy are the negative risk factors for PBSC mobilization.","['Yang, Shen-miao', 'Chen, Huan', 'Chen, Yu-hong', 'Zhu, Hong-hu', 'Zhao, Ting', 'Liu, Kai-yan']","['Yang SM', 'Chen H', 'Chen YH', 'Zhu HH', 'Zhao T', 'Liu KY']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",2012/04/12 06:00,2012/08/04 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2012 Feb;125(4):593-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although TLS is unusual in multiple myeloma, it should not be overlooked as it is associated with significant morbidity. In recent years, emerging new agents such as thalidomide and bortezomib have been found to be highly effective in the treatment of multiple myeloma. In this milieu, there is greater concern that the rate of TLS in multiple myeloma will increase. We herein report 2 patients with light chain multiple myeloma who developed TLS during treatment. One patient improved after hydration, allopurinol and forced diuresis. The other underwent hemodialysis because of oliguria. These 2 patients did not have heavy tumor burdens. They also lacked risk factors of TLS that were described in previous reports. Our experience suggests light chain myeloma with underlying myeloma kidney is associated with a risk of TLS.

The aim of this study was to find out some appropriate methods to learn about the nutritional status of leukemia patients before HSCT. METHODS: Nutritional status of patients with leukemia was assessed with three common methods of nutritional assessment (nutritional risk screening 2002 (NRS2002), mini nutritional assessment (MNA) and subjective global assessment (SGA)) before HSCT. The assessment results of NRS2002 and MNA were compared by paired chi(2) test. The consistency was analyzed by Kappa test. RESULTS: In this study, 13 of 50 patients (26.0%) with leukemia had nutritional risk before HSCT assessed by NRS2002, including 7 patients (14.0%) with undernutrition. Of 50 patients assessed by SGA, only 1 case (2.0%) was mild or moderate undernutrition, and the remaining 49 patients (98.0%) were well-nutrition. Assessed by MNA, 1 case (2.0%) was undernutrition, 11 cases (22.0%) were potential undernutrition, and 38 cases (76.0%) were well-nutrition. Paired chi(2) test results showed that the difference between NRS2002 and MNA was statistically significant (chi(2) = 13.64, P < 0.05); Kappa test results showed that they were consistent between NRS2002 and MNA (Kappa = 0.62, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: It is important to know the nutritional status of patients with leukemia before HSCT, and NRS2002 should be the first choice of nutritional assessment for patients with leukemia. If NRS2002 and MNA used at the same time, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the assessment can be improved.","['Liu, Peng', 'Yan, Xia', 'Wang, Bo-Shi', 'Xu, Xiao-Dong']","['Liu P', 'Yan X', 'Wang BS', 'Xu XD']","[""Department of Clinical Nutrition, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China. liupengpku@163.com""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Nutrition Assessment', 'Young Adult']",2012/04/12 06:00,2012/08/04 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2012 Feb;125(3):440-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: PC-3 cells were treated with various concentrations of docetaxel or (and) ABT-737. Cell viability was determined using MTT assay. Apoptosis was assessed by fluorescence microscopy analysis of cells with condensed and segmented nuclei following staining with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Cellular DNA was stained with propidium iodide and flow cytometric analysis was performed to analyze the cell cycle distribution. Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 protein changes were detected by Western blot. The activity of caspase-3 was measured using a colorimetric assay. RESULTS: Docetaxel (20 nmol/L) combination with ABT-737 (400 nmol/L) for 48 hours, the cell viability was decreased to 19.7% +/- 3.2% to compare with 44.2% +/- 4.4% (t = 4.45) of docetaxel and 93.2% +/- 1.8% of ABT-737 separately and there was a synergistic effect between the two drugs (CI = 0.8). Apoptosis rate of the combination group was higher than other two drugs. Docetaxel increased the cell number arrested in G(2)/M phase compared with control group (P < 0.05), but the combination treatment resulted in a significant arrest in the G(0)/G(1) phase. The combination treatment could significantly reduced the Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 expression (F = 369.53, 57.89 and 32.77, all P < 0.05) and enhanced the activity of caspase-3 (419.7% +/- 15.6%) (F = 207.33, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of ABT-737 with docetaxel can synergistically inhibit the proliferation of PC-3 cells through inducing apoptosis, which may be associated with cell cycle arrest, down-regulation of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 expression and activation of caspase-3.","['Hao, Jian-wei', 'Mao, Xiao-peng', 'Ding, De-gang', 'Du, Guang-hui', 'Liu, Zhong-hua']","['Hao JW', 'Mao XP', 'Ding DG', 'Du GH', 'Liu ZH']","[""Department of Urology, the People's Hospital of Henan Province, Zhengzhou 450003, China.""]",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Wai Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua wai ke za zhi [Chinese journal of surgery],0153611,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Taxoids)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Docetaxel', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Taxoids/*pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2012/04/12 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Wai Ke Za Zhi. 2012 Feb 1;50(2):161-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a high-throughput quantitative real-time PCR platform, we performed miRNA profiling on cyclin D1-positive MCL (n = 30) and cyclin D1-negative MCL (n = 7) and compared them with small lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma (n = 12), aggressive B-cell lymphomas (n = 138), normal B-cell subsets, and stromal cells. We identified a 19-miRNA classifier that included 6 up-regulated miRNAs and 13 down regulated miRNA that was able to distinguish MCL from other aggressive lymphomas. Some of the up-regulated miRNAs are highly expressed in naive B cells. This miRNA classifier showed consistent results in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and was able to distinguish cyclin D1-negative MCL from other lymphomas. A 26-miRNA classifier could distinguish MCL from small lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma, dominated by 23 up-regulated miRNAs in MCL. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of MCL patients demonstrated a cluster characterized by high expression of miRNAs from the polycistronic miR17-92 cluster and its paralogs, miR-106a-363 and miR-106b-25, and associated with high proliferation gene signature. The other clusters showed enrichment of stroma-associated miRNAs, and also had higher expression of stroma-associated genes.

These interactions within the BM niche are unique and could be important for developing new therapies. Here, we describe the development of extramedullary bone and bone marrow using human mesenchymal stromal cells and endothelial colony-forming cells implanted subcutaneously into immunodeficient mice. We demonstrate the engraftment of human normal and leukemic cells engraft into the human extramedullary bone marrow. When normal hematopoietic cells are engrafted into the model, only discrete areas of the BM are hypoxic, whereas leukemia engraftment results in widespread severe hypoxia, just as recently reported by us in human leukemias. Importantly, the hematopoietic cell engraftment could be altered by genetical manipulation of the bone marrow microenvironment: Extramedullary bone marrow in which hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha was knocked down in mesenchymal stromal cells by lentiviral transfer of short hairpin RNA showed significant reduction (50% +/- 6%; P = .0006) in human leukemic cell engraftment. These results highlight the potential of a novel in vivo model of human BM microenvironment that can be genetically modified.

When 110 CLL3 patients were compared with 126 matched patients from the FCR arm of the CLL8 trial, 4-year time to retreatment (75% vs 77%) and OS (86% vs 90%) was similar despite a significant benefit for autoSCT in terms of PFS. In summary, early treatment intensification including autoSCT can provide very effective disease control in poor-risk CLL, although its clinical benefit in the FCR era remains uncertain.

We show mutations in DNMT3A in 96 of 415 patients with newly diagnosed AML (23.1%). Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that patients with DNMT3A(mutant) AML show significantly worse overall survival (OS; P = .022; hazard ratio [HR], 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.81), and relapse-free survival (RFS; P = .005; HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.13-2.05) than DNMT3A(wild-type) AMLs. In a multivariable analysis, DNMT3A mutations express independent unfavorable prognostic value for OS (P = .003; HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.2-2.7) and RFS (P < .001; HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4-3.3). In a composite genotypic subset of cytogenetic intermediate-risk AML without FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations, this association is particularly evident (OS: P = .013; HR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.16-3.77; RFS: P = .001; HR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.48-4.89). The effect of DNMT3A mutations in human AML remains elusive, because DNMT3A(mutant) AMLs did not express a methylation or gene expression signature that discriminates them from patients with DNMT3A(wild-type) AML.

Consequently, it is worthwhile to search for adjuvants with the potential of increasing chemotherapeutic drug effectiveness and improving patient quality of life. Natural products are a very good source of such adjuvants. METHODS: The biological activity of a fraction enriched in hydrolysable polyphenols (P2Et) obtained from Caesalpinia spinosa was evaluated using the hematopoietic cell line K562. This fraction was tested alone or in combination with the conventional chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, camptothecin and taxol. The parameters evaluated were mitochondrial depolarization, caspase 3 activation, chromatin condensation and clonogenic activity. RESULTS: We found that the P2Et fraction induced mitochondrial depolarization, activated caspase 3, induced chromatin condensation and decreased the clonogenic capacity of the K562 cell line. When the P2Et fraction was used in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs at sub-lethal concentrations, a fourfold reduction in doxorubicin inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) was seen in the K562 cell line. This finding suggested that P2Et fraction activity is specific for the molecular target of doxorubicin. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a natural fraction extracted from Caesalpinia spinosa in combination with conventional chemotherapy in combination with natural products on leukemia cells may increase therapeutic effectiveness in relation to leukemia.","['Castaneda, Diana M', 'Pombo, Luis Miguel', 'Uruena, Claudia Patricia', 'Hernandez, John Fredy', 'Fiorentino, Susana']","['Castaneda DM', 'Pombo LM', 'Uruena CP', 'Hernandez JF', 'Fiorentino S']","['Grupo de Inmunobiologia y Biologia Celular, Facultad de Ciencias, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120410,England,BMC Complement Altern Med,BMC complementary and alternative medicine,101088661,"['0 (Adjuvants, Pharmaceutic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Hydrolyzable Tannins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Pharmaceutic', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Caesalpinia/*chemistry', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Hydrolyzable Tannins/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2012/04/12 06:00,2012/07/28 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2011/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1472-6882-12-38 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6882-12-38 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Complement Altern Med. 2012 Apr 10;12:38. doi: 10.1186/1472-6882-12-38.,,,PMC3353181,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Designed the new protocol SCMC-ALL-2005 based on the previous protocol XH-99 for ALL. Divided the patients into low, median and high risk groups depends on risk factors including day 33 and 55 minimal residual disease (MRD) level. The higher risk group, the more intensive therapy was given. All the cases were registed on pediatric oncology network database (POND). All the abandonment patients were counted as event. From May 1(st) 2005 to April 30(th) 2009, 351 children who were newly diagnosed as B lineage ALL were enrolled in this study. The prognoses relating to risk grouping, age, mutation gene and MRD level were analyzed. RESULTS: Up to June 30, 2011, 273 patients were followed up with median time 49 months (range 26 to 74 months). Three hundred and forty-five patients (98.29%) achieved complete remission on day 35 induction. 12 cases were younger than 1 year old (3.42%), 285 cases between 1 and 9 years old (81.20%), 54 cases 10 to 18 years old (15.38%). Five year event-free survival (EFS) was 34%, 72% and 63%, respectively. One hundred and fifty-six cases belonged to lowered risk (44.44%), 177 to middle risk (50.43%) and 18 to higher risk (5.13%). Five year EFS was 78%, 64% and 30%, respectively. In this study, 18 patients were detected positive for BCR/ABL, 3 for MLL/AF4, 16 for PBX/E2A, and 36 for TEL/AML. The 5 year EFS were 11%, 66%, 75% and 74%, respectively. A total of 300 cases were tested for MRD levels on day 35. Of them, 241 cases were with MRD </= 0.01% (negative), and 59 cases > 0.01% (positive). The 5 year relapse free survival (RFS) was 79% and 58%, respectively.

Herein, we report 15 cases of somatic mutations in the HLA genes of patients with a variety of hematologic diseases, including acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, encountered at our institute over the past decade. While two of the cases were identified in patient relapse specimens collected post-HCT, 13 cases were found in peripheral blood specimens submitted for HLA typing prior to transplantation. Ten patients exhibited acquired LOH for all or part of one HLA haplotype. Five other cases involved somatic mutations in the nucleotide sequences of common HLA-A or HLA-B alleles. Since they are not systematically evaluated prior to HCT, acquired mutations in HLA genes are likely under reported.

The present study was designed to determine the effects of 2.45 GHz radiation on the antioxidant redox system, calcium ion signaling, cell count and viability in human leukemia 60 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve cell cultures were equally divided into two main groups as controls (n = 6) and irradiated (n = 6) and then subdivided into four different subgroups depending on the duration of exposure, namely 1, 2, 12 and 24 hours. The samples were analyzed immediately after the experimental period. RESULTS: The extent of lipid peroxidation, cytosolic free Ca(2)(+) and cell numbers were higher in 2.45 GHz groups than in the controls. The increase of cytosolic free Ca(2)(+) concentrations was radiation time-dependent and was highest at 24-h exposure. The reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, vitamin C and cell viability values did not show any changes in any of the experimental groups. 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate inhibits Ca(2)(+) ions influx by blockage of the transient receptor potential melastatin 2. CONCLUSIONS: 2.45 GHz electromagnetic radiation appears to induce proliferative effects through oxidative stress and Ca(2)(+) influx although blocking of transient receptor potential melastatin 2 channels by 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate seems to counteract the effects on Ca(2)(+) ions influx.","['Naziroglu, Mustafa', 'Cig, Bilal', 'Dogan, Salih', 'Uguz, Abdulhadi Cihangir', 'Dilek, Selin', 'Faouzi, Dahdouh']","['Naziroglu M', 'Cig B', 'Dogan S', 'Uguz AC', 'Dilek S', 'Faouzi D']","['Department of Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, Suleyman Demirel University, Isparta, Turkey. mnaziroglu@med.sdu.edu.tr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120502,England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate)', '0 (Boron Compounds)', '0 (TRPM Cation Channels)', '0 (TRPM2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Ascorbic Acid/metabolism', 'Boron Compounds/pharmacology', 'Calcium Signaling/*radiation effects', 'Cell Phone', 'Cell Proliferation/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', '*Electromagnetic Radiation', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lipid Peroxidation/radiation effects', 'Oxidative Stress/*radiation effects', 'Radio Waves/adverse effects', 'TRPM Cation Channels/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Wireless Technology']",2012/04/12 06:00,2012/08/10 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/09553002.2012.682192 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2012 Jun;88(6):449-56. doi: 10.3109/09553002.2012.682192.

Here, we tested whether the histone signature and DNA methylation in multiple myeloma (MM) and leukemia cells is tumor-specific as compared with that in non-malignant lymphoblastoid cells. We observed a distinct histone signature in c-myc, Mcl-1, and ribosomal gene loci in MOLP8 MM and K562 leukemia cells, when compared with lymphoblastoid cells. Histone and DNA methylation patterns in MOLP8 cells were partially modified by the clinically promising HDAC inhibitor, vorinostat. In comparison with lymphoblastoid WIL2NS cells, MOLP8 cells and K562 cells were characterized by an absence of the gene silencing marker H3K9me2 in the c-myc and ribosomal genes. However, high levels of H3K27me3 were detected in the promoters and coding regions of selected genomic regions in these cells. Treatment by vorinostat increased the level of DNA methylation at the c-myc promoter, and this alteration was accompanied by a decrease in c-MYC protein. In MOLP8 cells, vorinostat significantly increased the H3K9 acetylation in the Mcl-1 coding regions and promoter. Both MOLP8 and K562 leukemia cells were characterized by decreased levels of H3K9me2 in the Mcl-1 gene as compared with lymphoblastoid WIL2NS cells. Lower levels of H3K9me1 in the Mcl-1 promoter, however, were specific for MM cells as compared with the other cell types studied. In other MM and leukemia cell lines, COLO677, OPM2, and U937, the ribosomal genes were less prone to epigenetic heterogeneity as compared to the c-myc and Mcl-1 proto-oncogenes.

Therefore, early detection of this mutation could potentially lead to early therapeutic intervention and a better prognosis with the ongoing treatment regimen. METHODS: The detection of BCR-ABL1 kinase domain (KD) mutations was performed by direct sequencing of peripheral blood (PB), total bone marrow (BM), and BM CD34+ cells from a reported CML patient. RESULTS: In this patient, the T315I mutation was detected in BM CD34+ cells 6 months prior to its emergence in PB, suggesting evolution and expansion of the T315I mutation clone, which most likely originated from more primitive CML cells. CONCLUSION: Our finding reflects the natural development of a T315I mutation within the hematopoietic system of the reported patient and indicates the importance of BCR-ABL1 mutation monitoring in more primitive cell populations. Considering the natural history of T315I development in this reported CML case, we hypothesize that BCR-ABL1 KD mutations may be pre-concentrated in more primitive CML cells, which subsequently expand into the PB. These findings may have future implications for the strategy used for detecting BCR-ABL1 mutations.","['Razga, Filip', 'Jurcek, Tomas', 'Jeziskova, Ivana', 'Zackova, Daniela', 'Dvorakova, Dana', 'Borsky, Marek', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Racil, Zdenek']","['Razga F', 'Jurcek T', 'Jeziskova I', 'Zackova D', 'Dvorakova D', 'Borsky M', 'Mayer J', 'Racil Z']","['Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology and Oncology, Masaryk University and University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,New Zealand,Mol Diagn Ther,Molecular diagnosis & therapy,101264260,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*enzymology', 'Disease Progression', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use']",2012/04/12 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/04/12 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2165/11632420-000000000-00000 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Diagn Ther. 2012 Jun 1;16(3):163-6. doi: 10.2165/11632420-000000000-00000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human reads were excluded by BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) and BLAT (BLAST-like alignment tool) searches. Remaining reads were screened with BLAST against viral databases. Purified B-cells from two CLL patients, with and without stimulation by phorbol-esters, were sequenced using Illumina technology to achieve depth of sequencing.

Among spontaneous tumors, mammary tumors are the most frequent cause of cancer death in cats and second most frequent in humans. In fact, naturally occurring tumors in domestic animals, more particularly cat mammary tumors, have been proposed as a good model for human breast cancer, but critical genetic and molecular information is still scarce. The aims of this study include the analysis of the cat ERBB2 gene partial sequences (between exon 17 and 20) in order to characterize a normal and a mammary lesion heterogeneous populations. Cat genomic DNA was extracted from normal frozen samples (n = 16) and from frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded mammary lesion samples (n = 41). We amplified and sequenced two cat ERBB2 DNA fragments comprising exons 17 to 20. It was possible to identify five sequence variants and six haplotypes in the total population. Two sequence variants and two haplotypes show to be specific for cat mammary tumor samples. Bioinformatics analysis predicts that four of the sequence variants can produce alternative transcripts or activate cryptic splicing sites. Also, a possible association was identified between clinicopathological traits and the variant haplotypes. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to examine ERBB2 genetic variations in cat mammary genome and its possible association with the onset and progression of cat mammary tumors. The demonstration of a possible association between primary tumor size (one of the two most important prognostic factors) and the number of masses with the cat ERBB2 variant haplotypes reveal the importance of the analysis of this gene in veterinary medicine.","['Santos, Sara', 'Bastos, Estela', 'Baptista, Claudia S', 'Sa, Daniela', 'Caloustian, Christophe', 'Guedes-Pinto, Henrique', 'Gartner, Fatima', 'Gut, Ivo G', 'Chaves, Raquel']","['Santos S', 'Bastos E', 'Baptista CS', 'Sa D', 'Caloustian C', 'Guedes-Pinto H', 'Gartner F', 'Gut IG', 'Chaves R']","['Institute for Biotechnology and Bioengineering, Centre of Genomics and Biotechnology, University of Tras-os-Montes and Alto Douro (IBB, CGB-UTAD), Quinta de Prados, 5001-801 Vila Real, Portugal; E-Mails: sarasantos@utad.pt (S.S.); ebastos@utad.pt (E.B.); danielasa@portugalmail.com (D.S.); hgp@utad.pt (H.G.-P.).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120302,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing/genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Female', '*Genes, erbB-2', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/*genetics/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2012/04/11 06:00,2012/04/11 06:01,['2012/04/11 06:00'],"['2011/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3390/ijms13032783 [doi]', 'ijms-13-02783 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2012;13(3):2783-800. doi: 10.3390/ijms13032783.

In most diagnostic laboratories, conventional karyotyping, in conjunction with targeted fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, is routinely performed to detect recurrent aberrations with prognostic implications. However, the genetic complexity of cancer cells requires a sensitive genome-wide analysis, enabling the detection of small genomic changes in a mixed cell population, as well as of regions of homozygosity. The advent of comprehensive high-resolution genomic tools, such as molecular karyotyping using comparative genomic hybridization or single-nucleotide polymorphism microarrays, has overcome many of the limitations of traditional cytogenetic techniques and has been used to study complex genomic lesions in, for example, leukemia. The clinical impact of the genomic copy-number and copy-neutral alterations identified by microarray technologies is growing rapidly and genome-wide array analysis is evolving into a diagnostic tool, to better identify high-risk patients and predict patients' outcomes from their genomic profiles. Here, we review the added clinical value of an array-based genome-wide screen in leukemia, and discuss the technical challenges and an interpretation workflow in applying arrays in the acquired cytogenetic diagnostic setting.","['Simons, Annet', 'Sikkema-Raddatz, Birgit', 'de Leeuw, Nicole', 'Konrad, Nicole Claudia', 'Hastings, Rosalind J', 'Schoumans, Jacqueline']","['Simons A', 'Sikkema-Raddatz B', 'de Leeuw N', 'Konrad NC', 'Hastings RJ', 'Schoumans J']","['Laboratory of Tumor Genetics, Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20120409,United States,Hum Mutat,Human mutation,9215429,,IM,"['*Comparative Genomic Hybridization/methods', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2012/04/11 06:00,2012/09/07 06:00,['2012/04/11 06:00'],"['2011/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/humu.22057 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mutat. 2012 Jun;33(6):941-8. doi: 10.1002/humu.22057.

METHODS: Participants with a history of smoking and a smoking-related cancer diagnosis (lung, oral, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, bladder, stomach, cervix, kidney, pancreas, acute myeloid leukemia) within the past 4 years were identified in the electronic medical record. We recruited 613 individuals to complete a mail-based survey and received 139 completed surveys (22.7% response rate). We focused on 105 participants who smoked at the time of diagnosis and dichotomized them to having either quit since diagnosis (48.6%; n = 51) or continued smoking (51.4%; n = 54). We assessed sociodemographics, type of cancer and treatment(s), and psychosocial factors (depressive symptoms, social support, hope, quality of life). We then conducted structured interviews with a subset of 21 survey respondents. RESULTS: Binary logistic regression indicated that, controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and income, factors associated with continued smoking versus cessation included being diagnosed with other smoking-related cancers versus lung or head and neck cancer (OR = 11.21, CI 2.85, 44.02) and having significant depressive symptoms (OR = 1.25, CI 1.08, 1.45). Qualitative findings highlighted motivators for cessation (impact of being diagnosed with cancer, doctor advice to quit, social influences) and barriers to cessation (hopelessness, stress, addiction). CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the need to address depressive symptoms among cancer survivors, particularly those continuing to smoke and the importance of exploring messages cancer survivors are given regarding the need for cessation post cancer diagnosis.","['Berg, Carla J', 'Thomas, Akilah N', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Schauer, Gillian L', 'Pinsker, Erika A', 'Ahluwalia, Jasjit S', 'Khuri, Fadlo R']","['Berg CJ', 'Thomas AN', 'Mertens AC', 'Schauer GL', 'Pinsker EA', 'Ahluwalia JS', 'Khuri FR']","['Department of Behavioral Sciences and Health Education, Emory University School of Public Health, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. cjberg@emory.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120409,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['Aged', 'Attitude to Health', 'Depression/etiology/psychology', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Motivation', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*psychology', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of Life', 'Smoking/*adverse effects/psychology', 'Smoking Cessation/*psychology', 'Social Support', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Survivors/*psychology']",2012/04/11 06:00,2013/09/26 06:00,['2012/04/11 06:00'],"['2011/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/13 00:00 [revised]', '2012/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pon.3077 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2013 Apr;22(4):799-806. doi: 10.1002/pon.3077.

Therefore, new therapies are urgently needed to improve treatment outcome of this deadly disease. In this study, we evaluated antileukemic interactions between clofarabine (a second-generation purine nucleoside analog) and valproic acid (VPA, a FDA-approved agent for treating epilepsy in both children and adult and a histone deacetylase inhibitor), in pediatric AML. METHODOLOGY: In vitro clofarabine and VPA cytotoxicities of the pediatric AML cell lines and diagnostic blasts were measured by using MTT assays. The effects of clofarabine and VPA on apoptosis and DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) were determined by flow cytometry analysis and Western blotting, respectively. Active form of Bax was measured by Western blotting post-immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: We demonstrated synergistic antileukemic activities between clofarabine and VPA in both pediatric AML cell lines and diagnostic blasts sensitive to VPA. In contrast, antagonism between the two agents could be detected in AML cells resistant to VPA. Clofarabine and VPA cooperate in inducing DNA DSBs, accompanied by Bax activation and apoptosis in pediatric AML cells. CONCLUSION: Our results document synergistic antileukemic activities of combined VPA and clofarabine in pediatric AML and suggest that this combination could be an alternative treatment option for the disease.","['Xie, Chengzhi', 'Edwards, Holly', 'Lograsso, Salvatore B', 'Buck, Steven A', 'Matherly, Larry H', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Ge, Yubin']","['Xie C', 'Edwards H', 'Lograsso SB', 'Buck SA', 'Matherly LH', 'Taub JW', 'Ge Y']","['Department of Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120405,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/*administration & dosage', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arabinonucleosides/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clofarabine', 'Cytarabine', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', '*Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Valproic Acid/*administration & dosage']",2012/04/11 06:00,2012/12/15 06:00,['2012/04/11 06:00'],"['2011/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24152 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Dec 15;59(7):1245-51. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24152.

We report the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) for children and adolescents with localized LL treated on a uniform regimen based on Children's Cancer Group (CCG) leukemia therapy (COG A5971). PROCEDURE: From June 2000 to October 2005, the study enrolled 60 patients >12 months old with Murphy stages I or II LL. Central review confirmed 56 eligible patients. Treatment consisted of 24 months of CCG BFM without day 28 intrathecal methotrexate in maintenance therapy or prophylactic cranial radiation. RESULTS: Most patients had pre-B immunophenotype (75%). At a median follow-up of 5.9 years (range 1.4-9.3 years), the 5-year EFS was 90% [95% confidence interval (CI), 78-96%] and the 5-year OS was 96% (95% CI, 84-99%). Stage (I vs. II), immunophenotype, elevated LDH > institutional normal, or primary site did not impact outcome. Five relapses occurred-none in the CNS and none in patients with pre-T lymphoblastic disease. Patients tolerated treatment well with no toxic deaths. CONCLUSION: Outcomes of pediatric patients with localized LL treated with 2 years of intensive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-type therapy was excellent and is similar to the outcome for standard risk ALL treated less intensively. CNS prophylaxis was adequate with limited intrathecal methotrexate and no radiation. Future studies should identify biologic prognostic factors or biomarkers for pediatric patients with LL, explore less intensive treatment for patients with localized disease, and explore novel immunophenotype directed therapies.","['Termuhlen, Amanda M', 'Smith, Lynette M', 'Perkins, Sherrie L', 'Lones, Mark', 'Finlay, Jonathan L', 'Weinstein, Howard', 'Gross, Thomas G', 'Abromowitch, Minnie']","['Termuhlen AM', 'Smith LM', 'Perkins SL', 'Lones M', 'Finlay JL', 'Weinstein H', 'Gross TG', 'Abromowitch M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California 701 E. 28th St, Suite 202, Long Beach, CA 90806, USA. atermuhlen@chla.usc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120405,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",2012/04/11 06:00,2012/12/15 06:00,['2012/04/11 06:00'],"['2011/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24149 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Dec 15;59(7):1229-33. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24149.

However, the prognostic significance of lymphopenia in peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is unclear. We analyzed the prognostic significance of lymphopenia in 826 patients with different types of PTCL and natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) from the International Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma Project. Lymphopenia was defined as an absolute lymphocyte count of less than 1,000 cells per microliter. The overall frequency of lymphopenia was 35.3%, ranging from 21.1% in ALK(+) anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) to 47.5% in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL). Lymphopenia was independently associated with an inferior overall survival (OS) in patients with the lymphoma type of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), with a 2-year OS of 15% versus 40% for those without lymphopenia (P < 0.001). Lymphopenia was also an adverse predictor of survival in PTCL, not otherwise specified, but was associated with other unfavorable prognostic factors. A trend toward inferior survival for lymphopenic patients was also observed in AITL, ALK(-) ALCL and extranasal NKTCL lymphoma, whereas no difference in survival was found in nasal NKTCL, ALK(+) ALCL, or enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. In this study, lymphopenia was identified as a new adverse prognostic factor in the lymphoma type of ATLL.","['Mitrovic, Zdravko', 'Perry, Anamarija M', 'Suzumiya, Junji', 'Armitage, James O', 'Au, Wing Y', 'Coiffier, Bertrand', 'Holte, Harald', 'Jaffe, Elaine S', 'Monserrat, Emili', 'Rajan, Sandeep K', 'Savage, Kerry J', 'Tobinai, Kensei', 'Vose, Julie M', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D']","['Mitrovic Z', 'Perry AM', 'Suzumiya J', 'Armitage JO', 'Au WY', 'Coiffier B', 'Holte H', 'Jaffe ES', 'Monserrat E', 'Rajan SK', 'Savage KJ', 'Tobinai K', 'Vose JM', 'Weisenburger DD']","['Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, 68198-3135, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20120410,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell/blood/*mortality/therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/blood/*mortality/therapy', 'Lymphopenia/blood/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",2012/04/11 06:00,2012/09/25 06:00,['2012/04/11 06:00'],"['2012/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23205 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2012 Aug;87(8):790-4. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23205.

Most treatment failures occur within 6-9 months of diagnosis, primarily from relapse. PROCEDURE: The Children's Oncology Group P9407 study was designed to test if early intensified treatment would improve outcome for infants with ALL. Due to a significant number of early deaths (< 90 days from enrollment), Induction therapy was amended three times. Cohorts 1 + 2 (n = 68), received identical Induction therapy except for reduced daunorubicin dose in Cohort 2. Cohort 3 (n = 141) received prednisone (40 mg/m(2)/day) instead of dexamethasone (10 mg/m(2)/day) and short infusion daunorubicin (30 minutes) instead of continuous infusion (48 hours), as well as additional supportive care measures throughout therapy. RESULTS: Early deaths occurred in 17/68 (25%) infants in Cohorts 1 + 2 and 8/141 (5.7%) infants in Cohort 3 (P < 0.0001). Among infants </=90 days of age at diagnosis, early death occurred in 10/17 (58.8%) in Cohorts 1 + 2 and 4/27 (14.8%) in Cohort 3 (P = 0.006). Among infants >90 days of age at diagnosis, early death occurred in 7/51 (13.7%) in Cohorts 1 + 2 and 4/114 (3.5%) in Cohort 3 (P = 0.036). Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections were more common in Cohorts 1 + 2 versus Cohort 3. CONCLUSIONS: Early morbidity and mortality for infants with ALL were reduced by substitution of prednisone (40 mg/m(2)/day) for dexamethasone (10 mg/m(2)/day), the delivery of daunorubicin over 30 minutes instead of a continuous infusion for 48 hours, and the provision of more specific supportive care measures.","['Salzer, Wanda L', 'Jones, Tamekia L', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Hilden, Joanne M', 'Winick, Naomi', 'Hunger, Stephen', 'Carroll, William L', 'Camitta, Bruce', 'Dreyer, ZoAnn E']","['Salzer WL', 'Jones TL', 'Devidas M', 'Hilden JM', 'Winick N', 'Hunger S', 'Carroll WL', 'Camitta B', 'Dreyer ZE']","['Pediatric Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA. salzerw@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120405,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",2012/04/11 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/04/11 06:00'],"['2011/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24132 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Nov;59(5):834-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24132.

We identified 259 CNAs consisting of 170 heterozygous deletions, 82 amplifications, and 7 regions of copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity. One of the most common CNAs was a deletion on chromosomal subband 1q31.3 in 13 of 93 (14%) patients encompassing the coding regions for the microRNAs mir181a1/b1. In multivariable analysis with the covariates age, white blood cell count, platelet count, and FLT3-ITD/FLT3 D835 mutations we found that after adjustment for patients' age (P<0.0001), patients with 2 or more CNAs detected by SNP-A had a higher risk of death (hazard ratio=5.942, P=0.0015) than patients with 0 or 1 CNA. Deletions of 1q31.3 were associated with a higher number of CNAs (median 2 vs. 8, P<0.0001) and were a strong independent prognostic factor for an increased risk of relapse (hazard ratio=28.9, P=0.0031).

Expression data of the four genes from 140 MDS patients were combined in an additive score, which was validated in an independent patient cohort of 110 MDS patients. A high MEBE score, defined as high expression of at least two of the four genes, predicted a significantly shorter overall survival (OS) (HR 2.29, 95 % CI 1.3-4.09, P= .005) and time to AML progression (HR 4.83, 95 % CI 2.01-11.57, P< .001) compared to a low MEBE score in multivariate analysis independent of karyotype, percentage of bone marrow blasts, transfusion dependence, ASXL1, and IDH1 mutation status. In a validation cohort of 110 MDS patients, a high MEBE score predicted shorter OS (HR 1.77; 95 % CI 1.04-3.0, P= .034) and time to AML progression (HR 3.0, 95 % CI 1.17-7.65, P= .022). A high MEBE expression score is an unfavorable prognostic marker in MDS and is associated with an increased risk for progression to AML.

The investigational drug alisertib (MLN8237) is a novel Aurora A kinase inhibitor being studied in multiple Phase I and II studies. We investigated the preclinical efficacy and pharmacodynamics of alisertib in AML cell lines, primary AML cells and mouse models of AML. Here, we report that alisertib disrupted cell viability, diminished clonogenic survival, induced expression of the FOXO3a targets p27 and BIM and triggered apoptosis. A link between Aurora A expression and sensitivity to ara-C was established, suggesting that Aurora A inhibition may be a promising strategy to increase the efficacy of ara-C. Accordingly, alisertib significantly potentiated the antileukemic activity of ara-C in both AML cell lines and primary blasts. Targeted FOXO3a knockdown significantly blunted the pro-apoptotic effects of the alisertib/ara-C combination, indicating that it is an important regulator of sensitivity to these agents. In vivo studies demonstrated that alisertib significantly augmented the efficacy of ara-C without affecting its pharmacokinetic profile and led to the induction of p27 and BIM. Our collective data indicate that targeting Aurora A with alisertib represents a novel approach to increase the efficacy of ara-C that warrants further investigation.","['Kelly, Kevin R', 'Nawrocki, Steffan T', 'Espitia, Claudia M', 'Zhang, Mengkun', 'Yang, Johnny J', 'Padmanabhan, Swaminathan', 'Ecsedy, Jeffrey', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Carew, Jennifer S']","['Kelly KR', 'Nawrocki ST', 'Espitia CM', 'Zhang M', 'Yang JJ', 'Padmanabhan S', 'Ecsedy J', 'Giles FJ', 'Carew JS']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Cancer Therapy and Research Center, The University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120628,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (FoxO3 protein, mouse)', '0 (MLN 8237)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurka protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase A)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Aurora Kinase A', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Azepines/*pharmacology', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2012/04/11 06:00,2013/03/09 06:00,['2012/04/11 06:00'],"['2011/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.27579 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2012 Dec 1;131(11):2693-703. doi: 10.1002/ijc.27579.

Such events could be of interest because loss of heterozygosity (LOH) resulting from aUPD in leukemic cells may lead to erroneous results if HLA typing for hematopoietic stem cell donor searches is performed on blood samples drawn during blastic crisis. We report here six AML patients whose HLA typing was performed on DNA extracted from peripheral blood obtained at diagnosis. We observed LOH involving the entire HLA region (three patients), HLA-A, B, C (two patients) and HLA-A only (one patient). An array-comparative genomic hybridization showed that copy number was neutral for all loci, thus revealing partial aUPD of chromosome 6p21. When HLA typing was performed on remission blood samples both haplotypes were detected. A 3-4% LOH incidence was estimated in AML patients with high blast counts. Based on DNA mixing experiments, we determined by PCR sequence-specific oligonucleotide hybridization on microbeads arrays a detection threshold for HLA-A, B, DRB1 heterozygosity in blood samples with <80% blasts. Because aUPD may be partial, any homozygous HLA result should be confirmed by a second typing performed on buccal swabs or on blood samples from the patient in remission.","['Dubois, V', 'Sloan-Bena, F', 'Cesbron, A', 'Hepkema, B G', 'Gagne, K', 'Gimelli, S', 'Heim, D', 'Tichelli, A', 'Delaunay, J', 'Drouet, M', 'Jendly, S', 'Villard, J', 'Tiercy, J-M']","['Dubois V', 'Sloan-Bena F', 'Cesbron A', 'Hepkema BG', 'Gagne K', 'Gimelli S', 'Heim D', 'Tichelli A', 'Delaunay J', 'Drouet M', 'Jendly S', 'Villard J', 'Tiercy JM']","['HLA Laboratory, EFS Rhone Alpes, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120314,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Uniparental Disomy/*genetics']",2012/04/11 06:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/04/11 06:00'],"['2012/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201268 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.68 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Sep;26(9):2079-85. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.68.

METHODS: Capillary electrophoresis (CE) and PAGE gel electrophoresis were simultaneously used to analyze FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations in 117 de novo AML patients with normal cytogenetic findings. RESULTS: For certain mutations, the length of mutated double-stranded DNA is longer than wild-type DNA. Since FLT3-mut (420 bp) is longer than FLT3-wt (327-332 bp), and NPM1-mut (172 bp) is longer than NPM1-wt (168 bp), heteroduplex will move more slowly during PAGE gel electrophoresis than homoduplex. Therefore the mutations may be detected. A total of 117 CN-AML patients were analyzed with CE and PAGE gel electrophoresis, and the results were identical, which included 18 (15.4%) patients with FLT3-ITD+/NPM1-, 19 (16.2%) patients with FLT3-ITD+/NPM1+, 25 (21.4%) patients with FLT3-ITD-/NPM1+, and 55 (47.0%) patients with FLT3-ITD-/NPM1-. CONCLUSION: Both types of electrophoresis assays may provide a rapid and handy assay for simultaneous detection of FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations. CE is relatively sensitive, stable; while PAGE electrophoresis is relatively simple, cheap, and reliable, which may be suitable for primary hospitals and preliminary screening.","['Lu, Ying', 'Wang, Qiong', 'Mu, Qi-tian', 'Yu, Meng-xia', 'Huang, Qin', 'Jin, Jie']","['Lu Y', 'Wang Q', 'Mu QT', 'Yu MX', 'Huang Q', 'Jin J']","[""Department of Hematology, Ningbo first hospital, Ningbo, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China.""]",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,9425197,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2012/04/11 06:00,2012/07/18 06:00,['2012/04/11 06:00'],"['2012/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/18 06:00 [medline]']","['940629040 [pii]', '10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2012.02.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2012 Apr;29(2):163-6. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2012.02.010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Clinical data of a B-ALL patient with t(14;14) (q11;q32) were analyzed. After 24 hour of unstimulated culturing, chromosome specimens of bone marrow cells were prepared with regular method, and R-banding was used for karyotype analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed on fixed bone marrow cells using IGH dual-color break-apart probe, CEBPE dual-color break-apart probe, whole chromosome paint (WCP) probe for chromosome 4, and Chromoprobe Multiprobe-ALL System probe. RESULTS: The 39-year-old female was diagnosed with B-ALL based on morphologic and immunophenotypic analyses. Conventional cytogenetic analysis showed a karyotype of 47, XX, +4, t(14;14) (q11;q32) [20], which was confirmed by FISH analysis. FISH using IGH-dual-color break-apart probe confirmed involvement of IGH gene in t(14;14) (q11;q32), and FISH using CEBPE dual-color break-apart probe indicated that CEBPE is the partner gene involved in t(14;14) (q11; q32). The patient achieved complete remission (CR) after a round of combined chemotherapy. At the time of follow-up, she had remained CR for more than 6 months. CONCLUSION: t(14;14) (q11;q32) simultaneously involving IGH and CEBPE genes in B-ALL is a rare but recurrent genetic abnormality that may identify a new subgroup of B-ALL. In B-ALL patients, t(14; 14) (q11; q32) involving IGH/CEBPE translocation may indicate a better prognosis.","['Han, Yong-sheng', 'Xue, Yong-quan', 'Zhang, Jun']","['Han YS', 'Xue YQ', 'Zhang J']","[""Department of Hematology, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China.""]",['chi'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,9425197,,IM,"['Adult', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Cytogenetics/methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology']",2012/04/11 06:00,2012/07/18 06:00,['2012/04/11 06:00'],"['2012/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/18 06:00 [medline]']","['940629034 [pii]', '10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2012.02.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2012 Apr;29(2):137-40. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2012.02.004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this purpose the generation of peroxides by mononuclear cells, the erythrocyte activity of superoxide-dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GL-PX), and the plasma levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and vitamin E (VIT E) were determined in 52 patients with two different types of lymphoid leukaemias, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 36 prior to chemotherapy and 16 treated patients. A decrease in SOD and GL-PX activities was observed in ALL patients prior to therapy, while a decrease in GSH and VIT E plasma levels was observed in untreated CLL, as compared to age-matched controls. An increase in peroxides formation occurred in both types of leukaemia, as compared to age-matched controls. There are significant differences for GSH, VIT E and peroxides generation between the different types of leukaemias. In relapsed ALL patients a decrease in peroxides generation was observed which may be due to the increase of the non-enzymatic defences GSH and VIT E.

During medical therapy, pre-existing periodontal conditions may exacerbate and cause local and systemic complications. When possible, maximal oral health should be achieved prior to engraftment. In this study, we aimed to determine the alterations occurred in the periodontal status of the patients after periodontal treatment and allogenic HSCT and evaluate the effect of intensive periodontal approach on the short-term complications of HSCT. METHODS: The alterations occurred in the periodontal tissues 3-4 weeks after periodontal treatment and after HSCT periods of 3 months for 29 patients treated with full-mouth periodontal treatment completed in 24 h in addition to eradication of dental foci, and oral hygiene status were evaluated using pocket depth measurements, presence of bleeding on probing and plaque and gingival indices. The incidence and severity of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and oral mucositis (OM) were recorded. Duration of engraftment period and the episode of febrile neutropenia were also evaluated. RESULTS: There were significant improvements in periodontal status after periodontal treatment (P<0.001). There were 14 (48.3%) patients without acute GVHD and 17 (58.6%) patients with no sign of OM. The majority of OM was at grade II level. There was a negative relation that exists between the percentage of BOP (+) sites and presence of OM (r=-0.518, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Together with a significant reduction in gingival inflammation and maintenance of the improvement in periodontal health, remarkable decrease in the incidence and severity of OM were observed.","['Gurgan, C A', 'Ozcan, M', 'Karakus, O', 'Zincircioglu, G', 'Arat, M', 'Soydan, E', 'Topcuoglu, P', 'Gurman, G', 'Bostanci, H S']","['Gurgan CA', 'Ozcan M', 'Karakus O', 'Zincircioglu G', 'Arat M', 'Soydan E', 'Topcuoglu P', 'Gurman G', 'Bostanci HS']","['Department of Periodontology, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey. cagurgan@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120409,England,Int J Dent Hyg,International journal of dental hygiene,101168070,['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Dental Plaque Index', 'Dental Prophylaxis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gingival Hemorrhage/classification', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*therapeutic use', 'Neutropenia/etiology', 'Oral Hygiene Index', 'Periodontal Debridement', 'Periodontal Diseases/*therapy', '*Periodontal Index', 'Periodontal Pocket/classification', '*Postoperative Complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/surgery', 'Stomatitis/etiology', 'Tooth Extraction', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2012/04/11 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2012/04/11 06:00'],"['2012/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1601-5037.2012.00550.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Dent Hyg. 2013 May;11(2):84-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1601-5037.2012.00550.x.

The discovery of the underlying cause of CML, a chromosomal translocation resulting in the expression of an aberrant tyrosine kinase, has enabled the rational development of targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The first available TKI, imatinib, dramatically improved survival rates and demonstrated the potential for long-term treatment. A number of additional strategies have been tested to further maximize outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed CML, including newer TKIs, imatinib dose escalation, and combination therapy. The advanced, more potent TKIs, nilotinib and dasatinib, have proven effective for newly diagnosed patients and for those who experience inadequate response or intolerance to imatinib. Randomized phase 3 studies have shown that nilotinib and dasatinib are more efficacious than imatinib in achieving primary study endpoints. Nilotinib was superior to imatinib in the rate of major molecular response at 12 months; dasatinib was superior to imatinib in the rate of complete cytogenetic response by 12 months. These phase 3 studies are ongoing to further define longer-term efficacy and safety. Research on additional contributing signaling pathways in CML, T315I mutations, and other causes of treatment resistance has identified additional potential treatments that are now in early stages of clinical development, with encouraging preliminary results. With continued advances, it is conceivable that the ultimate goal - a cure for CML - is in our sights.","['Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier', 'Flinn, Ian']","['Pinilla-Ibarz J', 'Flinn I']","['H.

Here, we investigated the impact of HTLV-1 status in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Twenty-six of 329 (7.9%) HTLV-1 carriers underwent primary LDLT. One recipient negative for HTLV-1 before LDLT received a graft from an HTLV-1 positive donor. Eight donors were HTLV-1 positive. Twenty-seven recipients (13 male and 14 female; mean age 52.5 years) were reviewed retrospectively. ATL developed in four recipients who ultimately died. The intervals between LDLT and ATL development ranged from 181 to 1315 days. Of the four ATL recipients, two received grafts from HTLV-1 positive donors and two from negative donors. The 1-, 3- and 5-year HTLV-1 carrier survival rates were 91.3%, 78.3% and 66.3%, respectively. Fulminant hepatic failure as a pretransplant diagnosis and a pretransplant MELD score >/= 15 was identified as risk factors for ATL development in this study (p = 0.001 and p = 0.041, respectively). In conclusion, LDLT can be performed for HTLV-1 positive recipients. However, when fulminant hepatic failure is diagnosed, LDLT should not be performed until further studies have revealed the mechanisms of ATL development.","['Yoshizumi, T', 'Shirabe, K', 'Ikegami, T', 'Kayashima, H', 'Yamashita, N', 'Morita, K', 'Masuda, T', 'Hashimoto, N', 'Taketomi, A', 'Soejima, Y', 'Maehara, Y']","['Yoshizumi T', 'Shirabe K', 'Ikegami T', 'Kayashima H', 'Yamashita N', 'Morita K', 'Masuda T', 'Hashimoto N', 'Taketomi A', 'Soejima Y', 'Maehara Y']","['Department of Surgery and Multidisciplinary Treatment, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan. yosizumi@surg2.med.kyushu-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120405,United States,Am J Transplant,American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,100968638,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Liver Transplantation', '*Living Donors', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2012/04/11 06:00,2012/10/13 06:00,['2012/04/11 06:00'],"['2012/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-6143.2012.04037.x [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Transplant. 2012 Jun;12(6):1479-85. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-6143.2012.04037.x.

Due to many specific issues associated with alemtuzumab treatment, the Working Committee of Czech CLL Study Group developed these guidelines. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS: (1) The main indication of alemtuzumab is fludarabine-refractory CLL. (2) Further possible indications include first-line treatment (in patients who cannot be treated by fludarabine-containing regimens), therapy of patients with del 17p, treatment of refractory autoimmune cytopenias and management of patients with severe cytopenias due to bone marrow infiltration. (3) The treatment should last 12 weeks and should not be terminated prematurely if there are no signs of CLL progression; bone marrow aspirate/biopsy can be performed after 12 weeks of treatment. (4) Subcutaneous administration of alemtuzumab seems to be equally effective with advantageous reduction of infusion-related adverse events. (5) Patients treated with alemtuzumab must receive combined antimicrobial prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci and herpetic viruses. Cytomegalovirus viremia should be monitored using weekly PCR from peripheral blood. (6) Use of alemtuzumab in combinations and consolidation/maintenance protocols must be considered experimental and needs optimization within prospective clinical trials. (7) Alemtuzumab treatment should be conducted by an experienced hematologist within a center of intensive hematology care.","['Smolej, L', 'Prochazka, V', 'Spacek, M', 'Obrtlikova, P', 'Gumulec, J', 'Vokurka, S', 'Doubek, M']","['Smolej L', 'Prochazka V', 'Spacek M', 'Obrtlikova P', 'Gumulec J', 'Vokurka S', 'Doubek M']","['Oddeleni Klinicke Hematologie II.

Previously we expressed a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the toxic fragment of Shiga toxin (A1) and GMCSF (A1-GMCSF) in Escherichia coli, and evaluated its cytotoxic properties in acute myeloid leukemia and colon carcinoma cell lines. In view of the specific cytotoxic effects of this immunotoxin, further detailed in-vitro and preclinical studies were undertaken. Large amounts of the recombinant protein of high purity and free of unwanted side products, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), were required. Since GMCSF is of mammalian origin and it requires proper disulfide bond formation, we intended to use the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) for the expression of the recombinant fusion protein.

However, isotype-specific inhibitors remain to be developed. We report that adenanthin, a diterpenoid isolated from the leaves of Rabdosia adenantha, induces differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells. We show that adenanthin directly targets the conserved resolving cysteines of Prx I and Prx II and inhibits their peroxidase activities. Consequently, cellular H(2)O(2) is elevated, leading to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases and increased transcription of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta, which contributes to adenanthin-induced differentiation. Adenanthin induces APL-like cell differentiation, represses tumor growth in vivo and prolongs the survival of mouse APL models that are sensitive and resistant to retinoic acid. Thus, adenanthin can serve as what is to our knowledge the first lead natural compound for the development of Prx I- and Prx II-targeted therapeutic agents, which may represent a promising approach to inducing differentiation of APL cells.","['Liu, Chuan-Xu', 'Yin, Qian-Qian', 'Zhou, Hu-Chen', 'Wu, Ying-Li', 'Pu, Jian-Xin', 'Xia, Li', 'Liu, Wei', 'Huang, Xin', 'Jiang, Tao', 'Wu, Ming-Xuan', 'He, Li-Cai', 'Zhao, Ya-Xue', 'Wang, Xiao-Lin', 'Xiao, Wei-Lie', 'Chen, Hong-Zhuan', 'Zhao, Qian', 'Zhou, Ai-Wu', 'Wang, Li-Shun', 'Sun, Han-Dong', 'Chen, Guo-Qiang']","['Liu CX', 'Yin QQ', 'Zhou HC', 'Wu YL', 'Pu JX', 'Xia L', 'Liu W', 'Huang X', 'Jiang T', 'Wu MX', 'He LC', 'Zhao YX', 'Wang XL', 'Xiao WL', 'Chen HZ', 'Zhao Q', 'Zhou AW', 'Wang LS', 'Sun HD', 'Chen GQ']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Shanghai Universities E-Institute for Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120408,United States,Nat Chem Biol,Nature chemical biology,101231976,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Diterpenes, Kaurane)', '0 (adenanthin)', '0 (adenanthin F)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxins)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cysteine/chemistry', 'Diterpenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Diterpenes, Kaurane/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/analysis', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Peroxiredoxins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2012/04/10 06:00,2012/06/30 06:00,['2012/04/10 06:00'],"['2012/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['nchembio.935 [pii]', '10.1038/nchembio.935 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Chem Biol. 2012 Apr 8;8(5):486-93. doi: 10.1038/nchembio.935.,,,,,,,,"['PubChem-Substance/134970389', 'PubChem-Substance/134970390', 'PubChem-Substance/134970391', 'PubChem-Substance/134970392', 'PubChem-Substance/134970393', 'PubChem-Substance/134970394', 'PubChem-Substance/134970395', 'PubChem-Substance/134970396', 'PubChem-Substance/134970397']",,,,,,,,,,,

Therapeutic drug monitoring is required to identify patients at risk of developing toxicity and to control folinic acid rescue. We report a case of Munchausen syndrome by proxy revealed by high and persistent falsely toxic methotrexate plasmatic levels. A 12 year-old child was treated with chemotherapy including methotrexate every 70 days for an ALL. The last methotrexate plasmatic level was 0.15 mumol/L at the 72th hour of the infusion. Then, he was treated by oral rout low-dose methotrexate. Ten days after methotrexate infusion, the patient consulted for asthenia, vomiting and presented a mucositis. Methotrexate plasmatic level was 2323 mumol/L. Renal function was normal. All drugs' intake was stopped. Folinic acid rescue was instituted. Even though there was no clinical sign of toxicity, therapeutic drug monitoring showed persistent high methotrexate plasmatic levels. Investigations eliminated measurement errors and pharmacokinetic problems. A deliberate methotrexate addition in each child blood sample brought by the mother was highly suspected. We confirmed this hypothesis by measuring methotrexate plasmatic levels in three samples: one brought by the mother, the second brought by the child's doctor and the last collected in our laboratory.

However, relapse is still the most frequent adverse event, occurring mainly in the patients with intermediate MRD levels (intermediate risk, IR), emphasizing the need for new prognostic markers. We analyzed the prognostic impact of cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) over-expression and P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion in 464 BCP-ALL patients (not affected by Down syndrome and BCR-ABL negative) enrolled in the AIEOP-BFM ALL2000 study in Italy. In 22/464 (4.7%) samples, RQ-PCR showed CRLF2 over-expression (>/=20 times higher than the overall median). P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion was detected in 22/365 (6%) cases, with 10/22 cases also showing CRLF2 over-expression. P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion was the most relevant prognostic factor independent of CRLF2 over-expression with a threefold increase in risk of relapse. Significantly, the cumulative incidence of relapse of the P2RY8-CRLF2 + patients in the IR group was high (61.1% +/- 12.9 vs 17.6% +/- 2.6, P<0.0001), similar to high-risk patients in AIEOP-BFM ALL2000 study. These results were confirmed in a cohort of patients treated in Germany.

A substantial proportion of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) harbor such mutations, which are often missense in type. Genotype-phenotype associations have been demonstrated for one of these mutations, SF3B1, with ring sideroblasts in MDS and 11q22 deletions in CLL. Spliceosome mutations might result in defective spliceosome assembly, deregulated global mRNA splicing, nuclear-cytoplasm export and altered expression of multiple genes. Such mutations are infrequent in other lymphomas, which instead display a separate group of novel mutations involving genes whose products are believed to affect histone acetylation and methylation and chromatin structure (for example, EZH2 and MLL2). On the other hand, some mutations (for example, NOTCH1) occur in both CLL and other immature and mature lymphoid malignancies. In the current review, we discuss potential mechanisms of cell transformation associated with spliceosome mutations, touch upon the increasing evidence regarding the clonal involvement of hematopoietic stem cells in some cases of otherwise mature lymphoid disorders and summarize recent information on recently described mutations in lymphomas.","['Damm, F', 'Nguyen-Khac, F', 'Fontenay, M', 'Bernard, O A']","['Damm F', 'Nguyen-Khac F', 'Fontenay M', 'Bernard OA']","['Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20120409,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing/*genetics', 'Spliceosomes/*genetics']",2012/04/10 06:00,2012/11/14 06:00,['2012/04/10 06:00'],"['2012/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201286 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.86 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Sep;26(9):2027-31. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.86.

We studied the effect of 50% ethanolic-water extracts of Pinus kesiya, Cratoxylum formosum ssp. pruniflorum and melphalan on cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction for human leukemic U937 cells, and explored the mode of action using FTIR microspectroscopy. The number of viable U937 cells in vitro was decreased in a concentration-dependent manner by all tested compounds, although potency differed between the U937 and Vero cells. Melphalan and the extract of C. formosum exhibited relatively lower IC(50) values (15.0 +/- 1.0 and 82.7 +/- 3.2 mug/mL respectively) and higher selectivity (selective index>3) than the extract of P. kesiya (299.0 +/- 5.2 mug/mL; selective index<3) on the U937 cells. All three compounds significantly induced apoptosis through the late stage - seen by the indicative DNA ladder - with the most effective being melphalan, then the P. kesiya and C. formosum extracts. FTIR microspectroscopy revealed that all three compounds raised the intensity of the beta-pleated sheet - higher than that of the untreated U937 cells - corresponding to a shift in the alpha-helix band associated with an alteration in the secondary structure of the protein band, confirming induction of apoptosis via pro-apoptotic proteins. The differences in intensity of the FTIR bands associated with lipids, proteins and nucleic acids were responsible for discrimination of the anticancer mode of action of each of the three compounds. The FTIR data suggest that the two plant extracts possessed anticancer activity with a different mode of action than melphalan.","['Machana, Sasipawan', 'Weerapreeyakul, Natthida', 'Barusrux, Sahapat', 'Thumanu, Kanjana', 'Tanthanuch, Waraporn']","['Machana S', 'Weerapreeyakul N', 'Barusrux S', 'Thumanu K', 'Tanthanuch W']","['Graduate school, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, 40002, Thailand. sasipawan.machana@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120301,Netherlands,Talanta,Talanta,2984816R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proteins)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carbohydrates/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clusiaceae/*chemistry', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA/chemistry', 'Ethanol/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lipids/chemistry', 'Melphalan/*chemistry', 'Pinus/*chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins/chemistry', 'RNA/chemistry', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared/*methods', 'Water/chemistry']",2012/04/10 06:00,2012/08/14 06:00,['2012/04/10 06:00'],"['2012/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/21 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0039-9140(12)00196-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.talanta.2012.02.058 [doi]']",ppublish,Talanta. 2012 May 15;93:371-82. doi: 10.1016/j.talanta.2012.02.058.

In mammals, trimethylation of lysine 4 in histone H3, a modification localized at the transcription start sites of active genes, is catalyzed by six enzymes (SET1a and SET1b, MLL1-MLL4) whose specific functions are largely unknown. By using a genomic approach, we found that in macrophages, MLL4 (also known as Wbp7) was required for the expression of Pigp, an essential component of the GPI-GlcNAc transferase, the enzyme catalyzing the first step of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor synthesis. Impaired Pigp expression in Wbp7(-/-) macrophages abolished GPI anchor-dependent loading of proteins on the cell membrane. Consistently, loss of GPI-anchored CD14, the coreceptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other bacterial molecules, markedly attenuated LPS-triggered intracellular signals and gene expression changes. These data link a histone-modifying enzyme to a biosynthetic pathway and indicate a specialized biological role for Wbp7 in macrophage function and antimicrobial response.","['Austenaa, Liv', 'Barozzi, Iros', 'Chronowska, Agnieszka', 'Termanini, Alberto', 'Ostuni, Renato', 'Prosperini, Elena', 'Stewart, A Francis', 'Testa, Giuseppe', 'Natoli, Gioacchino']","['Austenaa L', 'Barozzi I', 'Chronowska A', 'Termanini A', 'Ostuni R', 'Prosperini E', 'Stewart AF', 'Testa G', 'Natoli G']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology (IEO), Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120405,United States,Immunity,Immunity,9432918,"['0 (Dscr5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Hexosyltransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Hexosyltransferases/biosynthesis', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/biosynthesis', 'Lipopolysaccharides/immunology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2012/04/10 06:00,2012/06/19 06:00,['2012/04/10 06:00'],"['2011/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S1074-7613(12)00130-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.immuni.2012.02.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunity. 2012 Apr 20;36(4):572-85. doi: 10.1016/j.immuni.2012.02.016.

However, to our knowledge, no previous studies have examined whether stimulation with nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) enhances the growth of iPS cells. In the present study, we examined the involvement of nAchR in the proliferation of mouse iPS cells. MAIN METHODS: We performed immunofluorescence staining to determine whether mouse iPS cells could express nAchRs. Mouse iPS cells were treated with nicotine for 24h under feeder-free conditions in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The DNA synthesis was examined by the BrdU incorporation assay. Intracellular calcium levels were measured using Fluo-4-acetoxymethyl (a cell-permeable calcium indicator). In addition, we examined the involvement of the CaMKcapital PE, Cyrillic pathway in nicotine-enhanced proliferation of mouse iPS cells. KEY FINDINGS: The fluorescence images revealed that alpha(4)-nAchR and alpha(7)-nAchR are expressed on mouse iPS cells. Treatment of the cells with 300nM nicotine significantly increases DNA synthesis. This is significantly inhibited by pretreatment with antagonists of alpha(4)-nAchR and alpha(7)-nAchR or a CaMKcapital PE, Cyrillic inhibitor. In addition, treatment with nicotine increases the intracellular Ca(2+) level dose-dependently in mouse iPS cells. Treatment with nicotine significantly enhances CaMKcapital PE, Cyrillic phosphorylation. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study indicates that stimulation of alpha(4)-nAchR and alpha(7)-nAchR may lead to a significant increase in the rate of mouse iPS cell proliferation through enhancement of the CaMKcapital PE, Cyrillic signaling pathway.","['Ishizuka, Toshiaki', 'Ozawa, Ayako', 'Goshima, Hazuki', 'Watanabe, Yasuhiro']","['Ishizuka T', 'Ozawa A', 'Goshima H', 'Watanabe Y']","['Department of Pharmacology, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan. tishizu@ndmc.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120328,Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nicotinic Antagonists)', '0 (Receptors, Nicotinic)', '6M3C89ZY6R (Nicotine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nicotine/*metabolism', 'Nicotinic Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Nicotinic/genetics/*metabolism']",2012/04/10 06:00,2012/07/14 06:00,['2012/04/10 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0024-3205(12)00137-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lfs.2012.03.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2012 May 15;90(17-18):637-48. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2012.03.014.

FLVCR1 was previously assumed to be involved in Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and it was recently reported that mutations in the FLVCR1 gene are found in patients with posterior column ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (PCARP). Four mutations in FLVCR1 (Asn121Asp, Cys192Arg, Ala241Thr, and Gly493Arg) are located within putative transmembrane domains; however, the effects of FLVCR1 mutations on PCARP are unclear. In this study, we analyzed the function of FLVCR1 mutants by using a fluorescent heme analog as a transporter substrate, and found that all 4 FLVCR1 mutants lost their heme export activity. To investigate the mechanism responsible for this loss of activity, we determined the subcellular localization of FLVCR1 mutants. FLVCR1 mutants did not localize to the plasma membrane and were observed in intracellular structures, including lysosomes. We hypothesize that the loss of function of FLVCR1 mutants is caused by their mislocation. We examined the half-life of FLVCR1 in cells, which was >16h for wild-type FLVCR1 compared with 2-4h for the mutants. Based on these results, we propose that FLVCR1 mutants failed to fold properly in the ER, were rapidly degraded in the lysosomes, and therefore, could not export heme out of cells. Thus, accumulation of heme in FLVCR1-mutant cells could cause cellular toxicity.","['Yanatori, Izumi', 'Yasui, Yumiko', 'Miura, Koshiro', 'Kishi, Fumio']","['Yanatori I', 'Yasui Y', 'Miura K', 'Kishi F']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki 701-0192, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120405,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (FLVCR1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', 'Posterior column ataxia']",IM,"['*Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Cell Line', 'Dogs', 'Heme/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysosomes/genetics/metabolism', '*Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', '*Protein Folding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proteolysis', '*Receptors, Virus/genetics/metabolism', '*Retinitis Pigmentosa/genetics/metabolism', '*Sensation Disorders/genetics/metabolism', '*Spinocerebellar Degenerations/genetics/metabolism']",2012/04/10 06:00,2012/09/20 06:00,['2012/04/10 06:00'],"['2012/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S1079-9796(12)00064-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2012.03.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2012 Jun 15;49(1):60-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2012.03.004.

Second generation TKIs dasatinib and nilotinib have shown promising results in imatinibresistant or intolerant CML patients, but are not active against CML clones with highly resistant T315I mutation.

22482940,NLM,MEDLINE,20120508,20210217,1474-547X (Electronic) 0140-6736 (Linking),379,9825,2012 Apr 21,"Effect of gemtuzumab ozogamicin on survival of adult patients with de-novo acute myeloid leukaemia (ALFA-0701): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 study.",1508-16,10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60485-1 [doi],"BACKGROUND: The results of the addition of gemtuzumab ozogamicin, an anti-CD33 antibody conjugate, to the standard treatment for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia in phase 3 trials were contradictory. We investigated whether the addition of low fractionated-dose gemtuzumab ozogamicin to standard front-line chemotherapy would improve the outcome of patients with this leukaemia without causing excessive toxicity. METHODS: In a phase 3, open-label study, undertaken in 26 haematology centres in France, patients aged 50-70 years with previously untreated de novo acute myeloid leukaemia were randomly assigned with a computer-generated sequence in a 1:1 ratio with block sizes of four to standard treatment (control group) with or without five doses of intravenous gemtuzumab ozogamicin (3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, and 7 during induction and day 1 of each of the two consolidation chemotherapy courses). The primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS). Secondary endpoints were relapse-free (RFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with EudraCT, number 2007-002933-36. FINDINGS: 280 patients were randomly assigned to the control (n=140) and gemtuzumab ozogamicin groups (n=140), and 139 patients were analysed in each group. Complete response with or without incomplete platelet recovery to induction was 104 (75%) in the control group and 113 (81%) in the gemtuzumab ozogamicin group (odds ratio 1.46, 95% CI 0.20-2.59; p=0.25). At 2 years, EFS was estimated as 17.1% (10.8-27.1) in the control group versus 40.8% (32.8-50.8) in the gemtuzumab ozogamicin group (hazard ratio 0.58, 0.43-0.78; p=0.0003), OS 41.9% (33.1-53.1) versus 53.2% (44.6-63.5), respectively (0.69, 0.49-0.98; p=0.0368), and RFS 22.7% (14.5-35.7) versus 50.3% (41.0-61.6), respectively (0.52, 0.36-0.75; p=0.0003). Haematological toxicity, particularly persistent thrombocytopenia, was more common in the gemtuzumab ozogamicin group than in the control group (22 [16%] vs 4 [3%]; p<0.0001), without an increase in the risk of death from toxicity. INTERPRETATION: The use of fractionated lower doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin allows the safe delivery of higher cumulative doses and substantially improves outcomes in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. The findings warrant reassessment of gemtuzumab ozogamicin as front-line therapy for acute myeloid leukaemia.

However, CTC are extremely rare in the bloodstream, making their detection and characterization technically challenging. We report here the development of an aptamer-mediated, micropillar-based microfluidic device that is able to efficiently isolate tumor cells from unprocessed whole blood. High-affinity aptamers were used as an alternative to antibodies for cancer cell isolation. The microscope-slide-sized device consists of >59,000 micropillars, which enhanced the probability of the interactions between aptamers and target cancer cells. The device geometry and the flow rate were investigated and optimized by studying their effects on the isolation of target leukemia cells from a cell mixture. The device yielded a capture efficiency of ~95% with purity of ~81% at the optimum flow rate of 600 nL/s. Further, we exploited the device for isolating colorectal tumor cells from unprocessed whole blood; as few as 10 tumor cells were captured from 1 mL of whole blood. We also addressed the question of low throughput of a typical microfluidic device by processing 1 mL of blood within 28 min. In addition, we found that ~93% of the captured cells were viable, making them suitable for subsequent molecular and cellular studies.","['Sheng, Weian', 'Chen, Tao', 'Kamath, Rahul', 'Xiong, Xiangling', 'Tan, Weihong', 'Fan, Z Hugh']","['Sheng W', 'Chen T', 'Kamath R', 'Xiong X', 'Tan W', 'Fan ZH']","['Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of Florida, P.O.

Genetic deletion of beta-catenin during fetal HSC development leads to impairment of self-renewal while beta-catenin is dispensable in fully developed adult HSCs. Whether beta-catenin is required for maintenance of fully developed CML leukemia stem cells (LSCs) is unknown. Here, we use a conditional mouse model to show that deletion of beta-catenin after CML initiation does not lead to a significant increase in survival. However, deletion of beta-catenin synergizes with imatinib (IM) to delay disease recurrence after imatinib discontinuation and to abrogate CML stem cells. These effects can be mimicked by pharmacologic inhibition of beta-catenin via modulation of prostaglandin signaling. Treatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin reduces beta-catenin levels and leads to a reduction in LSCs. In conclusion, inhibiting beta-catenin by genetic inactivation or pharmacologic modulation is an effective combination therapy with imatinib and targets CML stem cells.","['Heidel, Florian H', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Feng, Zhaohui', 'Wang, Zhu', 'Neff, Tobias A', 'Stein, Lauren', 'Kalaitzidis, Demetrios', 'Lane, Steven W', 'Armstrong, Scott A']","['Heidel FH', 'Bullinger L', 'Feng Z', 'Wang Z', 'Neff TA', 'Stein L', 'Kalaitzidis D', 'Lane SW', 'Armstrong SA']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Stem Cell,Cell stem cell,101311472,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Prostaglandins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Indomethacin/*pharmacology', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Prostaglandins/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', '*beta Catenin/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",2012/04/10 06:00,2012/07/04 06:00,['2012/04/10 06:00'],"['2011/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1934-5909(12)00076-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.stem.2012.02.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Stem Cell. 2012 Apr 6;10(4):412-24. doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2012.02.017.,['Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we report two cases with ATLL who received donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) for relapse after allo-HSCT; one patient achieved complete remission (CR) after a single DLI, and the other suffered repeated relapses and was treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy combined with a total of five rounds of DLIs. Both patients presented with exacerbation of the graft-versus-host disease after the DLIs, and remained in CR for 9 and 8 years, respectively. These data support the use of DLIs as an effective therapy to induce durable CR in the treatment of relapsed ATLL. In this study, we review previous reports and discuss the role of DLIs in the treatment of post-transplant relapsed ATLL.","['Kamimura, Tomohiko', 'Miyamoto, Toshihiro', 'Kawano, Noriaki', 'Numata, Akihiko', 'Ito, Yoshikiyo', 'Chong, Yong', 'Nagafuji, Koji', 'Teshima, Takanori', 'Hayashi, Shin', 'Akashi, Koichi']","['Kamimura T', 'Miyamoto T', 'Kawano N', 'Numata A', 'Ito Y', 'Chong Y', 'Nagafuji K', 'Teshima T', 'Hayashi S', 'Akashi K']","['Department of Hematology, Harasanshin Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120406,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2012/04/07 06:00,2012/11/09 06:00,['2012/04/07 06:00'],"['2011/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/03/09 00:00 [revised]', '2012/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-012-1056-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2012 Jun;95(6):725-30. doi: 10.1007/s12185-012-1056-3.

Our table top AFM setup is affordable, has an open architecture, and is easily transferable to other laboratories. Its calculated noise characteristics are dominated by the Brownian noise with 2% non-Brownian components integrated over the first thermally induced resonance of a typical cantilever. For a typical SiN cantilever with a force constant of ~15 pN nm(-1) and in water the force sensitivity and resolution are less than 10 pN, and the corresponding deflection sensitivities are less than 100 pm Hz(-1/2). Also, we obtain a sub-ms time resolution in detecting the protein length change, and only few ms cantilever response times as measured in the force clamp mode on a well-known protein standard. Using this setup we investigate force-induced conformational transitions in the NRR region of a mouse Notch 1. Notch is an important protein related to leukemia and breast cancers in humans. We demonstrate that it is feasible to develop AFM-based studies of the force-induced conformational transitions in Notch. Our results match recent steered molecular dynamics simulations of the NRR unfolding and constitute a first step towards a detailed study of Notch activation with AFM.","['Dey, Ashim', 'Szoszkiewicz, Robert']","['Dey A', 'Szoszkiewicz R']","['Department of Physics, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS 66506, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20120405,England,Nanotechnology,Nanotechnology,101241272,"['0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomechanical Phenomena/physiology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force/*instrumentation/*methods', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Nanotechnology/*instrumentation/methods', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptor, Notch1/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism']",2012/04/07 06:00,2012/08/15 06:00,['2012/04/07 06:00'],"['2012/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1088/0957-4484/23/17/175101 [doi]'],ppublish,Nanotechnology. 2012 May 4;23(17):175101. doi: 10.1088/0957-4484/23/17/175101.

METHODS: We retrospectively correlated NPM1 and FLT3 mutation status with flow cytometric profile of leukemic blasts in 83 adult patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). RESULTS: Mutation of the NPM1 gene (NPM1.mt) was found in 39 (47%) of 83 patients, and internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the FLT3 gene (FLT3-ITD) was seen in 38 (46%) of 83 patients. Patients with CN-AML and with NPM1.mt were less likely to express CD34 (33% vs. 93%; 2P = .0001), CD2 (0% vs. 14%; 2P = .0187), and CD14 (6% vs. 22%, 2P = .0476), and were more likely to express CD4 (65.5% vs. 37%; 2P = .0367) and CD19 (49% vs. 27%; 2P = .0506). The patients with CN-AML and with FLT3-ITD were more likely to express CD56 (47% vs. 23%; 2P = .0393). Moreover, patients with favorable prognostic combination of NPM1.mt and wild-type (wt) FLT3 (n = 18) were less likely to express CD34 (33% vs. 74% all others; 2P = .0021) and CD56 (6% vs. 37% all others; 2P = .0072). The group with an unfavorable prognostic combination of NPM1-wt and FLT3-ITD (n = 17) were more likely to express CD34 (88% vs. 45% all others; 2P = .0011) and TdT (40% vs. 2% all others; 2P = .0054). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CN-AML, characteristic flow cytometric profile is associated with NPM1 and FLT3 mutation status.","['Dalal, Bakul I', 'Mansoor, Soudeh', 'Manna, Mita', 'Pi, Steven', 'Sauro, Giovanna Di', 'Hogge, Donna E']","['Dalal BI', 'Mansoor S', 'Manna M', 'Pi S', 'Sauro GD', 'Hogge DE']","['Division of Laboratory Haematology, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. bakul.dalal@vch.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120404,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/*immunology', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",2012/04/07 06:00,2013/02/15 06:00,['2012/04/07 06:00'],"['2011/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/20 00:00 [revised]', '2012/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(12)00004-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2012.01.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2012 Aug;12(4):274-9. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2012.01.003.
