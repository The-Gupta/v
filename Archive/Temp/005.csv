The identification of the small molecule Yoda1, a synthetic Piezo1 agonist, revealed the possibility of chemical activation of the channel. Stimulating effects of Yoda1 on Piezo1 have been mainly documented using over-expressing cellular systems or channel proteins incorporated in artificial lipid bilayers. However, the activating effect of Yoda1 on native Piezo1 channels in the plasma membrane of living cells remains generally undefined, despite the increasing number of studies in which the agonist is utilized as a functional tool to reveal the contribution of Piezo1 to cellular reactions. In the current study, we used the human myeloid leukemia K562 cell line as a suitable model to examine chemically induced Piezo1 activity with the use of the patch-clamp technique in various specific modes. The functional expression of Piezo1 in leukemia cells was evidenced using a combinative approach, including single channel patch-clamp measurements. Utilizing our established single-current whole-cell assay on K562 cells, we have shown, for the first time, the selective real-time chemical activation of endogenously expressed Piezo1. Extracellular application of 0.5-1 microM Yoda1 effectively stimulated single Piezo1 currents in the cell membrane.","['Vasileva, Valeria', 'Morachevskaya, Elena', 'Sudarikova, Anastasia', 'Negulyaev, Yuri', 'Chubinskiy-Nadezhdin, Vladislav']","['Vasileva V', 'Morachevskaya E', 'Sudarikova A', 'Negulyaev Y', 'Chubinskiy-Nadezhdin V']","['Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Tikhoretsky Ave. 4, 194064 St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Tikhoretsky Ave. 4, 194064 St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Tikhoretsky Ave. 4, 194064 St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Tikhoretsky Ave. 4, 194064 St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Tikhoretsky Ave. 4, 194064 St. Petersburg, Russia.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0137-471X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8488-6130']",['eng'],['18-15-00106/Russian Science Foundation'],['Journal Article'],20210722,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (PIEZO1 protein, human)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Thiadiazoles)', '0 (yoda-1)']",IM,"['Cell Membrane/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ion Channels/agonists/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Mechanotransduction, Cellular', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*methods', 'Thiadiazoles/*pharmacology']",PMC8346046,['NOTNLM'],"['Piezo1', 'Yoda1', 'human leukemia cells', 'single channel patch-clamp']",2021/08/08 06:00,2021/08/17 06:00,['2021/08/07 01:07'],"['2021/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/19 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/07 01:07 [entrez]', '2021/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22157839 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22157839 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Jul 22;22(15). pii: ijms22157839. doi: 10.3390/ijms22157839.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in splicing factors or regulatory elements in pre-mRNAs often result in many human diseases. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of chronic myeloid neoplasms characterized by many symptoms and a high risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Recent findings indicate that mutations in splicing factors represent a novel class of driver mutations in human cancers and affect about 50% of Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. Somatic mutations in MDS patients are frequently found in genes SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2. Interestingly, they are involved in the recognition of 3' splice sites and exons. It has been reported that mutations in these splicing regulators result in aberrant splicing of many genes. In this review article, we first describe molecular mechanism of pre-mRNA splicing as an introduction and mainly focus on those four splicing factors to describe their mutations and their associated aberrant splicing patterns.","['Kataoka, Naoyuki', 'Matsumoto, Eri', 'Masaki, So']","['Kataoka N', 'Matsumoto E', 'Masaki S']","['Laboratory of Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Animal Resource Sciences, Graduate School of Agriculture and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Animal Resource Sciences, Graduate School of Agriculture and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Medicinal Science, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ritsumeikan University, Shiga 525-8577, Japan.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4498-7420'],['eng'],['18K06012/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210721,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (RNA Precursors)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)']",IM,"['Humans', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*pathology', 'RNA Precursors/*genetics', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA Splicing Factors/*genetics']",PMC8346168,['NOTNLM'],"['MDS', 'exon recognition', 'splicing', 'splicing factor mutations']",2021/08/08 06:00,2021/08/17 06:00,['2021/08/07 01:06'],"['2021/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/19 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/07 01:06 [entrez]', '2021/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22157789 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22157789 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Jul 21;22(15). pii: ijms22157789. doi: 10.3390/ijms22157789.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mice, corruption of the Gpx4 gene leads to embryonic lethality and more detailed expression silencing studies have implicated the enzyme in several physiological processes (e.g., embryonal cerebrogenesis, neuronal function, male fertility). Experiments with conditional knockout mice, in which expression of the Gpx4 gene was silenced in erythroid precursors, indicated a role of Gpx4 in erythropoiesis. To test this hypothesis in a cellular in vitro model we transfected mouse erythroleukemia cells with a Gpx4 siRNA construct and followed the expression kinetics of erythropoietic gene products. Our data indicate that Gpx4 is expressed at high levels in mouse erythroleukemia cells and that expression silencing of the Gpx4 gene delays in vitro erythropoiesis. However, heterozygous expression of a catalytically inactive Gpx4 mutant (Gpx4(+/Sec46Ala)) did not induce a defective erythropoietic phenotype in different in vivo and ex vivo models. These data suggest that Gpx4 plays a role in erythroid differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia cells but that heterozygous expression of a catalytically inactive Gpx4 is not sufficient to compromise in vivo and ex vivo erythropoiesis.","['Rademacher, Marlena', 'Kuhn, Hartmut', 'Borchert, Astrid']","['Rademacher M', 'Kuhn H', 'Borchert A']","['Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universitat Berlin and Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, Institute of Biochemistry, Chariteplatz 1, 10117 Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universitat Berlin and Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, Institute of Biochemistry, Chariteplatz 1, 10117 Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universitat Berlin and Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, Institute of Biochemistry, Chariteplatz 1, 10117 Berlin, Germany.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8142-3192'],['eng'],"['Ku 961/13-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'Ku 961/14-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft']",['Journal Article'],20210721,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 1.11.1.12 (Phospholipid Hydroperoxide Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (glutathione peroxidase 4, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/etiology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitochondria/metabolism/*pathology', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Phospholipid Hydroperoxide Glutathione Peroxidase/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics']",PMC8345999,['NOTNLM'],"['cell differentiation', 'eicosanoids', 'lipid peroxidation', 'oxidative stress']",2021/08/08 06:00,2021/08/17 06:00,['2021/08/07 01:06'],"['2021/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/20 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/07 01:06 [entrez]', '2021/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22157795 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22157795 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Jul 21;22(15). pii: ijms22157795. doi: 10.3390/ijms22157795.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fanconi anemia (FA) proteins are required for repairing interstrand DNA crosslinks (ICLs). Here we report a novel role of PML proteins, regulating the ICL repair pathway. We found that depletion of the PML protein led to the significant reduction of damage-induced FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination and FANCD2 foci formation. Consistently, the cells treated with siRNA against PML showed enhanced sensitivity to a crosslinking agent, mitomycin C. Further studies showed that depletion of PML reduced the protein expression of FANCA, FANCG, and FANCD2 via reduced transcriptional activity. Interestingly, we observed that damage-induced CHK1 phosphorylation was severely impaired in cells with depleted PML, and we demonstrated that CHK1 regulates FANCA, FANCG, and FANCD2 transcription. Finally, we showed that inhibition of CHK1 phosphorylation further sensitized cancer cells to mitomycin C. Taken together, these findings suggest that the PML is critical for damage-induced CHK1 phosphorylation, which is important for FA gene expression and for repairing ICLs.","['Munkhjargal, Anudari', 'Kim, Myung-Jin', 'Kim, Da-Yeon', 'Jeon, Young-Jun', 'Kee, Young-Hoon', 'Kim, Lark-Kyun', 'Kim, Yong-Hwan']","['Munkhjargal A', 'Kim MJ', 'Kim DY', 'Jeon YJ', 'Kee YH', 'Kim LK', 'Kim YH']","[""Department of Biological Sciences, Research Institute of Women's Health, College of Natural Sciences, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Korea."", ""Department of Biological Sciences, Research Institute of Women's Health, College of Natural Sciences, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Korea."", ""Department of Biological Sciences, Research Institute of Women's Health, College of Natural Sciences, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Korea."", 'Department of Integrative Biotechnology, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon 16419, Korea.', 'Department of New Biology, Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology, Daegu 42988, Korea.', 'Severance Biomedical Science Institute, Graduate School of Medical Science, Brain Korea 21 Project, Gangnam Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 06230, Korea.', ""Department of Biological Sciences, Research Institute of Women's Health, College of Natural Sciences, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul 04310, Korea.""]","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7992-4585', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1461-572X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5998-9605', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5983-4470', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8574-4938']",['eng'],"['NRF-2014M3C9A2064688/National Research Foundation funded by the Ministry of', 'Science, ICT & Future Planning of the Korean government', 'NRF-2019R1A2C2089746/National Research Foundation funded by the Ministry of', 'Science, ICT & Future Planning of the Korean government', 'NRF-2016R1A5A1011974/National Research Foundation funded by the Ministry of', 'Science, ICT & Future Planning of the Korean government', 'NRF-2020R1I1A1A01061661/National Research Foundation funded by the Ministry of', 'Science, ICT & Future Planning of the Korean government']",['Journal Article'],20210721,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (FANCA protein, human)', '0 (FANCD2 protein, human)', '0 (FANCG protein, human)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group G Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Checkpoint Kinase 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Fanconi Anemia/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group G Protein/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', 'Ubiquitination']",PMC8346011,['NOTNLM'],"['CHK1 inhibitors', 'Fanconi anemia', 'PML nuclear body', 'interstrand DNA crosslink']",2021/08/08 06:00,2021/08/17 06:00,['2021/08/07 01:06'],"['2021/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/07 01:06 [entrez]', '2021/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22157782 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22157782 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Jul 21;22(15). pii: ijms22157782. doi: 10.3390/ijms22157782.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to assess dentition state in leukemic patients during one cycle of chemotherapy and its correlation with blood parameters. The study included 102 adults treated because of leukemia at the Clinic of Haemato-Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation at the university hospital in Lublin, Poland. The sample group consisted of 51 women and 51 men aged 22 to 72 (54.07 +/- 10.33) with following diagnoses: Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)-55 patients (53.92%), Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)-17 patients (16.67%), Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-16 patients (15.69%), Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)-10 patients (9.80%), Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) -3 patients (2.94%), Chronic hairy cell leukemia (HCL)-1 patient (0.98%). DMFT index was used to assess dentition state. After the cycle of chemotherapy, their dentition state changed in terms of decayed, missing and filled teeth and correlated with hematological parameters. Adult patients with leukemia have high dental treatment needs, and high number of missing teeth; thus, a comprehensive and fast dental treatment is necessary to avoid systemic complications and ensure better quality of life.","['Ptasiewicz, Maja', 'Maksymiuk, Pawel', 'Chalas, Renata']","['Ptasiewicz M', 'Maksymiuk P', 'Chalas R']","['Department of Oral Medicine, Medical University of Lublin, ul.

Starting from an understanding of the general state-of-the-art, a critical analysis of existing approaches has been conducted, identifying strengths and weaknesses. Then, a strategy for assessing the radon exposure of the general population, in a new comprehensive way, is proposed. It identifies three main areas of intervention and provides a list of hazard indicators and operative solutions to control human exposure. The strategy has been conceived to provide a supporting tool to authorities in the introduction of effective measures to assess population health risks due to radon exposure.","['Mancini, Simona', 'Vilnitis, Martins', 'Guida, Michele']","['Mancini S', 'Vilnitis M', 'Guida M']","['Department of Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Applied Mathematics (DIEM), Laboratory ""Ambients and Radiations (Amb.Ra.)"", University of Salerno, 84084 Fisciano, Italy.', 'Institute of Construction Technology, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Riga Technical University, 1658 Riga, Latvia.', 'Department of Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Applied Mathematics (DIEM), Laboratory ""Ambients and Radiations (Amb.Ra.)"", University of Salerno, 84084 Fisciano, Italy.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6759-8957', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1108-5391']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210730,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Radioactive)', 'Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)']",IM,"['*Air Pollutants, Radioactive/adverse effects/analysis', '*Air Pollution, Indoor/adverse effects/analysis', 'European Union', 'Humans', '*Lung Neoplasms', '*Radon/analysis/toxicity', 'Risk Assessment']",PMC8345373,['NOTNLM'],"['*environmental radon', '*health risk of radon', '*indoor radon', '*radon and public health', '*radon assessment', '*radon exposure', '*radon in building materials']",2021/08/08 06:00,2021/08/13 06:00,['2021/08/07 01:06'],"['2021/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/07 01:06 [entrez]', '2021/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph18158089 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph18158089 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2021 Jul 30;18(15). pii: ijerph18158089. doi: 10.3390/ijerph18158089.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They target mainly cancer and virally infected cells. To a high extent cytotoxic activity of NK cells is regulated inter alia by signals from killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR). The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules are important ligands for KIR receptors. Binding of ligands (such as MHC I) to the KIR receptors has the important role in solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplantation. Of note, the understanding of the relationship between KIR and MHC receptors may contribute to the improvement of transplant results. Donor-recipient matching, which also includes the KIR typing, may improve monitoring, individualize the treatment and allow for predicting possible effects after transplantation, such as the graft-versus-leukemia effect (GvL) or viral re-infection. There are also less evident implications of KIR/MHC matching, such as with pregnancy and cancer. In this review, we present the most relevant literature reports on the importance of the KIR/MHC relationship on NK cell activity and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)/solid organ transplantation (SOT) effects, the risk of allograft rejection, protection against post-transplant cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, pregnancy complications, cancer and adoptive therapy with NK cells.","['Debska-Zielkowska, Joanna', 'Moszkowska, Grazyna', 'Zielinski, Maciej', 'Zielinska, Hanna', 'Dukat-Mazurek, Anna', 'Trzonkowski, Piotr', 'Stefanska, Katarzyna']","['Debska-Zielkowska J', 'Moszkowska G', 'Zielinski M', 'Zielinska H', 'Dukat-Mazurek A', 'Trzonkowski P', 'Stefanska K']","['Department of Medical Immunology, Medical University of Gdansk, 80-210 Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Immunology, Medical University of Gdansk, 80-210 Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Immunology, Medical University of Gdansk, 80-210 Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Immunology, Medical University of Gdansk, 80-210 Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Immunology, Medical University of Gdansk, 80-210 Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Immunology, Medical University of Gdansk, 80-210 Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Medical University of Gdansk, 80-214 Gdansk, Poland.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8366-5846'],['eng'],"['02-049/07 (ST49)/Piotr Trzonkowski, Katarzyna Stefanska']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210714,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['HLA Antigens/*metabolism', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Receptors, KIR/*metabolism', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods']",PMC8303609,['NOTNLM'],"['*HLA', '*KIR', '*NK', '*transplantation']",2021/08/08 06:00,2021/10/29 06:00,['2021/08/07 01:04'],"['2021/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/05 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/07 01:04 [entrez]', '2021/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['cells10071777 [pii]', '10.3390/cells10071777 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2021 Jul 14;10(7). pii: cells10071777. doi: 10.3390/cells10071777.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we use dynamic BH3 profiling (DBP), a functional predictive assay that measures net changes in apoptotic priming, to find new effective treatments for ER+ breast cancer. We observed anti-apoptotic adaptations upon treatment that pointed to metronomic therapeutic combinations to enhance cytotoxicity and avoid resistance. Indeed, we found that the anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-xL and MCL-1 are crucial for ER+ breast cancer cells resistance to therapy, as they exert a dual inhibition of the pro-apoptotic protein BIM and compensate for each other. In addition, we identified the AKT inhibitor ipatasertib and two BH3 mimetics targeting these anti-apoptotic proteins, S63845 and A-1331852, as new potential therapies for this type of cancer. Therefore, we postulate the sequential inhibition of both proteins using BH3 mimetics as a new treatment option for refractory and relapsed ER+ breast cancer tumors.","['Alcon, Clara', 'Gomez Tejeda Zanudo, Jorge', 'Albert, Reka', 'Wagle, Nikhil', 'Scaltriti, Maurizio', 'Letai, Anthony', 'Samitier, Josep', 'Montero, Joan']","['Alcon C', 'Gomez Tejeda Zanudo J', 'Albert R', 'Wagle N', 'Scaltriti M', 'Letai A', 'Samitier J', 'Montero J']","['Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Eli and Edythe L.

Somatic mutations of STAT3 are involved in the pathogenesis of these entities. We describe the clinicobiological features, mutational status of STAT3/STAT5B, treatment and outcome of 131 patients. Neutropenia was the most frequent finding at diagnosis, followed by anemia. Concurrent hematological disorders were diagnosed in 37% of patients and autoimmune conditions and solid tumors in 17% and 15%, respectively. All patients who needed treatment belonged to the CD8(+)CD57(+) group. Remarkably, patients included in the CD4(+) group had a higher association with solid tumors (p = 0.037). STAT3 mutations were found in 17% of patients, mainly Y640F and D661Y mutations. Patients carrying STAT3 mutations more frequently presented with anemia, neutropenia, high LDH, high large granular lymphocyte counts and need for treatment (p = 0.0037). Methotrexate was the most frequently used agent (72% of cases). The overall response rate to all treatments was 50%. The 10-year overall survival of this series was 78%, with no differences according to the mutational status of STAT3. We compared the survival of these patients with the general Spanish population and no differences were found, confirming the indolent nature of these hematological malignancies. Our study further extends findings documented by others on the clinical behavior of the disease and the impact of STAT3, and for the first time analyzes survival compared to a matched general Spanish population.","['Rivero, Andrea', 'Mozas, Pablo', 'Jimenez, Laura', 'Lopez-Guerra, Monica', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Bataller, Alex', 'Correa, Juan', 'Rivas-Delgado, Alfredo', 'Bastidas, Gabriela', 'Baumann, Tycho', 'Martinez-Trillos, Alejandra', 'Delgado, Julio', 'Gine, Eva', 'Campo, Elias', 'Lopez-Guillermo, Armando', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Magnano, Laura', 'Matutes, Estella']","['Rivero A', 'Mozas P', 'Jimenez L', 'Lopez-Guerra M', 'Colomer D', 'Bataller A', 'Correa J', 'Rivas-Delgado A', 'Bastidas G', 'Baumann T', 'Martinez-Trillos A', 'Delgado J', 'Gine E', 'Campo E', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Villamor N', 'Magnano L', 'Matutes E']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), 08036 Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), 08036 Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Barcelona, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), 08036 Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), 08036 Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), 08036 Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Barcelona, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), 08036 Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Barcelona, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), 08036 Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), 08036 Barcelona, Spain."", 'Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4233-5031', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5545-0178', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7486-8484', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6085-2745', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6538-4111']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210802,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC8345581,['NOTNLM'],"['STAT3', 'T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia', 'chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK cells', 'outcome']",2021/08/08 06:00,2021/08/08 06:01,['2021/08/07 01:03'],"['2021/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/07 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/08 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13153900 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13153900 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Aug 2;13(15). pii: cancers13153900. doi: 10.3390/cancers13153900.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, loss of this engraftment ability by deletion of Lyl1 did not result in any loss of leukemogenesis activity. In the present study, we observe that NHD13 thymocytes overexpress EPHA3, and we characterise thymocyte behaviour in NHD13 mice with deletion of EphA3, which show a markedly reduced incidence of T-ALL. Deletion of EphA3 from the NHD13 mice does not prevent the abnormal accumulation or transplantation ability of these thymocytes. However, upon transplantation, these cells are unable to block the normal progression of recipient wild type (WT) progenitor cells through the normal developmental pathway. This is in contrast to the EphA3(+/+)&nbsp;NHD13 thymocytes, which block the progression of incoming WT progenitors past the DN1 stage. Therefore, EphA3 is not critical for classical self-renewal, but is essential for mediating an interaction between the abnormally self-renewing cells and healthy progenitors-an interaction that results in a failure of the healthy cells to differentiate normally. We speculate that this may orchestrate a loss of healthy cell competition, which in itself has been demonstrated to be oncogenic, and that this may explain the decrease in T-ALL incidence in the absence of EphA3. We suggest that pre-leukaemic self-renewal in this model is a complex interplay of cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic factors, and that multiple redundant pathways to leukaemogenesis are active.","['Pliego Zamora, Adriana C', 'Ranasinghe, Hansini', 'Lisle, Jessica E', 'Ng, Chun Ki', 'Huang, Stephen', 'Wadlow, Racheal', 'Scott, Andrew M', 'Boyd, Andrew W', 'Slape, Christopher I']","['Pliego Zamora AC', 'Ranasinghe H', 'Lisle JE', 'Ng CK', 'Huang S', 'Wadlow R', 'Scott AM', 'Boyd AW', 'Slape CI']","['The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Brisbane 4102, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Brisbane 4102, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Brisbane 4102, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Brisbane 4102, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Brisbane 4102, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Brisbane 4102, Australia.', 'Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute and La Trobe University, Heidelberg 3084, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Melbourne 3000, Australia.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Brisbane 4072, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Brisbane 4102, Australia.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0581-740X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8407-3092']",['eng'],['1099381/National Health and Medical Research Council'],['Journal Article'],20210731,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC8345401,['NOTNLM'],"['Eph', 'T-ALL', 'cell competition', 'pre-leukaemia']",2021/08/08 06:00,2021/08/08 06:01,['2021/08/07 01:03'],"['2021/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/07 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/08 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13153858 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13153858 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Jul 31;13(15). pii: cancers13153858. doi: 10.3390/cancers13153858.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, ENDOG silencing reduced proliferation of follicular thyroid carcinoma and glioblastoma cell lines with high p-AKT expression. High ENDOG expression was associated with a short time to treatment in a cohort of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a B-cell lymphoid neoplasm with activation of PI3K/AKT.

Detrimental graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but also beneficial graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects occurring after allo-HSCT are largely mediated by alloantigen-reactive donor T cells in the graft. Separating GVHD from GVL effects is a formidable challenge, and a greater understanding of donor T cell biology is required to accomplish the uncoupling of GVHD from GVL. Here, we evaluated the role of beta-catenin in this process. Using a unique mouse model of transgenic overexpression of human beta-catenin (Cat-Tg) in an allo-HSCT model, we show here that T cells from Cat-Tg mice did not cause GVHD, and surprisingly, Cat-Tg T cells maintained the GVL effect. Donor T cells from Cat-Tg mice exhibited significantly lower inflammatory cytokine production and reduced donor T cell proliferation, while upregulating cytotoxic mediators that resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity. RNA sequencing revealed changes in the expression of 1169 genes for CD4, and 1006 genes for CD8(+) T cells involved in essential aspects of immune response and GVHD pathophysiology. Altogether, our data suggest that beta-catenin is a druggable target for developing therapeutic strategies to reduce GVHD while preserving the beneficial GVL effects following allo-HSCT treatment.","['Mammadli, Mahinbanu', 'Harris, Rebecca', 'Mahmudlu, Sara', 'Verma, Anjali', 'May, Adriana', 'Dhawan, Rohan', 'Waickman, Adam T', 'Sen, Jyoti Misra', 'August, Avery', 'Karimi, Mobin']","['Mammadli M', 'Harris R', 'Mahmudlu S', 'Verma A', 'May A', 'Dhawan R', 'Waickman AT', 'Sen JM', 'August A', 'Karimi M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA.', 'Biomedical Research Center, National Institute on Aging-National Institutes of Health, 08C218, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Suite 100, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA.', 'Biomedical Research Center, National Institute on Aging-National Institutes of Health, 08C218, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Suite 100, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.', 'Immunology Program, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0115-4576', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1118-3514', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3240-4814']",['eng'],"['K22 AI130182/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'L6 MD0010106/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'AI130182/NH/NIH HHS/United States', '1146249-1-75632/Upstate Medical University Cancer grant']",['Journal Article'],20210728,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC8345079,['NOTNLM'],"['GVHD', 'GVT', 'T cells signaling', 'Wnt/beta-catenin', 'cytokines', 'inflammation', 'migration']",2021/08/08 06:00,2021/08/08 06:01,['2021/08/07 01:03'],"['2021/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/07 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/08 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13153798 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13153798 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Jul 28;13(15). pii: cancers13153798. doi: 10.3390/cancers13153798.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review, we present how KIRs and HLA class I ligands modulate the structural formation and the functional education of NK cells. In particular, we decipher the current knowledge about the extent of KIR and HLA class I gene polymorphisms, as well as their expression, interaction, and functional impact on the KIR(+) NK cell repertoire in a physiological context and in a leukemic context. In addition, we present the impact of NK cell alloreactivity on the outcomes of HSCT in adult patients with acute leukemia, as well as a description of genetic models of KIRs and NK cell reconstitution, with a focus on emergent T-cell-repleted haplo-identical HSCT using cyclosphosphamide post-grafting (haplo-PTCy). Then, we document how the immunogenetics of KIR/HLA and the immunobiology of NK cells could improve the relapse incidence after haplo-PTCy.

The origin of the driver mutations leading to preleukemia can be traced back to HSC/progenitor cells. Many properties typical to normal HSCs are exploited by leukemic stem cells (LSCs) to their advantage, leading to the emergence of a clonal population that can eventually progress to leukemia with variable latency and evolution. In fact, different subclones might in turn develop from the original malignant clone through accumulation of additional mutations, increasing their competitive fitness. This process ultimately leads to a complex cancer architecture where a mosaic of cellular clones-each carrying a unique set of mutations-coexists. The repertoire of genes whose mutations contribute to the progression toward leukemogenesis is broad. It encompasses genes involved in different cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, epigenetics (DNA and histones modifications), DNA damage signaling and repair, chromosome segregation and replication (cohesin complex), RNA splicing, and signal transduction. Among these many players, transcription factors, RNA splicing proteins, and deubiquitinating enzymes are emerging as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.","['Barabino, Silvia M L', 'Citterio, Elisabetta', 'Ronchi, Antonella Ellena']","['Barabino SML', 'Citterio E', 'Ronchi AE']","['Department of Biotechnology and Biosciences, University of Milano-Bicocca, 20126 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Biosciences, University of Milano-Bicocca, 20126 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Biosciences, University of Milano-Bicocca, 20126 Milan, Italy.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3584-4417', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2347-3495', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3905-1038']",['eng'],['813091/H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210726,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC8345071,['NOTNLM'],"['R-loops', 'RNA splicing', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs)', 'genome integrity', 'myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)', 'transcription factors']",2021/08/08 06:00,2021/08/08 06:01,['2021/08/07 01:03'],"['2021/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/21 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/07 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/08 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13153753 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13153753 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Jul 26;13(15). pii: cancers13153753. doi: 10.3390/cancers13153753.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Screening manually is time-consuming and tedious, and may lead to missed diagnosis or misdiagnosis because of subjective bias. To address these problems, we develop a three-step pipeline to help in the early diagnosis of APL from peripheral blood smears. The entire pipeline consists of leukocytes focusing, cell classification and diagnostic opinions. As the key component of the pipeline, a compact classification model based on attention embedded convolutional neural network blocks is proposed to distinguish promyelocytes from normal leukocytes. The compact classification model is validated on both the combination of two public datasets, APL-Cytomorphology_LMU and APL-Cytomorphology_JHH, as well as the clinical dataset, to yield a precision of 96.53% and 99.20%, respectively.

Loss of RIOK2 led to a decrease in protein synthesis and to ribosomal instability followed by apoptosis in leukemic cells, but not in fibroblasts. Moreover, the ATPase function of RIOK2 was necessary for cell survival. When a small-molecule inhibitor was used, pharmacological inhibition of RIOK2 similarly led to loss of protein synthesis and apoptosis and affected leukemic cell growth in vivo.

Here, we show that poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and PARP-2 exert opposing influences on progression of c-Myc-driven B-cell lymphoma. PARP-1 and PARP-2 catalyze the synthesis and transfer of ADP-ribose units onto amino acid residues of acceptor proteins in response to DNA strand breaks, playing a central role in the response to DNA damage. Accordingly, PARP inhibitors have emerged as promising new cancer therapeutics. However, the inhibitors currently available for clinical use are not able to discriminate between individual PARP proteins. We found that genetic deletion of PARP-2 prevents c-Myc-driven B-cell lymphoma, whereas PARP-1 deficiency accelerates lymphomagenesis in the Emu-Myc mouse model of aggressive B-cell lymphoma. Loss of PARP-2 aggravates replication stress in preleukemic Emu-Myc B cells, resulting in accumulation of DNA damage and concomitant cell death that restricts the c-Myc-driven expansion of B cells, thereby providing protection against B-cell lymphoma. In contrast, PARP-1 deficiency induces a proinflammatory response and an increase in regulatory T cells, likely contributing to immune escape of B-cell lymphoma, resulting in an acceleration of lymphomagenesis. These findings pinpoint specific functions for PARP-1 and PARP-2 in c-Myc-driven lymphomagenesis with antagonistic consequences that may help inform the design of new PARP-centered therapeutic strategies, with selective PARP-2 inhibition potentially representing a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of c-Myc-driven tumors.","['Galindo-Campos, Miguel A', 'Lutfi, Nura', 'Bonnin, Sarah', 'Martinez, Carlos', 'Velasco-Hernandez, Talia', 'Garcia-Hernandez, Violeta', 'Martin-Caballero, Juan', 'Ampurdanes, Coral', 'Gimeno, Ramon', 'Colomo, Lluis', 'Roue, Gael', 'Guilbaud, Guillaume', 'Dantzer, Francoise', 'Navarro, Pilar', 'Murga, Matilde', 'Fernandez-Capetillo, Oscar', 'Bigas, Anna', 'Menendez, Pablo', 'Sale, Julian E', 'Yelamos, Jose']","['Galindo-Campos MA', 'Lutfi N', 'Bonnin S', 'Martinez C', 'Velasco-Hernandez T', 'Garcia-Hernandez V', 'Martin-Caballero J', 'Ampurdanes C', 'Gimeno R', 'Colomo L', 'Roue G', 'Guilbaud G', 'Dantzer F', 'Navarro P', 'Murga M', 'Fernandez-Capetillo O', 'Bigas A', 'Menendez P', 'Sale JE', 'Yelamos J']","['Cancer Research Program, Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Cancer Research Program, Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Center for Genomic Regulation, Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Experimental Pathology Unit, Instituto Murciano de Investigacion Biosanitaria-Laboratorio de Investigacion Biosanitaria-Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), Redes de Investigacion Cooperativa Orientadas a Resultados en Salud, Madrid, Spain.', 'Cancer Research Program, Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Instituto Cajal, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Cancer Research Program, Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Immunology, Department of Pathology.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Division of Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry, Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Biotechnology and Cell Signaling, Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 7242 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Laboratory of Excellence Medalis, Ecole Superieure de Biotechnologie de Strasbourg, Strasbourg University, Illkirch, France.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Barcelona (IIBB)-CSIC, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute, Unidad Asociada IIBB-CSIC, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Genomic Instability Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Genomic Instability Group, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Science for Life Laboratory, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Cancer Research Program, Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'ISCIII, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Oncologia, Barcelona, Spain; and.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII), Redes de Investigacion Cooperativa Orientadas a Resultados en Salud, Madrid, Spain.', 'ISCIII, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Oncologia, Barcelona, Spain; and.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Division of Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry, Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research Program, Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Immunology, Department of Pathology.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0650-8660', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5159-2518', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3307-1326', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2183-7443', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2328-4360', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8758-121X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4345-6855', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4314-4584', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9766-4481', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2690-6885', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4801-6899', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1195-1496']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,,,,,2021/08/07 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2021/08/06 20:32'],"['2021/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/06 20:32 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(21)01451-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2021012805 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2022 Jan 13;139(2):228-239. doi: 10.1182/blood.2021012805.,228-239,['(c) 2022 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hematopoietic cell-specific mechanisms regulating p53 activity remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that conditional deletion of acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein 32B (ANP32B) in hematopoietic cells impairs repopulation capacity and postinjury regeneration of HSCs. Mechanistically, ANP32B forms a repressive complex with p53 and thus inhibits the transcriptional activity of p53 in hematopoietic cells, and p53 deletion rescues the functional defect in Anp32b-deficient HSCs. Of great interest, ANP32B is highly expressed in leukemic cells from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Anp32b deletion enhances p53 transcriptional activity to impair LSC function in a murine CML model and exhibits synergistic therapeutic effects with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in inhibiting CML propagation. In summary, our findings provide a novel strategy to enhance p53 activity in LSCs by inhibiting ANP32B and identify ANP32B as a potential therapeutic target in treating CML.","['Yang, Shuo', 'Zhu, Xiao-Na', 'Zhang, Hui-Lin', 'Yang, Qian', 'Wei, Yu-Sheng', 'Zhu, Di', 'Liu, Meng-Di', 'Shen, Shao-Ming', 'Xia, Li', 'He, Ping', 'Ge, Meng-Kai', 'Pan, Yi-Lian', 'Zhao, Meng', 'Wu, Ying-Li', 'Zheng, Jun-Ke', 'Chen, Guo-Qiang', 'Yu, Yun']","['Yang S', 'Zhu XN', 'Zhang HL', 'Yang Q', 'Wei YS', 'Zhu D', 'Liu MD', 'Shen SM', 'Xia L', 'He P', 'Ge MK', 'Pan YL', 'Zhao M', 'Wu YL', 'Zheng JK', 'Chen GQ', 'Yu Y']","['Department of Pathophysiology, State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Research Unit 2019RU043, Ren-Ji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Research Unit 2019RU043, Ren-Ji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Rui-Jin Hospital, SJTU-SM, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Rui-Jin Hospital, SJTU-SM, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Rui-Jin Hospital, SJTU-SM, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Ren-Ji Hospital, SJTU-SM, Shanghai, China.', 'International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital, SJTU-SM, Shanghai, China; and.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Rui-Jin Hospital, SJTU-SM, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Rui-Jin Hospital, SJTU-SM, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Research Unit 2019RU043, Ren-Ji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Research Unit 2019RU043, Ren-Ji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.', 'International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital, SJTU-SM, Shanghai, China; and.', 'Key Laboratory of Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Ministry of Education, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Rui-Jin Hospital, SJTU-SM, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Rui-Jin Hospital, SJTU-SM, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Research Unit 2019RU043, Ren-Ji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM), Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Rui-Jin Hospital, SJTU-SM, Shanghai, China.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4936-2363'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Anp32b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC8678996,,,2021/08/07 06:00,2022/01/04 06:00,['2021/08/06 20:32'],"['2020/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/12/16 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/06 20:32 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(21)01450-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020010400 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2021 Dec 16;138(24):2485-2498. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020010400.,2485-2498,['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,['2022/12/16 00:00'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Major histocompatibility complex class I polypeptide-related sequence A and B (MICA/B) are stress proteins expressed by cancer cells, and antibody-mediated inhibition of MICA/B shedding represents a novel approach to stimulate immunity against cancers. We found that the MICA/B antibody 7C6 potently inhibits the outgrowth of AML in 2 models in immunocompetent mice. Macrophages were essential for therapeutic efficacy, and 7C6 triggered antibody-dependent phagocytosis of AML cells. Furthermore, we found that romidepsin, a selective histone deacetylase inhibitor, increased MICB messenger RNA in AML cells and enabled subsequent stabilization of the translated protein by 7C6. This drug combination substantially increased surface MICA/B expression in a human AML line, pluripotent stem cell-derived AML blasts and leukemia stem cells, as well as primary cells from 3 untreated patients with AML. Human macrophages phagocytosed AML cells following treatment with 7C6 and romidepsin, and the combination therapy lowered leukemia burden in a humanized model of AML. Therefore, inhibition of MICA/B shedding promotes macrophage-driven immunity against AML via Fc receptor signaling and synergizes with an epigenetic regulator. These results provide the rationale for the clinical testing of this innovative immunotherapeutic approach for the treatment of AML.","['Alves da Silva, Pedro Henrique', 'Xing, Samantha', 'Kotini, Andriana G', 'Papapetrou, Eirini P', 'Song, Xiaoyu', 'Wucherpfennig, Kai W', 'Mascarenhas, John', 'Ferrari de Andrade, Lucas']","['Alves da Silva PH', 'Xing S', 'Kotini AG', 'Papapetrou EP', 'Song X', 'Wucherpfennig KW', 'Mascarenhas J', 'Ferrari de Andrade L']","['Precision Immunology Institute.', 'Precision Immunology Institute.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology.', 'The Black Family Stem Institute.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology.', 'The Black Family Stem Institute.', 'Department of Population Health Science and Policy, and.', 'The Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology and Virology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Immunology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; and.', ""Department of Neurology, Brigham & Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology.', 'The Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.', 'Precision Immunology Institute.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences.', 'The Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7002-417X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1829-302X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8400-0483', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2137-2271']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,,,,,2021/08/07 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2021/08/06 20:32'],"['2021/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/06 20:32 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(21)01448-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2021011619 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2022 Jan 13;139(2):205-216. doi: 10.1182/blood.2021011619.,205-216,['(c) 2022 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Validation using 100 positive specimens and 15 negative specimens by a combined reference standard of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)/RT-PCR/next-generation sequencing (NGS) assays achieved 100% sensitivity in leukemias/lymphomas and 95.0% sensitivity and 100% specificity in solid tumors. Subsequently, 214 consecutive clinical cases, including 73 leukemia/lymphoma specimens and 141 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded solid tumor specimens, were analyzed by gene fusion panels across 638 unique gene fusion transcripts. A variety of comparator tests, including FISH panels, conventional karyotyping, a DNA-based targeted NGS assay, and custom RT-PCR testing, were performed in parallel. The gene fusion assay detected 31 gene fusions, including 16 in leukemia/lymphoma specimens and 15 in solid tumor specimens. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of gene fusions detected by the gene fusion panel in all 329 specimens (validation and consecutive clinical specimens) tested in this study were 94.8%, 100%, and 97.9%, respectively, compared with FISH/RT-PCR/NGS assays. The gene fusion panel is a reliable approach that maximizes molecular detection of fusions among both fresh and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cancer specimens.","['Haley, Lisa', 'Parimi, Vamsi', 'Jiang, Liqun', 'Pallavajjala, Aparna', 'Hardy, Melanie', 'Yonescu, Raluca', 'Morsberger, Laura', 'Stinnett, Victoria', 'Long, Patty', 'Zou, Ying S', 'Gocke, Christopher D']","['Haley L', 'Parimi V', 'Jiang L', 'Pallavajjala A', 'Hardy M', 'Yonescu R', 'Morsberger L', 'Stinnett V', 'Long P', 'Zou YS', 'Gocke CD']","['Johns Hopkins Genomics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Johns Hopkins Genomics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Johns Hopkins Genomics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; Cytogenetics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; Cytogenetics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Johns Hopkins Genomics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; Cytogenetics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; Cytogenetics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Johns Hopkins Genomics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; Cytogenetics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Johns Hopkins Genomics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; Cytogenetics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland.

However, few reports have described the role of MCL1 in squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) derived from airways including the lung. In this study, we examined whether MCL1 could be a novel druggable target for airway-derived SqCC, for which effective molecular targeted drugs are unavailable. We searched the Kaplan-Meier Plotter database and found that high MCL1 mRNA expression was significantly associated with shorter survival in patients with lower airway (lung) or upper airway (head and neck) derived SqCC. We also explored the Expression Atlas database and learned that authentic lung SqCC cell lines expressing both TP63 and KRT5 mRNA were extremely sparse among the publicly available ""lung SqCC cell lines"", with an exception being HARA cells. HARA cells were highly dependent on MCL1 for survival, and MCL1-depleted cells were not able to grow, and even declined in number, upon docetaxel (DTX) exposure in vitro and in vivo. Similar in vitro experimental findings, including those in a 3D culture model, were also obtained using Detroit 562 pharyngeal SqCC cells. These findings suggested that combined treatment with MCL1 silencing plus DTX appears highly effective against airway-derived SqCC.","['Sakuma, Yuji', 'Hirai, Sachie', 'Sumi, Toshiyuki', 'Tada, Makoto', 'Kojima, Takashi', 'Niki, Toshiro', 'Yamaguchi, Miki']","['Sakuma Y', 'Hirai S', 'Sumi T', 'Tada M', 'Kojima T', 'Niki T', 'Yamaguchi M']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Research Institute for Frontier Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South 1, West 17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8556, Japan.

Here, we uncover an IRF8-MEF2D transcriptional circuit as an acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-biased dependency. We discover and characterize the mechanism by which the chromatin ""reader"" ZMYND8 directly activates IRF8 in parallel with the MYC proto-oncogene through their lineage-specific enhancers. ZMYND8 is essential for AML proliferation in vitro and in vivo and associates with MYC and IRF8 enhancer elements that we define in cell lines and in patient samples. ZMYND8 occupancy at IRF8 and MYC enhancers requires BRD4, a transcription coactivator also necessary for AML proliferation. We show that ZMYND8 binds to the ET domain of BRD4 via its chromatin reader cassette, which in turn is required for proper chromatin occupancy and maintenance of leukemic growth in vivo. Our results rationalize ZMYND8 as a potential therapeutic target for modulating essential transcriptional programs in AML.","['Cao, Zhendong', 'Budinich, Krista A', 'Huang, Hua', 'Ren, Diqiu', 'Lu, Bin', 'Zhang, Zhen', 'Chen, Qingzhou', 'Zhou, Yeqiao', 'Huang, Yu-Han', 'Alikarami, Fatemeh', 'Kingsley, Molly C', 'Lenard, Alexandra K', 'Wakabayashi, Aoi', 'Khandros, Eugene', 'Bailis, Will', 'Qi, Jun', 'Carroll, Martin P', 'Blobel, Gerd A', 'Faryabi, Robert B', 'Bernt, Kathrin M', 'Berger, Shelley L', 'Shi, Junwei']","['Cao Z', 'Budinich KA', 'Huang H', 'Ren D', 'Lu B', 'Zhang Z', 'Chen Q', 'Zhou Y', 'Huang YH', 'Alikarami F', 'Kingsley MC', 'Lenard AK', 'Wakabayashi A', 'Khandros E', 'Bailis W', 'Qi J', 'Carroll MP', 'Blobel GA', 'Faryabi RB', 'Bernt KM', 'Berger SL', 'Shi J']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA;

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to report a case of a 42-year-old woman, diagnosed with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, who developed oGVHD and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection after HSCT. CASE REPORT: oGVHD was confirmed by incisional biopsy and viral infection by HSV types 1 and 2 was confirmed by PCR. Topical and systemic corticotherapy and antiviral therapies were instituted. The immunosuppression intensified viral infection and antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) was instituted as an adjuvant treatment. aPDT application, along with the patient's immune recovery, antivirals and corticosteroids resulted in clinical improvement of oral lesions.

Epigenetic alterations including DNA methylation and chromatin modification may contribute to the initiation and progression of these malignancies. DNA hypomethylating agents such as decitabine and azacitidine are used as therapeutic treatments and have shown to promote expression of genes involved in tumor suppression, apoptosis, and immune response. Another anti-cancer drug, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, is used as a chemotherapeutic treatment for multiple myeloma (MM). Phase III clinical trials of decitabine and azacitidine used alone and in combination with other chemotherapeutics demonstrated their capacity to treat hematological malignancies and prolong the survival of MDS and AML patients. Although phase III clinical trials examining bortezomib's role in MDS and AML patients are limited, its underlying mechanisms in MM highlight its potential as a chemotherapeutic for such malignancies. Further research is needed to better understand how the epigenetic mechanisms mediated by these chemotherapeutic agents and their targeted gene networks are associated with the development and progression of MDS into AML. This review discusses the mechanisms by which decitabine, azacitidine, and bortezomib alter epigenetic programs and their results from phase III clinical trials.","['Sorrentino, Vincent G', 'Thota, Srijan', 'Gonzalez, Edward A', 'Rameshwar, Pranela', 'Chang, Victor T', 'Etchegaray, Jean-Pierre']","['Sorrentino VG', 'Thota S', 'Gonzalez EA', 'Rameshwar P', 'Chang VT', 'Etchegaray JP']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University-Newark, Newark, NJ 07102, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University-Newark, Newark, NJ 07102, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University-Newark, Newark, NJ 07102, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.', 'Veteran Affairs New Jersey Health Care System, East Orange, NJ 07018, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University-Newark, Newark, NJ 07102, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7503-6807', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0434-9034']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210704,Switzerland,Pharmaceuticals (Basel),"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",101238453,,,,PMC8308509,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'azacytidine', 'bortezomib', 'cancer', 'decitabine', 'epigenetic', 'hypomethylating agent', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'myeloma']",2021/08/07 06:00,2021/08/07 06:01,['2021/08/06 17:18'],"['2021/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/06 17:18 [entrez]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:01 [medline]']","['ph14070641 [pii]', '10.3390/ph14070641 [doi]']",epublish,Pharmaceuticals (Basel). 2021 Jul 4;14(7). pii: ph14070641. doi: 10.3390/ph14070641.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Up to now BLV sequences have been classified into eleven distinct genotypes. Although BLV genotyping and molecular analysis of field isolates were reported in many countries, there is no report describing BLV genotypes present in cattle from Pakistan. In this study we examined 27 env gene sequences from BLV-infected cattle coming from four farms located in Khyber Pakhtunkwa, Gilgit Baltisan and Punjab provinces. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the classification of Pakistani sequences into genotypes G1 and G6. The alignment with the FLK-BLV sequence revealed the presence of 45 mutations, namely, seven in genotype G1 and 33 in genotype G6. Five mutations were found in both, G1 and G6 genotypes. Twelve amino acid substitutions were found in the analyzed sequences, of which only one P264S was specific for sequences from Pakistan. Furthermore, a certain degree of nucleotide heterogeneity was identified by NGS. These results highlight the need for further study on the importance of genetic variability of BLV, especially in the context of its pathogenicity and potential effect on serological detection.","['Rola-Luszczak, Marzena', 'Sakhawat, Ali', 'Pluta, Aneta', 'Rylo, Anna', 'Bomba, Arkadiusz', 'Bibi, Nazia', 'Kuzmak, Jacek']","['Rola-Luszczak M', 'Sakhawat A', 'Pluta A', 'Rylo A', 'Bomba A', 'Bibi N', 'Kuzmak J']","['Department of Biochemistry, National Veterinary Research Institute, 24-100 Pulawy, Poland.', 'National Veterinary Laboratories, Islamabad 45500, Pakistan.', 'Animal Quarantine Department, Ministry of National Food Security and Research, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan.', 'Department of Bio Sciences, COMSATS University, Islamabad 45500, Pakistan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, National Veterinary Research Institute, 24-100 Pulawy, Poland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, National Veterinary Research Institute, 24-100 Pulawy, Poland.', 'Department of Omics Analysis, National Veterinary Research Institute, 24-100 Pulawy, Poland.', 'Department of Bio Sciences, COMSATS University, Islamabad 45500, Pakistan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, National Veterinary Research Institute, 24-100 Pulawy, Poland.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3209-3427', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6860-4474']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210719,Switzerland,Pathogens,"Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",101596317,,,,PMC8308526,['NOTNLM'],"['Pakistan', 'bovine leukemia virus (BLV)', 'genetic variability', 'phylogenetic analysis', 'quasispecies']",2021/08/07 06:00,2021/08/07 06:01,['2021/08/06 17:18'],"['2021/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/06 17:18 [entrez]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:01 [medline]']","['pathogens10070910 [pii]', '10.3390/pathogens10070910 [doi]']",epublish,Pathogens. 2021 Jul 19;10(7). pii: pathogens10070910. doi: 10.3390/pathogens10070910.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this pilot study, the average total IgA and IgM concentrations in milk, saliva, and serum samples from BLV ELISA-positive (ELISA+) dairy cows were compared against samples from BLV ELISA-negative (ELISA-) cows using the Kruskal-Wallis test (with ties). The results from ELISA+ cows were also stratified by lymphocyte count (LC) and proviral load (PVL). In milk and saliva from ELISA+ cows, the average total IgA and IgM concentrations were decreased compared to ELISA- cows, although this was only statistically significant for saliva IgM in cows with low PVL (p = 0.0424). Numerically, the average total IgA concentrations were 33.6% lower in milk and 23.7% lower in saliva, and the average total IgM concentrations were 42.4% lower in milk and 15.5% lower in saliva. No significant differences were observed in the total serum IgA concentrations, regardless of PVL and LC. The total serum IgM from ELISA+ cows was significantly decreased (p = 0.0223), with the largest decreases occurring in the highest PVL and LC subgroups.

Her father became Professor of Medicine at Sheffield University and her mother was one of the first women to qualify as a doctor, and together they practiced in Hillsborough, near Sheffield. Having qualified as a doctor herself in 1932, Alice worked in London hospitals before moving to Oxford, where she became a pioneer in epidemiology. Early in her career, she showed that X-raying pregnant women was a cause of childhood leukemia. Her later work focused on the harmful effects of low-level radiation on nuclear industry workers, the role of background radiation and she went on to question the dose limits set for radiation protection. All her results were initially challenged, but subsequent studies have borne out her findings. CONCLUSIONS: Dr Alice Stewart's research was pioneering, fundamental and challenging, and is now widely accepted.","['Sutcliffe, Jill']",['Sutcliffe J'],"['Low Level Radiat, Billingshurst, UK.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210927,England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hanford workers', 'X-rays', 'background radiation', 'childhood cancer', 'low level radiation', 'standard setting']",2021/08/07 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2021/08/06 17:14'],"['2021/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/06 17:14 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09553002.2021.1962569 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Int J Radiat Biol. 2021 Sep 27:1-13. doi: 10.1080/09553002.2021.1962569.,1-13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe the epidemiology of IFD in a large multicentre cohort of children with AML. METHODS: As part of the retrospective multicentre cohort TERIFIC (The Epidemiology and Risk factors for Invasive Fungal Infections in immunocompromised Children) study, proven/probable/possible IFD episodes occurring in children with primary or relapsed/refractory AML from 2003 to 2014 were analysed. Crude IFD prevalence, clinical characteristics, microbiology and treatment were assessed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate 6-month survival. RESULTS: There were 66 IFD episodes diagnosed in 63 children with AML. The majority (75.8%) of episodes occurred in the context of primary AML therapy. During primary AML therapy, the overall prevalence was 20.7% (95% CI 15.7%-26.5%) for proven/probable/possible IFD and 10.3% (95% CI 6.7%-15.0%) for proven/probable IFD. Of primary AML patients, 8.2% had IFD diagnosed during the first cycle of chemotherapy. Amongst pathogens implicated in proven/probable IFD episodes, 74.4% were moulds, over a third (37.9%) of which were non-Aspergillus spp. Antifungal prophylaxis preceded 89.4% of IFD episodes, most commonly using fluconazole (50% of IFD episodes). All-cause mortality at 6 months from IFD diagnosis was 16.7% with IFD-related mortality of 7.6% (all in cases of proven IFD). CONCLUSIONS: IFD is a common and serious complication during paediatric AML therapy. Mould infections, including non-Aspergillus spp. predominated in this cohort. A systematic approach to the identification of patients at risk, and a targeted prevention strategy for IFD is needed.","['Yeoh, Daniel K', 'Moore, Andrew S', 'Kotecha, Rishi S', 'Bartlett, Adam W',

The purpose of this multicenter retrospective study was to clarify the clinical significance of PCI before HCT in patients with non-remission ALL. Patients with non-remission ALL who received HCT between 2005 and 2015 at 16 institutions were included. PCI was objectively defined and classified to three groups according to the intensity of PCI (no, intensive, or moderate). The study cohort consisted of 104 patients with a median age of 38 (range 17-68). A significant decrease of blast percentage in the peripheral blood (PB) was confirmed in both PCI groups, suggesting that PCIs were effective to stabilize the disease activity. The group with moderate PCI had higher nucleated cell count in the BM compared to the group with intensive PCI or the group without PCI. The overall survival (OS) rates of groups with intensive and no PCI showed comparable and significantly better compared to the group with moderate PCI (P = 0.009). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the OS of moderate PCI group was significantly worse compared to that of intensive PCI group (HR = 2.43, 95% CI: 1.32-4.14, P = 0.004), while the OS of intensive PCI group was comparable to that of the group without PCI. These results suggest that the intensity of PCI rather than the response to PCI may contribute to improve the transplant outcome in patients with ALL not in remission.","['Tachibana, Takayoshi', 'Kanda, Junya', 'Ishizaki, Takuma', 'Najima, Yuho', 'Tanaka, Masatsugu', 'Doki, Noriko', 'Fujiwara, Shin-Ichiro', 'Kimura, Shun-Ichi', 'Onizuka, Makoto', 'Takahashi, Satoshi', 'Saito, Takeshi', 'Mori, Takehiko', 'Fujisawa, Shin', 'Sakaida, Emiko', 'Miyazaki, Takuya', 'Aotsuka, Nobuyuki', 'Gotoh, Moritaka', 'Watanabe, Reiko', 'Shono, Katsuhiro', 'Kanamori, Heiwa', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Okamoto, Shinichiro']","['Tachibana T', 'Kanda J', 'Ishizaki T', 'Najima Y', 'Tanaka M', 'Doki N', 'Fujiwara SI', 'Kimura SI', 'Onizuka M', 'Takahashi S', 'Saito T', 'Mori T', 'Fujisawa S', 'Sakaida E', 'Miyazaki T', 'Aotsuka N', 'Gotoh M', 'Watanabe R', 'Shono K', 'Kanamori H', 'Kanda Y', 'Okamoto S']","['Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, 2-3-2 Nakao, Asahi-ku, Yokohama, 241 -8515, Japan. tcbn@kcch.jp.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, 2-3-2 Nakao, Asahi-ku, Yokohama, 241 -8515, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, The Advanced Clinical Research Center, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Clinical Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Japanese Red Cross Society Narita Hospital, Narita, Japan.', 'First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Saitama Medical University, Kawagoe, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Chiba Aoba Municipal Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, 2-3-2 Nakao, Asahi-ku, Yokohama, 241 -8515, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7780-4459'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20210806,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'CVAD protocol', 'MAV protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Pre-conditioning intervention', 'Refractory', 'Relapse']",2021/08/07 06:00,2021/10/26 06:00,['2021/08/06 12:26'],"['2021/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/06 12:26 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-021-04607-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-021-04607-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2021 Nov;100(11):2763-2771. doi: 10.1007/s00277-021-04607-8.

This retrospective cohort study aimed to describe medically relevant information among them. All children under 3 years old treated in the same medical units from April 2014 to August 2020 and in whom a P. jirovecii evaluation was undertaken were enrolled in the study. A positive case was defined as a child presenting at least one positive PCR for P. jirovecii in a respiratory sample. Medically relevant information such as demographical characteristics, clinical presentation, microbiological co-infections, and treatments were collected. The objectives were to describe the characteristics of these children with P. jirovecii colonization/infection to determine the key underlying diseases and risk factors, and to identify viral respiratory pathogens associated. The PCR was positive for P. jirovecii in 32 children.

Here we explored for the first time the effect of the clinical-grade peptide-based CK2 inhibitor CIGB-300 on AML cells proliferation and viability. CIGB-300 internalization and subcellular distribution were also studied, and the role of B23/nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), a major target for the peptide in solid tumors, was addressed by knock-down in model cell lines. Finally, pull-down experiments and phosphoproteomic analysis were performed to study CIGB-interacting proteins and identify the array of CK2 substrates differentially modulated after treatment with the peptide. Importantly, CIGB-300 elicited a potent anti-proliferative and proapoptotic effect in AML cells, with more than 80% of peptide transduced cells within three minutes. Unlike solid tumor cells, NPM1 did not appear to be a major target for CIGB-300 in AML cells. However, in vivo pull-down experiments and phosphoproteomic analysis evidenced that CIGB-300 targeted the CK2alpha catalytic subunit, different ribosomal proteins, and inhibited the phosphorylation of a common CK2 substrates array among both AML backgrounds. Remarkably, our results not only provide cellular and molecular insights unveiling the complexity of the CIGB-300 anti-leukemic effect in AML cells but also reinforce the rationale behind the pharmacologic blockade of protein kinase CK2 for AML-targeted therapy.","['Rosales, Mauro', 'Perez, George V', 'Ramon, Ailyn C', 'Cruz, Yiliam', 'Rodriguez-Ulloa, Arielis', 'Besada, Vladimir', 'Ramos, Yassel', 'Vazquez-Blomquist, Dania', 'Caballero, Evelin', 'Aguilar, Daylen', 'Gonzalez, Luis J', 'Zettl, Katharina', 'Wisniewski, Jacek R', 'Yang, Ke', 'Perera, Yasser', 'Perea, Silvio E']","['Rosales M', 'Perez GV', 'Ramon AC', 'Cruz Y', 'Rodriguez-Ulloa A', 'Besada V', 'Ramos Y', 'Vazquez-Blomquist D', 'Caballero E', 'Aguilar D', 'Gonzalez LJ', 'Zettl K', 'Wisniewski JR', 'Yang K', 'Perera Y', 'Perea SE']","['Department of Animal and Human Biology, Faculty of Biology, University of Havana (UH), Havana 10400, Cuba.', 'Molecular Oncology Group, Department of Pharmaceuticals, Biomedical Research Division, Center for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology (CIGB), Havana 10600, Cuba.', 'Molecular Oncology Group, Department of Pharmaceuticals, Biomedical Research Division, Center for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology (CIGB), Havana 10600, Cuba.', 'Molecular Oncology Group, Department of Pharmaceuticals, Biomedical Research Division, Center for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology (CIGB), Havana 10600, Cuba.', 'Molecular Oncology Group, Department of Pharmaceuticals, Biomedical Research Division, Center for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology (CIGB), Havana 10600, Cuba.', 'Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, Proteomics Group, Department of System Biology, Biomedical Research Division, CIGB, Havana 10600, Cuba.', 'Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, Proteomics Group, Department of System Biology, Biomedical Research Division, CIGB, Havana 10600, Cuba.', 'Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, Proteomics Group, Department of System Biology, Biomedical Research Division, CIGB, Havana 10600, Cuba.', 'Pharmacogenomic Group, Department of System Biology, Biomedical Research Division, CIGB, Havana 10600, Cuba.', 'Molecular Oncology Group, Department of Pharmaceuticals, Biomedical Research Division, Center for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology (CIGB), Havana 10600, Cuba.', 'Molecular Oncology Group, Department of Pharmaceuticals, Biomedical Research Division, Center for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology (CIGB), Havana 10600, Cuba.', 'Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, Proteomics Group, Department of System Biology, Biomedical Research Division, CIGB, Havana 10600, Cuba.', 'Biochemical Proteomics Group, Department of Proteomics and Signal Transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, 82152 Munich, Germany.', 'Biochemical Proteomics Group, Department of Proteomics and Signal Transduction, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, 82152 Munich, Germany.', 'China-Cuba Biotechnology Joint Innovation Center (CCBJIC), Yongzhou Zhong Gu Biotechnology, Yongzhou City 425000, China.', 'Molecular Oncology Group, Department of Pharmaceuticals, Biomedical Research Division, Center for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology (CIGB), Havana 10600, Cuba.', 'China-Cuba Biotechnology Joint Innovation Center (CCBJIC), Yongzhou Zhong Gu Biotechnology, Yongzhou City 425000, China.', 'Molecular Oncology Group, Department of Pharmaceuticals, Biomedical Research Division, Center for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology (CIGB), Havana 10600, Cuba.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1920-0064', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8527-8930', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5791-604X']",['eng'],"['01DN18015/German Ministry of Education and Science', '2020WK2031/The Science and Technology Innovation Program of Hunan Province']",['Journal Article'],20210701,Switzerland,Biomedicines,Biomedicines,101691304,,,,PMC8301452,['NOTNLM'],"['CIGB-300', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'phosphoproteomics', 'protein kinase CK2']",2021/08/07 06:00,2021/08/07 06:01,['2021/08/06 12:21'],"['2021/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/06 12:21 [entrez]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:01 [medline]']","['biomedicines9070766 [pii]', '10.3390/biomedicines9070766 [doi]']",epublish,Biomedicines. 2021 Jul 1;9(7). pii: biomedicines9070766. doi: 10.3390/biomedicines9070766.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the biological activities of a lectin protein isolated from the eggs of Sea hare (Aplysia kurodai) were evaluated. The 40 kDa Aplysia kurodai egg lectin (or AKL-40) binds to D-galacturonic acid and D-galactose sugars similar to previously purified isotypes with various molecular weights (32/30 and 16 kDa). The N-terminal sequence of AKL-40 was similar to other sea hare egg lectins. The lectin was shown to be moderately toxic to brine shrimp nauplii, with an LC50 value of 63.63 microg/mL. It agglutinated Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells and reduced their growth, up to 58.3% in vivo when injected into Swiss albino mice at a rate of 2 mg/kg/day. The morphology of these cells apparently changed due to AKL-40, while the expression of apoptosis-related genes (p53, Bax, and Bcl-XL) suggested a possible apoptotic pathway of cell death. AKL-40 also inhibited the growth of human erythroleukemia cells, probably via activating the MAPK/ERK pathway, but did not affect human B-lymphoma cells (Raji) or rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-1). In vitro, lectin suppressed the growth of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma and U937 cells by 37.9% and 31.8%, respectively. Along with strong antifungal activity against Talaromyces verruculosus, AKL showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella sonnei, and Bacillus cereus whereas the growth of Escherichia coli was not affected by the lectin. This study explores the antiproliferative and antimicrobial potentials of AKL as well as its involvement in embryo defense of sea hare.","['Swarna, Rubaiya Rafique', 'Asaduzzaman, A K M', 'Kabir, Syed Rashel', 'Arfin, Nawshin', 'Kawsar, Sarkar M A', 'Rajia, Sultana', 'Fujii, Yuki', 'Ogawa, Yukiko', 'Hirashima, Keisuke', 'Kobayashi, Nanae', 'Yamada, Masao', 'Ozeki, Yasuhiro', 'Hasan, Imtiaj']","['Swarna RR', 'Asaduzzaman AKM', 'Kabir SR', 'Arfin N', 'Kawsar SMA', 'Rajia S', 'Fujii Y', 'Ogawa Y', 'Hirashima K', 'Kobayashi N', 'Yamada M', 'Ozeki Y', 'Hasan I']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Rajshahi, Rajshahi 6205, Bangladesh.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Rajshahi, Rajshahi 6205, Bangladesh.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Rajshahi, Rajshahi 6205, Bangladesh.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Rajshahi, Rajshahi 6205, Bangladesh.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Chittagong, Chittagong 4331, Bangladesh.', 'Center for Interdisciplinary Research, Varendra University, Rajshahi 6204, Bangladesh.', 'School of Science, Yokohama City University, 22-2 Seto, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama 236-0027, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagasaki International University, 2825-7, Huis Ten Bosch-cho, Sasebo, Nagasaki 859-3298, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagasaki International University, 2825-7, Huis Ten Bosch-cho, Sasebo, Nagasaki 859-3298, Japan.', 'School of Science, Yokohama City University, 22-2 Seto, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama 236-0027, Japan.', 'School of Science, Yokohama City University, 22-2 Seto, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama 236-0027, Japan.', 'School of Medicine, Yokohama City University, 3-9, Fukuura, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama 236-0004, Japan.', 'School of Science, Yokohama City University, 22-2 Seto, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama 236-0027, Japan.', 'School of Science, Yokohama City University, 22-2 Seto, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama 236-0027, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Rajshahi, Rajshahi 6205, Bangladesh.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9182-3456', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5708-014X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7964-9117', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6408-9620', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2782-6158', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4715-9022']",['eng'],['JP19K06239/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science'],['Journal Article'],20210714,Switzerland,Mar Drugs,Marine drugs,101213729,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Lectins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', '*Aplysia', 'Aquatic Organisms', 'Eggs', 'Escherichia coli/drug effects', 'Lectins/*pharmacology', 'Staphylococcus aureus/drug effects']",PMC8306185,['NOTNLM'],"['Aplysia kurodai', 'Ehrlich ascites carcinoma', 'antibacterial activity', 'anticancer activity', 'antifungal activity', 'apoptosis', 'lectin']",2021/08/07 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/08/06 12:21'],"['2021/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/06 12:21 [entrez]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['md19070394 [pii]', '10.3390/md19070394 [doi]']",epublish,Mar Drugs. 2021 Jul 14;19(7). pii: md19070394. doi: 10.3390/md19070394.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An interesting feature of this enzyme comes from its regulation mechanism, which involves its binding to an activating dimer before it can be catalytically functional. Once the trimer is formed, the reaction mechanism proceeds through the deprotonation of the lysine followed by the methyl-transfer reaction. Here we present a detailed exploration of the activation mechanism through a QM/MM approach focusing on both steps of the reaction, aiming to provide new insights into the deprotonation process and the role of the catalytic machinery in the methyl-transfer reaction. Our finding suggests that the source of the activation mechanism comes from conformational restriction mediated by the formation of a network of salt-bridges between MLL3 and one of the activating subunits, which restricts and stabilizes the positioning of several residues relevant for the catalysis. New insights into the deprotonation mechanism of lysine are provided, identifying a valine residue as crucial in the positioning of the water molecule in charge of the process. Finally, a tyrosine residue was found to assist the methyl transfer from SAM to the target lysine.","['Miranda-Rojas, Sebastian', 'Blanco-Esperguez, Kevin', 'Tunon, Inaki', 'Kastner, Johannes', 'Mendizabal, Fernando']","['Miranda-Rojas S', 'Blanco-Esperguez K', 'Tunon I', 'Kastner J', 'Mendizabal F']","['Departamento de Ciencias Quimicas, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, Universidad Andres Bello, Republica 275, Santiago 8370146, Chile.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Quimicas, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, Universidad Andres Bello, Republica 275, Santiago 8370146, Chile.', 'Departamento de Quimica Fisica, Universidad de Valencia, 46100 Burjasot, Spain.', 'Institut fur Theoretische Chemie, Universitat Stuttgart, Pfaffenwaldring 55, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Departamento de Quimica, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Chile, P.O.

However, it is unclear the expression level of RIG-G gene in the peripheral blood of healthy subjects and patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL or AML-M3). In the present study, we established the TaqMan-MGB fluorescent probe qPCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction) method for the first time to detect the expression of RIG-G gene in APL. Twenty APL patients were selected, and their RIG-G expression levels were quantified to assess the correlation between the expression of peripheral blood and bone marrow samples. U test was used to analyze the expression level of RIG-G in the peripheral blood of 40 normal specimens and 20 APL patients to observe the prognostic monitoring effect of RIG-G gene in the ATRA treatment process. ROC (receiver operating characteristic curve) was used to analyze and test the diagnostic efficiency of RIG-G gene for APL patients. There is a strong positive correlation between the expression of RIG-G in peripheral blood and bone marrow of APL patients. The expression level of RIG-G in peripheral blood of APL patients is significantly lower than that in healthy controls (p < 0.001). The changes in the expression level of RIG-G in peripheral blood changed indicates the remission and recurrence of APL patients after ATRA treatment, and the ROC curve shows that it has a better diagnostic power for APL. In summary, the TaqMan-MGB real-time PCR method we have established has successfully run. The detection of RIG-G gene expression in peripheral blood can effectively monitor the disease changes of APL patients and avoid harmful bone marrow puncture injury.","['Wang, Fei', 'Tian, Jiale', 'Pang, Li', 'Wu, Junlu', 'Shang, Anquan', 'Sun, Zujun', 'Li, Dong', 'Yan, Jinsong', 'Quan, Wenqiang']","['Wang F', 'Tian J', 'Pang L', 'Wu J', 'Shang A', 'Sun Z', 'Li D', 'Yan J', 'Quan W']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Shanghai Tongji Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai 200065, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Shanghai Tongji Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai 200065, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Shanghai Tongji Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai 200065, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Shanghai Tongji Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai 200065, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Shanghai Tongji Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai 200065, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Shanghai Tongji Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai 200065, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Shanghai Tongji Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai 200065, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Liaoning Medical Center for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Dalian Key Laboratory of Hematology, Liaoning Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Translational Medicine, Dalian 116027, China.', 'Diamond Bay Institute of Hematology, Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116027, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Shanghai Tongji Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai 200065, China.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4109-2602', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8243-8078']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210702,Switzerland,Genes (Basel),Genes,101551097,,IM,,PMC8307143,['NOTNLM'],"['*RIG-G gene', '*acute promyelocytic leukemia', '*real-time polymerase chain reaction']",2021/08/07 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2021/08/06 12:18'],"['2021/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/06 12:18 [entrez]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['genes12071035 [pii]', '10.3390/genes12071035 [doi]']",epublish,Genes (Basel). 2021 Jul 2;12(7). pii: genes12071035. doi: 10.3390/genes12071035.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, we show that cellular stress activates PI3K/Akt-dependent survival pathways in B-ALL, exposing their vulnerability to PI3Kdelta and pan-PI3Ki. The addition of a brief course of copanlisib to chemotherapy delivered the combined benefits of increased survival, decreased systemic disease, and reduced CNS metastasis. These data suggest the promising, multifaceted potential of pan-PI3Ki for B-ALL CNS prophylaxis, systemic disease control, and chemosensitization.","['Ridge, Sarah M', 'Whiteley, Andrew E', 'Yao, Hisayuki', 'Price, Trevor T', 'Brockman, Maegan L', 'Murray, Andrew S', 'Simon, Brennan G', 'Islam, Prioty', 'Sipkins, Dorothy A']","['Ridge SM', 'Whiteley AE', 'Yao H', 'Price TT', 'Brockman ML', 'Murray AS', 'Simon BG', 'Islam P', 'Sipkins DA']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0165-8395'],['eng'],['R01 CA234580/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210806,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Animals', '*Central Nervous System Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC8722463,['NOTNLM'],"['*CNS relapse', '*PI3K inhibition', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*chemosensitization', '*microenvironment']",2021/08/07 06:00,2021/11/03 06:00,['2021/08/06 08:42'],"['2021/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/03 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/06 08:42 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2021.1929963 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2021 Nov;62(11):2690-2702. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2021.1929963.

In the present study, a clinically achievable concentration of trametinib, a highly selective inhibitor of MEK, enhanced ATRA-induced differentiation in AML cell lines, HL-60 and U937 as well as AML primary cells. Moreover, trametinib-ATRA (tra-ATRA) co-treatment restored ATRA sensitivity in ATRA-resistant AML cell line, HL-60Res. The protein level of STAT3 and the phosphorylation of Akt or JNK were enhanced with tra-ATRA treatment in HL-60, U937, and HL-60Res cells, respectively. Furthermore, tra-ATRA-induced differentiation in HL-60, U937, and HL-60Res cells was inhibited by STAT3, PI3K, and JNK inhibitors, respectively. Therefore, STAT3, Akt, and JNK signaling pathways were involved in tra-ATRA-induced differentiation in HL-60, U937, and HL-60Res cells, respectively.

Studies have shown that shift work could disrupt the melatonin secretion and eventually increase leukaemia incidence risk. Melatonin, a pineal hormone, has shown promising oncostatic properties on a wide range of cancers, including leukaemia. We first reviewed the relationship between shift work and the incidence rate of leukaemia and then discussed the role of melatonin receptors (MT1 and MT2) and their functions in leukaemia. Moreover, the connection between inflammation and leukaemia, and melatonin-induced anti-leukaemia mechanisms including anti-proliferation, apoptosis induction and immunomodulation are comprehensively discussed. Apart from that, the synergistic effects of melatonin with other anticancer compounds are also included. In short, this review article has compiled the evidence of anti-leukaemia properties displayed by melatonin and discuss its potential to act as adjunct for anti-leukaemia treatment. This review may serve as a reference for future studies or experimental research to explore the possibility of melatonin serving as a novel therapeutic agent for leukaemia.","['Ng, Ming Guan', 'Ng, Khuen Yen', 'Koh, Rhun Yian', 'Chye, Soi Moi']","['Ng MG', 'Ng KY', 'Koh RY', 'Chye SM']","['School of Health Science, International Medical University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'School of Pharmacy, Monash University Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Division of Biomedical Science and Biotechnology, School of Health Science, International Medical University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Division of Biomedical Science and Biotechnology, School of Health Science, International Medical University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210806,Germany,Horm Mol Biol Clin Investig,Hormone molecular biology and clinical investigation,101538885,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['leukaemia', 'melatonin', 'therapeutic actions']",2021/08/07 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2021/08/06 07:17'],"['2021/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/06 07:17 [entrez]']","['hmbci-2021-0009 [pii]', '10.1515/hmbci-2021-0009 [doi]']",epublish,Horm Mol Biol Clin Investig. 2021 Aug 6;42(4):445-461. doi: 10.1515/hmbci-2021-0009.,445-461,"['(c) 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, 2614 patients with ATL were diagnosed based on the registries, and 117 departments registered 1042 patients. Among these patients, 984 were eligible for analysis. The median age at diagnosis was 69 y. A larger proportion of patients with ATL older than 70 y was diagnosed with the lymphoma subtype, and more than half of the patients with ATL in the metropolitan areas were born in the human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1)-endemic areas of Kyushu/Okinawa, which are almost identical to the findings in our 2010-2011 study. Additionally, we identified that patients with ATL migrated from the endemic areas for HTLV-1 to the non-endemic metropolitan areas. The present study was able to reduce the burden of searching each hospital and to update the clinico-epidemiological characteristics of a large number of patients with ATL in Japan, suggesting the usefulness and feasibility of the novel data collection method.

We aimed to identify the effects of levofloxacin prophylaxis, given to paediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia to prevent infections during induction chemotherapy, on antibiotic resistance in gastrointestinal microbiota after completion of induction and consolidation therapy. Methods: This prospective, single-centre (St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA) cohort study included children (</=18 years) receiving therapy for newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and who received either primary levofloxacin prophylaxis or no antibacterial prophylaxis (aside from Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) and provided at least two stool samples, including one after completion of induction therapy. We used metagenomic sequencing to identify bacterial genes that confer resistance to fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or other antibiotics, and to identify point mutations in bacterial topoisomerases (gyrA, parC) that confer resistance to fluoroquinolones. We then used generalised linear mixed models to compare the prevalence and relative abundance of antibiotic resistance gene groups after completion of induction and consolidation therapy between participants who had received levofloxacin and those who received no prophylaxis. Findings: Between Feb 1, 2012, and April 30, 2016, 118 stool samples (32 baseline, 49 after induction, and 37 after consolidation) were collected from 49 evaluable participants; of these participants, 31 (63%) received levofloxacin prophylaxis during induction therapy and 18 (37%) received no antibacterial prophylaxis. Over the course of induction therapy, there was an overall increase in the relative abundance of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance genes (estimated mean fold change 5.9, 95% CI 3.6-9.6; p<0.0001), which was not modified by levofloxacin prophylaxis (p=0.46). By contrast, the prevalence of topoisomerase point mutations increased over the course of induction therapy in levofloxacin recipients (mean prevalence 10.4% [95% CI 3.2-25.4] after induction therapy vs 3.7% [0.2-22.5] at baseline) but not other participants (0% vs 0%; p<0.0001). There was no significant difference between prophylaxis groups with respect to changes in aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, vancomycin, or multidrug resistance genes after completion of induction or consolidation therapy. Interpretation: Analysing the gastrointestinal resistome can provide insights into the effects of antibiotics on the risk of antibiotic-resistant infections. In this study, antibiotic prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or levofloxacin during induction therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia appeared to increase the short-term and medium-term risk of colonisation with bacteria resistant to these antibiotics, but not to other drugs. More research is needed to determine the longer-term effects of antibacterial prophylaxis on colonisation with antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been widely explored in cancer tumorigenesis. However, their roles in CML remain largely unclear. Methods: The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and CML cell lines (K562, KCL22, MEG01, BV173) were collected for in vitro research. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the mRNA expression levels. Cell viability and apoptosis were analyzed by cell counting kit 8 and flow cytometry assays. The targeting relationships were predicted using Starbase and TargetScan and ulteriorly verified by RNA pull-down and luciferase reporter assays. Western blotting assay was performed to assess the protein expressions. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification sites were predicted by SRAMP and confirmed by Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) assay. Results: LncRNA nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) expression levels were decreased in the CML cell lines and PBMCs of CML patients. Moreover, METTL3-mediated m6A modification induced the aberrant expression of NEAT1 in CML. Overexpression of NEAT1 inhibited cell viability and promoted the apoptosis of CML cells. Additionally, miR-766-5p was upregulated in CML PBMCs and abrogated the effects of NEAT1 on cell viability and apoptosis of the CML cells. Further, CDKN1A was proved to be the target gene of miR-766-5p and was downregulated in the CML PBMCs. Knockdown of CDKN1A reversed the effects of NEAT1. Conclusion: The current research elucidates a novel METTL3/NEAT1/miR-766-5p/CDKN1A axis which plays a critical role in the progression of CML.","['Yao, Fang-Yi', 'Zhao, Cui', 'Zhong, Fang-Min', 'Qin, Ting-Yu', 'Wen, Fang', 'Li, Mei-Yong', 'Liu, Jing', 'Huang, Bo', 'Wang, Xiao-Zhong']","['Yao FY', 'Zhao C', 'Zhong FM', 'Qin TY', 'Wen F', 'Li MY', 'Liu J', 'Huang B', 'Wang XZ']","['Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210720,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC8329653,['NOTNLM'],"['CDKN1A', 'METTL3', 'N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification', 'NEAT1', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'miR-766-5p']",2021/08/07 06:00,2021/08/07 06:01,['2021/08/06 06:54'],"['2021/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/06 06:54 [entrez]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.679634 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Jul 20;11:679634. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.679634. eCollection 2021.,679634,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Yao, Zhao, Zhong, Qin, Wen, Li, Liu, Huang and Wang.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike conventional anticancer drugs, D-All targets glucose metabolism and is non-toxic to normal cells. Therefore, it has attracted attention as a unique ""seed"" compound for anticancer agents. However, the anti-proliferative activities of the other rare aldohexoses have not been examined yet. In this study, we evaluated the anti-proliferative activity of rare aldohexoses against human leukemia MOLT-4F and human prostate cancer DU-145 cell lines. We found that D-All and D-idose (D-Ido) at 5 mM inhibited cell proliferation of MOLT-4F cells by 46 % and 60 %, respectively. On the other hand, the rare aldohexoses at 5 mM did not show specific anti-proliferative activity against DU-145 cells. To explore the structure-activity relationship of D-Ido, we evaluated the anti-proliferative activity of D-sorbose (D-Sor), 6-deoxy-D-Ido, and L-xylose (L-Xyl) against MOLT-4F cells and found that D-Sor, 6-deoxy-D-Ido, and L-Xyl showed no inhibitory activity at 5 mM, suggesting that the aldose structure and the C-6 hydroxy group of D-Ido are important for its activity. Cellular glucose uptake assay and western blotting analysis of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) expression suggested that the anti-proliferative activity of D-Ido is induced by inhibition of glucose uptake via TXNIP-independent pathway.","['Ishiyama, Hironobu', 'Yanagita, Ryo C', 'Takemoto, Kazune', 'Kitaguchi, Natsumi', 'Uezato, Yuuki', 'Sugiyama, Yasunori', 'Sato, Masashi', 'Kawanami, Yasuhiro']","['Ishiyama H', 'Yanagita RC', 'Takemoto K', 'Kitaguchi N', 'Uezato Y', 'Sugiyama Y', 'Sato M', 'Kawanami Y']","['1 Department of Applied Bioresource Science, The United Graduate School of Agricultural Sciences, Ehime University.', '2 Department of Applied Biological Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Kagawa University.', '3 Division of Applied Bioresource Science, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kagawa University.', '3 Division of Applied Bioresource Science, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kagawa University.', '3 Division of Applied Bioresource Science, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kagawa University.', '2 Department of Applied Biological Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Kagawa University.', '2 Department of Applied Biological Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Kagawa University.', '2 Department of Applied Biological Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Kagawa University.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200903,Japan,J Appl Glycosci (1999),Journal of applied glycoscience,101167786,,,,PMC8132072,['NOTNLM'],"['D-idose', 'anti-proliferative activity', 'leukemia', 'rare sugar']",2021/08/07 06:00,2021/08/07 06:01,['2021/08/06 06:48'],"['2020/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/06 06:48 [entrez]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5458/jag.jag.JAG-2020_0006 [doi]'],epublish,J Appl Glycosci (1999). 2020 Sep 3;67(3):95-101. doi: 10.5458/jag.jag.JAG-2020_0006. eCollection 2020.,95-101,['2020 by The Japanese Society of Applied Glycoscience.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We cloned all four of the resulting fusion genes (MLL-AF6, AF6-MLL, exMLL-AF6, AF6-shMLL) and subsequently transfected them to generate stable cell culture models. Their molecular function was tested by inducing gene expression for 48 h in a Doxycycline-dependent fashion. Here, we present our results upon differential gene expression (DGE) that were obtained by the ""Massive Analyses of cDNA Ends"" (MACE-Seq) technology, an established 3'-end based RNA-Seq method. Our results indicate that the PHD/BD domain, present in the AF6-MLL and the exMLL-AF6 fusion protein, is responsible for chromatin activation in a genome-wide fashion. This led to strong deregulation of transcriptional processes involving protein-coding genes, pseudogenes, non-annotated genes, and RNA genes, e.g., LincRNAs and microRNAs, respectively. While cooperation between the MLL-AF6 and AF6-MLL fusion proteins appears to be required for the above-mentioned effects, exMLL-AF6 is able to cause similar effects on its own. The exMLL-AF6/AF6-shMLL co-expressing cell line displayed the induction of a myeloid-specific and a T-cell specific gene signature, which may explain the T-ALL disease phenotype observed in patients with such breakpoints. This again demonstrated that MLL fusion proteins are instructive and allow to study their pathomolecular mechanisms.","['Kundu, Arpita', 'Kowarz, Eric', 'Marschalek, Rolf']","['Kundu A', 'Kowarz E', 'Marschalek R']","['Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology/DCAL, Goethe-University of Frankfurt, Biocenter, Max-von-Laue-Str. 9, D-60438, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology/DCAL, Goethe-University of Frankfurt, Biocenter, Max-von-Laue-Str. 9, D-60438, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology/DCAL, Goethe-University of Frankfurt, Biocenter, Max-von-Laue-Str. 9, D-60438, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.

Effective treatments for IC are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potency of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) in an IC-induced rat model and investigate the potential molecular mechanism in a mast cell model (rat basophilic leukemia cells, RBL-2H3) in treating IC in a coculture system. MATERIAL AND METHODS The rat model of IC was induced by cyclophosphamide (CYP). Rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: sham, IC+PBS, and IC+MSC. In the coculture system, RBL-2H3 cells were sensitized overnight to Compound 48/80 (C48/80), cocultured with UC-MSCs for 3 days, and collected for subsequent experiments. RBL-2H3 cells were randomly divided into 3 groups: sham, C48, and UC-MSCs (C48+MSC). RESULTS The UC-MSCs marked by thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) were transplanted in the treatment group, and were densely distributed in the bladder. Accordingly, the conscious cystometry was measured and the bladder tissues were harvested. Compared with the sham group, the treated IC rats exhibited shorter bladder voiding intervals (307+/-35 vs 217+/-37 s; P<0.01), more integral epithelia, and less collagen fiber aggregation, infiltration and degranulation of mast cells, and inflammatory cytokines in the bladder tissue. In the coculture system, compared with the C48 group, the UC-MSC-treated RBL-2H3 cells had suppressed degranulation. CONCLUSIONS UC-MSCs treatment showed a promising therapeutic effect on treating IC in vivo and in vitro. UC-MSCs inhibit mast cell degranulation in IC and could be a potential therapeutic target to ameliorate inflammation in IC.","['Xu, Yuancheng', 'Yang, Fei', 'Xie, Juncong', 'Li, Wenbiao', 'Liu, Bolong', 'Chen, Jialiang', 'Ding, Honglu', 'Cai, Jiarong']","['Xu Y', 'Yang F', 'Xie J', 'Li W', 'Liu B', 'Chen J', 'Ding H', 'Cai J']","['Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (mainland).', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (mainland).', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (mainland).', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (mainland).', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (mainland).', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (mainland).', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (mainland).', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (mainland).']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210806,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (Cytokines)', '4091-50-3 (p-Methoxy-N-methylphenethylamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques/methods', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', '*Cystitis, Interstitial/immunology/therapy', 'Cytokines/analysis', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Umbilical Cord/*cytology', '*Urinary Bladder/immunology/pathology/physiopathology', 'Urination/immunology', 'p-Methoxy-N-methylphenethylamine/*pharmacology']",PMC8353995,,,2021/08/07 06:00,2022/01/04 06:00,['2021/08/06 05:54'],"['2021/08/06 05:54 [entrez]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['930001 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.930001 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2021 Aug 6;27:e930001. doi: 10.12659/MSM.930001.,e930001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zebrafish terc harboring the CR4-CR5 domain mutation found in DC patients hardly interacted with Pol II and failed to regulate myeloid gene expression in vivo and to increase their transcription rates in vitro. Similarly, TERC regulated myeloid gene expression and Pol II promoter occupancy in human myeloid progenitor cells. Strikingly, induced pluripotent stem cells derived from DC patients with a TERC mutation in the CR4-CR5 domain showed impaired myelopoiesis, while those with mutated telomerase catalytic subunit differentiated normally.

METHODS: A pooled analysis of 137 patients from these trials (ELIANA: n=79; ENSIGN: n=58) was performed to provide a comprehensive safety profile for tisagenlecleucel. RESULTS: Grade 3/4 tisagenlecleucel-related adverse events (AEs) were reported in 77% of patients. Specific AEs of interest that occurred </=8 weeks postinfusion included cytokine-release syndrome (CRS; 79% (grade 4: 22%)), infections (42%; grade 3/4: 19%), prolonged (not resolved by day 28) cytopenias (40%; grade 3/4: 34%), neurologic events (36%; grade 3: 10%; no grade 4 events), and tumor lysis syndrome (4%; all grade 3). Treatment for CRS included tocilizumab (40%) and corticosteroids (23%). The frequency of neurologic events increased with CRS severity (p<0.001). Median time to resolution of grade 3/4 cytopenias to grade </=2 was 2.0 (95% CI 1.87 to 2.23) months for neutropenia, 2.4 (95% CI 1.97 to 3.68) months for lymphopenia, 2.0 (95% CI 1.87 to 2.27) months for leukopenia, 1.9 (95% CI 1.74 to 2.10) months for thrombocytopenia, and 1.0 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.87) month for anemia. All patients who achieved complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete hematologic recovery experienced B cell aplasia; however, as nearly all responders also received immunoglobulin replacement, few grade 3/4 infections occurred >1 year postinfusion. CONCLUSIONS: This pooled analysis provides a detailed safety profile for tisagenlecleucel during the course of clinical trials, and AE management guidance, with a longer follow-up duration compared with previous reports.","['Levine, John E', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'Pulsipher, Michael A', 'Dietz, Andrew C', 'Rives, Susana', 'Myers, G Douglas', 'August, Keith J', 'Verneris, Michael R', 'Buechner, Jochen', 'Laetsch, Theodore W', 'Bittencourt, Henrique', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Boyer, Michael W', 'De Moerloose, Barbara', 'Qayed, Muna', 'Davies, Stella M', 'Phillips, Christine L', 'Driscoll, Timothy A', 'Bader, Peter', 'Schlis, Krysta', 'Wood, Patricia A', 'Mody, Rajen', 'Yi, Lan', 'Leung, Mimi', 'Eldjerou, Lamis K', 'June, Carl H', 'Maude, Shannon L']","['Levine JE', 'Grupp SA', 'Pulsipher MA', 'Dietz AC', 'Rives S', 'Myers GD', 'August KJ', 'Verneris MR', 'Buechner J', 'Laetsch TW', 'Bittencourt H', 'Baruchel A', 'Boyer MW', 'De Moerloose B', 'Qayed M', 'Davies SM', 'Phillips CL', 'Driscoll TA', 'Bader P', 'Schlis K', 'Wood PA', 'Mody R', 'Yi L', 'Leung M', 'Eldjerou LK', 'June CH', 'Maude SL']","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', ""Division of Oncology, Center for Childhood Cancer Research and Cancer Immunotherapy Program, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", ""Section of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, Children's Hospital Los Angeles Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California, USA."", ""Section of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, Children's Hospital Los Angeles Cancer and Blood Disease Institute, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California, USA."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hospital Sant Joan de Deu de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institut de Recerca Sant Joan de Deu, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Children's Mercy Hospital Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri, USA."", ""Children's Mercy Hospital Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri, USA."", 'Division of Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', ""Department of BMT and Cellular Therapy, Children's Hospital Colorado, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, USA."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', ""Division of Oncology, Center for Childhood Cancer Research and Cancer Immunotherapy Program, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Harold C.

However, poor clinical trials warrant the search for new potent DHODH inhibitors. Herein we present a novel DHODH inhibitor SBL-105 effective against myeloid leukemia. Chemical characteristics were identified by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and Mass-spectroscopy. Virtual docking and molecular dynamic simulation analysis were performed using the automated protocol with AutoDock -VINA, GROMACS program. Human-recombinant (rh) DHODH was used for enzyme inhibition study. THP-1, TF-1, HL-60 and SKM-1 cell lines were used. MTT assay was used to assess cell viability. Flow cytometry was employed for cell cycle, apoptosis, and differentiation analysis. Chemical analysis identified the compound to be 3-benzylidene-6,7-benz-chroman-4-one (SBL-105). The compound showed high binding efficacy towards DHODH with a DeltaGbinding score of -10.9 kcal/mol. Trajectory analysis indicated conserved interactions of SBL-105-DHODH to be stable throughout the 200ns simulation. SBL-105 inhibited rh DHODH with an IC50 value of 48.48 nM. The GI50 values of SBL-105 in controlling THP-1, TF-1, HL-60 and SKM-1 cell proliferations were 60.66 nM 45.33 nM, 73.98 nM and 86.01 nM respectively. A dose-dependent increase in S-phase cell cycle arrest and total apoptosis was observed by SBL-105 treatment in both cell types, which were reversed in the presence of uridine. The compound also increased the differentiation marker CD11b positive populations in both THP-1 and TF-1 cells, which were decreased under uridine influence. SBL-105, a novel DHODH inhibitor, identified using computational and in vitro analysis, was effective controlled AML cells and needs attention for further preclinical developments.","['Kamli, Hossam', 'Zaman, Gaffar S', 'Shaikh, Ahmad', 'Mobarki, Abdullah A', 'Rajagopalan, Prasanna']","['Kamli H', 'Zaman GS', 'Shaikh A', 'Mobarki AA', 'Rajagopalan P']",,,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210805,United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,,IM,,,,,2021/08/07 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2021/08/06 05:39'],"['2021/08/06 05:39 [entrez]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3727/096504021X16281573507558 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Oncol Res. 2021 Aug 5. doi: 10.3727/096504021X16281573507558.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: combinations of terms of ""acute myeloid leukemia"", ""fludara"", ""cytarabine"", ""cladribine"", ""aclacinomycin"", ""granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)"", and ""hyaluronic acid"" were searched in Chinese databases. ""acute myelogenous leukemia"", ""fludara"", ""cytarabine"", ""cladribine"", ""aclacinomycin"", ""granulocyte colony-stimulating factor"", and ""hyaluronic acid"" were searched in English databases. Review Manager 5.3 was employed for the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Ultimately, 12 articles were included. Most of the articles had a low-risk bias, and were of medium or high quality. The complete remission rates were tested for heterogeneity [chi-square test (Chi2) =4.10, degrees of freedom (df)=10, I2=0%; P=0.94]. The fixed effect model analysis showed that the difference between experimental participants and controls was considerable [Z=13.15, odds ratio (OR) =12.82, 95% confidence interval (CI): (8.77, 18.76); P<0.01]. The overall effective rates were tested for heterogeneity (Chi2=1.58, df=7, I2=0%; P=0.98), and difference between experimental participants and controls was considerable [Z=10.70, OR =1.32, 95% CI: (7.32,17.89); P<0.01]. The overall adverse reaction rates were tested for heterogeneity (Chi2=0.42, df=5, I2=0%; P=0.99), and the difference between experimental participants and controls was considerable [Z=5.00, OR =0.38, 95% CI: (0.26, 0.55); P<0.01].

METHODS: literatures were searched with ""Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation"", ""killer cell"", ""leukemia"", ""Cytokine induction"", etc. as search terms using Boolean logic search. Review Manager was utilized for meta-analysis after literature screening. RESULTS: eleven literatures were included, most of which were of low-risk bias (medium-high quality). Through meta-analysis, statistical heterogeneity was found in non-recurring mortality (NRM) between control group and experimental group (Chi2 =15.69, I2=62%, P=0.02). The leukemia-free survival rate between two groups was not heterogeneous (Chi2 =13.16, I2=32%, P=0.16), without considerable difference between groups (Z=1.52, P=0.13). The incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) between the two groups was statistically heterogeneous (Chi2 =21.38, I2=67%, P=0.003). The incidence of graft-versus-host disease in experimental group was greatly inferior to controls (Z=3.87, P=0.0001). DISCUSSION: hematopoietic stem cell transplantation combined with killer cells can effectively reduce the incidence of GvHD after stem cell transplantation in patients. The prognosis of transplantation was good, and it had no obvious effect on the overall survival rate and recurrence rate.","['Zhang, Yunjie', 'Song, Yanping', 'Ni, Qingren', 'Li, Guang', 'Dai, Jinqian', 'Zhang, Menyun', 'Xie, Jia']","['Zhang Y', 'Song Y', 'Ni Q', 'Li G', 'Dai J', 'Zhang M', 'Xie J']","[""Institute of Hematology, Xi'an Jiaotong University Affiliated to Xi'an Central Hospital, Xi'an, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Xi'an Jiaotong University Affiliated to Xi'an Central Hospital, Xi'an, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Xi'an Jiaotong University Affiliated to Xi'an Central Hospital, Xi'an, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Xi'an Jiaotong University Affiliated to Xi'an Central Hospital, Xi'an, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Xi'an Jiaotong University Affiliated to Xi'an Central Hospital, Xi'an, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Xi'an Jiaotong University Affiliated to Xi'an Central Hospital, Xi'an, China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Xi'an Jiaotong University Affiliated to Xi'an Central Hospital, Xi'an, China.""]",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",,China,Ann Palliat Med,Annals of palliative medicine,101585484,,IM,"['*Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Leukemia/therapy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)', 'killer cells', 'leukemia']",2021/08/07 06:00,2021/08/10 06:00,['2021/08/06 05:27'],"['2021/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/06 05:27 [entrez]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.21037/apm-21-1359 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Palliat Med. 2021 Jul;10(7):7872-7883. doi: 10.21037/apm-21-1359.,7872-7883,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then, this study aimed to determine the inhibitory effects of this peptide on cancer immune escape by coculturing improving cytokine-induced killer (ICIK) cells with cancer cells. Materials and Methods: nABP284 that binds to PD-1 was identified by phage display technology in our previous study. AutoDock and PyMOL were used to optimize the sequence of nABP284 to design a new peptide (nABPD1). Immunofluorescence was used to demonstrate that the peptides bound to PD-1. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used to measure the binding affinity of the peptides. The blocking effect of the peptides on PD-1 was evaluated by a neutralization experiment with human recombinant PD-L1 protein. The inhibition of activated lymphocytes by cancer cells was simulated by coculturing of human acute T lymphocytic leukemia cells (Jurkat T cells) with human tongue squamous cell carcinoma cells (Cal27 cells). The anticancer activities were determined by coculturing ICIK cells with Cal27 cells in vitro. Results: A high-affinity peptide (nABPD1, KD=11.9 nM) for PD-1 was obtained by optimizing the nABP284 peptide (KD=11.8 microM). nABPD1 showed better efficacy than nABP284 in terms of increasing the secretion of IL-2 by Jurkat T cells and enhancing the in vitro antitumor activity of ICIK cells. Conclusion: nABPD1 possesses higher affinity for PD-1 than nABP284, which significantly enhances its ability to block the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction and to increase ICIK cell-mediated antitumor activity by armoring ICIK cells.","['Chen, Yilei', 'Huang, Hongxing', 'Liu, Yin', 'Wang, Zhanghao', 'Wang, Lili', 'Wang, Quanxiao', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Wang, Hua']","['Chen Y', 'Huang H', 'Liu Y', 'Wang Z', 'Wang L', 'Wang Q', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang H']","['Departments Hospital of Stomatology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guanghua School of Stomatology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Departments Hospital of Stomatology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guanghua School of Stomatology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Departments Hospital of Stomatology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guanghua School of Stomatology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Departments Hospital of Stomatology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guanghua School of Stomatology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Departments Hospital of Stomatology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guanghua School of Stomatology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Departments Hospital of Stomatology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guanghua School of Stomatology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Departments Hospital of Stomatology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guanghua School of Stomatology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Departments Hospital of Stomatology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guanghua School of Stomatology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210803,Korea (South),Cancer Res Treat,Cancer research and treatment,101155137,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Affinity', 'Computer simulation', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunotherapy', 'Improving cytokine-induced killer (ICIK) cells', 'PD-1', 'Peptide optimization']",2021/08/07 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2021/08/06 02:53'],"['2021/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/06 02:53 [entrez]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['crt.2021.424 [pii]', '10.4143/crt.2021.424 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Cancer Res Treat. 2021 Aug 3. pii: crt.2021.424. doi: 10.4143/crt.2021.424.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Actively developing novel antibiotics and anticancer medicines is a priority. Natural pentacyclic triterpenoids have attracted wide attention due to their significant biological activities. In this study, a series of 1,2,3-triazolo fused triterpenoids (betulin, oleanolic acid and ursolic acid) were functionalized on the A-ring by an in-house developed multi-component triazolization reaction. The compounds were investigated for antitumoral activity in twelve cancer cell lines and were also tested for antibacterial activity against four bacteria. In terms of anticancer effects, compounds 5b-f and 8a-d displayed strong cytotoxic activity in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Capan-1), chronic myeloid leukemia (Hap-1), acute myeloid leukemia (HL-60), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Jurkat) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Rec-1) cell lines. Among them, compound 5f exhibited the most potent antiproliferative effect on HL-60 cells. Further pharmacological research confirmed that compound 5f caused mitochondrial dysfunction and arrested the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase to induce apoptosis of HL-60 cells. In addition, compound 5f also induced autophagy to inhibit the proliferation of HL-60 cells. Antibacterial screening revealed that compounds 2a-g and 5a-d showed modest activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica) with especially compounds 2c and 2d being potent inhibitors of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica growth. Because of their promising anticancer and antibacterial activity, this series of compounds deserve further study.","['Wang, Rui', 'Li, Yang', 'Hu, Haibo', 'Persoons, Leentje', 'Daelemans, Dirk', 'De Jonghe, Steven', 'Luyten, Walter', 'Krasniqi, Besir', 'Dehaen, Wim']","['Wang R', 'Li Y', 'Hu H', 'Persoons L', 'Daelemans D', 'De Jonghe S', 'Luyten W', 'Krasniqi B', 'Dehaen W']","['Molecular Design and Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, KU Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F, B-3001, Leuven, Belgium.', ""Zhong Yuan Academy of Biological Medicine, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, 252000, PR China."", 'Department of Biology, Animal Physiology and Neurobiology Section, KU Leuven, Naamsestraat 59, Box 2465, B-3000, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, Herestraat 49 - Box 1043, B-3000, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, Herestraat 49 - Box 1043, B-3000, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, Herestraat 49 - Box 1043, B-3000, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Biology, Animal Physiology and Neurobiology Section, KU Leuven, Naamsestraat 59, Box 2465, B-3000, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Molecular Design and Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, KU Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F, B-3001, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Molecular Design and Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, KU Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F, B-3001, Leuven, Belgium.

Recent studies show that BAFF and BAFFR are also required for the survival of memory B cells, autoimmune B cells as well as malignant chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells. BAFFR cooperates with other receptors, notably the B cell antigen receptor (BCR), a process which is critical for the expansion of autoimmune and CLL cells. This crosstalk may be mediated by TRAF3 which interacts with BAFFR and with CD79A, a signalling subunit of the BCR and the downstream SYK kinase, inhibiting its activity. BAFF binding to BAFFR leads to degradation of TRAF3 which may relieve inhibition of SYK activity transducing signals to pathways required for B cell survival. BAFFR activates both canonical and non-canonical NF-kappaB signalling and both pathways play important roles in the survival of B cells and CLL cells.","['Schweighoffer, Edina', 'Tybulewicz, Victor Lj']","['Schweighoffer E', 'Tybulewicz VL']","['The Francis Crick Institute, London NW1 1AT, UK.', 'The Francis Crick Institute, London NW1 1AT, UK; Department of Immunology & Inflammation, Imperial College London, London W12 0NN, UK.

Researches have exhibited that the progression of CML is related to histone modifications. Here, we perform the systematic analyses of H3K36me3 patterns and gene expression level changes. We observe that the genes with higher gene-body H3K36me3 levels in normal cells show fewer expression changes during leukemogenesis, while the genes with lower gene-body H3K36me3 levels in normal cells yield obvious expression changes during leukemogenesis (rho = -0.98, P = 9.30 x 10(-8)). These findings are conserved in human lung/breast cancers and mouse CML, regardless of gene expression levels and gene lengths. Regulatory element analysis and Random Forest regression display that Hoxd13, Rara, Scl, Smad3, Smad4 and Tgif1 induce the up-regulation of genes with lower H3K36me3 levels (rho = 0.97, P = 2.35 x 10(-56)). Enrichment analysis shows that the differentially expressed genes with lower H3K36me3 levels are involved in leukemia-related pathways, such as leukocyte migration and regulation of leukocyte activation. Finally, six driver genes (Tp53, Wt1, Dnmt3a, Cacna1b, Phactr1 and Gbp4) with lower H3K36me3 levels are identified. Our analyses indicate that lower gene-body H3K36me3 levels may serve as a biomarker for the progression of CML.","['Zhang, Lu-Qiang', 'Liu, Jun-Jie', 'Liu, Li', 'Fan, Guo-Liang', 'Li, Yan-Nan', 'Li, Qian-Zhong']","['Zhang LQ', 'Liu JJ', 'Liu L', 'Fan GL', 'Li YN', 'Li QZ']","['Laboratory of Theoretical Biophysics, School oef Physical Science and Technology, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010021, China.

Other professionals such as greenspace workers are also extremely exposed, presenting specific exposure features (practices, types of pesticide used). The aim of this review was to summarize epidemiological literature that examine the relationship between pesticide exposure and the risk of cancer and long-term health effects in greenspace workers. METHOD: Six main groups of greenspace workers were identified and examined through a systematic literature review based on PubMed and Scopus. The studies were then grouped according to their design, health outcomes and the type of population studied. RESULTS: Forty-four articles were selected among the 1679 identified. Fifteen studies were conducted exclusively among greenspace workers, while ten also studied these workers with other pesticide applicators. Six were cohorts from the general population in which greenspace workers were identified. Elevated risks were found in several studies for leukaemia, soft-tissue sarcoma, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Parkinson's disease. DISCUSSION: The majority of studies used rough parameters for defining exposure such as job titles which could lead to the misclassification of exposure, with the risk of false or positive negative conclusions. Health outcomes were mainly collected through registries or death certificates, and information regarding potential confounders was often missing. CONCLUSION: The review identified only 15 studies conducted exclusively among greenspace workers. Elevated risk was found for several sites of cancer and Parkinson's diseases. Further epidemiological research is needed, conducted specifically on these workers, to better characterize this population, its exposure to pesticides and the related health effects.","['de Graaf, L', 'Boulanger, M', 'Bureau, M', 'Bouvier, G', 'Meryet-Figuiere, M', 'Tual, S', 'Lebailly, P', 'Baldi, I']","['de Graaf L', 'Boulanger M', 'Bureau M', 'Bouvier G', 'Meryet-Figuiere M', 'Tual S', 'Lebailly P', 'Baldi I']","['ISPED, Universite de Bordeaux, 146 rue Leo Saignat, 33076, Bordeaux, France; INSERM U1219 Epicene, 146 rue Leo Saignat, 33076, Bordeaux, France.

Intrathecal chemotherapy replaced cranial radiation due to radiation-induced neurotoxicity and late-effects. Survivors treated with chemotherapy-only experience neurologic and cognitive problems following cessation of treatment. Very long-term cognitive outcomes remain unclear. Animal models are being generated to assess late-effects of chemotherapy on cognitive function. Although, few address juvenile models of chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) and developing brain, results of this review outline neurocognitive effects of chemotherapy consistent with childhood ALL therapy. Studies demonstrate deficits across cognitive domains including spatial memory, executive function, short-term memory, anxiety and depression. Inflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxity, and other metabolic disruptions may lead to neurodegeneration associated with cognitive impairment observed in ALL survivors. Interventions directly targeting these mechanisms may prevent and/or promote recovery of cognitive function and improve long-term outcomes. Evidence suggests success of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant treatments in reducing cognitive decline. Animal models provide basis for assessing effects of chemotherapy on neurologic processes to guide future clinical investigations.","['Alexander, Tyler C', 'Krull, Kevin R']","['Alexander TC', 'Krull KR']","[""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, United States."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, United States; Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, United States.

The incidence and prognostic impact of the emergence of newly detectable TP53 mutations over the course of AML therapy has not been well described. We retrospectively analyzed 200 patients with newly diagnosed TP53 wild type AML who relapsed after or were refractory to frontline therapy. Twenty-nine patients (15%) developed a newly detectable TP53 mutation in the context of relapsed/refractory disease. The median variant allelic frequency (VAF) was 15% (range, 1.1%-95.6%). TP53 mutations were more common after intensive therapy versus lower-intensity therapy (23% vs. 10%, respectively; p = 0.02) and in patients who had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplant versus those who had not (36% vs. 12%, respectively; p = 0.005). Lower TP53 VAF was associated with an increased likelihood of complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) compared to higher TP53 VAF (CR/CRi rate of 41% for VAF < 20% vs. 13% for VAF >/= 20%, respectively). The median overall survival (OS) after acquisition of TP53 mutation was 4.6 months, with a 1-year OS rate of 19%. TP53 VAF at relapse was significantly associated with OS; the median OS of patients with TP53 VAF >/= 20% was 3.5 months versus 6.1 months for those with TP53 VAF < 20% (p < 0.05). In summary, new TP53 mutations may be acquired throughout the course of AML therapy. Sequential monitoring for TP53 mutations is likely to be increasingly relevant in the era of emerging TP53-targeting therapies for AML.","['Alwash, Yasmin', 'Khoury, Joseph D', 'Tashakori, Mehrnoosh', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Daver, Naval', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Dinardo, Courtney D', 'Issa, Ghayas C', 'Loghavi, Sanam', 'Takahashi, Koichi', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Guerra, Veronica', 'Kornblau, Steven', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Short, Nicholas J']","['Alwash Y', 'Khoury JD', 'Tashakori M', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Daver N', 'Ravandi F', 'Kadia TM', 'Konopleva M', 'Dinardo CD', 'Issa GC', 'Loghavi S', 'Takahashi K', 'Jabbour E', 'Guerra V', 'Kornblau S', 'Kantarjian H', 'Short NJ']","['The Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'The Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'The Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'The Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'The Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'The Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'The Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'The Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'The Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'The Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'The Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'The Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'The Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'The Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'The Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'The Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'The Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4857-6781', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2621-3584', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0973-3011', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7829-5249', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7103-373X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7621-377X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9892-9832', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9347-2212', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9003-0390', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8980-3202', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4465-6119', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2983-2738']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210819,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease Management', 'Gene Frequency', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,,2021/08/06 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2021/08/05 13:09'],"['2021/07/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/05 13:09 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.26314 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2021 Nov 1;96(11):1420-1428. doi: 10.1002/ajh.26314.

We performed a systematic review to assess the risk and the clinical-pathological features and prognosis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) in patients with CLL. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials databases for articles published from database inception to December 31, 2019. English-language studies reporting original data on patients with a specific diagnosis of CLL and cSCC were included. Data were extracted using a standardized extraction form, and any discordance was resolved by consensus. Descriptive data were generated by pooling patients from eligible studies. Of the 4588 non-duplicate records identified, 55 articles met our inclusion criteria. These studies reported that CLL patients have a 3.2% prevalence of cSCC, with an 11.5% cSCC-related lethality and an overall risk of metastasis of 5.7% (7.3% for regional lymph node involvement and 3.8% for distant metastasis). The quality of evidence was limited by the high heterogeneity in the design, populations, and objectives of the included studies. This systematic review suggests that cSCC in CLL patients tends to behave less aggressively compared with the solid organ transplant recipients but has a higher morbidity and mortality than in the general population. Future prospective studies are needed to increase the quality of evidence and to determine the best treatment modalities and screening intervals for these patients.","['Lai, Michela', 'Pampena, Riccardo', 'Cornacchia, Luigi', 'Odorici, Giulia', 'Piccerillo, Alfredo', 'Pellacani, Giovanni', 'Peris, Ketty', 'Longo, Caterina']","['Lai M', 'Pampena R', 'Cornacchia L', 'Odorici G', 'Piccerillo A', 'Pellacani G', 'Peris K', 'Longo C']","['Centro Oncologico ad Alta Tecnologia Diagnostica, Azienda Unita Sanitaria Locale - IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Centro Oncologico ad Alta Tecnologia Diagnostica, Azienda Unita Sanitaria Locale - IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Dermatology, Universita Cattolica, Rome and Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

This may be related to their lower participation in clinical trials. METHODS: This study examined AYA patient accrual to SWOG Cancer Research Network phase 1 to 3 clinical treatment trials for 29 cancers over 25 years (January 1996 to December 2020). Trial enrollments for AYA patients (15-39 years old) were compared with trial enrollments for older patients (40 years old or older) in SWOG and with US AYA cancer population rates derived from US Census and National Cancer Institute/Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data. RESULTS: In total, 84,219 patients were enrolled in SWOG treatment trials, including 7109 AYA patients (8.4%); in contrast, AYAs constituted 3.8% of the US cancer population. By histology, the highest proportions of AYA patients were in trials for Hodgkin disease (825 of 1220; 67.6%) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (350 of 678; 51.6%), whereas breast cancer trials had the greatest number of AYA patients (3032 of 32,693; 9.3%). SWOG AYA patients were more often female (68.8% vs 58.7%; P < .001), Black (10.1% vs 8.2%; P < .001), and Hispanic (10.6% vs 5.6%; P < .001) than SWOG patients who were 40 years old or older, and they were more often female (68.8% vs 65.1%; P < .001) but less often Black (10.1% vs 11.8%; P < .001) or Hispanic (10.6% vs 12.8%; P < .001) than AYA patients in the US cancer population. CONCLUSIONS: AYA patients with cancer were well represented in SWOG clinical trials in comparison with US cancer population patients with the same cancers. The SWOG AYA population was more racially/ethnically diverse than older SWOG patients, although it was less diverse than the US AYA cancer population. LAY SUMMARY: Adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with cancer (aged 15-39 years) have not seen the same improvements in survival as younger (pediatric) patients and older patients (adults 40 years old or older). This may be related to their lower participation in clinical trials. This study evaluated the extent to which AYA patients were enrolled in a large, National Cancer Institute-sponsored network group over 25 years (1996-2020). Overall, 8.4% of the enrolled patients (7109 of 84,219) were AYAs; this was twice the corresponding rate of 3.8% in the US cancer population. AYA patients were also more racially/ethnically diverse than older trial patients, although they were less racially/ethnically diverse than the US AYA cancer population.","['Unger, Joseph M', 'Beauchemin, Melissa', 'Hershman, Dawn L']","['Unger JM', 'Beauchemin M', 'Hershman DL']","['SWOG Statistics and Data Management Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5191-0317'],['eng'],"['Research Professorship Grant by the American Cancer Society', 'Hope Foundation for Cancer Research', '5T32CA094061/Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute', 'UG1 CA189974/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA094061/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5UG1CA189974/Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute']",['Journal Article'],20210805,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,PMC8665001,['NOTNLM'],"['adolescents and young adults', 'cancer clinical trials', 'disparities', 'enrollment', 'representativeness']",2021/08/06 06:00,2021/08/06 06:00,['2021/08/05 13:07'],"['2021/07/21 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/12/15 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/05 13:07 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33855 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2021 Dec 15;127(24):4574-4584. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33855.

However, despite the clear clinical and biological benefits of asparaginase therapy, many patients experience toxicities. A well-known treatment-limiting toxicity is asparaginase-associated pancreatitis (AAP). If severe, it necessitates discontinuation of asparaginase therapy, which can lead to a higher risk of relapse in patients with ALL. New protocols for ALL therapy have increased overall total doses of asparaginase therapy in select high-risk populations and have incorporated longer half-life formulations of pegylated asparaginase. Treatment drug monitoring has also allowed assurance of adequate levels of asparagine depletion throughout treatment. It is currently unknown if these changes will increase rates of AAP. Interestingly, important pharmacogenomics data, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, can identify patients at the highest risk for severe AAP. The incidence of AAP in recent trials, current pharmacogenomic data that could further our understanding of the disease, and the importance of cautiously re-exposing patients to further asparaginase treatment after an initial episode of AAP are discussed.","['Gibson, Amber', 'Hernandez, Carlos', 'Tejada, Fiorela N Hernandez', 'Kawedia, Jitesh', 'Rytting, Michael', 'Cuglievan, Branko']","['Gibson A', 'Hernandez C', 'Tejada FNH', 'Kawedia J', 'Rytting M', 'Cuglievan B']","['Department of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Clinical Programs, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Internal Medicine, Holland Hospital, Holland, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.

Using an AML composite model (AML-CM) assigning higher scores to older age, increased comorbidity burdens, and adverse cytogenetic risks, we defined 3 distinct prognostic groups and compared outcomes after less-intensive vs intensive induction therapies in a multicenter retrospective cohort (n = 1292) treated at 6 institutions from 2008 to 2012 and a prospective cohort (n = 695) treated at 13 institutions from 2013 to 2017. Prospective study included impacts of Karnofsky performance status (KPS), quality of life (QOL), and physician perception of cure. In the retrospective cohort, recipients of less-intensive therapies were older and had more comorbidities, more adverse cytogenetics, and worse KPS. Less-intensive therapies were associated with higher risks of mortality in AML-CM scores of 4 to 6, 7 to 9, and >/=10. Results were independent of allogeneic transplantation and similar in those age 70 to 79 years. In the prospective cohort, the 2 groups were similar in baseline QOL, geriatric assessment, and patient outcome preferences. Higher mortality risks were seen after less-intensive therapies. However, in models adjusted for age, physician-assigned KPS, and chance of cure, mortality risks and QOL were similar. Less-intensive therapy recipients had shorter length of hospitalization (LOH). Our study questions the survival and QOL benefits (except LOH) of less-intensive therapies in patients with AML, including those age 70 to 79 years or with high comorbidity burdens. A randomized trial in older/medically infirm patients is required to better assess the value of less-intensive and intensive therapies or their combination. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01929408.","['Sorror, Mohamed L', 'Storer, Barry E', 'Fathi, Amir T', 'Brunner, Andrew', 'Gerds, Aaron T', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Mukherjee, Sudipto', 'Medeiros, Bruno C', 'Wang, Eunice S', 'Vachhani, Pankit', 'Shami, Paul J', 'Pena, Esteban', 'Elsawy, Mahmoud', 'Adekola, Kehinde', 'Luger, Selina', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Rizzieri, David', 'Wildes, Tanya M', 'Koprivnikar, Jamie', 'Smith, Julie', 'Garrison, Mitchell', 'Kojouri, Kiarash', 'Leisenring, Wendy', 'Onstad, Lynn', 'Nyland, Jennifer E', 'Becker, Pamela S', 'McCune, Jeannine S', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Estey, Elihu H']","['Sorror ML', 'Storer BE', 'Fathi AT', 'Brunner A', 'Gerds AT', 'Sekeres MA', 'Mukherjee S', 'Medeiros BC', 'Wang ES', 'Vachhani P', 'Shami PJ', 'Pena E', 'Elsawy M', 'Adekola K', 'Luger S', 'Baer MR', 'Rizzieri D', 'Wildes TM', 'Koprivnikar J', 'Smith J', 'Garrison M', 'Kojouri K', 'Leisenring W', 'Onstad L', 'Nyland JE', 'Becker PS', 'McCune JS', 'Lee SJ', 'Sandmaier BM', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Estey EH']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Statistics Program, Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington School of Public Health, Seattle, WA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Leukemia & Myeloid Disorders Program, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Leukemia & Myeloid Disorders Program, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Leukemia & Myeloid Disorders Program, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY.', 'Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Robert H.

METHODS: Sixty patients with CML and 20 age- and sex-matched control subjects were enrolled. Circulating miR-150 levels were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction on days 0, 14, and 90 of imatinib therapy for patients and once for control subjects. RESULTS: The baseline miR-150 expression was significantly lower in patients with CML than in control subjects with subsequent elevation at 14 and 90 days after the start of imatinib treatment. Early treatment response (ETR) at 90 days was the main study outcome. The miR-150 expression had a significantly higher level in patients with CML with ETR. On multivariate analysis, miR-150 on day 14 was significantly related to ETR in patients with CML with predictive efficacy (area under the curve = 0.838, 72.9% sensitivity, and 84.2% specificity). CONCLUSION: We found that miR-150 expression on day 14 of imatinib treatment is a useful early predictive candidate for imatinib response in patients with CML.","['Habib, Eman M', 'Nosiar, Nahla A', 'Eid, Manal A', 'Taha, Atef M', 'Sherief, Dalia E', 'Hassan, Asmaa E', 'Abdel Ghafar, Muhammad T']","['Habib EM', 'Nosiar NA', 'Eid MA', 'Taha AM', 'Sherief DE', 'Hassan AE', 'Abdel Ghafar MT']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Kafr El-Sheikh University, Kafr El-Sheikh, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Kafr El-Sheikh University, Kafr El-Sheikh, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Kafr El-Sheikh University, Kafr El-Sheikh, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Kafr El-Sheikh University, Kafr El-Sheikh, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0621-4291'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Lab Med,Laboratory medicine,0250641,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'early treatment response', 'imatinib', 'miR-150', 'prediction']",2021/08/06 06:00,2021/08/06 06:00,['2021/08/05 08:49'],"['2021/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/05 08:49 [entrez]']","['6341662 [pii]', '10.1093/labmed/lmab040 [doi]']",ppublish,Lab Med. 2022 Jan 6;53(1):58-64. doi: 10.1093/labmed/lmab040.,58-64,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2021.

The conventional analysis of bone marrow smears is performed under a manual microscope, which is labor-intensive and subject to interobserver variability. The morphological differential diagnosis of abnormal lymphocytes from normal lymphocytes is still challenging. The digital pathology methods integrated with advances in machine learning enable new diagnostic features/algorithms from digital bone marrow cell images in order to optimize classification, thus providing a robust and faster screening diagnostic tool. We have developed a machine learning system, Morphogo, based on algorithms to discriminate abnormal lymphocytes from normal lymphocytes using digital imaging analysis. We retrospectively reviewed 347 cases of bone marrow digital images. Among them, 53 cases had a clinical history and the diagnosis of marrow involvement with lymphoma was confirmed either by morphology or flow cytometry. We split the 53 cases into two groups for training and testing with 43 and 10 cases, respectively. The selected 15,353 cell images were reviewed by pathologists, based on morphological visual appearance, from 43 patients whose diagnosis was confirmed by complementary tests. To expand the range and the precision of recognizing the lymphoid cells in the marrow by automated digital microscopy systems, we developed an algorithm that incorporated color and texture in addition to geometrical cytological features of the variable lymphocyte images which were applied as the training data set. The selected images from the 10 patients were analyzed by the trained artificial intelligence-based recognition system and compared with the final diagnosis rendered by pathologists. The positive predictive value for the identification of the categories of reactive/normal lymphocytes and abnormal lymphoid cells was 99.04%. It seems likely that further training and improvement of the algorithms will facilitate further subclassification of specific lineage subset pathology, e.g., diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma or even hairy cell leukemia in cases of abnormal malignant lymphocyte classes in the future. This research demonstrated the feasibility of digital pathology and emerging machine learning approaches to automatically diagnose lymphoma cells in the bone marrow based on cytological-histological analyses.","['Tang, Gusheng', 'Fu, Xinyan', 'Wang, Zhen', 'Chen, Mingyi']","['Tang G', 'Fu X', 'Wang Z', 'Chen M']","['Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Division of Medical Technology Development, Hangzhou ZhiWei Information and Technology Co.

With repeated sampling, immune monitoring creates a real-time portrait of the cells reacting to a novel virus before disease-specific knowledge and tools are established. However, single cell analysis tools can struggle to reveal rare cells that are under 0.1% of the population. Here, the machine learning workflow Tracking Responders EXpanding (T-REX) was created to identify changes in both rare and common cells across human immune monitoring settings. T-REX identified cells with highly similar phenotypes that localized to hotspots of significant change during rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Specialized MHCII tetramer reagents that mark rhinovirus-specific CD4+ cells were left out during analysis and then used to test whether T-REX identified biologically significant cells. T-REX identified rhinovirus-specific CD4+ T cells based on phenotypically homogeneous cells expanding by >/=95% following infection. T-REX successfully identified hotspots of virus-specific T cells by comparing infection (day 7) to either pre-infection (day 0) or post-infection (day 28) samples. Plotting the direction and degree of change for each individual donor provided a useful summary view and revealed patterns of immune system behavior across immune monitoring settings. For example, the magnitude and direction of change in some COVID-19 patients was comparable to blast crisis acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing a complete response to chemotherapy. Other COVID-19 patients instead displayed an immune trajectory like that seen in rhinovirus infection or checkpoint inhibitor therapy for melanoma. The T-REX algorithm thus rapidly identifies and characterizes mechanistically significant cells and places emerging diseases into a systems immunology context for comparison to well-studied immune changes.","['Barone, Sierra M', 'Paul, Alberta Ga', 'Muehling, Lyndsey M', 'Lannigan, Joanne A', 'Kwok, William W', 'Turner, Ronald B', 'Woodfolk, Judith A', 'Irish, Jonathan M']","['Barone SM', 'Paul AG', 'Muehling LM', 'Lannigan JA', 'Kwok WW', 'Turner RB', 'Woodfolk JA', 'Irish JM']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, United States.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, United States.', 'Allergy Division, Department of Medicine, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, United States.', 'Allergy Division, Department of Medicine, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, United States.', 'Benaroya Research Institute at Virginia Mason, Seattle, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, United States.', 'Allergy Division, Department of Medicine, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, United States.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, United States.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, United States.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5944-750X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9318-3760', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3203-3264', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3981-8681', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4843-4599', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8915-4334', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9428-8866']",['eng'],"['R21 AI138077/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007496/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AI125056/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 TR002625/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA068485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA68485/Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center', 'R21 AI138077/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AI125056/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007496/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA217450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA226833/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 TR002625/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'Michael David Greene Brain Cancer Fund/Vanderbilt University Medical Center', 'R01 CA226833/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA217450/NH/NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20210805,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'COVID-19/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Melanoma/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Neoplasms', 'Picornaviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Rhinovirus/isolation & purification', 'SARS-CoV-2/isolation & purification', '*Unsupervised Machine Learning', 'Young Adult']",PMC8370768,['NOTNLM'],"['*COVID-19', '*computational biology', '*cytometry', '*human', '*immune monitoring', '*immunology', '*inflammation', '*machine learning', '*rhinovirus', '*systems biology']",2021/08/06 06:00,2021/08/26 06:00,['2021/08/05 08:42'],"['2020/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/26 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/05 08:42 [entrez]']","['10.7554/eLife.64653 [doi]', '64653 [pii]']",epublish,Elife. 2021 Aug 5;10. pii: 64653. doi: 10.7554/eLife.64653.,,"['(c) 2021, Barone et al.']",,,,"['SB, WK, RT, JW none, AP became an employee of Cytek Biosciences, Inc after', 'performing this research at University of Virginia.

This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the efficacy of using CD-targeted antibodies for ALL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The EMBASE and MEDLINE databases were searched for research papers using immunotherapy- and ALL-related terms from inception to July 2021. Eligible studies were randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) or cohort studies in which ALL patients received CD-targeted immunotherapy or conventional chemotherapy as the induction or salvage therapy. The reports had to report our primary outcomes of interest: overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), or complete remission (CR), with the patient number for each outcome. The effect estimates with 95% confidence interval (CI) from each study were combined to calculate the pooled-effect estimate, using the Hantel-Maenszel method. RESULTS: Five RCTs and 9 retrospective cohort studies were eligible for the meta-analysis. ALL patients given CD-targeted immunotherapy in the induction or salvage therapy had significantly higher OS and RFS rates than those administered conventional chemotherapy only, with pooled odds ratios (OR) of 2.11 (95% CI, 1.76-2.53; I(2), 0%) and 2.25 (95% CI, 1.62-3.14; I(2), 61%), respectively. The rates of achieving CR and minimal residual disease negativity were also higher for the immunotherapy group, with pooled ORs of 1.70 (95% CI, 1.07-2.69; I(2), 79%) and 2.98 (95% CI, 1.17-7.58; I(2), 90%), while developing less risk for febrile neutropenia (pooled OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08-0.58; I(2), 84%). Subgroup analyses revealed that all antibody types yielded dramatically better OS rates than those for patients administered chemotherapy alone. CONCLUSIONS: The ALL patients receiving CD-targeted immunotherapy as induction or salvage therapy had significantly higher response rates and survival outcomes, as well as lower odds of acquiring febrile neutropenia, than the patients given conventional chemotherapy.","['Ponvilawan, Ben', 'Vittayawacharin, Pongthep', 'Tunsing, Pattaraporn', 'Owattanapanich, Weerapat']","['Ponvilawan B', 'Vittayawacharin P', 'Tunsing P', 'Owattanapanich W']","['Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, 65106Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, 65106Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, 65106Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, 65106Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1262-2005'],['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",,United States,Technol Cancer Res Treat,Technology in cancer research & treatment,101140941,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '3062P60MH9 (epratuzumab)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)', 'P93RUU11P7 (Inotuzumab Ozogamicin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Bispecific/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Febrile Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy/adverse effects', 'Induction Chemotherapy/methods', 'Inotuzumab Ozogamicin/therapeutic use', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Rituximab/therapeutic use', 'Salvage Therapy/methods', 'Survival Rate']",PMC8358501,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*immunotherapy', '*meta-analysis', '*monoclonal antibody']",2021/08/06 06:00,2021/12/22 06:00,['2021/08/05 08:39'],"['2021/08/05 08:39 [entrez]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/15330338211037434 [doi]'],ppublish,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2021 Jan-Dec;20:15330338211037434. doi: 10.1177/15330338211037434.,15330338211037434,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic and molecular aberrations are the most important factors in determining response to chemotherapy as well as long-term outcome, but beyond prognostication are potential therapeutic targets. Our increased understanding of the pathogenesis of AML facilitated by next-generation sequencing has spurred the development of new compounds in the treatment of AML, particularly the creation of small molecules that target the disease on a molecular level. Many of the hopeful predictions outlined in our AML review of 2018 are now therapeutic realities: gemtuzumab ozogamicin, venetoclax, FLT3 inhibitors (midostaurin, gilteritinib), IDH inhibitors (ivosidenib, enasidenib), CPX-351, glasdegib, oral decitabine, and oral azacitidine. Others may soon be (quizartinib, APR246 magrolimab, menin inhibitors). The wealth of positive data allows reconsideration of what might soon be new standards of care in younger and older patients with AML. In this review we give an overview of recently approved therapies in AML and address present and future research directions.","['Kayser, Sabine', 'Levis, Mark J']","['Kayser S', 'Levis MJ']","['Medical Clinic and Policlinic I, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'NCT Trial Center, National Center of Tumor Diseases, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3796-8843', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0473-6982']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210804,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Keywords: acute myeloid leukaemia', 'authority-approved agents', 'molecular tailored therapy', 'monoclonal antibody', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2021/08/06 06:00,2021/08/06 06:00,['2021/08/05 06:41'],"['2021/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/05 06:41 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.17746 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2022 Jan;196(2):316-328. doi: 10.1111/bjh.17746.

Nevertheless, neutralizing antibodies are a key requisite in the fight against viral infections. Patients depleted of antibody-producing B cells, such as those treated with rituximab (anti-CD20) for hematological malignancies, lack a fundamental part of their adaptive immunity. Treatment with convalescent plasma appears to be of general benefit in this particularly vulnerable cohort. We analyzed clinical course and inflammation markers of three B-cell-depleted patients suffering from COVID-19 who were treated with convalescent plasma. In addition, we measured serum antibody levels as well as peripheral blood CD38/HLA-DR-positive T-cells ex vivo and CD137-positive T-cells after in vitro stimulation with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-derived peptides in these patients. We observed that therapy with convalescent plasma was effective in all three patients and analysis of CD137-positive T-cells after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 peptides showed an increase in peptide-specific T-cells after application of convalescent plasma. In conclusion, we here demonstrate efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in three B-cell-depleted patients and present data that suggest that while application of convalescent plasma elevates systemic antibody levels only transiently, it may also boost specific T-cell responses.","['Kremer, Andreas E', 'Kremer, Anita N', 'Willam, Carsten', 'Volkl, Simon', 'Verhagen, Johan', 'Achenbach,

We review the AML risk stratification, the efficacy of the newly approved drugs, and the role of ""3+7"". RECENT FINDINGS: Treatment of AML is becoming more niched with specific subtypes more appropriately treated with gemtuzumab, midostaurin, and CPX-351. Although lower intensity therapies can yield high response rates, they are less efficient at preventing relapses. The only curative potential for poor-risk AML is still an allogeneic stem cell transplant. The number of AML subtypes where 3+7 alone is an appropriate therapeutic option is shrinking. However, it remains the backbone for combination therapy with newer agents in patients suitable for intensive chemotherapy.","['Tang, Kenny', 'Schuh, Andre C', 'Yee, Karen Wl']","['Tang K', 'Schuh AC', 'Yee KW']","['Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Health Network - Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, 610 University Avenue, 700 U 6th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Health Network - Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, 610 University Avenue, 700 U 6th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Health Network - Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, 610 University Avenue, 700 U 6th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada. karen.yee@uhn.ca.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2572-9952'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210804,United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*CPX-351', '*Daunorubicin', '*Midostaurin', '*Venetoclax', '*cytarabine', '*gemtuzumab ozogamicin']",2021/08/06 06:00,2021/08/06 06:00,['2021/08/05 06:38'],"['2021/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/05 06:38 [entrez]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11912-021-01108-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s11912-021-01108-9 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2021 Aug 4;23(10):120. doi: 10.1007/s11912-021-01108-9.,120,"['(c) 2021.

The PD-1 pathway, found to be overexpressed in myeloid malignancies, has gained great interest as a therapeutic target, where a significant unmet need exists for novel therapeutic strategies. Preclinical models showed JAK2 mutant cells had higher expression of PD-L1; furthermore, JAK2 mutant xenografts treated with PD-1 inhibition had prolonged survival and reduction in JAK2 allele burden. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of single-agent nivolumab in 8 adult patients with myelofibrosis. Nivolumab was given at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 8 doses, then every 12 weeks for up to 4 years, or until disease progression or toxicity. The median number of nivolumab doses received was 6 [range, 5-16 doses]. Five patients had stable disease including spleen size, total symptom score, and blood requirements for a median of 3.3 months [range, 2.3-15.2 months].

However, light has yet to be shed on the landscape of adaptive immunity-related genes. This work aimed to uncover the novel molecular events in AML and potential therapeutic strategies for AML treatment. Methods: For the current research, the transcriptional information of 732 genes that participate in adaptive immunity was collected from 173 patients with AML, and the patients were grouped into different cohorts based on the different expression patterns. The correlations between gene expression and clinical characteristics, including prognosis, were studied. Results: According to the notably different expressions of adaptive immunity-related genes, the 173 patients were divided into 2 clusters and 3 subclusters. No significant differences in overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) were detected between the clusters or subclusters. There were obvious discrepancies found in age, peripheral blood (PB) blast percentage, and French-American-British (FAB) classification between each cluster or subcluster. The patients in cluster 1 were older and more of them had M5 type; the patients in cluster 2 were younger and more of them had M2 type. Further, 81 genes were significantly correlated with age and 101 genes were significantly correlated with PB blast percentage. Comparison of the prognosis between each FAB type revealed that patients with M3 type displayed the most favorable OS and PFS. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), CLEC2B expression was much lower in M2 patients than in patients with other types (P<0.001), and its high expression indicated a worse outcome (12.4 vs. 46.5 months of OS). Conclusions: This study has uncovered the expression profile of adaptive immunity-related genes in AML. The different gene expression patterns are not associated with survival, but are significantly correlated the FAB types. CLEC2B expression is low in patients with M2 type and is negatively correlated with prognosis, thus revealing a potential therapeutic target for AML.","['Chen, Peng', 'Liu, Yi', 'Zhang, Rui', 'Wang, Haitao', 'Zhang, Juan', 'Guo, Meng', 'Du, Zhenlan']","['Chen P', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang R', 'Wang H', 'Zhang J', 'Guo M', 'Du Z']","['Department of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', ""Department of Hematology, People's Hospital of Cangzhou, Cangzhou, China."", 'Department of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', ""Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases, Air Force Medical University (Fourth Military Medical University), Xi'an, China."", 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Pediatrics, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', ""Bayi Children's Hospital, Seventh Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China."", 'National Engineering Laboratory for Birth Defects Prevention and Control of Key Technology, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Organ Failure, Beijing, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Ann Transl Med,Annals of translational medicine,101617978,,,,PMC8263877,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'French-American-British (FAB) subtypes', 'adaptive immunity', 'prognosis']",2021/08/06 06:00,2021/08/06 06:01,['2021/08/05 06:31'],"['2021/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/05 06:31 [entrez]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/atm-21-2720 [doi]', 'atm-09-11-939 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Transl Med. 2021 Jun;9(11):939. doi: 10.21037/atm-21-2720.,939,['2021 Annals of Translational Medicine.

However, limited stem cell sources as well as immune rejection and ethical issues have restricted its wide application. Therefore, to achieve further breakthroughs regarding the application of stem cell transplantation to treat spinal cord injury (SCI), it is important to develop a stem cell line that can effectively avoid immune rejection and ethical issues. Methods: Urine cells (UCs) were induced to differentiate into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which then further differentiated into neural stem cells (NSCs). Relevant tests were performed, and three-dimensional (3D) printed scaffolds were prepared. Thirty C57BL/6 mice were divided into 5 groups based on a random number table: a sham group, an SCI group, an SCI + control group, an SCI + siNC group, and an SCI + siGAS5 group (n=6). The latter 4 groups replicated SCI models. Mice in the SCI + control group were transplanted with 3D scaffolds loaded with iPSC-derived NSCs (iPSd-NSCs). Mice in the SCI + siNC group and the SCI + siGAS5 group were transplanted with scaffolds loaded with iPSd-NSCs-siNC and 3D scaffolds loaded with iPSd-NSCs-siGAS5, respectively. Mice in the other groups were injected with the same amount of normal saline. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to observe the histopathology of the injured spinal cord, the Basso-Mouse Scale was used to assess the motor function of the hind limbs of the mice, and Western blot was used to detect the expression of apoptosis-related proteins after SCI. Results: iPSd-NSCs were successfully induced and differentiated, and 3D printed heparin sulfate-collagen scaffolds were prepared, inside which a 3D loose porous structure was shown by electron microscopy. Morphological observations showed that iPSd-NSC transplantation improved SCI in mice, while GAS5 silencing inhibited the reparative effect of iPSd-NSC transplantation on SCI in mice. Western blot results indicated that iPSd-NSC transplantation significantly increased the expression level of B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) (P<0.01) but decreased the expression levels of Bcl-2 associated X protein, cytochrome C, and cleaved caspase-3 (P<0.001). Conclusions: The overexpression of lncRNA-GAS5 can promote spinal cord repair and inhibit neural apoptosis via the transplantation of 3D printed scaffolds loaded with iPSd-NSCs.","['Shao, Rongxue', 'Li, Changming', 'Chen, Yan', 'Zhang, Liang', 'Yang, Hejie', 'Zhang, Zhijing', 'Yue, Jun', 'Gao, Wenshuo', 'Zhu, Hang', 'Pan, Hao', 'Zhou, Hui', 'Quan, Renfu']","['Shao R', 'Li C', 'Chen Y', 'Zhang L', 'Yang H', 'Zhang Z', 'Yue J', 'Gao W', 'Zhu H', 'Pan H', 'Zhou H', 'Quan R']","['Department of Orthopedics, Hangzhou TCM Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Jiangnan Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Hangzhou TCM Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Hangzhou TCM Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Hangzhou TCM Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Hangzhou TCM Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Hangzhou TCM Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Orthopaedic Institute, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Hangzhou TCM Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Hangzhou TCM Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Hangzhou TCM Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Jiangnan Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Ann Transl Med,Annals of translational medicine,101617978,,,,PMC8263850,['NOTNLM'],"['3D printed scaffold', 'Long non-coding RNA-GAS5', 'iPSC-derived NSCs', 'neuronal apoptosis', 'spinal cord injury (SCI)']",2021/08/06 06:00,2021/08/06 06:01,['2021/08/05 06:31'],"['2021/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/05 06:31 [entrez]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/atm-21-2570 [doi]', 'atm-09-11-931 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Transl Med. 2021 Jun;9(11):931. doi: 10.21037/atm-21-2570.,931,['2021 Annals of Translational Medicine.

However, the underlying mechanism of LIF-dependent ACTH induction remains unclear. Recently, we found that LIF induces corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in mouse trophoblast stem cells. This finding supports the results of a previous study that CRH, which is produced by the placenta, induces placental ACTH production. In this study, we examined whether the effects of LIF are mediated by the induction of Pomc via CRH upregulation in mouse trophoblast. In vivo, protein levels of LIF and CRH peak in mouse placenta at 13.5 days post coitum. In mouse placenta, Crh mRNA and protein levels significantly increased 3 h after intraperitoneal injection of LIF (5 mug/kg body weight) into dams at 13.5 days post coitum. We also examined the effect of LIF-induced CRH on the expression of Pomc induced by LIF in mouse trophoblast stem cells in vitro. After LIF supplementation for 3 days, we found that the increased expression of Crh-induced by new supplementation of LIF was earlier than that of Pomc. Furthermore, LIF-induced upregulation of Pomc in mouse trophoblast stem cells was attenuated by inhibition of the CRH/CRHR1 pathway, whereas LIF-induced secretion of ACTH was attenuated by inhibition of the JAK/STAT3 pathway. Therefore, LIF indirectly increases placental Pomc expression through the CRH/CRHR1 pathway, and placental ACTH secretion is induced directly by LIF via the JAK/STAT3 pathway.","['Wang, He', 'Sakata-Haga, Hiromi', 'Masuta, Hiroko', 'Tomosugi, Mitsuhiro', 'Tsukada, Tsuyoshi', 'Shimada, Hiroki', 'Sakai, Daisuke', 'Shoji, Hiroki', 'Hatta, Toshihisa']","['Wang H', 'Sakata-Haga H', 'Masuta H', 'Tomosugi M', 'Tsukada T', 'Shimada H', 'Sakai D', 'Shoji H', 'Hatta T']","['Department of Anatomy, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Anatomy, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Science, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Japan.', 'Department of Biology, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Japan.', 'Department of Biology, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy, Kanazawa Medical University, Uchinada, Japan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210719,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,PMC8326836,['NOTNLM'],"['corticotropin-releasing hormone', 'corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor', 'leukemia inhibitory factor', 'mouse placenta', 'mouse trophoblast stem cells', 'proopiomelanocortin']",2021/08/06 06:00,2021/08/06 06:01,['2021/08/05 06:30'],"['2020/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/05 06:30 [entrez]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.618947 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Jul 19;9:618947. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.618947. eCollection 2021.,618947,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Wang, Sakata-Haga, Masuta, Tomosugi, Tsukada, Shimada, Sakai,', 'Shoji and Hatta.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since its first description in 2013, over 200 patients have been reported worldwide. Unsurprisingly, many of the newly diagnosed patients were recruited later in life from previously long-standing unclassified immunodeficiencies and the early course of the disease is, therefore, often less well-described. In this study, we report clinical and laboratory features of eight patients followed for APDS, with particular focus on early warning signs, longitudinal development of their symptoms, individual variations, and response to therapy. The main clinical features shared by our patients included recurrent bacterial and viral respiratory tract infections, gastrointestinal disease, non-malignant lymphoproliferation, autoimmune thyroiditis, and susceptibility to EBV. All patients tolerated vaccination with both attenuated live and subunit vaccines with no adverse effects, although some failed to mount adequate antibody response. Laboratory findings were characterized by dysgammaglobulinaemia, elevated serum IgM, block in B-cell maturation with high transitional B cells, and low naive T cells with CD8 T-cell activation. All patients benefited from immunoglobulin replacement therapy, whereas immunosuppression with mTOR pathway inhibitors was only partially successful.

Methods: In this study, ""DDX41"" was searched in PubMed and Web of Science between 1 January 2015 and 29 April 2021 with individual-patient data seeking. A meta-analysis was not valid here due to the absence of a large dataset. Thirty articles were finally included in the qualitative analysis and 277 patients from 20 studies without overlap were involved in the quantitative summary. Results: Pooled incidence was 3.3% (95% confidence interval 2.4-4.2%) of unselected myeloid neoplasms. Patients with hematologic disorders harboring mutated DDX41 were featured as 80% males, median 66 (20-88) years old at diagnosis, 75% acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 64% with normal karyotype. Eighty-five percent of patients had germline variants which were nationally diverse and more of frameshift type, whereas 64% of patients had somatic DDX41 variants where p.R525H and missense dominated. ASXL1 and TP53 were the top frequent concomitant somatic mutations. Therapeutically, 70% overall response rate was obtained of hypomethylating agents in MDS, 96% complete remission of chemotherapy in AML, and 8% of relapse in hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Neither overall survival nor progression-free survival could be summed. Conclusions: Several significant clinical differences were observed in different diagnosis groups, familial and sporadic cases, and p.R525H compared with other somatic variants. In conclusion, myeloid neoplasms carrying DDX41 mutations were mainly older, male, MDS, and AML patients who had promising responses to treatment. Both germline and somatic DDX41 variants possessed unique characteristics and groups of interest presented certain differences worth further research.

However, the application of CAR-T cells is hampered by potentially adverse events, of which cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is one of the severest and the most studied. Local cytokine-release syndrome (L-CRS) at particular parts of the body has been reported once in a while in B-cell lymphoma or other compartmental tumors. The underlying mechanism of L-CRS is not well understood and the existing reports attempting to illustrate it only involve compartmental tumors, some of which even indicated L-CRS only happens in compartmental tumors. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is systemic and our center treated a B-cell ALL patient who exhibited life threatening dyspnea, L-CRS was under suspicion and the patient was successfully rescued with treatment algorithm of CRS.

Genetic polymorphism in the genes involving thiopurine metabolisms is related to 6-MP related toxicity. Objective: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of ITPA:c.94C>A and NUDT15:c.415C>T polymorphisms among Thai children diagnosed with leukemia and their association with mercaptopurine-related myelotoxicity. Methods: Patients and survivors with a diagnosis of leukemia treated with mercaptopurine-containing chemotherapy regimens were enrolled. Clinical data and laboratory parameters during treatment as well as ITPA:c.94C>A and NUDT15:c.415C>T genotypes were analyzed. Results: In all, 99 patients with acute leukemia or survivors were enrolled in the study. The prevalences of ITPA:c.94C>A, NUDT15:c.415C>T, and co-occurrence of ITPA:c.94C>A and NUDT15:c.415C>T polymorphisms were 34, 17, and 4%, respectively. Numbers of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and platelet count significantly decreased among patients carrying NUDT15:c.415C>T compared with NUDT15 wild type patients with p-values<0.001 and 0.019, respectively. The differences were not observed among patients carrying ITPA:c.94C>A compared with ITPA wild type patients. According to multivariate GEE, NUDT15:c.415C>T and co-occurrence of ITPA:c.94C>A and NUDT15:c.415C>T had a significant negative effect on ANC during treatment (coefficient: -463.81; CI: -778.53, -149.09; p-value=0.004 and coefficient: -527.56; CI: -1045.65, -9.48; p-value=0.046). No significant effect of ITPA:c.94C>A on ANC during treatment was observed. Conclusion: ITPA:c.94C>A and NUDT15:c.415C>T polymorphisms are common among Thai children with leukemia.

However, in developing countries, finding a unit that is HLA or HPA matched or platelet crossmatch poses a challenge. Hence, easier and cost-effective alternatives such as massive platelet transfusion and continuous platelet transfusion were attempted to manage bleeding in PTR. A 31-year-old male presented with acute myeloid leukemia relapse and chloroma in bladder underwent FLAG salvage chemotherapy. Despite almost daily platelet transfusion with single donor platelets (SDPs), patient presented with hematuria and low corrected count increment at 1 h and 24 h suggesting both immune and nonimmune refractoriness to platelet transfusion. The patient received SDP transfusion twice daily from day 19 to day 21 to maintain hemostasis. The patient had persistent hematuria, so massive platelet transfusion in the form of double adult doses of SDP given every 12(th) hourly for three events. Despite these measures, there was persistent hematuria and refractoriness to platelet transfusion. As HLA or HPA matched or crossmatch compatible platelets were unavailable, continuous platelet transfusion was started for this patient from day 23 to day 28. After 4 days of continuous platelet transfusion, hematuria subsided.

While standard of care treatment results in remission in most patients, a small population of patients will relapse, due to the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) consisting of dormant, chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells. To interrogate this clinically relevant population of treatment refractory cells, we developed an in vitro cell model in which human ALL cells are grown in co-culture with human derived bone marrow stromal cells or osteoblasts. Within this co-culture, tumor cells are found in suspension, lightly attached to the top of the adherent cells, or buried under the adherent cells in a population that is phase dim (PD) by light microscopy. PD cells are dormant and chemotherapy-resistant, consistent with the population of cells that underlies MRD. In the current study, we characterized the transcriptional signature of PD cells by RNA-Seq, and these data were compared to a published expression data set derived from human MRD B-cell ALL patients. Our comparative analyses revealed that the PD cell population is markedly similar to the MRD expression patterns from the primary cells isolated from patients. We further identified genes and key signaling pathways that are common between the PD tumor cells from co-culture and patient derived MRD cells as potential therapeutic targets for future studies.","['Rellick, Stephanie L', 'Hu, Gangqing', 'Piktel, Debra', 'Martin, Karen H', 'Geldenhuys, Werner J', 'Nair, Rajesh R', 'Gibson, Laura F']","['Rellick SL', 'Hu G', 'Piktel D', 'Martin KH', 'Geldenhuys WJ', 'Nair RR', 'Gibson LF']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Cell Biology, West Virginia University School of Medicine, 1 Medical Center Drive, Morgantown, WV, 26506, USA.', 'West Virginia University Cancer Institute, Morgantown, WV, 26506, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Cell Biology, West Virginia University School of Medicine, 1 Medical Center Drive, Morgantown, WV, 26506, USA.', 'Bioinformatics Core, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, 26506, USA.', 'West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute, Morgantown, WV, 26506, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Cell Biology, West Virginia University School of Medicine, 1 Medical Center Drive, Morgantown, WV, 26506, USA.', 'West Virginia University Cancer Institute, Morgantown, WV, 26506, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Cell Biology, West Virginia University School of Medicine, 1 Medical Center Drive, Morgantown, WV, 26506, USA.', 'West Virginia University Cancer Institute, Morgantown, WV, 26506, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, West Virginia University School of Pharmacy, Morgantown, WV, 26506, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Cell Biology, West Virginia University School of Medicine, 1 Medical Center Drive, Morgantown, WV, 26506, USA.', 'West Virginia University Cancer Institute, Morgantown, WV, 26506, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Cell Biology, West Virginia University School of Medicine, 1 Medical Center Drive, Morgantown, WV, 26506, USA. lgibson@hsc.wvu.edu.', 'West Virginia University Cancer Institute, Morgantown, WV, 26506, USA. lgibson@hsc.wvu.edu.']",,['eng'],"['U54 GM104942/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 GM103488/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM121322/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM103434/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM109098/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20210804,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Osteoblasts/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'RNA-Seq', '*Transcriptome']",PMC8339057,,,2021/08/06 06:00,2021/11/09 06:00,['2021/08/05 05:54'],"['2020/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/05 05:54 [entrez]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-021-95039-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-021-95039-x [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2021 Aug 4;11(1):15840. doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-95039-x.,15840,['(c) 2021.

The leukemic cells in infants with ALL frequently carry chromosome translocations involving 11q23, resulting in the rearrangement and fusion of the MLL (KMT2A) gene. Among many MLL fusion genes, MLL-AF4 (KMT2A-AFF1) fusion is characteristically observed in infants with ALL, representing a hallmark of poor prognosis. In MLL-AF4-positive infants with ALL, first leukemic cells with MLL-AF4 were generated in utero. Analysis of several murine and human leukemia models revealed that the target cells for tumorigenesis by MLL-AF4 were not the hematopoietic progenitor cells of the bone marrow, but the early hematopoietic progenitor cells present in the fetal liver during the embryonic period and possibly the undifferentiated cells prior to the commitment to hematopoietic cells in the fetus.

Accumulated evidence of the relationship between the clinical outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and diversity of the microbiota demonstrates the importance of the microbiota in the physiological and pathological regulation of hematopoiesis. In addition, recent studies have shown that aberrant diet-related changes in the microbiota may cause abnormal hematopoiesis and contribute to the progression of myeloproliferative neoplasm in combination with RAS-MAPK activation. Ten-eleven translocation 2 (Tet2) mutation in myeloid cells causes dysfunction of the small-intestinal barrier, which leads to induction of preleukemic myeloproliferation. Proliferation of leukemia cells is associated with reduced insulin secretion and enhancement of insulin resistance, partly due to microbiota-derived metabolites. Thus, the microbiota affects normal and malignant hematopoiesis mediated by multiple factors. Further analyses may contribute to the identification of critical environmental factors, which may lead to the discovery of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for hematopoietic neoplasms.","['Hirao, Atsushi']",['Hirao A'],"['Kanazawa University, Cancer Research Institute.']",,['jpn'],,['Journal Article'],,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,,IM,"['*Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', '*Leukemia']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Leukemogenesis', 'Microbiota']",2021/08/06 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2021/08/05 05:44'],"['2021/08/05 05:44 [entrez]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.62.739 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2021;62(7):739-743. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.62.739.,739-743,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The genome-wide association study approach has led to the identification of several associated genes, thereby confirming the polygenic nature of childhood leukemia. Ongoing studies have shown that many of these loci, which were originally identified in populations of European ancestry, are also important in the Japanese population. Regarding potential external exposures, increasing evidence is becoming available to elucidate the role of infectious agents and the influence of immune maturation in early life. Epidemiological evidence supports the prevailing hypotheses related to the effect of population mixing on transient increases in the childhood leukemia rates, as well as the role of delayed exposures to common infections in propagating an aberrant immune response and subsequent leukemia risk. Future advances in the investigation of childhood leukemia and other rare diseases along with coordinated studies and collaborations are needed, owing to stringent sample size requirements to support statistically robust comparisons and opportunities for independent validation.","['Urayama, Kevin Y']",['Urayama KY'],"[""Graduate School of Public Health, St. Luke's International University."", 'Department of Social Medicine, National Center for Child Health and Development.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,,IM,"['Biometry', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/epidemiology']",,,,2021/08/06 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2021/08/05 05:44'],"['2021/08/05 05:44 [entrez]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.62.733 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2021;62(7):733-738. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.62.733.,733-738,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we introduce Differential Subclone Eradication and Resistance (DSER) analysis, a method developed to identify molecular targets for improved therapy by direct comparison of genomic features of eradicated and resistant subclones in pre- and posttreatment samples from a patient with BRCA2-deficient metastatic prostate cancer. FANCI and EYA4 were identified as candidate DNA repair-related targets for converting subclones from resistant to eradicable, and RNAi-mediated depletion of FANCI confirmed it as a potential target. The EYA4 alteration was associated with adjacent L1 transposon insertion during cancer evolution upon treatment, raising questions surrounding the role of therapy in L1 activation. Both carboplatin and enzalutamide turned on L1 transposon machinery in LNCaP and VCaP but not in PC3 and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell lines. L1 activation in LNCaP and VCaP was inhibited by the antiretroviral drug azidothymidine. L1 activation was also detected postcastration in LuCaP 77 and LuCaP 105 xenograft models and postchemotherapy in previously published time-series transcriptomic data from SCC25 head and neck cancer cells. In conclusion, DSER provides an informative intermediate step toward effective precision cancer medicine and should be tested in future studies, especially those including dramatic but temporary metastatic tumor regression. L1 transposon activation may be a modifiable source of cancer genomic heterogeneity, suggesting the potential of leveraging newly discovered triggers and blockers of L1 activity to overcome therapy resistance. SIGNIFICANCE: Differential analysis of eradicated and resistant subclones following cancer treatment identifies that L1 activity associated with resistance is induced by current therapies and blocked by the antiretroviral drug azidothymidine.","['Ketola, Kirsi', 'Kaljunen, Heidi', 'Taavitsainen, Sinja', 'Kaarijarvi, Roosa', 'Jarvela, Emmi', 'Rodriguez-Martin, Bernardo', 'Haase, Kerstin', 'Woodcock, Dan J', 'Tubio, Jose', 'Wedge, David C', 'Nykter, Matti', 'Bova, G Steven']","['Ketola K', 'Kaljunen H', 'Taavitsainen S', 'Kaarijarvi R', 'Jarvela E', 'Rodriguez-Martin B', 'Haase K', 'Woodcock DJ', 'Tubio J', 'Wedge DC', 'Nykter M', 'Bova GS']","['Institute of Biomedicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland. kirsi.ketola@uef.fi steve.bova@tuni.fi.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University and Tays Cancer Center, Tampere, Finland.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Genomes and Disease, Centre for Research in Molecular Medicine and Chronic Diseases (CIMUS), Universidade de Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Department of Zoology, Genetics and Physical Anthropology, Universidade de Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Experimental and Clinical Research Center, Charite and the Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Big Data Institute, University of Oxford, Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Information and Discovery, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Genomes and Disease, Centre for Research in Molecular Medicine and Chronic Diseases (CIMUS), Universidade de Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Department of Zoology, Genetics and Physical Anthropology, Universidade de Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Manchester Cancer Research Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University and Tays Cancer Center, Tampere, Finland.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University and Tays Cancer Center, Tampere, Finland. kirsi.ketola@uef.fi steve.bova@tuni.fi.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5249-2508', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7572-3196', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1639-3104']",['eng'],['CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210908,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Retroelements)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Autopsy', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clonal Evolution/*genetics', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Silencing', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics/methods', 'Humans', '*Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements/drug effects', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Retroelements', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,2021/08/06 06:00,2022/01/04 06:00,['2021/08/05 05:43'],"['2021/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/05 05:43 [entrez]']","['0008-5472.CAN-21-0371 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-21-0371 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2021 Oct 1;81(19):4901-4909. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-21-0371.

Each case with a first reported cancer between 1999 and 2017 was matched with up to 4 controls: by age (+/-2-years) and year of cancer diagnosis. Conditional logistic regressions were adjusted for sex, lung function (FEV1%), CF related diabetes (CFRD), F508del status, transplant status, DIOS, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, meconium ileus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, pancreatic insufficiency, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use, IV antibiotic days and BMI. Results: From 12,886 registered patients, 146 (1.1%) cases of malignancy were identified with 14.3% of cases occurring post solid organ transplant. Site of primary cancer was available for 98 patients: 22% were gastro-intestinal in origin (77% lower, 23% upper GI), 13% skin, 13% breast and 11% lymphomas/leukaemia. In univariable analysis, transplantation increased the odds of reporting any cancer by 2.46 times (95%CI: 1.3-4.6). CFRD also increased the odds of reporting any cancer (OR 2.35; CI: 1.37-4.0) and PPI use (OR 2.0; CI 1.28-3.19). In the multivariable models significant associations with CFRD and transplant remained, while PA infection, PPI use and being overweight showed increased, but statistically insignificant risks. The incidence of GI cancer was strongly associated with CFRD (OR=4.04; 1.47-11.1). Conclusions: We observed a high incidence of lower GI cancers in our cohort which was significantly affected by the presence of CFRD. Screening for gastrointestinal cancers could benefit patients at higher risk.","['Archangelidi, Olga', 'Cullinan, Paul', 'Simmonds, Nicholas J', 'Mentzakis, Emmanouil', 'Peckham, Daniel', 'Bilton, Diana', 'Carr, Siobhan B']","['Archangelidi O', 'Cullinan P', 'Simmonds NJ', 'Mentzakis E', 'Peckham D', 'Bilton D', 'Carr SB']","['National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College, London; Amgem Ltd.', 'National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College, London; Royal Brompton Hospital, London.', 'National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College, London; Royal Brompton Hospital, London.', 'Economics Department, University of Southampton.', ""St James's University Hospital, Leeds."", 'National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College, London; Royal Brompton Hospital, London.', 'National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College, London; Royal Brompton Hospital, London.

Real-Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to examine serum levels of CDT1 in childhood ALL patients and healthy volunteers. The interaction between CDT1 expression and prognosis of childhood ALL was analyzed. Meanwhile, expressions of CDT1 in ALL cell lines were determined. Furthermore, CDT1 knockdown model was constructed in ALL cells, and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), and Transwell assays were conducted to analyze the effect of CDT1 on the biological functions of ALL cells. Potential mechanism was further explored through detecting the expressions of Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes. RT-qPCR results indicated that serum level of CDT1 in childhood ALL patients was remarkably higher than that of healthy volunteers. Childhood ALL patients with high expression of CDT1 had lower overall survival rate compared with those expressing low expression of CDT1. CDT1 knockdown remarkably decreased the proliferation and metastasis abilities of pediatric ALL cells. Results of western blot showed that CDT1 might contribute to the malignant progression of childhood ALL via activating EMT. The findings showed that elevated CDT1 facilitated ALL metastasis by promoting EMT, suggesting that CDT1 played a pivotal role in ALL metastasis and may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.","['Shi, H X', 'Huang, S W', 'Luo, W J', 'Pan, F', 'Jin, H J', 'Wei, W']","['Shi HX', 'Huang SW', 'Luo WJ', 'Pan F', 'Jin HJ', 'Wei W']","['Department of Pediatrics, Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital of Zhangqiu District, Jinan, China.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Zhangqiu District People's Hospital, Jinan, China."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Jiyang People's Hospital, Jinan, China."", ""Department of Obstetrics, Zhangqiu District People's Hospital, Jinan China."", ""Department of Obstetrics, Zhangqiu District People's Hospital, Jinan China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhangqiu District People's Hospital, Jinan, China.""]",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210730,Italy,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,8809253,"['0 (CDT1 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Cdc10 protein-dependent transcript 1 (CDT1)', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'invasion', 'migration', 'proliferation']",2021/08/06 06:00,2021/09/01 06:00,['2021/08/05 05:39'],"['2021/08/05 05:39 [entrez]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.23812/21-SI1-6 [doi]', '6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents. 2021 Jul 30;35(Special Issue on Internal Medicine n.1). pii: 6. doi: 10.23812/21-SI1-6.

Although several different AML prognostic scoring models have been proposed to assess the prognosis of patients, the accuracy still needs to be improved. As important components of the tumor microenvironment, immune cells played important roles in the physiological functions of tumors and had certain research value. Therefore, whether the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) can be used to assess the prognosis of AML aroused our great interest. METHODS: The patients' gene expression profile from 7 GEO databases was normalized after removing the batch effect. TIME cell components were explored through Xcell tools and then hierarchically clustered to establish TIME classification. Subsequently, a prognostic model was established by Lasso-Cox. Multiple GEO databases and the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset were employed to validate the prognostic performance of the model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and the concordance index (C-index) were utilized to assess the prognostic efficacy. RESULTS: After analyzing the composition of TIME cells in AML, we found infiltration of ten types of cells with prognostic significance. Then using hierarchical clustering methods, we established a TIME classification system, which clustered all patients into three groups with distinct prognostic characteristics. Using the differential genes between the first and third groups in the TIME classification, we constructed a 121-gene prognostic model. The model successfully divided 1229 patients into the low and high groups which had obvious differences in prognosis. The high group with shorter overall survival had more patients older than 60 years and more poor-risk patients (both P< 0.001). Besides, the model can perform well in multiple datasets and could further stratify the cytogenetically normal AML patients and intermediate-risk AML population. Compared with the European Leukemia Net Risk Stratification System and other AML prognostic models, our model had the highest C-index and the largest AUC of the ROC curve, which demonstrated that our model had the best prognostic efficacy. CONCLUSION: A prognostic model for AML based on the TIME classification was constructed in our study, which may provide a new strategy for precision treatment in AML.","['Zeng, Tiansheng', 'Cui, Longzhen', 'Huang, Wenhui', 'Liu, Yan', 'Si, Chaozeng', 'Qian, Tingting', 'Deng, Cong', 'Fu, Lin']","['Zeng T', 'Cui L', 'Huang W', 'Liu Y', 'Si C', 'Qian T', 'Deng C', 'Fu L']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Education Department Key Laboratory of Nano-Immunoregulation Tumor Microenvironment, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Education Department Key Laboratory of Nano-Immunoregulation Tumor Microenvironment, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China.', 'Information Center, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, 100029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Education Department Key Laboratory of Nano-Immunoregulation Tumor Microenvironment, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Education Department Key Laboratory of Nano-Immunoregulation Tumor Microenvironment, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China. fulin022@126.com.', 'Translational Medicine Center, State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China. fulin022@126.com.', 'Guangdong Provincial Education Department Key Laboratory of Nano-Immunoregulation Tumor Microenvironment, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510260, China. fulin022@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng, 475000, China. fulin022@126.com.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210805,England,BMC Med,BMC medicine,101190723,,IM,"['Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve', 'Transcriptome', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC8340489,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Precision treatment', '*Prognostic model', '*Tumor immune microenvironment classification']",2021/08/06 06:00,2021/10/16 06:00,['2021/08/05 05:34'],"['2021/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/05 05:34 [entrez]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12916-021-02047-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12916-021-02047-9 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med. 2021 Aug 5;19(1):176. doi: 10.1186/s12916-021-02047-9.,176,['(c) 2021.

Go6976, as a type of indolocarbazole and shows strong antitumor effects, but there have been no reports on the effect of Go6976 on CML. The objectives of this research were: (1) to explore the impact of Go6976 on CML in vitro and in vivo; and (2) to explore the drug toxicity of Go6976 to normal cells and animals.Methods:K562 cells and CML mice were used to explore the effect of Go6976 on CML. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), CD34+ cells, and healthy mice were used to explore the drug toxicity of Go6976.Results: Cell experiments showed that Go6976 could inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells and enhance the inhibitory effects of imatinib at 5 muM and 10 muM, but it had little effect on CD34+ cells or PBMCs at concentrations less than 5 muM. Animal experiments showed that 2.5 mg/kg Go6976 could effectively inhibit the development of CML in mice, and it had almost no effects on healthy mice at 2.5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg.Discussion: Because of the direct inhibitory effect of Go6976 on CML and its pharmacological enhancement effect on imatinib, it is foreseeable that Go6976 could become a new type of anti-CML medicine. And the further research is needed.Conclusion: Our findings verified that Go6976 could effectively inhibit CML in vitro and in vivo, and it is almost nontoxic to hematopoietic cells, immune cells, and healthy mice.","['Cao, Zhen-Rui', 'Chen, Xiao-Peng', 'Feng, Min', 'Hou, Yun-Long', 'Li, Yan', 'Hu, Xiao-Lei', 'Huang, Zheng-Lan', 'Hu, Jing']","['Cao ZR', 'Chen XP', 'Feng M', 'Hou YL', 'Li Y', 'Hu XL', 'Huang ZL', 'Hu J']","[""The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."", ""The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."", ""Neuroscience Research Center, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhoukou Union Osteological Hospital, Zhoukou, People's Republic of China."", ""The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, People's Republic of China.""]",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8276-0411'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Video-Audio Media']",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Carbazoles)', '136194-77-9 (Go 6976)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbazoles/agonists/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Drug Agonism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/agonists/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,['NOTNLM'],"['310.4710', '320.2430', 'Go6976', 'K562', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'toxicity']",2021/08/06 06:00,2021/08/20 06:00,['2021/08/05 05:29'],"['2021/08/05 05:29 [entrez]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2021.1945235 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2021 Dec;26(1):543-551. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2021.1945235.,543-551,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The improvement of APL outcome is mainly due to two agents, which target the typical translocation t(15;17) and its fusion transcript PML-RARalpha responsible for initiating and maintaining the disease: all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO). The story of APL represents a pioneering model for the development of precision medicine and curative chemotherapy-free approaches for acute leukemia. AREA COVERED: The authors examine the major advances in the treatment of patients with APL focusing on three different eras: 1) the pre-ATRA era; 2) the ATRA era; 3) the ATO era. EXPERT OPINION: The combination of ATRA and ATO is effective and curative for the majority of APL patients. It has been approved for low/intermediate risk cases while an experimental trial with a minimal addition of chemotherapy for high-risk ones is ongoing. Disease relapse is infrequent and can be cured with ATRA-ATO rechallenging, with or without subsequent transplantation depending on the interval between complete remission and relapse. New therapeutic landscapes contemplate the use of an oral chemo-free ATRA-ATO combination, implementing treatment as outpatient care, thus increasing quality of life and decreasing medical costs.","['Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Molica, Matteo', 'Bernardi, Massimo']","['Ferrara F', 'Molica M', 'Bernardi M']","['Divion of Hematology, Cardarelli Hospital, Naples, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, S.

Meanwhile, the effect of BR-1 on the biological characteristics of AML cells and the underlying mechanism was investigated along with the combination of BR-1 and sorafenib on the AML cell viability. Our results show that BR-1 promotes apoptosis by inactivation of the JAK/STAT5 and PI3K/AKT pathways, while inhibits cell proliferation through arresting cell cycle in the S phase. In addition, a combination of BR-1 with sorafenib can further improve the therapeutic effect on AML. Thus, our results demonstrated that BR-1 would be a novel and potent therapeutic agent to AML, and its combination with other anti-AML drugs would be a promising strategy for AML therapy.","['Chen, Xiaomin', 'Rong, Dade', 'Cai, Wanhua', 'Tong, Xiuzhen', 'Wang, Haihe']","['Chen X', 'Rong D', 'Cai W', 'Tong X', 'Wang H']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210617,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,['9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)'],IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Liver', '*Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Sorafenib']",,,,2021/08/06 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2021/08/05 05:24'],"['2021/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/05 05:24 [entrez]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.4149/neo_2021_210301N265 [doi]', '210301N265 [pii]']",ppublish,Neoplasma. 2021 Jul;68(4):832-841. doi: 10.4149/neo_2021_210301N265.

To this end, we investigated the therapeutic potential of clofarabine in primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia in trial CoALL 08-09. The primary study objective was the minimal residual disease (MRD)-based comparative assessment of cytotoxic efficacies of clofarabine 5x40 mg/m2 versus high-dose cytarabine (HIDAC) 4x3g/m2, both in combination with PEG-ASP 2500 IU/m2 as randomized intervention in early consolidation. The secondary objective was an outcome analysis focused on treatment-arm dependence and MRD after randomized intervention. In B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL, eradication of MRD was more profound after clofarabine compared to cytarabine, with 93 vs 79 of 143 randomized patients per arm reaching MRD-negativity (Chi-square test P=.03, left-sided P(Fisher's exact test)=.04). MRD status of BCP-ALL after randomized intervention maintained its prognostic relevance, with a significant impact on event-free survival (EFS) and relapse rate. However, no difference in outcome regarding EFS and overall survival (OS) between randomized courses was observed (5- year EFS: clofarabine 85.7, SE=4.1 vs HIDAC 84.8, SE=4.7 (P=.96); OS: 95.7, SE=1.9 vs 92.2, SE=3.2 (P=.59)), independent of covariates or overall risk strata. Severe toxicities between randomized and subsequent treatment elements were also without significant difference. In conclusion, clofarabine/PEG-ASP is effective and safe, but greater cytotoxic efficacy of clofarabine compared to HIDAC did not translate into improved outcomes indicating a lack of surrogacy of post-intervention MRD at the trial level as opposed to the patient level, which hampers a broader implementation of this regimen in the frontline treatment of ALL.","['Escherich, Gabriele', 'Zur Stadt, Udo', 'Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Dilloo, Dagmar', 'Faber, Jorg', 'Feuchtinger, Tobias', 'Imschweiler, Thomas', 'Jorch, Norbert', 'Pekrun, Arnulf', 'Schmid, Irene', 'Schramm, Franziska', 'Spohn, Michael', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Horstmann, Martin A']","['Escherich G', 'Zur Stadt U', 'Borkhardt A', 'Dilloo D', 'Faber J', 'Feuchtinger T', 'Imschweiler T', 'Jorch N', 'Pekrun A', 'Schmid I', 'Schramm F', 'Spohn M', 'Zimmermann M', 'Horstmann MA']","['Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg. escherich@uke.de.', 'Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Mainz, Mainz.', ""Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Helios Hospital, Krefeld.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Protestant Hospital of Bethel Foundation, Bielefeld.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hospital Bremen-Mitte.', ""Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich."", 'Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg.', ""Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany; Research Institute Children's Cancer Center Hamburg, Germany; Bioinformatics Core Unit, University Medical Center Hamburg."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical School Hannover, Hannover.', ""Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany; Research Institute Children's Cancer Center Hamburg. horstmann@uke.de.""]",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210805,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,,,,,2021/08/06 06:00,2021/08/06 06:00,['2021/08/05 03:36'],"['2021/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/05 03:36 [entrez]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3324/haematol.2021.279357 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Haematologica. 2021 Aug 5. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2021.279357.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Excluding inv(16) with trisomy 22, our data indicate that the outcome of CBF-AML patients with FLT3-ITD seems to be inferior compared to published data on those without FLT3-ITD, suggesting that prognostically these patients should not be classified as favorable-risk. FLT3-inhibitors may improve outcome in those patients.","['Kayser, Sabine', 'Kramer, Michael', 'Martinez-Cuadron, David', 'Grenet, Justin', 'Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Sustkova, Zuzana', 'Luskin, Marlise R', 'Brunner, Andrew M', 'Elliott, Michelle A', 'Gil, Cristina', 'Marini, Sandra Casal', 'Racil, Zdenek', 'Cetkovsky, Petr', 'Novak, Jan', 'Perl, Alexander E', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Stolzel, Friedrich', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Rollig, Christoph', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Levis, Mark J']","['Kayser S', 'Kramer M', 'Martinez-Cuadron D', 'Grenet J', 'Metzeler KH', 'Sustkova Z', 'Luskin MR', 'Brunner AM', 'Elliott MA', 'Gil C', 'Marini SC', 'Racil Z', 'Cetkovsky P', 'Novak J', 'Perl AE', 'Platzbecker U', 'Stolzel F', 'Ho AD', 'Thiede C', 'Stone RM', 'Rollig C', 'Montesinos P', 'Schlenk RF', 'Levis MJ']","['Medical Clinic and Policlinic I, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany; NCT Trial Center, National Center of Tumor Diseases, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany; Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg. s.kayser@dkfz-heidelberg.de.', 'Department of Medicine I, University Hospital Carl-Gustav-Carus, Dresden.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic, La Fe, Valencia, Spain; CIBERONC, Instituto Carlos III, Madrid.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic I, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany; Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Masaryk University and University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Hospital General, Alicante.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Centro Hospitalar e Universitario de Coimbra, Coimbra.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Masaryk University and University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic; Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Haematology, 3rd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Faculty Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady, Charles University Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic I, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig.', 'Department of Medicine I, University Hospital Carl-Gustav-Carus, Dresden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg.', 'Department of Medicine I, University Hospital Carl-Gustav-Carus, Dresden.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medicine I, University Hospital Carl-Gustav-Carus, Dresden.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic, La Fe, Valencia, Spain; CIBERONC, Instituto Carlos III, Madrid.', 'NCT Trial Center, National Center of Tumor Diseases, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany; Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany; Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210805,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,,,,,2021/08/06 06:00,2021/08/06 06:00,['2021/08/05 03:36'],"['2021/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/05 03:36 [entrez]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3324/haematol.2021.278645 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Haematologica. 2021 Aug 5. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2021.278645.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow aspirate specimens of 91 patients was performed by standard Giemsa (G)-banding and interphase FISH (iFISH). RESULTS: The frequency of chromosomal abnormalities detected by G-banding was 29.5%, and the frequency of nonrandom abnormalities with independent prognostic significance identified by iFISH was 46.4%. The abnormality with the highest frequency was gain of RUNX1 (n = 18, 21.4%), followed by ETV6/RUNX1 fusion (n = 7, 8.3%), and gain of KMT2A (n = 6, 7.1%). Additionally, rarely reported gains of ETV6, PBX1, and ABL1 were observed at a frequency of 6% (n = 5), and the deletion of ETV6 and TCF3 was seen at a frequency of 3.6% (n = 3) and 2.3% (n = 2), respectively.

The role of the Fanconi anemia pathway in DNA repair mechanisms and genome instability is well studied. However, the consequences of inherited mutations in genes encoding the FA proteins and the acquired mutations due to impaired DNA repair complex in immune cells are far from understood. Patients with FA show bone marrow failure (BMF) and have a higher risk of developing myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) which are directly related to having chromosomal instability in hematopoietic stem cells and their subsequent progeny. However, immune dysregulation can also be seen in FA. As mature descendants of the common lymphoid progenitor line, NK cells taken from FA patients are dysfunctional in both NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine production. The molecular bases for these defects are yet to be determined. However, recent studies have provided directions to define the cause and effect of inherited and acquired mutations in FA patients. Here, we summarize the recent studies in the hematopoietic dysfunction, focusing on the impairment in the development and functions of NK cells in FA patients, and discuss the possible mechanisms and future directions.","['Hashemi, Elaheh', 'Bjorgaard, Stacey', 'Wang, Dandan', 'Uyemura, Bradley', 'Riese, Matthew', 'Thakar, Monica S', 'Malarkannan, Subramaniam']","['Hashemi E', 'Bjorgaard S', 'Wang D', 'Uyemura B', 'Riese M', 'Thakar MS', 'Malarkannan S']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Immunotherapy, Blood Research Institute, Versiti, Milwaukee, WI; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee WI.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Immunotherapy, Blood Research Institute, Versiti, Milwaukee, WI.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Immunotherapy, Blood Research Institute, Versiti, Milwaukee, WI; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee WI.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Immunotherapy, Blood Research Institute, Versiti, Milwaukee, WI.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Immunotherapy, Blood Research Institute, Versiti, Milwaukee, WI; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee WI; Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Immunotherapy, Blood Research Institute, Versiti, Milwaukee, WI; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee WI; Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI; Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee WI.']",,['eng'],"['R01 AI102893/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA179363/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Crit Rev Immunol,Critical reviews in immunology,8914819,,IM,"['*Fanconi Anemia/genetics', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mutation', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes']",,,,2021/08/05 06:00,2021/11/10 06:00,['2021/08/04 17:29'],"['2021/08/04 17:29 [entrez]', '2021/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['22112e6d37005af7,0099a99b42d713b2 [pii]', '10.1615/CritRevImmunol.2021037644 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Immunol. 2021;41(2):35-44. doi: 10.1615/CritRevImmunol.2021037644.,35-44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the many compounds studied, the ruthenium-based complex NAMI-A embodies the unique paradigm of the ability to selectively inhibiting and preventing the development and the growth of distant metastases originating from solid tumors in all the tumor models on which it has been tested. An activity that can be detected only in vivo since the compound is virtually free of measurable direct cell cytotoxicity in vitro. Recently, a published paper reported on a significant in vitro cytotoxicity against some leukemic cells. The present study was undertaken to reproduce those experiments to further support this novel antileukemic activity that would have put NAMI-A on a new trajectory for development. Our results do not confirm the efficacy of NAMI-A in vitro against the human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line either using test cultures identical to those reported in the study of reference or in even more stressed conditions, supporting the lack of in vitro direct cell cytotoxicity of NAMI-A. The present study also helps to elucidate that many factors can influence the outcome of in vitro tests of cytotoxicity and suggests caution to speculate on possible therapeutic properties based on the results of simple and reductive in vitro tests of cytotoxicity.","['Bergamo, Alberta', 'Sava, Gianni']","['Bergamo A', 'Sava G']","['Callerio Foundation Onlus, Via A.

It remains a major problem to solve in cancer therapy. The mechanisms of resistance are multifactorial, and in our cellular models of acute myeloid leukemia, hepatocellular carcinoma, and triple-negative breast cancer, it involves the NF-kappaB pathway. In our opinion, multitarget molecules can be considered as privileged compounds capable of attacking and reversing the resistant phenotype. In the phenomena of both innate and acquired drug resistance that we have been studying since 1998 to today and up to 2016 under the guidance of Professor Natale D'Alessandro, more strictly pharmacological factors are certainly involved. These factors include P-glycoprotein and biological factors such as inhibitory proteins; apoptosis; the Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein, an important tumor suppressor and metastasis inhibitor, which enhances drug-induced apoptosis of cancer cells; and Yin Yang, a transcription factor involved in drug resistance.","['Poma, Paola', 'Labbozzetta, Manuela', 'Notarbartolo, Monica']","['Poma P', 'Labbozzetta M', 'Notarbartolo M']","['Pharmacology Unit, Department of Health Sciences and Mother and Child Care ""G.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ribociclib was administered orally once daily for 16 days after TOTEM for 5 days (arm A) or for 21 days with everolimus orally once daily continuously in a 28-day cycle (arm B). Dose escalation followed the continuous reassessment method, and activity assessment the Ensign design. Arms were enriched on the basis of molecular alterations in the cell cycle or PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were included, 14 in arm A and 18 in arm B, and 31 were treated. Fourteen patients had sarcomas (43.8%), and 13 brain tumors (40.6%). Main toxicities were leukopenia, neutropenia, and lymphopenia. The recommended phase II dose was ribociclib 260 mg/m(2) once a day, temozolomide 100 mg/m(2) once a day, and topotecan 0.5 mg/m(2) once a day (arm A) and ribociclib 175 mg/m(2) once a day and everolimus 2.5 mg/m(2) once a day (arm B). Pharmacokinetic analyses confirmed the drug-drug interaction of ribociclib on everolimus exposure. Two patients (14.3%) had stable disease as best response in arm A, and seven (41.2%) in arm B, including one patient with T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia with significant blast count reduction. Alterations considered for enrichment were present in 25 patients (81%) and in eight of nine patients with stable disease; the leukemia exhibited CDKN2A/B and PTEN deficiency. CONCLUSION: Ribociclib in combination with TOTEM or everolimus was well-tolerated. The observed activity signals initiated a follow-up study of the ribociclib-everolimus combination in a population enriched with molecular alterations within both pathways.","['Bautista, Francisco', 'Paoletti, Xavier', 'Rubino, Jonathan', 'Brard, Caroline', 'Rezai, Keyvan', 'Nebchi, Souad', 'Andre, Nicolas', 'Aerts, Isabelle', 'De Carli, Emilie', 'van Eijkelenburg, Natasha', 'Thebaud, Estelle', 'Corradini, Nadege', 'Defachelles, Anne-Sophie', 'Ducassou, Stephane', 'Morscher, Raphael J', 'Vassal, Gilles', 'Geoerger, Birgit']","['Bautista F', 'Paoletti X', 'Rubino J', 'Brard C', 'Rezai K', 'Nebchi S', 'Andre N', 'Aerts I', 'De Carli E', 'van Eijkelenburg N', 'Thebaud E', 'Corradini N', 'Defachelles AS', 'Ducassou S', 'Morscher RJ', 'Vassal G', 'Geoerger B']","['Hospital Nino Jesus, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Madrid, Spain.', 'Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Biostatistics and Epidemiology Unit, INSERM U1018, CESP, Universite Paris-Saclay, UVSQ, Villejuif, France.', 'Current address: Institut Curie, INSERM U900 STAMPM, UVSQ, St Cloud, France.', 'Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Clinical Research Direction, Villejuif, France.', 'Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Biostatistics and Epidemiology Unit, INSERM U1018, CESP, Universite Paris-Saclay, UVSQ, Villejuif, France.', 'Institut Curie, Radio-Pharmacology Department, Saint Cloud, France.', 'Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Biostatistics and Epidemiology Unit, INSERM U1018, CESP, Universite Paris-Saclay, UVSQ, Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hopital de la Timone, AP-HM, Marseille, France.', 'UMR Inserm 1068, CNRS UMR 7258, Aix Marseille Universite U105, Marseille Cancer Research Center (CRCM), Marseille, France.', 'SIREDO Oncology Center (Care, Innovation and research for children and AYA with cancer), Institut Curie, PSL Research University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Hospital, Angers, France.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Nantes, France.', 'Pediatric Oncology Department, Institut of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Oscar Lambret Cancer Center, Lille, France.', 'Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Pellegrin-Hopital des Enfants, Bordeaux, France.', 'Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Oncology, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM U1015, Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', 'Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Clinical Research Direction, Villejuif, France.', 'Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Oncology, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM U1015, Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Universite Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, France.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0421-8862', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1250-0040', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2980-0779', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0196-4157', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6786-4968', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0577-0621', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1942-1222', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4277-9871', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1780-8869', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4361-3643']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210804,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', '9HW64Q8G6G (Everolimus)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'TK8ERE8P56 (ribociclib)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Aminopyridines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Everolimus/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Purines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Temozolomide/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', 'Topotecan/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,2021/08/05 06:00,2021/12/21 06:00,['2021/08/04 17:14'],"['2021/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/21 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/04 17:14 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.21.01152 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2021 Nov 10;39(32):3546-3560. doi: 10.1200/JCO.21.01152.

The BCR-ABL oncoprotein encoded by this fusion gene has been extensively studied. However, research on whether BCR-ABL also affects circular RNAs (circRNAs) is limited. This study aimed to explore the new fusion circRNAs produced by BCR-ABL and their role in CML cells. In this study, we identified a novel fusion circRNA, named F-circBA1, originating from BCR-ABL in K562 and K562/G01 cells using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Sanger sequencing. qRT-PCR of the nuclear RNA and cytoplasmic RNA were separated, indicating that F-circBA1 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm. Cell counting kit-8 assay and flow cytometry showed that F-circBA1 knockdown by shRNA prevented the proliferation of K562 and K562/G01 cells, and the cell cycle was arrested at G2/M. Mechanically, dual-luciferase reporter assay and western blotting assay showed that F-circBA1 sponged miR-148-3p and F-circBA1 silencing decreased CDC25B expression in vitro. Furthermore, the results of the murine leukemogenesis model showed that F-circBA1 knockdown suppressed leukemogenesis in vivo. Besides, we found the existence of F-circBA1 in some patients with BCR-ABL-positive CML. In conclusion, these results demonstrate the presence of F-circBA1 and its oncogenic role in CML cells.","['Tan, Yuan', 'Huang, Zhenglan', 'Wang, Xin', 'Dai, Hongdan', 'Jiang, Guoyun', 'Feng, Wenli']","['Tan Y', 'Huang Z', 'Wang X', 'Dai H', 'Jiang G', 'Feng W']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, School of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0889-8348'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Bioengineered,Bioengineered,101581063,"['0 (RNA, Circular)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Female', '*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', '*RNA, Circular/genetics/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*bcr-abl', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*fusion circRNAs', '*proliferation']",2021/08/05 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/08/04 12:18'],"['2021/08/04 12:18 [entrez]', '2021/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/21655979.2021.1957749 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioengineered. 2021 Dec;12(1):4816-4827. doi: 10.1080/21655979.2021.1957749.,4816-4827,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study is to investigate the relationship between the genetic variation and MTX-induced adverse drug effects. METHODS: A total of 80 paediatric patients (aged 1-14 years) were enrolled in this study. Toxicity was assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 scoring system. Genotyping was performed by MassARRAY Assay method. Data were analysed using Spss statistical package version 17.0 and Plink v1.07 software. The HWE was tested by a chi-square test. The Fisher's exact test (chi-squaretest) was used to compare the distributions of genotypes between cases and controls. OR and 95%CI were applied to evaluate the association of genetic variants with the presence of mucositis using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Mucosal inflammatory injuries were found in 28 children. SNPs of rs1128503 (p = 0.0022, OR = 3.04, 95%CI = 1.39-6.64) and rs1045642 (p = 0.0052, OR = 2.38, 95%CI = 1.15-5.00) located in the gene of ABCB1 and SNPs of rs1801133 (p = 0.040, OR = 2.50, 95%CI = 1.06-5.88) located in the gene of MTHFR show marked impacts on the risk of developing mucositis. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: SNPs of ABCB1 rs1128503, rs1045642 and MTHFR rs1801133 can be risk predictor for MTX-induced mucositis in Chinese paediatric patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, lymphoma or osteosarcoma.","['Gong, Yan', 'Luo, Li', 'Wang, Liu', 'Chen, Jun', 'Chen, Fen', 'Ma, Yuanyuan', 'Xu, Zhen', 'Sun, Yiqi', 'Luo, Lin', 'Shi, Chen', 'Li, Xingang']","['Gong Y', 'Luo L', 'Wang L', 'Chen J', 'Chen F', 'Ma Y', 'Xu Z', 'Sun Y', 'Luo L', 'Shi C', 'Li X']","['Department of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Union Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Union Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Union Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Union Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Union Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Union Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Union Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Service Center of Health Talents of BMHC, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Union Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4911-620X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5431-0918', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6726-9571']",['eng'],['7192060/Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality'],['Journal Article'],20210804,England,J Clin Pharm Ther,Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,8704308,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['genetic polymorphisms', 'methotrexate', 'mucositis', 'toxicity']",2021/08/05 06:00,2021/08/05 06:00,['2021/08/04 08:55'],"['2021/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/04 08:55 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcpt.13505 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharm Ther. 2021 Dec;46(6):1557-1563. doi: 10.1111/jcpt.13505.

Currently, vaccination is the best-evaluated preventive strategy. In the present study, we aimed to assess serological response, predictive markers, and safety of BNT162b2 in haemato-oncological patients. A total of 259 haemato-oncological patients were vaccinated with two 30 microg doses of BNT162b2 administered 21 days apart. Serological response was assessed by ELECSYS((R)) Anti-SARS-CoV-2-S immunoassay before vaccination, and at 3 and 7 weeks after the first dose (T1, T2). Safety assessment was performed. At T2 spike protein receptor binding domain (S/RBD) antibodies were detected in 71.4% of haematological and in 94.5% of oncological patients (P < 0.001). Haematological patients receiving systemic treatment had a 14.2-fold increased risk of non-responding (95% confidence interval 3.2-63.3, P = 0.001). Subgroups of patients with lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were at highest risk of serological non-response. Low immunoglobulin G (IgG) level, lymphocyte- and natural killer (NK)-cell counts were significantly associated with poor serological response (P < 0.05). Vaccination was well tolerated with only 2.7% of patients reporting severe side-effects. Patients with side-effects developed a higher S/RBD-antibody titre compared to patients without side-effects (P = 0.038). Haematological patients under treatment were at highest risk of serological non-response. Low lymphocytes, NK cells and IgG levels were found to be associated with serological non-response. Serological response in oncological patients was encouraging. The use of BNT162b2 is safe in haemato-oncological patients.","['Benda, Magdalena', 'Mutschlechner, Beatrix', 'Ulmer, Hanno', 'Grabher, Claudia', 'Severgnini, Luciano', 'Volgger, Andreas', 'Reimann, Patrick', 'Lang, Theresia', 'Atzl, Michele', 'Huynh, Minh', 'Gasser, Klaus', 'Petrausch, Ulf', 'Fraunberger, Peter', 'Hartmann, Bernd', 'Winder, Thomas']","['Benda M', 'Mutschlechner B', 'Ulmer H', 'Grabher C', 'Severgnini L', 'Volgger A', 'Reimann P', 'Lang T', 'Atzl M', 'Huynh M', 'Gasser K', 'Petrausch U', 'Fraunberger P', 'Hartmann B', 'Winder T']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, Feldkirch Academic Teaching Hospital, Feldkirch, Austria.', 'Private University of the Principality of Liechtenstein, Triesen, Principality of Liechtenstein.', 'Private University of the Principality of Liechtenstein, Triesen, Principality of Liechtenstein.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Feldkirch Academic Teaching Hospital, Feldkirch, Austria.', 'Department of Medical Statistics, Informatics and Health Economics, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Medical Central Laboratories, Feldkirch, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Feldkirch Academic Teaching Hospital, Feldkirch, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Feldkirch Academic Teaching Hospital, Feldkirch, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Feldkirch Academic Teaching Hospital, Feldkirch, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Feldkirch Academic Teaching Hospital, Feldkirch, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Feldkirch Academic Teaching Hospital, Feldkirch, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Feldkirch Academic Teaching Hospital, Feldkirch, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Feldkirch Academic Teaching Hospital, Feldkirch, Austria.', 'University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Onkozentrum Zurich, Swiss Tumor Immunology Institute, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Medical Central Laboratories, Feldkirch, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Feldkirch Academic Teaching Hospital, Feldkirch, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Feldkirch Academic Teaching Hospital, Feldkirch, Austria.', 'University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4216-2994'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210803,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (COVID-19 Vaccines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', 'N38TVC63NU (BNT162 Vaccine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Antibody Formation/*drug effects/immunology', 'BNT162 Vaccine', 'COVID-19/blood/diagnosis/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'COVID-19 Vaccines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/immunology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay/methods', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'SARS-CoV-2/genetics/*immunology', 'Safety']",PMC8444745,['NOTNLM'],"['*BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine', '*COVID-19', '*chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', '*immune cells', '*serological response']",2021/08/05 06:00,2021/11/25 06:00,['2021/08/04 07:19'],"['2021/07/13 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/04 07:19 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.17743 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2021 Nov;195(4):523-531. doi: 10.1111/bjh.17743.

The virus infects type B lymphocytes and creates lymph glands tumors. Recently, the association between the presence of this virus and breast cancer has been addressed in humans. Here, we studied the prevalence of BLV in the samples of raw milk of native Iranian and Iranian-foreign cows in traditional, semi-industrial and industrial dairy farms in rural and urban areas of Zanjan province. Raw milk samples of cows were collected manually in sterile tubes. The samples were tested by nested-PCR method. Forty samples (9.93%) out of 403 samples showed BLV contamination. In this study, nested-PCR was successfully applied to determine the level of contamination in raw milk samples from cows infected with BLV. Furthermore, a relatively high rate of BLV infection was found in dairy cows in Zanjan province, northwestern of Iran.","['Barzegar, Hossein', 'Mirshahabi, Hessam', 'Motamed, Nima', 'Yavarmanesh, Masoud', 'Mahdavi Poor, Behroz', 'Moaddab, Seyyed Reza', 'Asgharzadeh, Mohammad']","['Barzegar H', 'Mirshahabi H', 'Motamed N', 'Yavarmanesh M', 'Mahdavi Poor B', 'Moaddab SR', 'Asgharzadeh M']","['Department of Microbiology and Virology, School of Medicine, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology and Virology, School of Medicine, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran.', 'Department of Social Medicine, School of Medicine, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran.', 'Department of Food science and Technology, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Paramedicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Paramedicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Faculty of Paramedicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210615,Iran,Vet Res Forum,Veterinary research forum : an international quarterly journal,101625812,,,,PMC8328253,['NOTNLM'],"['Bovine leukemia virus', 'Breast cancer', 'Milk', 'Nested-PCR']",2021/08/05 06:00,2021/08/05 06:01,['2021/08/04 07:06'],"['2019/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/04 07:06 [entrez]', '2021/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.30466/vrf.2019.102686.2446 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Res Forum. 2021 Spring;12(2):223-227. doi: 10.30466/vrf.2019.102686.2446.

Here, to identify novel targets for AML therapy, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen using AML cell lines, followed by a second screen in vivo. We show that PAICS, an enzyme involved in de novo purine biosynthesis, is a potential target for AML therapy. AML cells expressing shRNA-PAICS exhibited a proliferative disadvantage, indicating a toxic effect of shRNA-PAICS. Treatment of human AML cells with a PAICS inhibitor suppressed their proliferation by inhibiting DNA synthesis and promoting apoptosis and had anti-leukemic effects in AML PDX models. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 screens using AML cells in the presence of the inhibitor revealed genes mediating resistance or synthetic lethal to PAICS inhibition. Our findings identify PAICS as a novel therapeutic target for AML and further define components of de novo purine synthesis pathway and its downstream effectors essential for AML cell survival.","['Yamauchi, Takuji', 'Miyawaki, Kohta', 'Semba, Yuichiro', 'Takahashi, Masatomo', 'Izumi, Yoshihiro', 'Nogami, Jumpei', 'Nakao, Fumihiko', 'Sugio, Takeshi', 'Sasaki, Kensuke', 'Pinello, Luca', 'Bauer, Daniel E', 'Bamba, Takeshi', 'Akashi, Koichi', 'Maeda, Takahiro']","['Yamauchi T', 'Miyawaki K', 'Semba Y', 'Takahashi M', 'Izumi Y', 'Nogami J', 'Nakao F', 'Sugio T', 'Sasaki K', 'Pinello L', 'Bauer DE', 'Bamba T', 'Akashi K', 'Maeda T']","['Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Center for Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Division of Metabolomics, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Division of Metabolomics, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Center for Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA, 02129, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, 02129, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", 'Division of Metabolomics, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Center for Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan. maeda.takahiro.294@m.kyushu-u.ac.jp.', 'Division of Precision Medicine, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan. maeda.takahiro.294@m.kyushu-u.ac.jp.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7442-2738', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4530-6460']",['eng'],"['16H06391/MEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)', '18063889/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)']",['Journal Article'],20210803,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,,,,,2021/08/05 06:00,2021/08/05 06:00,['2021/08/04 06:55'],"['2021/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/04 06:55 [entrez]', '2021/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41375-021-01369-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-021-01369-0 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Leukemia. 2021 Aug 3. pii: 10.1038/s41375-021-01369-0. doi: 10.1038/s41375-021-01369-0.,,"['(c) 2021.

PARTICIPANTS: Children who undergone CC procedures from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2013, before the age of 16 in one of the 15 paediatric cardiology departments which perform paediatric CC in mainland France were included. The follow-up started at the date of the first recorded CC procedure until the exit date, that is, the date of death, the date of first cancer diagnosis, the date of the 18th birthday or the 31 December 2015, whichever occurred first. The cohort was linked to the National Childhood Cancer Registry to identify patients diagnosed with cancer and with the French National Directory for the Identification of Natural Persons to retrieve the patients' vital status. FINDINGS TO DATE: A total of 17 104 children were included in the cohort and followed for 110 335 person-years, with 22 227 CC procedures collected. Among the patients, 81.6% received only one procedure. Fifty-nine cancer cases were observed in the cohort. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were increased for all-cancer (SIR=3.8, 95% CI: 2.9 to 4.9), leukaemia (SIR=3.3, 95% CI: 2.0 to 5.4), lymphoma (SIR=14.9, 95% CI: 9.9 to 22.5) and solid cancers excluding central nervous system (CNS) tumours (SIR=3.3, 95% CI: 2.0 to 5.5) compared with the general population. FUTURE PLANS: Dose reconstruction is currently underway to estimate individual cumulative doses absorbed to relevant organs, including red bone marrow and brain for respectively haematologic disorders and CNS tumours risk estimation. A dose-response analysis will be conducted with consideration to confounding factors such as age at exposure, gender, predisposing factors to cancer and other sources of medical diagnostic low-dose ionising radiation.","['Abalo, Kossi Dovene', 'Malekzadeh-Milani, Sophie', 'Hascoet, Sebastien', 'Dreuil, Serge', 'Feuillet, Tiphaine', 'Cohen, Sarah', 'Dauphin, Claire', 'Filippo, Sylvie Di', 'Douchin, Stephanie', 'Godart, Francois', 'Guerin, Patrice', 'Helms, Pauline', 'Karsenty, Clement', 'Lefort, Bruno', 'Mauran, Pierre', 'Ovaert, Caroline', 'Piechaud, Jean-Francois', 'Thambo, Jean-Benoit', 'Leuraud, Klervi', 'Bonnet, Damien', 'Bernier, Marie-Odile', 'Rage, Estelle']","['Abalo KD', 'Malekzadeh-Milani S', 'Hascoet S', 'Dreuil S', 'Feuillet T', 'Cohen S', 'Dauphin C', 'Filippo SD', 'Douchin S', 'Godart F', 'Guerin P', 'Helms P', 'Karsenty C', 'Lefort B', 'Mauran P', 'Ovaert C', 'Piechaud JF', 'Thambo JB', 'Leuraud K', 'Bonnet D', 'Bernier MO', 'Rage E']","['PSE-SANTE/SESANE/Laboratory of Epidemiology, Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN), Fontenay-aux-Roses, Ile-de-France, France kossi.abalo@irsn.fr.', 'Department of Congenital and Pediatric Cardiology, Necker-Sick Children University Hospital, M3C-Necker, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Paediatric and Congenital Cardiac Surgery Department, M3C Marie-Lannelongue Hospital, National Reference Centre, Groupe Hospitalier Saint-Joseph, Paris Saclay University, Plessis-Robinson, France.', 'PSE-SANTE/SER/UEM, Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN), Fontenay-aux-Roses, Ile-de-France, France.', 'AMAREXIA, Paris, France.', 'Paediatric and Congenital Cardiac Surgery Department, M3C Marie-Lannelongue Hospital, National Reference Centre, Groupe Hospitalier Saint-Joseph, Paris Saclay University, Plessis-Robinson, France.', 'Cardiology and Vascular Department, Hopital Gabriel Montpied, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'Paediatric and Congential Cardiology Department, Hopital Cardiologique Louis Pradel, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Lyon, France.', 'Cardiopediatrie, Hopital couple enfant, CHU Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble cedex 9, France, Grenoble, France.', 'Service de Cardiologie Infantile et Congenitale, Institut Coeur Poumon, Lille Cedex, Lille, France.', 'Clinique Cardiologique et des Maladies Vasculaires, CIC 1413, Institut du Thorax, Cardiopediatrie, CHU Nantes, INSERM, Nantes Universite, Nantes, France.', 'Unit of Cardiopediatrics, University Hospital of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', ""Pediatric and Congenital Cardiology, Children's Hospital and INSERM U1048, I2MC, Institut des Maladies Metaboliques et Cardiovasculaires, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France."", 'Institut des Cardiopathies Congenitales, CHRU Tours, Tours, France.', 'Unite de cardiologie pediatrique et congenitale, American Memorial Hospital, CHU de Reims, 47 rue Cognacq-Jay, Reims Cedex, Reims, France.', 'Cardiologie pediatrique et congenitale, Timone enfants, AP-HM et INSERM 1251, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France.', 'Institut Cardiovasculaire Paris Sud, Institut Hospitalier Jacques-Cartier, Massy, France.', 'Department of Pediatric and Adult Congenital Cardiology, Bordeaux University Hospital (CHU), Bordeaux, France.', 'PSE-SANTE/SESANE/Laboratory of Epidemiology, Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN), Fontenay-aux-Roses, Ile-de-France, France.', 'Department of Congenital and Pediatric Cardiology, Necker-Sick Children University Hospital, M3C-Necker, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', 'PSE-SANTE/SESANE/Laboratory of Epidemiology, Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN), Fontenay-aux-Roses, Ile-de-France, France.', 'PSE-SANTE/SESANE/Laboratory of Epidemiology, Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN), Fontenay-aux-Roses, Ile-de-France, France.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5064-0215', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6160-0670']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210803,England,BMJ Open,BMJ open,101552874,,IM,"['Cardiac Catheterization/adverse effects', 'Child', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",PMC8336117,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer pain', '*cardiology', '*congenital heart disease', '*epidemiology', '*paediatric cardiology', '*paediatric oncology']",2021/08/05 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2021/08/04 06:18'],"['2021/08/04 06:18 [entrez]', '2021/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['bmjopen-2020-048576 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048576 [doi]']",epublish,BMJ Open. 2021 Aug 3;11(8):e048576. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048576.,e048576,"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

This mini-review summarizes two of these viruses, EPV and HTLV-1, in terms of their general pathway of infection, the key mechanism of cancer induction, and the prominent technologies used to detect the infections. EBV is the first discovered human oncovirus and HTLV - I is the first human retrovirus and both were discovered from patient with distinct lymphoma clinical condition. Both the viruses can immortalize lymphocytes invitro and lymphomas are common manifestation of majority oncogenic viruses. Lymphomagenesis are discovered in associated with EBV, HTLV-I, Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Kaposi sarcoma - associated herpes virus and hepatitis c virus. Later the undefined mechanism behind the induction of cancer by these viruses was unveiled gradually along with the responsible cofactors and mimicry mechanism. These two viruses contrast in their genetic structure, location of the infection, and latency, yet clinically, they generate similar cancer disorders. The major focus of this study is to brief the mechanism of these two unrelated viral cancer promoting agents on how they simulate a condition similar to lymphoma which may or may not undergo mimicry and cofactor utilization process, handpicked and vital genes behind the transformation mechanism are given accordingly.","['Manivannan, Arun Chandra', 'Devaraju, Vinitha', 'Velmurugan, Palanivel', 'Sathiamoorthi, Thangavelu', 'Sivakumar, Subpiramaniyam', 'Subbiah, Suresh Kumar', 'Ravi, Arumugam Veera']","['Manivannan AC', 'Devaraju V', 'Velmurugan P', 'Sathiamoorthi T', 'Sivakumar S', 'Subbiah SK', 'Ravi AV']","['Department of Microbiology, Science Campus, Alagappa University, Karaikudi 630003, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Microbiology, PSG College of Arts and Science, Avinashi Road, Civil Aerodrome Post, Coimbatore 641014, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Science Campus, Alagappa University, Karaikudi 630003, Tamil Nadu, India; Centre for Materials engineering and Regenerative Medicne, Bharath Institute of Higer Eductaion and Research (BIHER), Chennai, India.

Dysregulation of these activities places this cytokine family as important mediators of autoimmunity, chronic inflammation and cancer. In this regard, ectopic lymphoid structures (ELS) are a pathological hallmark of many tissues affected by chronic disease. These inducible lymphoid aggregates form compartmentalised T cell and B cell zones, germinal centres, follicular dendritic cell networks and high endothelial venules, which are defining qualities of peripheral lymphoid organs. Accordingly, ELS can support local antigen-specific responses to self-antigens, alloantigens, pathogens and tumours. ELS often correlate with severe disease progression in autoimmune conditions, while tumour-associated ELS are associated with enhanced anti-tumour immunity and a favourable prognosis in cancer. Here, we discuss emerging roles for IL-6 family cytokines as regulators of ELS development, maintenance and activity and consider how modulation of these activities has the potential to aid the successful treatment of autoimmune conditions and cancers where ELS feature.","['Hill, David G', 'Ward, Amy', 'Nicholson, Lindsay B', 'Jones, Gareth W']","['Hill DG', 'Ward A', 'Nicholson LB', 'Jones GW']","['School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.

Residues 90-94 of SU are considered as a Nrp1 binding site, and our previous results show that an SU peptide consisting of residues 85-94 can bind directly to the Nrp1 b1 domain with a binding affinity of 7.4 muM. Therefore, the SU peptide is expected to be a good model to investigate the SU-Nrp1 interaction. Recently, the N93D mutation in the Nrp1 b1 binding region of the SU was identified in symptomatic patients with HTLV-1 infections in the Brazilian Amazon. However, it remains unclear how the SU-N93D mutation affects Nrp1 b1 binding. To elucidate the impact of the substituted Asp93 of SU on Nrp1 b1 binding, we analyzed the interaction between the SU-N93D peptide and Nrp1 b1 using isothermal titration calorimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance. The SU-N93D peptide binds directly to Nrp1 b1 with a binding affinity of 3.5 muM, which is approximately two-fold stronger than wild-type. This stronger binding is likely a result of the interaction between the substituted residue Asp93 of the N93D peptide and the four residues Trp301, Lys347, Glu348, and Thr349 of Nrp1 b1. Our results suggest that the interaction of SU Asp93 with the four residues of Nrp1 b1 renders the high affinity of the N93D mutant for Nrp1 b1 binding during HTLV-1 entry.","['Kusunoki, Hideki', 'Tanaka, Toshiyuki', 'Ohshima, Chinatsu', 'Sakamoto, Taiichi', 'Wakamatsu, Kaori', 'Hamaguchi, Isao']","['Kusunoki H', 'Tanaka T', 'Ohshima C', 'Sakamoto T', 'Wakamatsu K', 'Hamaguchi I']","['Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, 4-7-1 Gakuen, Musashimurayama, Tokyo 208-0011, Japan.

Inactivation of cell death is a key step in tumour development and also impedes effective response to cancer therapy. Precise execution of unwanted cells is achieved through regulated cell death processes including the intrinsic apoptotic pathway that is governed by the BCL-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) protein family. There is compelling evidence that intrinsic apoptosis is defective in prostate cancer, particularly in metastatic and castration resistant advanced disease, currently a lethal diagnosis. New therapeutics have been developed to target pro-survival BCL-2 proteins (including BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL-1) and show promise in reinstating apoptosis to destroy tumour cells in haematological cancers. Here we discuss perturbation of cell death in prostate cancer and how new therapeutics could improve treatment outcome in prostate cancer.","['Campbell, Kirsteen J', 'Leung, Hing Y']","['Campbell KJ', 'Leung HY']","['CRUK Beatson Institute, Garscube Estate, Switchback Road, Glasgow, G61 1BD, UK; Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Garscube Estate, Switchback Road, Glasgow, G61 1QH, UK.

Dysregulated ammonia metabolism, which is evident in many chronic diseases such as liver cirrhosis, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, initiates a hyperammonemic stress response in tissues including skeletal muscle and in myotubes. Perturbations in levels of specific regulatory molecules have been reported, but the global responses to hyperammonemia are unclear. In this study, we used a multiomics approach to vertically integrate unbiased data generated using an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing, RNA-Seq, and proteomics. We then horizontally integrated these data across different models of hyperammonemia, including myotubes and mouse and human muscle tissues. Changes in chromatin accessibility and/or expression of genes resulted in distinct clusters of temporal molecular changes including transient, persistent, and delayed responses during hyperammonemia in myotubes. Known responses to hyperammonemia, including mitochondrial and oxidative dysfunction, protein homeostasis disruption, and oxidative stress pathway activation, were enriched in our datasets. During hyperammonemia, pathways that impact skeletal muscle structure and function that were consistently enriched were those that contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and senescence. We made several novel observations, including an enrichment in antiapoptotic B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 family protein expression, increased calcium flux, and increased protein glycosylation in myotubes and muscle tissue upon hyperammonemia. Critical molecules in these pathways were validated experimentally. Human skeletal muscle from patients with cirrhosis displayed similar responses, establishing translational relevance. These data demonstrate complex molecular interactions during adaptive and maladaptive responses during the cellular stress response to hyperammonemia.","['Welch, Nicole', 'Singh, Shashi Shekhar', 'Kumar, Avinash', 'Dhruba, Saugato Rahman', 'Mishra, Saurabh', 'Sekar, Jinendiran', 'Bellar, Annette', 'Attaway, Amy H', 'Chelluboyina, Aruna', 'Willard, Belinda B', 'Li, Ling', 'Huo, Zhiguang', 'Karnik, Sadashiva S', 'Esser, Karyn', 'Longworth, Michelle S', 'Shah, Yatrik M', 'Davuluri, Gangarao', 'Pal, Ranadip', 'Dasarathy, Srinivasan']","['Welch N', 'Singh SS', 'Kumar A', 'Dhruba SR', 'Mishra S', 'Sekar J', 'Bellar A', 'Attaway AH', 'Chelluboyina A', 'Willard BB', 'Li L', 'Huo Z', 'Karnik SS', 'Esser K', 'Longworth MS', 'Shah YM', 'Davuluri G', 'Pal R', 'Dasarathy S']","['Department of Inflammation & Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Inflammation & Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Inflammation & Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Inflammation & Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Inflammation & Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Inflammation & Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Inflammation & Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA; Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Inflammation & Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Proteomics Research Core Services, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Proteomics Research Core Services, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, College of Public Health and Health Profession, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Functional Genomics, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Inflammation & Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Molecular & Integrative Physiology and Department of Gastroenterology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Integrated Physiology and Molecular Metabolism, Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas, USA.

The authors investigated the activity of the Fc-modified anti-CD19 antibody tafasitamab in adults with R/R B-ALL (NCT01685021). METHODS: Adults with R/R B-ALL received single-agent tafasitamab 12 mg/kg weekly for up to four 28-day cycles. Patients with complete remission (with or without neutrophil/platelet recovery; complete remission [CR] or complete remission with incomplete count recovery [CRi]) after cycles 2, 3, or 4 could continue tafasitamab every 2 weeks for up to 3 further months. The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR). RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were treated (median, 2 prior lines of therapy; range, 1-8). Six patients completed 2 cycles, and 2 of these patients responded for an ORR of 9%; 16 patients (73%) progressed before their first response assessment. Responses lasted 8 and 4 weeks in the 2 patients with CR and minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative CRi, respectively. Tafasitamab produced rapid B-cell/blast depletion in 21 of 22 patients within 1 to 2 weeks of first administration. Tafasitamab was well tolerated, with the most frequent adverse events being infusion-related reactions (59.1%) and fatigue (40.9%). Grade 3 to 4 febrile neutropenia (22.7%) was the most common hematologic adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: Tafasitamab monotherapy was associated with clinical activity in a subset of patients with R/R B-ALL, including short-lasting CR and MRD-negative CRi. Given its favorable tolerability profile, further development of tafasitamab in chemoimmunotherapy combinations and MRD settings should be explored.","['Klisovic, Rebecca B', 'Leung, Wing H', 'Brugger, Wolfram', 'Dirnberger-Hertweck, Maren', 'Winderlich, Mark', 'Ambarkhane, Sumeet V', 'Jabbour, Elias J']","['Klisovic RB', 'Leung WH', 'Brugger W', 'Dirnberger-Hertweck M', 'Winderlich M', 'Ambarkhane SV', 'Jabbour EJ']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong.', 'MorphoSys AG, Planegg, Germany.', 'MorphoSys AG, Planegg, Germany.', 'MorphoSys AG, Planegg, Germany.', 'MorphoSys AG, Planegg, Germany.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4465-6119'],['eng'],['MorphoSys'],['Journal Article'],20210803,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-lymphocytes', 'CD19', 'MOR208', 'Xmab5574', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'antineoplastic monoclonal antibody']",2021/08/04 06:00,2021/08/04 06:00,['2021/08/03 17:31'],"['2021/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/04 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/03 17:31 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33796 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2021 Nov 15;127(22):4190-4197. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33796.

Although lower-intensity venetoclax-containing regimens are standard for older/unfit patients with newly diagnosed AML, it is unknown how such regimens compare with intensive chemotherapy (IC) for R/R AML. METHODS: Outcomes of R/R AML treated with 10-day decitabine and venetoclax (DEC10-VEN) were compared with IC-based regimens including idarubicin with cytarabine, with or without cladribine, clofarabine, or fludarabine, with or without additional agents. Propensity scores derived from patient baseline characteristics were used to match DEC10-VEN and IC patients to minimize bias. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients in the DEC10-VEN cohort were matched to 130 IC recipients. The median ages for the DEC10-VEN and IC groups were 64 and 58 years, respectively, and baseline characteristics were balanced between the 2 cohorts. DEC10-VEN conferred significantly higher responses compared with IC including higher overall response rate (60% vs 36%; odds ratio [OR], 3.28; P < .001), complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi, 19% vs 6%; OR, 3.56; P = .012), minimal residual disease negativity by flow cytometry (28% vs 13%; OR, 2.48; P = .017), and lower rates of refractory disease. DEC10-VEN led to significantly longer median event-free survival compared with IC (5.7 vs 1.5 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% CI, 0.30-0.70; P < .001), as well as median overall survival (OS; 6.8 vs 4.7 months; HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.37-0.86; P = .008). DEC10-VEN was independently associated with improved OS compared with IC in multivariate analysis. Exploratory analysis for OS in 27 subgroups showed that DEC10-VEN was comparable with IC as salvage therapy for R/R AML. CONCLUSION: DEC10-VEN represents an appropriate salvage therapy and may offer better responses and survival compared with IC in adults with R/R AML.","['Maiti, Abhishek', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Qiao, Wei', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'Jabbour, Elias J', 'Rausch, Caitlin R', 'Daver, Naval G', 'Short, Nicholas J', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Yilmaz, Musa', 'Alvarado, Yesid', 'Montalbano, Kathryn S', 'Wade, Allison', 'Maduike, Rita E', 'Guerrero, Julio A', 'Vaughan, Kenneth', 'Bivins, Carol A', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Ning, Jing', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Konopleva, Marina Y']","['Maiti A', 'DiNardo CD', 'Qiao W', 'Kadia TM', 'Jabbour EJ', 'Rausch CR', 'Daver NG', 'Short NJ', 'Borthakur G', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Yilmaz M', 'Alvarado Y', 'Montalbano KS', 'Wade A', 'Maduike RE', 'Guerrero JA', 'Vaughan K', 'Bivins CA', 'Pierce S', 'Ning J', 'Ravandi F', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Konopleva MY']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Pharmacy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9043-538X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9003-0390', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9892-9832', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4465-6119', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4166-5717', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7103-373X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2983-2738', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1670-6513', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5289-331X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1908-3307']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NIH', 'R01CA235622/Research Project', 'CA016672/MD Anderson Cancer Center', 'R01 CA235622/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20210803,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,PMC8556232,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'decitabine', 'intensive chemotherapy', 'refractory', 'relapsed', 'venetoclax']",2021/08/04 06:00,2021/08/04 06:00,['2021/08/03 17:31'],"['2021/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/11/15 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/04 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/03 17:31 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33814 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2021 Nov 15;127(22):4213-4220. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33814.

Another exon 5 mutation was identified in an additional 141 patients with AML selected for wild-type NPM1 exon 12. Three NPM1 rearrangements (NPM1/RPP30, NPM1/SETBP1, NPM1/CCDC28A) were detected and characterized among 13 979 AML samples screened by cytogenetic/fluorescence in situ hybridization and RNA sequencing. Functional studies demonstrated that in AML cases, new NPM1 proteins harbored an efficient extra NES, either newly created or already present in the fusion partner, ensuring its cytoplasmic accumulation. Our findings support NPM1 cytoplasmic relocation as critical for leukemogenesis and reinforce the role of immunohistochemistry in predicting AML-associated NPM1 genetic lesions. This study highlights the need to develop new assays for molecular diagnosis and monitoring of NPM1-mutated AML.","['Martelli, Maria Paola', 'Rossi, Roberta', 'Venanzi, Alessandra', 'Meggendorfer, Manja', 'Perriello, Vincenzo Maria', 'Martino, Giovanni', 'Spinelli, Orietta', 'Ciurnelli, Raffaella', 'Varasano, Emanuela', 'Brunetti, Lorenzo', 'Ascani, Stefano', 'Quadalti, Corinne', 'Cardinali, Valeria', 'Mezzasoma, Federica', 'Gionfriddo, Ilaria', 'Milano, Francesca', 'Pacini, Roberta', 'Tabarrini, Alessia', 'Bigerna, Barbara', 'Albano, Francesco', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Vetro, Calogero', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Annibali, Ombretta', 'Avvisati, Giuseppe', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Falzetti, Franca', 'Tiacci, Enrico', 'Sportoletti, Paolo', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Falini, Brunangelo']","['Martelli MP', 'Rossi R', 'Venanzi A', 'Meggendorfer M', 'Perriello VM', 'Martino G', 'Spinelli O', 'Ciurnelli R', 'Varasano E', 'Brunetti L', 'Ascani S', 'Quadalti C', 'Cardinali V', 'Mezzasoma F', 'Gionfriddo I', 'Milano F', 'Pacini R', 'Tabarrini A', 'Bigerna B', 'Albano F', 'Specchia G', 'Vetro C', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Annibali O', 'Avvisati G', 'Rambaldi A', 'Falzetti F', 'Tiacci E', 'Sportoletti P', 'Haferlach T', 'Haferlach C', 'Falini B']","['Hematology, Centro di Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Santa Maria della Misericordia Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Centro di Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Centro di Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Hematology, Centro di Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Centro di Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology, ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, University of Milan, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Santa Maria della Misericordia Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Centro di Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Centro di Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Santa Maria della Misericordia Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Centro di Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Centro di Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Centro di Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Santa Maria della Misericordia Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Centro di Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Centro di Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Centro di Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Santa Maria della Misericordia Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Santa Maria della Misericordia Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Santa Maria della Misericordia Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Policlinico-San Marco, Catania, Italy;

Myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) account for 75% of associated malignancies, but how these cancers overcome the inherited telomere defect is unknown.METHODSWe used ultra-deep targeted sequencing to detect somatic reversion mutations in 17 candidate telomere lengthening genes among controls and patients with short telomere syndromes with and without MDS/AML, and we tested the functional significance of these mutations.RESULTSWhile no controls carried somatic mutations in telomere maintenance genes, 29% (16 of 56) of adults with germline telomere maintenance defects carried at least 1 (P < 0.001), and 13% (7 of 56) had 2 or more. In addition to TERT promoter mutations, which were present in 19%, another 13% of patients carried a mutation in POT1 or TERF2IP. POT1 mutations impaired telomere binding in vitro and some mutations were identical to ones seen in familial melanoma associated with longer telomere length. Exclusively in patients with germline defects in telomerase RNA (TR), we identified somatic mutations in nuclear RNA exosome genes RBM7, SKIV2L2, and DIS3, where loss-of-function upregulates mature TR levels. Somatic reversion events in 6 telomere-related genes were more prevalent in patients who were MDS/AML-free (P = 0.02, RR 4.4, 95% CI 1.2-16.7), and no patient with MDS/AML had more than 1 reversion mutation.CONCLUSIONOur data indicate that diverse adaptive somatic mutations arise in the short telomere syndromes. Their presence may alleviate the telomere crisis that promotes transformation to MDS/AML.FUNDINGThis work was supported by the NIH, the Commonwealth Foundation, the S&R Foundation Kuno Award, the Williams Foundation, the Vera and Joseph Dresner Foundation, the MacMillan Pathway to Independence Award, the American Society of Hematology Scholar Award, the Johns Hopkins Research Program for Medical Students, and the Turock Scholars Fund.","['Schratz, Kristen E', 'Gaysinskaya, Valeriya', 'Cosner, Zoe L', 'DeBoy, Emily A', 'Xiang, Zhimin', 'Kasch-Semenza, Laura', 'Florea, Liliana', 'Shah, Pali D', 'Armanios, Mary']","['Schratz KE', 'Gaysinskaya V', 'Cosner ZL', 'DeBoy EA', 'Xiang Z', 'Kasch-Semenza L', 'Florea L', 'Shah PD', 'Armanios M']","['Department of Oncology.', 'Telomere Center at Johns Hopkins.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Department of Oncology.', 'Department of Oncology.', 'Department of Oncology.', 'Department of Genetic Medicine.', 'Department of Oncology.', 'Department of Genetic Medicine.', 'Department of Genetic Medicine.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Oncology.', 'Telomere Center at Johns Hopkins.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Department of Genetic Medicine.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",,['eng'],"['F32 HL142207/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL119476/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007309/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM136577/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007525/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA225027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (POT1 protein, human)', '0 (Shelterin Complex)', '0 (Telomere-Binding Proteins)', '0 (telomerase RNA)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA/genetics', 'Shelterin Complex', 'Telomerase/genetics', 'Telomere/*genetics', 'Telomere Shortening/genetics', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC8439599,['NOTNLM'],"['*Clonal selection', '*Genetics', '*Leukemias', '*Oncology', '*Telomeres']",2021/08/04 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2021/08/03 17:21'],"['2021/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/03 17:21 [entrez]']","['e147598 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI147598 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2021 Sep 15;131(18). pii: e147598. doi: 10.1172/JCI147598.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we describe the rational design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationship study of 3,5-dimethyl-4-sulfonyl-1H-pyrrole-based compounds as Mcl-1 inhibitors. Stepwise optimizations of hit compound 11 with primary Mcl-1 inhibition (52%@30 muM) led to the discovery of the most potent compound 40 with high affinity (Kd = 0.23 nM) and superior selectivity over other Bcl-2 family proteins (>40,000 folds). Mechanistic studies revealed that 40 could activate the apoptosis signal pathway in an Mcl-1-dependent manner. 40 exhibited favorable physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetic profiles (F% = 41.3%). Furthermore, oral administration of 40 was well tolerated to effectively inhibit tumor growth (T/C = 37.3%) in MV4-11 xenograft models.

Patients with leukemia are more likely to have severe infection and increased rates of mortality. There is paucity of information on how to modify care of leukemia patients in view of the COVID-19 risks and imposed restrictions. We review the available literature on the impact of COVID-19 on different types of leukemia patients and suggest general as well as disease-specific recommendations on care based on available evidence. RECENT FINDINGS: The COVID-19 infection impacts leukemia subtypes in variable ways and the standard treatments for leukemia have similarly, varying effects on the course of COVID-19 infection. Useful treatment strategies include deferring treatment when possible, use of less intensive regimens, outpatient targeted oral agents requiring minimal monitoring, and prioritization of curative or life-prolonging strategies. Reducing health care encounters, rational transfusion standards, just resource allocation, and pre-emptive advance care planning will serve the interests of leukemia patients. Ad hoc modifications based on expert opinions and extrapolations of previous well-designed studies are the way forward to navigate the crisis. This should be supplanted with more rigorous prospective evidence.","['Karki, Nabin Raj', 'Le, Thuy', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Karki NR', 'Le T', 'Cortes J']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, USA. jorge.cortes@augusta.edu.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University, 1410 Laney Walker Rd., CN2222, Augusta, GA, 30912, USA. jorge.cortes@augusta.edu.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6449-8109'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210803,United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,,IM,"['COVID-19/*epidemiology/prevention & control/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Patient Care', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2']",PMC8330191,['NOTNLM'],"['*COVID-19', '*Coronavirus', '*Leukemia', '*Pandemic']",2021/08/04 06:00,2021/08/17 06:00,['2021/08/03 12:24'],"['2021/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/03 12:24 [entrez]', '2021/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11912-021-01111-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s11912-021-01111-0 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2021 Aug 3;23(10):114. doi: 10.1007/s11912-021-01111-0.,114,"['(c) 2021.

Generally, by this point, the cell is worn out and damaged. RBCs pass through both the spleen and liver, where specialised immune cells called macrophages are found. Macrophages recognise when an RBC is spent, and undergo a process called phagocytosis where they digest the cell. In this process, the iron in haemoglobin is recycled for use in new blood cells and the hem molecule is degraded, conjugated to bilirubin, and eliminated from the body. All the other cellular proteins are either recycled or eliminated. Historically, this process was thought to occur exclusively in the spleen, but recent studies have shown that it occurs in the bone marrow. The RBC has been analysed from many perspectives: cytological, haematological, and immunological, as well as from the focus of molecular biology, biophysics, and mathematics.

Using an unbiased genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen we sought to identify pathway dependencies for T-ALL which could be harnessed for therapy development. Disruption of the one-carbon folate, purine and pyrimidine pathways scored as the top metabolic pathways required for T-ALL proliferation. We used a recently developed inhibitor of SHMT1 and SHMT2, RZ-2994, to characterize the effect of inhibiting these enzymes of the one-carbon folate pathway in T-ALL and found that T-ALL cell lines were differentially sensitive to RZ-2994, with the drug inducing a S/G2 cell cycle arrest. The effects of SHMT1/2 inhibition were rescued by formate supplementation. Loss of both SHMT1 and SHMT2 was necessary for impaired growth and cell cycle arrest, with suppression of both SHMT1 and SHMT2 inhibiting leukemia progression in vivo. RZ-2994 also decreased leukemia burden in vivo and remained effective in the setting of methotrexate resistance in vitro. This study highlights the significance of the one-carbon folate pathway in T-ALL and supports further development of SHMT inhibitors for treatment of T-ALL and other cancers.","['Pikman, Yana', 'Ocasio-Martinez, Nicole', 'Alexe, Gabriela', 'Dimitrov, Boris', 'Kitara, Samuel', 'Diehl, Frances F', 'Robichaud, Amanda L', 'Conway, Amy Saur', 'Ross, Linda', 'Su, Angela', 'Ling, Frank', 'Qi, Jun', 'Roti, Giovanni', 'Lewis, Caroline A', 'Puissant, Alexandre', 'Vander Heiden, Matthew G', 'Stegmaier, Kimberly']","['Pikman Y', 'Ocasio-Martinez N', 'Alexe G', 'Dimitrov B', 'Kitara S', 'Diehl FF', 'Robichaud AL', 'Conway AS', 'Ross L', 'Su A', 'Ling F', 'Qi J', 'Roti G', 'Lewis CA', 'Puissant A', 'Vander Heiden MG', 'Stegmaier K']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. yana_pikman@dfci.harvard.edu."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Graduate Program in Bioinformatics, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'INSERM UMR 944, IRSL, St Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR 944, IRSL, St Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Division of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'INSERM UMR 944, IRSL, St Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. kimberly_stegmaier@dfci.harvard.edu."", 'Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA. kimberly_stegmaier@dfci.harvard.edu.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5336-0216', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1461-3356', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0218-7895']",['eng'],"['Rally Foundation/Bear Necessities Collaborative Grant/Rally Foundation (Rally', 'Foundation Inc.)', 'K08 CA222684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '758848/ERC_/European Research Council/International', 'R35 CA210030/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 CA236036/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20210802,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,,,,,2021/08/04 06:00,2021/08/04 06:00,['2021/08/03 06:29'],"['2020/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/03 06:29 [entrez]', '2021/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41375-021-01361-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-021-01361-8 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Leukemia. 2021 Aug 2. pii: 10.1038/s41375-021-01361-8. doi: 10.1038/s41375-021-01361-8.,,"['(c) 2021.

Whole exome sequencing analysis of a germline sample identified a PACS1 c.607 C>T de novo variant and the patient was diagnosed with Schuurs-Hoeijmakers syndrome (SHS). SHS is a rare disease characterized by intellectual disability and dysmorphic facial features, among various physical abnormalities, due to PACS1 c.607 C>T de novo variant. Due to the rarity of the SHS, diagnosis based on phenotypic information is difficult. To date, there have been no previous reports describing malignancy associated with SHS. Comprehensive somatic mutation analysis revealed a unique pattern of genetic alterations in the PAX3/7-FOXO1 fusion-negative ARMS tumor, including mutations in the oncogene, HRAS; MYOD1, a molecule essential for muscle differentiation; and KMT2C and TET1, genes encoding factors involved in epigenetic regulation. Although the role of PACS1 in tumorigenesis is unclear, it is reported to function in apoptosis regulation. Our case suggests that PACS1 could have a novel role in oncogenesis.","['Ohkawa, Teppei', 'Nishimura, Akira', 'Kosaki, Kenjiro', 'Aoki-Nogami, Yuki', 'Tomizawa, Daisuke', 'Kashimada, Kenichi', 'Morio, Tomohiro', 'Kato, Motohiro', 'Mizutani, Shuki', 'Takagi, Masatoshi']","['Ohkawa T', 'Nishimura A', 'Kosaki K', 'Aoki-Nogami Y', 'Tomizawa D', 'Kashimada K', 'Morio T', 'Kato M', 'Mizutani S', 'Takagi M']","['Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chiba Kaihinn Municipal Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Division of Leukemia and Lymphoma, Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan. m.takagi.ped@tmd.ac.jp.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2505-5932', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9259-1025', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7580-9184']",['eng'],['19ck0106467/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)'],['Journal Article'],20210802,England,J Hum Genet,Journal of human genetics,9808008,,IM,,,,,2021/08/04 06:00,2021/08/04 06:00,['2021/08/03 06:28'],"['2021/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/04 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/03 06:28 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s10038-021-00965-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s10038-021-00965-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Hum Genet. 2022 Jan;67(1):51-54. doi: 10.1038/s10038-021-00965-3.

Maintenance therapies to extend the duration of remission and to improve survival have been proposed for several years with mixed results but have experienced a renaissance recently. RECENT FINDINGS: The oral hypomethylating agent CC-486 has been the first agent to show an overall survival (OS) benefit compared with observation in AML patients in remission following intensive chemotherapy who are not proceeding to allo-HCT. In the realm of maintenance therapy following allo-HCT, the FLT3 inhibitor sorafenib has yielded superior results in terms of OS and relapse-free survival in randomized trials compared with observation. Several open questions remain regarding patient selection, timing, duration and safety of maintenance therapies. Various targeted agents are currently tested in clinical trials and could potentially enable an even more individualized therapeutic approach. SUMMARY: Maintenance therapies following intensive chemotherapy or allo-HCT offer a new therapeutic paradigm for an increasing number of AML patients and have been shown to result in an OS benefit in selected patients.","['Bewersdorf, Jan Philipp', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Stahl, Maximilian']","['Bewersdorf JP', 'Tallman MS', 'Stahl M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Adult Leukemia Program, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.']",,['eng'],"['T32 CA009512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (cc-486)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",,,,2021/08/04 06:00,2021/11/25 06:00,['2021/08/03 05:52'],"['2021/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/03 05:52 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CCO.0000000000000778 [doi]', '00001622-900000000-98989 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2021 Nov 1;33(6):658-669. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0000000000000778.,658-669,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Treatment with any chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy is a multistep process in which nurses and nurse practitioners are key to managing patient safety. Managing patients receiving CAR-T cell therapy in the outpatient setting (as Penn does with tisagenlecleucel and lisocabtagene maraleucel) requires an even more complex process. The objective of this manuscript is to provide guidance on the role of nurses in the outpatient administration of tisagenlecleucel therapy and postinfusion care in adult patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Oncology and apheresis nurses discuss institutional processes and perspectives related to the patient experience with tisagenlecleucel therapy at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. DATA SOURCES: Author experience. CONCLUSION: Nurses are vital for the success of the patient management processes involved with tisagenlecleucel therapy. Nurses must be thoroughly educated in tisagenlecleucel therapy and adverse event management and be able to effectively communicate all aspects of therapy among the multidisciplinary team of the hospital, the product manufacturer, and patients and families. Establishment of the nurse cellular therapy coordinator at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania was advantageous in facilitating effective communication in all these situations. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: This encompassing approach to patient management is particularly necessary during administration of tisagenlecleucel therapy and other CAR-T cell therapies that are managed in the outpatient setting.","['Cunningham, Kathleen', 'DiFilippo, Heather', 'Henes, Kelli', 'Irwin, Leah L', 'Napier, Ellen', 'Weber, Elizabeth']","['Cunningham K', 'DiFilippo H', 'Henes K', 'Irwin LL', 'Napier E', 'Weber E']","['Program Manager, Cell Therapy and Transplant Program, Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Civic Center Blvd., Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Nurse Practitioner, Cell Therapy and Transplant Program, Division of Hematology-Oncology and Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Civic Center Blvd., Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Registered Nurse, Department of Transfusion Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Civic Center Blvd., Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Nurse Manager, Apheresis, Infusion, and Donor Services, Department of Transfusion Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Civic Center Blvd., Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Nurse Practitioner, Abramson Cancer Center, Clinical Research Unit, University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Civic Center Blvd., Philadelphia, PA 19104.', 'Cellular Therapy Coordinator, Cell Therapy and Transplant, Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, 3400 Civic Center Blvd., Philadelphia, PA 19104.

In contrast, VHR pediatric patients can be treated effectively with minimal residual disease (MRD)-guided pediatric protocols and HSCT are not always needed. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed young adult ALL VHR patients treated with the pediatric-type (TPOG-ALL-2002 VHR) regimen in our institute from 2008 to 2019 and compared the event-free survival (EFS) with patients treated with an adult-type regimen (Hyper-CVAD alternating with high dose methotrexate and cytarabine). RESULTS: We identified 16 patients treated with the TPOG and 11 treated with the Hyper-CVAD regimen. Philadelphia chromosome-positive (n = 10) and T-cell immunophenotype (n = 11) are the most common VHR features. Compared with the Hyper-CVAD group, patients treated with the TPOG regimen showed a trend toward better EFS with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.42 (p = 0.16). Compared with untransplanted patients, HSCT showed a positive trend in the Hyper-CVAD (HR 0.22, p = 0.12) but not in the TPOG group (p = 0.37). Untransplanted patients treated initially with the hyper-CVAD regimen had a significantly worse outcome than the TPOG regimen (HR 4.19, p < 0.05). In the TPOG group, patients with negative MRD at the end of consolidation had a significantly better outcome (HR 0.12, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Young adult VHR patients can be effectively treated with the TPOG-ALL-2002 protocol, and those who achieved MRD negativity before the end of consolidation have a good outcome without allogeneic HSCT.","['Cheng, Chao-Neng', 'Li, Sin-Syue', 'Hsu, Ya-Ting', 'Chen, Ya-Ping', 'Chen, Tsai-Yun', 'Chen, Jiann-Shiuh']","['Cheng CN', 'Li SS', 'Hsu YT', 'Chen YP', 'Chen TY', 'Chen JS']","['Department of Pediatrics, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.

Hence, it would be desirable to rely on a technique and an analytical workflow that allows the simultaneous analysis and identification of all the genetic alterations in a single approach. Moreover, based on the results with standard methods, a significant amount of patients have no established abnormalities and hence, cannot further be stratified. METHODS: We performed WTS and WGS in 279 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients (B-cell: n = 211; T-cell: n = 68) to assess the accuracy of WTS, to detect relevant genetic markers, and to classify ALL patients. RESULTS: DNA and RNA-based genotyping was used to ensure correct WTS-WGS pairing. Gene expression analysis reliably assigned samples to the B Cell Precursor (BCP)-ALL or the T-ALL group. Subclassification of BCP-ALL samples was done progressively, assessing first the presence of chromosomal rearrangements by the means of fusion detection. Compared to the standard methods, 97% of the recurrent risk-stratifying fusions could be identified by WTS, assigning 76 samples to their respective entities. Additionally, read-through fusions (indicative of CDKN2A and RB1 gene deletions) were recurrently detected in the cohort along with 57 putative novel fusions, with yet untouched diagnostic potentials. Next, copy number variations were inferred from WTS data to identify relevant ploidy groups, classifying an additional of 31 samples. Lastly, gene expression profiling detected a BCR-ABL1-like signature in 27% of the remaining samples. CONCLUSION: As a single assay, WTS allowed a precise genetic classification for the majority of BCP-ALL patients, and is superior to conventional methods in the cases which lack entity defining genetic abnormalities.","['Walter, Wencke', 'Shahswar, Rabia', 'Stengel, Anna', 'Meggendorfer, Manja', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Haferlach, Claudia']","['Walter W', 'Shahswar R', 'Stengel A', 'Meggendorfer M', 'Kern W', 'Haferlach T', 'Haferlach C']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, 81377, Munich, Germany. wencke.walter@mll.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, 81377, Munich, Germany.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210802,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Computational Biology', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histocytochemistry/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', '*Transcriptome', '*Whole Exome Sequencing', 'Young Adult']",PMC8330044,['NOTNLM'],"['Fusion transcript calling', 'Gene expression profiling', 'Patient classification', 'Whole transcriptome sequencing']",2021/08/04 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2021/08/03 05:34'],"['2021/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/03 05:34 [entrez]', '2021/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-021-08635-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-021-08635-5 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2021 Aug 2;21(1):886. doi: 10.1186/s12885-021-08635-5.,886,['(c) 2021.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvic cavity revealed a 4.4- x 2.7- x 1.8-cm cystic lesion in the subcutaneous fat of the left vulva. Resection beyond the macroscopic border was performed. Pathology revealed vascular structures with elongated and narrow arborizing vascular channels that were arranged in a retiform pattern resembling rete testis tissue.

Hypomethylating agent (HMA) treatment results in further increased expression of these immune checkpoints. We hypothesised that combining an anti-PD-1 antibody with HMAs may have efficacy in patients with MDS. To test this concept, we designed a phase II trial of the combination of azacitidine and pembrolizumab with two cohorts. In the 17 previously untreated patients, the overall response rate (ORR) was 76%, with a complete response (CR) rate of 18% and median overall survival (mOS) not reached after a median follow-up of 12.8 months. For the HMA-failure cohort (n = 20), the ORR was 25% and CR rate was 5%; with a median follow-up of 6.0 months, the mOS was 5.8 months. The most observed toxicities were pneumonia (32%), arthralgias (24%) and constipation (24%). Immune-related adverse events requiring corticosteroids were required in 43%. Overall, this phase II trial suggests that azacitidine and pembrolizumab is safe with manageable toxicities in patients with higher-risk MDS. This combined therapy may have anti-tumour activity in a subset of patients and merits further studies in the front-line setting.","['Chien, Kelly S', 'Kim, Kunhwa', 'Nogueras-Gonzalez, Graciela M', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Naqvi, Kiran', 'Daver, Naval G', 'Montalban-Bravo, Guillermo', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Alvarado, Yesid', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Bose, Prithviraj', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'Huang, Xuelin', 'Sheppard, Kimberly B', 'Klingner-Winton, Cheri', 'Pierce, Sherry A', 'Dong, Xiao Qin', 'Soltysiak, Kelly A', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Chien KS', 'Kim K', 'Nogueras-Gonzalez GM', 'Borthakur G', 'Naqvi K', 'Daver NG', 'Montalban-Bravo G', 'Cortes JE', 'DiNardo CD', 'Jabbour E', 'Alvarado Y', 'Andreeff M', 'Bose P', 'Jain N', 'Kadia TM', 'Huang X', 'Sheppard KB', 'Klingner-Winton C', 'Pierce SA', 'Dong XQ', 'Soltysiak KA', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6024-1613', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7679-6453', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7103-373X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4533-5176', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8636-1071', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0114-8384', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3631-2482']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210802,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', 'DPT0O3T46P (pembrolizumab)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Arthralgia/chemically induced', 'Azacitidine/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Constipation/chemically induced', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Pneumonia/chemically induced', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Risk']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*azacitidine', '*hypomethylating agent failure', '*immunotherapy', '*myelodysplastic syndromes', '*pembrolizumab']",2021/08/03 06:00,2021/12/24 06:00,['2021/08/02 20:34'],"['2021/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/02 20:34 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.17689 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2021 Nov;195(3):378-387. doi: 10.1111/bjh.17689.

Their infectious episodes were classified as severe, mild or oral, and analysed according to their natural occurrence without granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), on G-CSF, after myelodysplasia/acute leukaemia or after haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. During the disease's natural history period (without G-CSF; 1913 person-years), 302, 957 and 754 severe, mild and oral infectious events, respectively, occurred. Among severe infections, cellulitis (48%) and pneumonia (38%) were the most common. Only 38% of episodes were microbiologically documented. The most frequent pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (37.4%), Escherichia coli (20%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%), while fungal infections accounted for 1%. Profound neutropenia (<200/mm(3) ), high lymphocyte count (>3000/mm(3) ) and neutropenia subtype were associated with high risk of infection. Only the p.Gly214Arg variant (5% of the patients) was associated with infections but not the overall genotype. The first year of life was associated with the highest infection risk throughout life. G-CSF therapy achieved lower ratios of serious or oral infectious event numbers per period but was less protective for patients requiring >10 microg/kg/day. Infections had permanent consequences in 33% of patients, most frequently edentulism.","['Rotulo, Gioacchino A', 'Plat, Genevieve', 'Beaupain, Blandine', 'Blanche, Stephane', 'Moushous, Despina', 'Sicre de Fontbrune, Flore', 'Leblanc, Thierry', 'Renard, Cecile', 'Barlogis, Vincent', 'Vigue, Marie-Gabrielle', 'Freycon, Claire', 'Piguet, Christophe', 'Pasquet, Marlene', 'Fieschi, Claire', 'Abou-Chahla, Wadih', 'Gandemer, Virginie', 'Rialland, Fanny', 'Millot, Frederic', 'Marie-Cardine, Aude', 'Paillard, Catherine', 'Levy, Pacifique', 'Aladjidi, Nathalie', 'Biosse-Duplan, Martin', 'Bellanne-Chantelot, Christine', 'Donadieu, Jean']","['Rotulo GA', 'Plat G', 'Beaupain B', 'Blanche S', 'Moushous D', 'Sicre de Fontbrune F', 'Leblanc T', 'Renard C', 'Barlogis V', 'Vigue MG', 'Freycon C', 'Piguet C', 'Pasquet M', 'Fieschi C', 'Abou-Chahla W', 'Gandemer V', 'Rialland F', 'Millot F', 'Marie-Cardine A', 'Paillard C', 'Levy P', 'Aladjidi N', 'Biosse-Duplan M', 'Bellanne-Chantelot C', 'Donadieu J']","['Registre des Neutropenies Chroniques, Centre de Reference des Neutropenies Chroniques, Hopital Trousseau, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (APHP), Paris, France.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health (DINOGMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Hematologie Oncologie et Immunologie Pediatrique, Hopital des Enfants, Toulouse, France.', 'Registre des Neutropenies Chroniques, Centre de Reference des Neutropenies Chroniques, Hopital Trousseau, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (APHP), Paris, France.', 'APHP, UIHR CEREDIH, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malade, Paris, France.', 'APHP, UIHR CEREDIH, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malade, Paris, France.', ""APHP, Service d'Hematologie Transplantation Medullaire, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Immunology, Hopital Robert-Debre, APHP, Paris, France.', ""Service de Pediatrie, Institut d'Hematologie et Oncologie Pediatrique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) de Lyon, Lyon, France."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Timone Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Marseille, Marseille, France.', 'Pediatrics, Infectiology, Rhumatology, Hopital Arnaud-de-Villeneuve, CHRU de Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', ""Service d'Onco-Hematologie Pediatrique, CHU de Grenoble, Grenoble, France."", ""Service d'Hemato-Oncologie Pediatrie, CHU de Limoges, Limoges, France."", 'Hematologie Oncologie et Immunologie Pediatrique, Hopital des Enfants, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Saint-Louis Hospital, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Jeanne-de-Flandre Hospital, CHU de Lille, Lille, France.', ""Service d'Hemato-Oncologie Pediatrique, CHU de Rennes, Rennes, France."", ""Service d'Oncologie Pediatrique, CHU de Nantes, Nantes, France."", ""Service d'Hemato-Oncologie Pediatrique, CHU de Poitiers, Poitiers, France."", ""Service d'Hemato-Pediatrique, CHU de Rouen, Rouen, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Oncologie Pediatrique, CHU de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France."", 'Departement de Genetique, DMU BioGeM, CHU Pitie-Salpetriere, APHP, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Hemato-Oncologie Pediatrique, CHU de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France."", 'Service de Medecine Bucco-Dentaire, Hopital Bretonneau, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Departement de Genetique, DMU BioGeM, CHU Pitie-Salpetriere, APHP, Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France.', 'Registre des Neutropenies Chroniques, Centre de Reference des Neutropenies Chroniques, Hopital Trousseau, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (APHP), Paris, France.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6926-0877', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0231-4460', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4485-146X']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210802,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['EC 3.4.21.37 (ELANE protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)', 'Neutropenia, severe chronic']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bacterial Infections/*etiology/genetics', 'Child', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'France/epidemiology', 'Genetic Variation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Elastase/*analysis/genetics', 'Mycoses/*etiology/genetics', 'Neutropenia/*complications/genetics/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Registries', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*ELANE-related neutropenia', '*opportunistic infections', '*severe congenital neutropenia']",2021/08/03 06:00,2021/12/16 06:00,['2021/08/02 20:34'],"['2021/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/02 20:34 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.17695 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2021 Sep;194(5):908-920. doi: 10.1111/bjh.17695.

However, whether dietary VA restriction for marbling impairs the T-cell responses that control BLV proviral load in beef cattle is unknown. We assessed T-cell subsets, interferon (IFN)-gamma gene expression, and BLV proviral load in naturally BLV-infected Japanese Black cattle that were fed a diet with decreased VA levels. We found that the percentage of CD4(+) T cells increased over time during dietary VA restriction. In addition, BLV proviral load was negatively correlated with the percentage of CD4(+) T cells and with the level of IFN-gamma gene expression. These observations suggest that dietary VA restriction for marbling enhances T-cell responses that control BLV proviral load and thus does not promote leukemogenesis in fattening beef cattle.","['Miyauchi, Sonoko', 'Katagiri, Yuzuru', 'Ochiai, Chihiro', 'Hirata, Toh-Ichi', 'Matsuda, Keiichi', 'Ichijo, Toshihiro', 'Hikono, Hirokazu', 'Murakami, Kenji']","['Miyauchi S', 'Katagiri Y', 'Ochiai C', 'Hirata TI', 'Matsuda K', 'Ichijo T', 'Hikono H', 'Murakami K']","['Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, 020-8550, Japan.', 'Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, 020-8550, Japan.', 'Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, 020-8550, Japan.', 'Field Science Center, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Shizukuishi, Iwate, 020-0581, Japan; Food Animal Medicine and Food Safety Research Center (FAMS), Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, 501-1193, Japan.', 'Livestock Medicine Training Center, Miyagi Prefecture Agricultural Mutual Aid Association, Oohira, Kurokawagun, Miyagi, 981-3602, Japan.', 'Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, 020-8550, Japan; Food Animal Medicine and Food Safety Research Center (FAMS), Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, 501-1193, Japan.', 'Department of Animal Sciences, Teikyo University of Science, Adachi, Tokyo, 120-0045, Japan.', 'Cooperative Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, 020-8550, Japan; Food Animal Medicine and Food Safety Research Center (FAMS), Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, 501-1193, Japan; Graduate School of Veterinary Sciences, Iwate University, Morioka, Iwate, 020-8550, Japan.

BCL-2 (B-cell CLL/Lymphoma 2) protein family is popularly known to mediate the intrinsic mode of apoptosis, of which MCL-1 is a crucial member. Myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1) is an anti-apoptotic oncoprotein and one of the most investigated members of the BCL-2 family. It is commonly known to be genetically altered, aberrantly overexpressed, and primarily associated with drug resistance in various human cancers. Recent advancements in the development of selective MCL-1 inhibitors and evaluating their effectiveness in cancer treatment establish its popularity as a molecular target. The overall aim is the selective induction of apoptosis in cancer cells by using a single or combination of BCL-2 family inhibitors. Delineating the precise molecular mechanisms associated with MCL-1-mediated cancer progression will certainly improve the efficacy of clinical interventions aimed at MCL-1 and hence patient survival. This review is structured to highlight the structural characteristics of MCL-1, its specific interactions with NOXA, MCL-1-regulatory microRNAs, and at the same time focus on the emerging therapeutic strategies targeting our protein of interest (MCL-1), alone or in combination with other treatments.","['Mittal, Pooja', 'Singh, Sujata', 'Sinha, Rajesh', 'Shrivastava, Anju', 'Singh, Archana', 'Singh, Indrakant Kumar']","['Mittal P', 'Singh S', 'Sinha R', 'Shrivastava A', 'Singh A', 'Singh IK']","['Molecular Biology Research Lab, Department of Zoology, Deshbandhu College, University of Delhi, Kalkaji, New Delhi 110019, India.', 'Molecular Biology Research Lab, Department of Zoology, Deshbandhu College, University of Delhi, Kalkaji, New Delhi 110019, India.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Alabama, Birmingham 35205, United States of America.', 'Department of Zoology, University of Delhi, New Delhi, 110007, India.', 'Department of Botany, Hans Raj College, University of Delhi, New Delhi 110007, India.

Apart from Bcr-Abl kinase, imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib and ponatinib are known to have additional off-target effects that might contribute to their antitumoural activities. In our study, we identified aldo-keto reductase 1B10 (AKR1B10) as a novel target for dasatinib. The enzyme AKR1B10 is upregulated in several cancers and influences the metabolism of chemotherapy drugs, including anthracyclines. AKR1B10 reduces anthracyclines to alcohol metabolites that show less antineoplastic properties and tend to accumulate in cardiac tissue. In our experiments, clinically achievable concentrations of dasatinib selectively inhibited AKR1B10 both in experiments with recombinant enzyme (Ki = 0.6 microM) and in a cellular model (IC50 = 0.5 microM). Subsequently, the ability of dasatinib to attenuate AKR1B10-mediated daunorubicin (Daun) resistance was determined in AKR1B10-overexpressing cells. We have demonstrated that dasatinib can synergize with Daun in human cancer cells and enhance its therapeutic effectiveness. Taken together, our results provide new information on how dasatinib may act beyond targeting Bcr-Abl kinase, which may help to design new chemotherapy regimens, including those with anthracyclines.","['Bukum, Neslihan', 'Novotna, Eva', 'Morell, Anselm', 'Zelazkova, Jana', 'Lastovickova, Lenka', 'Cermakova, Lucie', 'Portillo, Ramon', 'Solich, Petr', 'Wsol, Vladimir']","['Bukum N', 'Novotna E', 'Morell A', 'Zelazkova J', 'Lastovickova L', 'Cermakova L', 'Portillo R', 'Solich P', 'Wsol V']","['Department of Biochemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005 Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.

In addition, due to the lack of a comparable control group and limited types of studied malignant neoplasms, the results remain inconsistent and inconclusive. OBJECTIVES: To quantitatively evaluate the potential adverse effects of specific malignant neoplasms on semen quality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate 445 malignant neoplasm patients undergoing sperm cryopreservation for fertility preservation in Guangdong province, China during 2016-2019. A propensity score matching method was used to select a comparable control group from 9170 sperm donation volunteers. Each subject was analyzed for semen quality. Multivariate linear regression models were employed to assess the association between malignant neoplasm and semen quality. RESULTS: Using the propensity score matching method, 413 (92.8%) malignant neoplasm patients were successfully matched with 798 sperm donation volunteers. Overall, malignant neoplasms were significantly associated with a 0.3 ml, 17.1 x 10(6) /ml, 67.6 x 10(6) , 9.8%, 10.2%, and 6.4% reduction in semen volume, sperm concentration, total sperm number, total motility, progressive motility, and normal forms, respectively. Malignant neoplasm of testis, nasopharynx and digestive organs, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia were significantly associated with a reduction in sperm motility and normal forms, while malignant neoplasm of testis, Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia were also significantly associated with reduced sperm concentration and/or total sperm number. The reduction in sperm concentration and total sperm number associated with malignant neoplasms was significantly greater in subjects < 30 years. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We found that malignant neoplasms were significantly associated with a reduction in semen quality, which varied across the type of malignant neoplasms. Our results highlight the needs to examine semen quality for young malignant neoplasm patients, especially those who are expected to conceive.","['Fan, Zhaoyu', 'Wang, Qiling', 'Xu, Ruijun', 'Wang, Yaqi', 'Liu, Tingting', 'Li, Yingxin', 'Duan, Yonggang', 'Liu, Yuewei', 'Zhang, Xinzong']","['Fan Z', 'Wang Q', 'Xu R', 'Wang Y', 'Liu T', 'Li Y', 'Duan Y', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang X']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'NHC Key Laboratory of Male Reproduction and Genetics, Family Planning Research Institute of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Fertility Regulation, Centre of Assisted Reproduction and Embryology, The University of Hong Kong - Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'NHC Key Laboratory of Male Reproduction and Genetics, Family Planning Research Institute of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, China.']",,['eng'],"['202002030480/Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Bureau', 'KF201905/NHC Key Laboratory of Male Reproduction and Genetics, Family Planning', 'Research Institute of Guangdong Province', '2021A1515011544/Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210813,England,Andrology,Andrology,101585129,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*fertility preservation', '*malignant neoplasm', '*propensity score matching', '*semen quality', '*sperm donation']",2021/08/03 06:00,2021/08/03 06:00,['2021/08/02 17:25'],"['2021/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/02 17:25 [entrez]']",['10.1111/andr.13087 [doi]'],ppublish,Andrology. 2022 Jan;10(1):111-119. doi: 10.1111/andr.13087.

Cytogenetic abnormalities and genetic mutations have been widely used in the prognostic stratification of AML to assign patients into different risk categories. Nevertheless, nearly half of AML patients assigned to intermediate risk need more precise prognostic schemes. Here, 336 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AML and control samples and 206 genes representing the intratumor heterogeneity of AML were identified. By applying a LASSO Cox regression model, we generated a 4-mRNA prognostic signature comprising KLF9, ENPP4, TUBA4A and CD247. Higher risk scores were significantly associated with shorter overall survival, complex karyotype, and adverse mutations. We then validated the prognostic value of this 4-mRNA signature in two independent cohorts. We also proved that incorporation of the 4-mRNA-based signature in the 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk classification could enhance the predictive accuracy of survival in patients with AML. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that this signature was independent of traditional prognostic factors such as age, WBC count, and unfavorable cytogenetics. Finally, the molecular mechanisms underlying disparate outcomes in high-risk and low-risk AML patients were explored. Therefore, our findings suggest that the 4-mRNA signature refines the risk stratification and prognostic prediction of AML patients.","['Chen, Zizhen', 'Song, Junzhe', 'Wang, Wenjun', 'Bai, Jiaojiao', 'Zhang, Yuhui', 'Shi, Jun', 'Bai, Jie', 'Zhou, Yuan']","['Chen Z', 'Song J', 'Wang W', 'Bai J', 'Zhang Y', 'Shi J', 'Bai J', 'Zhou Y']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7493-8347', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4413-7490']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210814,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD3 antigen, zeta chain)', '0 (KLF9 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (ENPP4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)']",IM,"['CD3 Complex/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', '*Transcriptome']",,,,2021/08/03 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2021/08/02 17:22'],"['2021/07/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/02 17:22 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.26309 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2021 Nov 1;96(11):1385-1395. doi: 10.1002/ajh.26309.

We can hardly predict the time of herd immunity against and end of COVID-19 with or without success of vaccine. One way to overcome the situation is to define what delineates disease severity and serves as a molecular target. The most successful analogy is found in BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia, which is the golden biomarker, and simultaneously, the most effective molecular target. We hypothesize that S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8) is one such molecule. The underlying evidence includes accumulating clinical information that S100A8 is upregulated in severe forms of COVID-19, pathological similarities of the affected lungs between COVID-19 and S100A8-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) model, homeostatic inflammation theory in which S100A8 is an endogenous ligand for endotoxin sensor Toll-like receptor 4/Myeloid differentiation protein-2 (TLR4/MD-2) and mediates hyper-inflammation even after elimination of endotoxin-producing extrinsic pathogens, analogous findings between COVID-19-associated ARDS and pre-metastatic lungs such as S100A8 upregulation, pulmonary recruitment of myeloid cells, increased vascular permeability, and activation coagulation cascade. A successful treatment in an animal COVID-19 model is given with a reagent capable of abrogating interaction between S100A8/S100A9 and TLR4. In this paper, we try to verify our hypothesis that S100A8 governs COVID-19-associated ARDS.","['Deguchi, Atsuko', 'Yamamoto, Tomoko', 'Shibata, Noriyuki', 'Maru, Yoshiro']","['Deguchi A', 'Yamamoto T', 'Shibata N', 'Maru Y']","[""Department of Pharmacology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Division of Pathological Neuroscience, Department of Pathology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Division of Pathological Neuroscience, Department of Pathology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Department of Pharmacology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.""]","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9647-3539', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9477-7974']",['eng'],"['18K07245/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', '21K07157/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', '19K03506/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', 'Smoking Research Foundation']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (CXCL11 protein, human)', '0 (Calgranulin A)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL11)', '0 (Disaccharides)', '0 (LY96 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphocyte Antigen 96)', '0 (S100A8 protein, human)', '0 (Sugar Phosphates)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '551541VI0Y (eritoran)', 'EC 3.4.17.23 (ACE2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.17.23 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2)']",IM,"['Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2/genetics/physiology', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'COVID-19/*complications/genetics/pathology', 'Calgranulin A/blood/genetics/*physiology', 'Chemokine CXCL11/blood', 'Cytokine Release Syndrome/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Disaccharides/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Discovery', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism/virology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Lung/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/secondary', 'Lymphocyte Antigen 96/physiology', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', '*Pandemics', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome/*etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'SARS-CoV-2/*genetics', 'Species Specificity', 'Sugar Phosphates/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/physiology', 'Up-Regulation', 'Virus Internalization']",PMC8441709,['NOTNLM'],"['*Coronavirus disease 2019', '*S100A8', '*Toll-like receptor', '*acute respiratory distress syndrome', '*myeloid-derived suppressor cells']",2021/08/03 06:00,2021/08/06 06:00,['2021/08/02 12:37'],"['2021/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/02 12:37 [entrez]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1096/fj.202101013 [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 2021 Sep;35(9):e21798. doi: 10.1096/fj.202101013.,e21798,"['(c) 2021 The Authors.

The cost-effectiveness of TDM combined with IM (IM TDM) in first-line CML treatment has not yet been studied. OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost-effectiveness of IM TDM for the first-line treatment of CML compared to tyrosine kinase inhibitor only treatment. METHODS: A recently published cost-effectiveness model of tyrosine kinase inhibitor-treatment in CML was modified to include IM TDM as a first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor-based CML treatment option. Efficacy inputs for major molecular response (MMR) rates were taken from previously published studies: IM TDM 65%, dasatinib 52%, nilotinib 53%. Annual tyrosine kinase inhibitor drug prices were derived from the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and the average and lowest wholesale acquisition costs (WAC) reported in the Red Book; the annual cost of TDM was $228. Other input costs modeled in the original CML CEA model were updated to 2016 US dollars using the medical service component of the Consumer Price Index. A US payer perspective was used with a 5-year time horizon and a 3.0% discount rate. The model compared first-line IM TDM versus IM alone, nilotinib (NIL) or dasatinib (DAS) in terms of the following outcomes: costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and cost-effectiveness (total cost/QALY). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed using all key clinical and economic parameters. RESULTS: This study found that IM TDM dominates IM alone with $15,452 to $36,940 in savings and 0.25 higher QALYs. Using FSS, per patient total costs for IM and IM TDM were $270,905 and $233,965, respectively.; Using average WAC, these costs were $461,657 and $446,205, and using lowest WAC, these costs were $366,966 and $350,090. The results comparing first line using of IM TDM to NIL/DAS found that TDM IM had higher QALYs and lower costs (0.08 QALYs lower, and $117,006 to $172,420 savings per patient [varying by price basis]). Thus, in terms of cost-effectiveness, IM TDM dominates NIL/DAS with both lower costs and higher QALYs. CONCLUSIONS: IM TDM is a clinically and economically viable first-line treatment option for CML.

Increased thrombin generation has been reported in ALL, but the mechanisms remain elusive. Objective: We aimed to show that extracellular traps and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) promote thrombin generation in pediatric ALL. Methods: In a longitudinal single-center study, we recruited 17 consecutive pediatric ALL patients. Serial blood samples were collected at diagnosis and weekly during the 4-week induction phase of antileukemic chemotherapy. Healthy children (n = 14) and children with deep vein thrombosis (DVT; n = 7) or sepsis (n = 5) were recruited as negative and positive controls, respectively. In plasma, we measured endogenous thrombin generation potential (ETP) and components of extracellular traps, including cfDNA. Results: In patients with ALL, ETP was increased at baseline and remained significantly elevated throughout the induction therapy. Plasma levels of cfDNA were increased at baseline and during the first 3 weeks of induction therapy. The extent of enhancement of ETP and plasma cfDNA in patients with ALL was similar to that seen in patients with DVT or sepsis. Treatment of plasma with DNase 1 lowered ETP in patients with ALL at each time point but did not affect ETP in healthy controls. Conclusion: We conclude that childhood ALL is associated with a prothrombotic milieu at the time of diagnosis that continues during induction chemotherapy, and cfDNA contributes to increased thrombogenic potential.","['Kumar, Rahul', 'Katare, Parmeshwar B', 'Lentz, Steven R', 'Modi, Arunkumar J', 'Sharathkumar, Anjali A', 'Dayal, Sanjana']","['Kumar R', 'Katare PB', 'Lentz SR', 'Modi AJ', 'Sharathkumar AA', 'Dayal S']","['Department of Internal Medicine University of Iowa Iowa City IA USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine University of Iowa Iowa City IA USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine University of Iowa Iowa City IA USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics University of Iowa Iowa City IA USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics University of Iowa Iowa City IA USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine University of Iowa Iowa City IA USA.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8885-4718', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4574-6175', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6156-2996']",['eng'],"['I01 CX001932/CX/CSRD VA/United States', 'R01 AG049784/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20210726,United States,Res Pract Thromb Haemost,Research and practice in thrombosis and haemostasis,101703775,,,,PMC8312738,['NOTNLM'],"['cell-free nucleic acids', 'child', 'extracellular traps', 'induction chemotherapy', 'leukemia', 'thrombin generation']",2021/08/03 06:00,2021/08/03 06:01,['2021/08/02 06:12'],"['2021/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/02 06:12 [entrez]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1002/rth2.12557 [doi]', 'RTH212557 [pii]']",epublish,Res Pract Thromb Haemost. 2021 Jul 26;5(5):e12557. doi: 10.1002/rth2.12557. eCollection 2021 Jul.,e12557,"['(c) 2021 The Authors.

We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of intermittent liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) prophylaxis in a heterogenous group of hematology patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort of all hematology patients who received a course of intravenous L-AMB, defined as 1 mg/kg thrice weekly from July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2018, were identified from pharmacy records. Outcomes included breakthrough-invasive fungal disease (BIFD), reasons for premature discontinuation, and acute kidney injury. Results: There were 198 patients who received 273 courses of L-AMB prophylaxis. Using a conservative definition, the BIFD rate was 9.6% (n = 19 of 198) occurring either during L-AMB prophylaxis or up to 7 days from cessation in patients who received a course. Probable/proven BIFD occurred in 13 patients (6.6%, 13 of 198), including molds in 54% (n = 7) and non-albicans Candidemia in 46% (n = 6). Cumulative incidence of BIFD was highest in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (6.8%) followed by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (2.7%) and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (2.5%). The most common indication for L-AMB was chemotherapy, or anticancer drug-azole interactions (75% of courses) dominated by vincristine, or acute myeloid leukemia clinical trials, followed by gut absorption concerns (13%) and liver function abnormalities (8.8%). Acute kidney injury, using a modified international definition, complicated 27% of courses but was not clinically significant, accounting for only 3.3% (9 of 273) of discontinuations. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate a high rate of BIFD among patients receiving L-AMB prophylaxis. Pragmatic trials will help researchers find the optimal regimen of L-AMB prophylaxis for the many clinical scenarios in which azoles are unsuitable, especially as targeted anticancer drugs increase in use.","['Batchelor, R', 'Thomas, C', 'Gardiner, B J', 'Lee, S J', 'Fleming, S', 'Wei, A', 'Coutsouvelis, J', 'Ananda-Rajah, M']","['Batchelor R', 'Thomas C', 'Gardiner BJ', 'Lee SJ', 'Fleming S', 'Wei A', 'Coutsouvelis J', 'Ananda-Rajah M']","['Department of General Medicine, Alfred Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of General Medicine, Alfred Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases Alfred Health Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Central Clinical School, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases Alfred Health Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Central Clinical School, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Alfred Health Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Alfred Health Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Alfred Health Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Alfred Health Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Pharmacy Department, Alfred Health Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Centre for Medicine Use and Safety, Monash University Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of General Medicine, Alfred Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases Alfred Health Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Central Clinical School, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7514-3298'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210308,United States,Open Forum Infect Dis,Open forum infectious diseases,101637045,,,,PMC8318248,['NOTNLM'],"['antifungal prophylaxis', 'breakthrough fungal infection', 'invasive fungal disease', 'liposomal amphotericin B', 'malignant hematology']",2021/08/03 06:00,2021/08/03 06:01,['2021/08/02 06:09'],"['2021/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/02 06:09 [entrez]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1093/ofid/ofab113 [doi]', 'ofab113 [pii]']",epublish,Open Forum Infect Dis. 2021 Mar 8;8(7):ofab113. doi: 10.1093/ofid/ofab113. eCollection 2021 Jul.,ofab113,"['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

Chimeric antigen receptor- (CAR-) engineered NK cells, although are still at the preliminary stage, have been shown to be alternative to CAR-T cells, mainly due to the absence of graft-versus-host disease and safer clinical profile. Allogeneic human NK cell line NK-92 cells, equipped by CAR, are being developed for clinical applications. Herein, we designed third-generation CARs, optimized the production protocol, and generated CAR-NK-92 cells, targeting CD19 and/or CD138 antigens that employ CD28, 4-1BB, and CD3zeta signaling, with >80% CAR expression, designated as CD19-NK-92, CD138-NK-92, and dual-NK-92 cells. The generated CAR-NK-92 cells displayed high and selective cytotoxicity toward various corresponding leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma cell lines in vitro. Multitargeting approach using a mixture of CD19-NK-92 and CD138-NK-92 cells was also evaluated at various ratios to test the idea of personalized formulation to match the patients' antigen expression profile.

Therefore, hematological abnormalities might occur because of these toxic particles, but few studies on this issue have been reported. According to Cochrane guidance, we performed a systematic review on the relationship between exposure to PM2.5 and the risk of hematological disorders. Ten articles were included in this review. Anemia was found among children and elderly populations with 2- to 5-year PM2.5 exposure. Young children from mothers exposed to air pollution during pregnancy had a higher incidence of leukemia similar to the elderly. Supporting these data, outdoor workers also showed abnormal epigenetic modifications after exposure to very high PM2.5 levels. Adults living in high PM2.5 areas for 2 years were more likely to develop thrombocytosis. Finally, elderly populations with 7- to 8-year PM2.5 exposure showed increased risks of venous thromboembolism. In conclusion, the associations between PM2.5 and hematological aberrations among high-risk people with long-term exposure were reported.","['Fongsodsri, Kamonpan', 'Chamnanchanunt, Supat', 'Desakorn, Varunee', 'Thanachartwet, Vipa', 'Sahassananda, Duangjai', 'Rojnuckarin, Ponlapat', 'Umemura, Tsukuru']","['Fongsodsri K', 'Chamnanchanunt S', 'Desakorn V', 'Thanachartwet V', 'Sahassananda D', 'Rojnuckarin P', 'Umemura T']","['Department of Tropical Pathology, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Information Technology Unit, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Medical Technology and Sciences, International University of Health and Welfare, Ohkawa, Japan.']",,['eng'],,['Systematic Review'],20210714,Switzerland,Front Med (Lausanne),Frontiers in medicine,101648047,,,,PMC8316685,['NOTNLM'],"['air pollution', 'anemia', 'blood coagulation', 'leukemia', 'particulate matter', 'thrombosis']",2021/08/03 06:00,2021/08/03 06:01,['2021/08/02 06:08'],"['2021/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/02 06:08 [entrez]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmed.2021.692008 [doi]'],epublish,Front Med (Lausanne). 2021 Jul 14;8:692008. doi: 10.3389/fmed.2021.692008. eCollection 2021.,692008,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Fongsodsri, Chamnanchanunt, Desakorn, Thanachartwet,', 'Sahassananda, Rojnuckarin and Umemura.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinically silent ETV6-RUNX1 preleukemic clones are frequently found in neonatal cord blood, but few carriers develop B-ALL as a result of secondary genetic alterations. The understanding of the mechanisms underlying the first transforming steps could greatly advance the development of non-toxic prophylactic interventions. Using genetic lineage tracing, we examined the capacity of ETV6-RUNX1 to instruct a malignant phenotype in the hematopoietic lineage by cell-specific Cre-mediated activation of ETV6-RUNX1 from the endogenous Etv6 gene locus. Here we show that, while ETV6-RUNX1 has the propensity to trigger both T- and B-lymphoid malignancies, it is the second hit that determines tumor cell identity. To instigate leukemia, both oncogenic hits must place early in the development of hematopoietic/precursor cells, not in already committed B-cells. Depending on the nature of the second hit, the resulting B-ALLs presented distinct entities that were clearly separable based on their gene expression profiles. Our findings give a novel mechanistic insight into the early steps of ETV6-RUNX1+ B-ALL development and might have major implications for the potential development of ETV6-RUNX1+ B-ALL prevention

Mutations targeting genes encoding DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), TET family of DNA demethylases, and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1, IDH2) that produce TET inhibitory metabolite, 2-hyoxyglutarate (2-HG), are found in more than half of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To gain new insights into the regulation of DNA de/methylation and consequence of its alteration in cancer development, we searched for genes which are mutated in a manner that is linked with gene mutations involved in DNA de/methylation in multiple cancer types. We found that recurrent CBFB-MYH11 fusions, which result in the expression of fusion protein comprising core-binding factor beta (CBFB) and myosin heavy chain 11 (MYH11) and are found in 6 approximately 8% of AML patients, occur mutually exclusively with DNMT3A mutations. Tumors bearing CBFB-MYH11 fusion show DNA hypomethylation patterns similar to those with loss-of-function mutation of DNMT3A. Expression of CBFB-MYH11 fusion or inhibition of DNMT3A similarly impairs the methylation and expression of target genes of Runt related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), a functional partner of CBFB. We demonstrate that RUNX1 directly interacts with DNMT3A and that CBFB-MYH11 fusion protein sequesters RUNX1 in the cytoplasm, thereby preventing RUNX1 from interacting with and recruiting DNMT3A to its target genes. Our results identify a novel regulation of DNA methylation and provide a molecular basis how CBFB-MYH11 fusion contributes to leukemogenesis.","['Liu, Peng', 'Liu, Jin-Pin', 'Sun, Si-Jia', 'Gao, Yun', 'Ai, Yingjie', 'Chen, Xiufei', 'Sun, Yiping', 'Zhou, Mengyu', 'Liu, Yun', 'Xiong, Yue', 'Yuan, Hai-Xin']","['Liu P', 'Liu JP', 'Sun SJ', 'Gao Y', 'Ai Y', 'Chen X', 'Sun Y', 'Zhou M', 'Liu Y', 'Xiong Y', 'Yuan HX']","[""The Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai and the Molecular and Cell Biology Research Lab of the Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", ""The Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai and the Molecular and Cell Biology Research Lab of the Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", ""The Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai and the Molecular and Cell Biology Research Lab of the Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", ""The Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai and the Molecular and Cell Biology Research Lab of the Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', ""The Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai and the Molecular and Cell Biology Research Lab of the Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", ""The Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai and the Molecular and Cell Biology Research Lab of the Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", 'Ministry of Education (MOE) Key Laboratory of Metabolism and Molecular Medicine, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Ministry of Education (MOE) Key Laboratory of Metabolism and Molecular Medicine, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Cullgen Inc., San Diego, CA, United States.', ""The Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai and the Molecular and Cell Biology Research Lab of the Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.""]",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210715,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,PMC8321512,['NOTNLM'],"['CBFB-MYH11', 'DNA methylation', 'DNMT3A', 'RUNX1', 'mutually exclusive mutation']",2021/08/03 06:00,2021/08/03 06:01,['2021/08/02 06:08'],"['2021/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/02 06:08 [entrez]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.675424 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Jul 15;9:675424. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.675424. eCollection 2021.,675424,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Liu, Liu, Sun, Gao, Ai, Chen, Sun, Zhou, Liu, Xiong and Yuan.']",,,,"['YX was employed by company Cullgen Inc.

Thus, we aim to incorporate T-cell subsets with clinical features to develop a predictive model of clinical outcome. Methods: We retrospectively screened a total of 1,008 patients, including 252 newly diagnosed de novo FL patients with available peripheral blood T lymphocyte subsets who were randomized to different sets (177 in the training set and 75 in the internal validation set). A nomogram and a novel immune-clinical prognostic index (ICPI) were established according to multivariate Cox regression analysis for progression-free survival (PFS). The concordance index (C-index), Akaike's information criterion (AIC), and likelihood ratio chi-square were employed to compare the ICPI's discriminatory capability and homogeneity to that of FLIPI, FLIPI2, and PRIMA-PI. Additional external validation was performed using a dataset (n = 157) from other four centers. Results: In the training set, multivariate analysis identified five independent prognostic factors (Stage III/IV disease, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Hb <120g/L, CD4+ <30.7% and CD8+ >36.6%) for PFS. A novel ICPI was established according to the number of risk factors and stratify patients into 3 risk groups: high, intermediate, and low-risk with 4-5, 2-3, 0-1 risk factors respectively. The hazard ratios for patients in the high and intermediate-risk groups than those in the low-risk were 27.640 and 2.758. The ICPI could stratify patients into different risk groups both in the training set (P < 0.0001), internal validation set (P = 0.0039) and external validation set (P = 0.04). Moreover, in patients treated with RCHOP-like therapy, the ICPI was also predictive (P < 0.0001). In comparison to FLIPI, FLIPI2, and PRIMA-PI (C-index, 0.613-0.647), the ICPI offered adequate discrimination capability with C-index values of 0.679. Additionally, it exhibits good performance based on the lowest AIC and highest likelihood ratio chi-square score. Conclusions: The ICPI is a novel predictive model with improved prognostic performance for patients with de novo FL treated with R-CHOP/CHOP chemotherapy. It is capable to be used in routine practice and guides individualized precision therapy.","['Lu, Yaxiao', 'Yu, Jingwei', 'Gong, Wenchen', 'Su, Liping', 'Sun, Xiuhua', 'Bai, Ou', 'Zhou, Hui', 'Guan, Xue', 'Zhang, Tingting', 'Li, Lanfang', 'Qiu, Lihua', 'Qian, Zhengzi', 'Zhou, Shiyong', 'Meng, Bin', 'Ren, Xiubao', 'Wang, Xianhuo', 'Zhang, Huilai']","['Lu Y', 'Yu J', 'Gong W', 'Su L', 'Sun X', 'Bai O', 'Zhou H', 'Guan X', 'Zhang T', 'Li L', 'Qiu L', 'Qian Z', 'Zhou S', 'Meng B', 'Ren X', 'Wang X', 'Zhang H']","['Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China.', 'Departments of Pathology and Immunology/Biotherapy, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanxi Provincial Cancer Hospital, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma & Hematology, Hunan Cancer Hospital, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Departments of Pathology and Immunology/Biotherapy, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China.', 'Departments of Pathology and Immunology/Biotherapy, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Departments of Pathology and Immunology/Biotherapy, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, Tianjin, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210713,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC8316046,['NOTNLM'],"['T lymphocyte subsets', 'follicular lymphoma', 'peripheral blood', 'prognostic index', 'risk stratification']",2021/08/03 06:00,2021/08/03 06:01,['2021/08/02 06:07'],"['2021/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/02 06:07 [entrez]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.708784 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Jul 13;11:708784. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.708784. eCollection 2021.,708784,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Lu, Yu, Gong, Su, Sun, Bai, Zhou, Guan, Zhang, Li, Qiu, Qian,', 'Zhou, Meng, Ren, Wang and Zhang.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this case, combination therapy may be a promising way to overcome this obstacle. Here, we investigate the preclinical efficacy of a new strategy combining ABT-199 with homoharringtonine (HHT), a selective inhibitor of MCL-1 may be a promising approach for AML treatment as these two molecules are important in apoptosis. Methods: A Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay and flow cytometry were used to determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value and cell apoptosis rate, respectively. The flow cytometry results showed that combined treatment with HHT and ABT-199 caused apoptosis in AML patient samples (n=5) but had no effect on normal healthy donor samples (n=11). Furthermore, we used a Western blot assay to explore the mechanism underlying the efficacy of HHT combined with ABT-199. Finally, antileukemic activity was further evaluated in vivo xenograft model. Results: Our results indicated that ABT-199 combined with HHT significantly inhibited cell growth and promoted apoptosis in both AML cell lines and primary AML tumors in a dose- and time-dependent manner.

In two patients, leukemia and CSDH were confirmed on the basis of medical records, mild head trauma, and neuroimaging features. Both patients experienced reduced CSDH and neurological symptoms after receiving atorvastatin (20 mg/day) plus low-dose dexamethasone. However, this combined conservative treatment was ineffective in the third patient, who was diagnosed as having leukemia and showed an increased hematoma volume after two weeks of therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging findings suggested dural metastasis, which prompted a switch from statin-based conservative treatment to chemotherapy. Complete remission of the leukemia and resolution of the subdural mass were observed after chemotherapy, which supported a diagnosis of leukemia encephalopathy. The 5-month follow-ups did not reveal CSDH relapse in all 3 cases. Thus, atorvastatin-based conservative treatment may be effective for leukemia-related CSDH but not for leukemia encephalopathy.","['Yuan, Jiangyuan', 'Li, Ying', 'Liu, Xuanhui', 'Nie, Meng', 'Jiang,

The discovery of the molecular pathogenesis has led to entitle all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) as the first targeted therapy for acute leukemia. It is usually associated to anthracycline-based chemotherapy with high response rates, but potential long-term sequelae including therapy-related malignancies have been observed. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) was added to obviate these complications and investigational trials aimed to a new strategy with the incorporation of arsenic trioxide (ATO) into initial therapy instead of chemotherapy in selected patients. ATRA plus ATO without chemotherapy was the first attempt to treat low and intermediate-risk patients with APL. Our study aims to describe a monocentric cohort of patients with newly diagnosed APL effectively treated with ATO plus ATRA underlying its efficacy together with the high grade of tolerability of this association. From January 2009 to December 2019 23 APL patients were diagnosed and treated with ATO plus ATRA regimen: 14 males and 9 females patients with a median age of 45 years (range 18-72), for the majority intermediate risk (15 patients, 65%). The treatment was well tolerated and all patients achieved molecular remission after a median time of 3 months (range 1-6 months). All patients proceeded to consolidation phase as outpatients, they maintained complete molecular response at a median time of 44 months (range 15-127) except for 1 patient. All but one patient are alive and in response at a median follow-up of 48 months (range 9-141) without late effects. ATO plus ATRA regimen shows advantages in comparison to chemotherapy; in fact it allowed to treat patients in which chemotherapy could even not be applicable and it did not show secondary hematological diseases. The association of ATO to ATRA as chemo-free regimen enabled to treat APL even without chemotherapy.","['Autore, Francesco', 'Chiusolo, Patrizia', 'Sora, Federica', 'Giammarco, Sabrina', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Innocenti, Idanna', 'Metafuni, Elisabetta', 'Piccirillo, Nicola', 'Pagano, Livio', 'Sica, Simona']","['Autore F', 'Chiusolo P', 'Sora F', 'Giammarco S', 'Laurenti L', 'Innocenti I', 'Metafuni E', 'Piccirillo N', 'Pagano L', 'Sica S']","['Dipartimento di Diagnostica per Immagini, Radioterapia Oncologica ed Ematologia, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

We investigated oxidative stress as a possible mechanism of chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity in children with ALL. Materials and methods In this case-control study, we estimated the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), a DNA damage product, in children with B-cell ALL and control children. CSF samples were collected at diagnosis, at end of Induction 1, Induction 2, and Induction 2A - consolidation phase. CSF 8-OH-dG levels were compared in children with and without neurotoxicity. Results Children with ALL (n=23) at diagnosis had significantly higher median (interquartile range, IQR) CSF 8-OH-dG levels (ng/mL) compared to controls (n=19) [1.97 (1.59-2.56) Vs 0.65 (0.59-0.82), P<0.001]. CSF 8-OH-dG levels at the end of four weeks, eight weeks, and 16 weeks of chemotherapy were [3.96 (2.85-5.44) ng/mL], 1.00 (0.89-1.09), and 3.73 (2.80-4.39) ng/mL, respectively. Out of 23 children with ALL, 12 developed neurotoxicity; the CSF levels of 8-OH-dG in them were only marginally higher compared to those who did not develop neurotoxicity. The CSF 8-OH-dG levels did not show a significant correlation with the number of doses of methotrexate or vincristine received. Conclusion Chemotherapy increases the CNS oxidative stress as measured by CSF 8-OH-dG levels, with the levels being proportional to the intensity of chemotherapy. Children with neurotoxicity had only marginally higher CSF 8-OH-dG levels as compared to children without neurotoxicity.","['Dewan, Pooja', 'Chaudhary, Preety', 'Gomber, Sunil', 'Ahmed, Rafat S', 'Kotru, Mrinalini']","['Dewan P', 'Chaudhary P', 'Gomber S', 'Ahmed RS', 'Kotru M']","['Pediatrics, University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi, IND.', 'Pediatrics, University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi, IND.', 'Pediatrics, University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi, IND.', 'Biochemistry, University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi, IND.', 'Pathology, University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi, IND.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210628,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,,,PMC8318315,['NOTNLM'],"['child', 'leukemia', 'neurotoxicity', 'oxidative stress', 'reactive oxygen species']",2021/08/03 06:00,2021/08/03 06:01,['2021/08/02 06:05'],"['2021/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/02 06:05 [entrez]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.15997 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Jun 28;13(6):e15997. doi: 10.7759/cureus.15997. eCollection 2021 Jun.,e15997,"['Copyright (c) 2021, Dewan et al.']",,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is associated with the Philadelphia chromosome [Ph1, t (9; 22) (q34; q11)] or BCR-ABL fusion gene. CML usually undergoes a triphasic clinical course ending in a blast crisis, an accelerated phase of blasts and promyelocyte production. Ten percent of CML patients reach the blast crisis phase, with 20-30% of leukemias belonging to B-cell lymphoid lineage. However, a transformation of CML into T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is rare. Case presentation: We present a 56-year-old male patient, known case of hypertension and Ph1 CML of eight years with a family history of Gaucher disease who developed T-ALL. The patient presented with lymphadenopathy and severe anemia, needing packed RBC transfusion, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia at the admission. However, the monocytes and basophils percentage were high. The patient underwent a cervical lymph node core biopsy, and the immunohistochemistry stains showed an invasion of neoplastic cells positive for CD3, CD5, BCL2, CD34, TdT and focally positive for C-Kit and negative for CD20, CD56 and pan-CK. These histopathology features were consistent with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Conclusion: Blast crisis remain a challenge in CML management. It's of great importance to do a full proper workup including lymph nodes biopsies. The aim is to reverse blast crisis and restore the chronic phase.","['Al-Janazreh, Hamdi', 'Abuzneid, Yousef S', 'Khamayseh, Iman', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Alqam, Bilal', 'Abusabbah, Rosaline M F', 'Mustafa, Fatima K', 'Sarahneh, Shifa']","['Al-Janazreh H', 'Abuzneid YS', 'Khamayseh I', 'Morabito F', 'Alqam B', 'Abusabbah RMF', 'Mustafa FK', 'Sarahneh S']","['Al-Quds University Faculty of Medicine, Jerusalem, Palestine.', 'Hematology Department and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Cancer Care Center, Augusta Victoria Hospital, Jerusalem, Palestine.', 'Al-Quds University Faculty of Medicine, Jerusalem, Palestine.', 'Al-Quds University Faculty of Medicine, Jerusalem, Palestine.', 'Hematology Department and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Cancer Care Center, Augusta Victoria Hospital, Jerusalem, Palestine.', 'Al-Quds University Faculty of Medicine, Jerusalem, Palestine.', 'Al-Quds University Faculty of Medicine, Jerusalem, Palestine.', 'Al-Quds University Faculty of Medicine, Jerusalem, Palestine.', 'Al-Quds University Faculty of Medicine, Jerusalem, Palestine.']",,['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210714,England,Ann Med Surg (Lond),Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),101616869,,,,PMC8313842,['NOTNLM'],"['Blast crisis', 'CML', 'Case report', 'T-ALL', 'Transformation']",2021/08/03 06:00,2021/08/03 06:01,['2021/08/02 06:01'],"['2021/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/02 06:01 [entrez]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102565 [doi]', 'S2049-0801(21)00515-X [pii]']",epublish,Ann Med Surg (Lond). 2021 Jul 14;68:102565. doi: 10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102565. eCollection 2021 Aug.,102565,['(c) 2021 The Authors.'],,,,['There is no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This condition is characterized by the proliferation of abnormal Langerhans cells within different tissues. Skin rash is the typical early feature, but bony involvement is the second most common presentation. The most common complications are musculoskeletal disabilities, hearing problems, skin scarring, neuropsychiatric defects and most importantly, progression to secondary malignancies like leukemia. Early recognition and treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality. Herein, we report a case of a 10-year-old male presenting with a tender, palpable mass in the lower limb. On initial imaging, a lesion involving the diaphysis of the fibula was observed, raising concerns of Ewing sarcoma.

Material and methods: MicroRNA expression data of AML were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and analyzed by microarray analysis. Expression levels of miR-107 and RAD51 mRNA were detected by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Protein expression of RAD51, pro-apoptotic protein Bax, apoptosis related protein CytC and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 were determined by Western blot. The rate of cell apoptosis was detected by Annexin-V/PI. The predicted targeting relationship between miR-107 and the 3'UTR of RAD51 was first predicted by the online application TargetScan and then verified by dual-luciferase assay. Results: Acute myelocytic leukemia-associated genes (n = 197) and miRNAs (n = 1701) were retrieved from the database, the interaction network of miRNA-mRNA was constructed and the core position was occupied by RAD51. miR-107 exhibited a regulatory effect on RAD51 in which the mRNA and protein expression of RAD51 were both significantly inhibited by miR-107 mimics in vitro. Additionally, down-regulated expression of miR107 as well as up-regulated expression of RAD51 were detected not only in the plasma of AML patients compared to healthy volunteers, but also in AML cell lines compared to the normal bone marrow stromal cell line. Further study found that increased expression of miR-107 and the consequent down-regulation of RAD51 could aggravate the apoptosis of AML cells in vitro. Conclusions: Our present results showed that the crucial role of RAD51 and miR-107 in the apoptosis of AML cells, i.e., miR-107 promotes the apoptosis of AML cells through down-regulating the expression of RAD51.","['Huang, Fengxia', 'Tang, Wei', 'Lei, Yan']","['Huang F', 'Tang W', 'Lei Y']","[""Department of Medical Technology Clinical and Hematological Laboratory Office, Xi'an Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", 'Department of Radiology, Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, Sichuan, China.', 'Translational Medical Research Center, North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong, Sichuan, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200204,Poland,Arch Med Sci,Archives of medical science : AMS,101258257,,,,PMC8314419,['NOTNLM'],"['MiR-107', 'RAD51', 'acute myelocytic leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'interaction network']",2020/02/04 00:00,2020/02/04 00:01,['2021/08/02 05:59'],"['2018/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/02 05:59 [entrez]', '2020/02/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/04 00:01 [medline]']","['10.5114/aoms.2020.92860 [doi]', '92141 [pii]']",epublish,Arch Med Sci. 2020 Feb 4;17(4):1044-1055. doi: 10.5114/aoms.2020.92860. eCollection 2021.,1044-1055,['Copyright: (c) 2020 Termedia & Banach.'],,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the possible association between CAT C262T polymorphism in the promoter region of the CAT gene and leukemia risk and to determine the relationship between CAT genotypes and CAT enzyme activities. Material and methods: Genotypes of 102 cases and 112 healthy controls' genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. Catalase activity was measured with the method of Aebi. Results: The frequencies of the T allele among the cases and controls were 28.4% and 25.9%, respectively (p = 0.75). The frequencies of CC, CT, and TT among cases were 57.8%, 27.4%, and 14.7%, respectively, while in controls, the frequencies of CC, CT, and TT were 54.4%, 39.3%, and 6.3%, respectively, which were not significantly different. Although CAT enzyme activity was lower in leukemia patients with TT genotypes than in controls, this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.37). Conclusions: This is the first report showing that CAT C262T polymorphism is not a genetic predisposing factor for the risk of leukemia in the Turkish population. However, additional research is needed to confirm these findings.","['Eras, Nazan', 'Turkoz, Gozde', 'Tombak, Anil', 'Tiftik, Naci', 'Yalin, Serap', 'Berkoz, Mehmet', 'Erden, Sema', 'Akbas, Etem']","['Eras N', 'Turkoz G', 'Tombak A', 'Tiftik N', 'Yalin S', 'Berkoz M', 'Erden S', 'Akbas E']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Yuzuncu Yil University, Van, Turkey.', 'Vocational School of Health Service, Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20191112,Poland,Arch Med Sci,Archives of medical science : AMS,101258257,,,,PMC8314395,['NOTNLM'],"['antioxidant', 'catalase', 'leukemia', 'oxidative stress', 'polymorphism']",2019/11/12 00:00,2019/11/12 00:01,['2021/08/02 05:59'],"['2018/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/02 05:59 [entrez]', '2019/11/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/12 00:01 [medline]']","['10.5114/aoms.2019.89692 [doi]', '92531 [pii]']",epublish,Arch Med Sci. 2019 Nov 12;17(4):928-933. doi: 10.5114/aoms.2019.89692. eCollection 2021.,928-933,['Copyright: (c) 2019 Termedia & Banach.'],,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Material and methods: In this retrospective study, we included relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients who underwent multiple lines of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was to determine the objective response and toxicity. Results: Ninety-nine patients with a median age of 59.8 years were included in the study. Eighty-one patients had NHL (follicular lymphoma: 10, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: 27, mantle-cell lymphoma: 18, marginal zone lymphoma: 9, small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia: 17) and 18 patients had HL. The patients had previously received a median of three lines of chemotherapy (range: 2-8) except autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT); 19 patients (HL: 11, NHL: 8) had undergone ASCT. The objective response rate (ORR) was 74.3%, the complete response rate was 57% (= 53), and the partial response rate was 16.6% ( = 19). The overall survival (OS) rate at 1 year was 74.6%. The progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 1 year was 62.5%. The most common side effects were lymphopenia, anemia and neutropenia. Side effects which were observed as grade 3 and higher levels were lymphopenia (14.1%), neutropenia (10.1%) and fatigue (7.1%). Conclusions: Objective response rate of bendamustine was found to be 74.3% in relapsed/refractory HL and NHL patients.

In this study, the antiproliferative activities of the methanolic extract of Tetrapleura tetraptera fruits and nine different fractions (C1-C9) from the column chromatographic separation of the extract against leukemia (Jurkat) and human breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines were investigated using a tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay. Phytochemical screening of the extract and fractions found alkaloids, carbohydrates, flavonoids, glycosides, phenols, saponins, steroids, tannins, and terpenoids in the methanolic extract. Most of the fractions exhibited antiproliferative activity (>100 mug/mL) with the Jurkat cells being more susceptible than the MCF-7 cells. Four of the collected fractions C4, C3, C5, and C2 had good selective indices in decreasing order of activity, in the case of Jurkat cells. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of all samples (except for C4 and C9) revealed that C1, C2, C3, and C5 each had a single component. More importantly, fractions C2, C3, and C5, which were selective to Jurkat cells, also had the same retention time of 1.846 min. Fractions C6 and C8 had two components, with C7 having four components.

However, the network of soluble immunological molecules in the bone marrow microenvironment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains underexplored. Herein, we evaluated the levels of the immunological molecules (CXCL8, CCL2, CXCL9, CCL5, CXCL10, IL-6, TNF, IFN-gamma, IL-17A, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-2) in the bone marrow plasma of 47 recently diagnosed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients during induction therapy using cytometric beads arrays. The results demonstrated that B-ALL patients showed high levels of CXCL9, CXCL10, IL-6, and IL-10 at the time of diagnosis, while at the end of induction therapy, a decrease in the levels of these immunological molecules and an increase in CCL5, IFN-gamma, and IL-17A levels were observed. These findings indicate that B-ALL patients have an imbalance in chemokines and cytokines in the bone marrow microenvironment that contributes to suppressing the immune response. This immune imbalance may be associated with the presence of leukemic cells since, at the end of the induction therapy, with the elimination and reduction to residual cells, the proinflammatory profile is reestablished, characterized by an increase in the cytokines of the Th1 and Th17 profiles.","['Magalhaes-Gama, Fabio', 'Kerr, Marlon Wendell Athaydes', 'de Araujo, Nilberto Dias',

The latest guidelines emphasize stratifying the patients in terms of CAT risks periodically. Multiple risk assessment models (RAMs) were developed to classify patients and guide thromboprophylaxis to high-risk patients. This study aimed to discuss and highlight different RAMs across various malignancy types with their related advantages and disadvantages. A scoping review was conducted using predefined search terms in three scientific databases, including Google Scholar, Science Direct, and PubMed. The search for studies was restricted to original research articles that reported risk assessment models published in the last thirteen years (between 2008 and 2021) to cover the most recently published evidence following the development of the principal risk assessment score in 2008. Data charting of the relevant trials, scores, advantages, and disadvantages were done iteratively considering the malignancy type. Of the initially identified 1115 studies, 39 studies with over 67,680 patients were included in the review. In solid organ malignancy, nine risk assessment scores were generated. The first and most known Khorana risk score still offers the best available risk assessment model when used for high-risk populations with a threshold of 2 and above. However, KRS has a limitation of failure to stratify low-risk patients. The COMPASS-CAT score showed the best performance in the lung carcinoma patients who have a higher prevalence of thrombosis than other malignancy subtypes. In testicular germ cell tumours, Bezan et al RAM is a validated good discriminatory RAM for this malignancy subtype. CAT in haematological malignancy seems to be under-investigated and has multiple disease-related, and treatment-related confounding factors. AL-Ani et al score performed efficiently in acute leukemia. In multiple myeloma, both SAVED and IMPEDED VTE scores showed good performance. Despite the availability of different disease-specific scores in lymphoma-related thrombosis, the standard of care needs to be redefined.","['Mosaad, Manar', 'Elnaem, Mohamed Hassan', 'Cheema, Ejaz', 'Ibrahim, Ismail', 'Ab Rahman, Jamalludin', 'Kori, Ahlam Naila', 'Hin, How Soon']","['Mosaad M', 'Elnaem MH', 'Cheema E', 'Ibrahim I', 'Ab Rahman J', 'Kori AN', 'Hin HS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, International Islamic University Malaysia, Kuantan, Pahang, Malaysia.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, Faculty of Pharmacy, International Islamic University Malaysia, Kuantan, Pahang, Malaysia.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, International Islamic University Malaysia, Kuantan, Pahang, Malaysia.', 'Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, International Islamic University Malaysia, Kuantan, Pahang, Malaysia.', 'Haematology Unit, Tengku Ampuan Afzan Hospital, Kuantan, Pahang, Malaysia.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, International Islamic University Malaysia, Kuantan, Pahang, Malaysia.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0873-6541', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8538-7392', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4323-1194', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1337-5664']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210724,New Zealand,Int J Gen Med,International journal of general medicine,101515487,,,,PMC8318782,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'prophylaxis', 'risk assessment', 'thrombosis']",2021/08/03 06:00,2021/08/03 06:01,['2021/08/02 05:50'],"['2021/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/02 05:50 [entrez]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJGM.S320492 [doi]', '320492 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Gen Med. 2021 Jul 24;14:3881-3897. doi: 10.2147/IJGM.S320492. eCollection 2021.,3881-3897,['(c) 2021 Mosaad et al.'],,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to analyze the cancer incidence and mortality rates during 2016 in Zhejiang Province, Southeast China. METHODS: Data were collected from 14 population-based cancer registries across Zhejiang Province of China. Cancer incidence and mortality rates stratified by sex and region were analyzed. The crude rate, age-standardized rate, age-specific and region-specific rate, and cumulative rate were calculated. The proportions of 10 common cancers in different groups and the incidence and mortality rates of the top five cancers in different age groups were also calculated. The Chinese national census of 2000 and the world Segi population was used for calculating the age-standardized incidence and mortality rates. RESULTS: The 14 cancer registries covered a population of 14,250,844 individuals, accounting for 29.13% of the population of Zhejiang Province. The total reported cancer cases and deaths were 55,835 and 27,013, respectively. The proportion of morphological verification (MV%) was 78.95% of the population, and percentage of incident cases identified through death certificates only (DCO%) was 1.23% with a mortality-to-incidence ratio (M/I ratio) of 0.48. The crude incidence rate in Zhejiang cancer registration areas was 391.80/105; the age-standardized incidence rate of the Chinese standard population (ASIRC) and the age-standardized incidence rate of the world standard population (ASIRW) were 229.76/105 and 220.96/105, respectively. The incidence rate in men was higher than that in women. The incidence rate increased rapidly after 45 years of age and peaked in individuals aged 80 to 84 years. The top 10 incidence rates of cancers were lung cancer, female breast cancer, thyroid cancer, colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, cervical cancer, esophageal cancer, and pancreatic cancer (from highest to lowest). The crude mortality rate in Zhejiang cancer registration areas was 189.55/105; the age-standardized mortality rate of the Chinese standard population (ASMRC) and the age-standardized mortality rate of the world standard population (ASMRW) were 94.46/105 and 93.42/105, respectively. The mortality rate in men was higher than that in women, and the male population in rural areas was higher than that in urban areas. The cancer mortality rate increased rapidly after 50 years of age and peaked in individuals aged 85+ years. The top 10 mortality rates of cancers were lung cancer, liver cancer, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, esophageal cancer, female breast cancer, prostate cancer, lymphoma, and leukemia (from highest to lowest). CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer, female breast cancer, thyroid cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer, and stomach cancer were the most common cancers in Zhejiang Province. Effective prevention and control measures should be established after considering the different characteristics of cancers in urban and rural areas.","['Wang, You-Qing', 'Li, Hui-Zhang', 'Gong, Wei-Wei', 'Chen, Yao-Yao', 'Zhu, Chen', 'Wang, Le', 'Zhong, Jie-Ming', 'Du, Ling-Bin']","['Wang YQ', 'Li HZ', 'Gong WW', 'Chen YY', 'Zhu C', 'Wang L', 'Zhong JM', 'Du LB']","['Zhejiang Provincial Office for Cancer Prevention and Control, The Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhejiang Cancer Hospital), Institute of Basic Medicine and Cancer (IBMC), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310022, China.', 'Zhejiang Provincial Office for Cancer Prevention and Control, The Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhejiang Cancer Hospital), Institute of Basic Medicine and Cancer (IBMC), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310022, China.', 'Department of Chronic Non-communicable Disease Prevention and Control, Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310051, China.', 'Zhejiang Provincial Office for Cancer Prevention and Control, The Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhejiang Cancer Hospital), Institute of Basic Medicine and Cancer (IBMC), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310022, China.', 'Zhejiang Provincial Office for Cancer Prevention and Control, The Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhejiang Cancer Hospital), Institute of Basic Medicine and Cancer (IBMC), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310022, China.', 'Zhejiang Provincial Office for Cancer Prevention and Control, The Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhejiang Cancer Hospital), Institute of Basic Medicine and Cancer (IBMC), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310022, China.', 'Department of Chronic Non-communicable Disease Prevention and Control, Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310051, China.', 'Zhejiang Provincial Office for Cancer Prevention and Control, The Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhejiang Cancer Hospital), Institute of Basic Medicine and Cancer (IBMC), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310022, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210729,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,,IM,"['China/epidemiology', '*Esophageal Neoplasms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Registries', '*Rural Population', 'Urban Population']",PMC8382332,,,2021/08/03 06:00,2021/08/25 06:00,['2021/08/02 05:41'],"['2021/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/02 05:41 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CM9.0000000000001666 [doi]', '00029330-202108200-00010 [pii]']",epublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2021 Jul 29;134(16):1959-1966. doi: 10.1097/CM9.0000000000001666.,1959-1966,"['Copyright (c) 2021 The Chinese Medical Association, produced by Wolters Kluwer,', 'Inc. under the CC-BY-NC-ND license.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

YG-PLL originates from lymphoma cells and contains a defective HTLV-I proviral genome. Although YG-PLL cannot survive without IL-2/4, the follicular dendritic cell (FDC)-like cell line HK expressing OX40-ligand gene (OX40L(+)HK) inhibited their death in the presence of soluble neutral polymers. After the prevention of cell death, YG-PLL proliferated on OX40L(+)HK without IL2/4 in the presence of two kinds of positively or negatively charged polymers. In particular, dermatan sulfate and poly-L-histidine supported growth for more than 4 months. Therefore, the original lymphoma cells proliferated transiently in the presence of IL2/4, and their growth arrest was inhibited by the addition of PLL. Furthermore, YG-PLL lost IL2/4 dependency by the following 3-step procedure: preculture with IL2/4 and neutral polymers, 3-day culture with neutral polymer on OX40L(+)HK to inhibit cell death, and co-culture with OX40L(+)HK in the presence of the positively and negatively charged polymers. The extracellular environment made by soluble polymers plays a role in the growth of ATLL in vitro.","['Kagami, Yoshitoyo', 'Kato, Harumi', 'Okada, Yasutaka', 'Seto, Masao', 'Yamamoto, Kazuhito']","['Kagami Y', 'Kato H', 'Okada Y', 'Seto M', 'Yamamoto K']","['Department of Hematology, Toyota Kosei Hospital, Toyota, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratories, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Nagakute, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210731,Japan,J Clin Exp Hematop,Journal of clinical and experimental hematopathology : JCEH,101141257,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (OX40 Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF4 protein, human)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '24967-94-0 (Dermatan Sulfate)', '26062-48-6 (polyhistidine)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)']",IM,"['*Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dendritic Cells, Follicular/immunology/metabolism', 'Dermatan Sulfate/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Histidine/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/*metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'OX40 Ligand/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC8519244,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'Follicular dendritic cell', 'Interleukin', 'OX-40 ligand', 'Soluble high-molecular-weight polymer']",2021/08/03 06:00,2021/09/28 06:00,['2021/08/02 05:40'],"['2021/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/02 05:40 [entrez]']",['10.3960/jslrt.20058 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Exp Hematop. 2021 Sep 10;61(3):145-151. doi: 10.3960/jslrt.20058.

It is more effective than traditional treatments but causes adverse effects such as pleural effusion that limits its effective treatment cycle. Since pleural effusion is caused by vascular hyperpermeability and causes discontinuation of treatment with dasatinib, it is important to explore the mechanism of pleural effusion caused by dasatinib and how to prevent it. In this study, we investigated how dasatinib increase vascular permeability, and how it can be prevented. Cytotoxicity was observed in vascular endothelial cells or epithelial cells were exposed to high concentrations of dasatinib. Thus, it was observed in vascular endothelial cells such as human umbilical vascular endothelial cell (HUVEC). Vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin is one of the important factors that control vascular permeability. When VE-cadherin expression decreases, vascular permeability increases, but it did not change with tyrosine kinase inhibitor exposure. Monolayer permeability significantly increased only with high concentration of dasatinib, but this increase was prevented by cAMP activation. Furthermore, dasatinib affects the cell morphology of HUVEC, with increased inter celluar space compared to control and bosutinib, which were also attenuated by cAMP activation. Dasatinib significantly affected permeability control of vascular endothelial cells compared to bosutinib and imatinib. These results indicated that the cAMP signaling pathway may be involved in the pleural effusion caused by dasatinib in CML patients.","['Aoyama, Tsuyoshi', 'Kuriyama, Hiroki', 'Sato, Yuki', 'Imai, Shungo', 'Kashiwagi, Hitoshi', 'Sugawara, Mitsuru', 'Takekuma, Yoh']","['Aoyama T', 'Kuriyama H', 'Sato Y', 'Imai S', 'Kashiwagi H', 'Sugawara M', 'Takekuma Y']","['Laboratory of Pharmacokinetics, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University.', 'Laboratory of Pharmacokinetics, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University.', 'Laboratory of Pharmacokinetics, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University.', 'Laboratory of Pharmacokinetics, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University.', 'Laboratory of Pharmacokinetics, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University.', 'Laboratory of Pharmacokinetics, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Hokkaido University Hospital.', 'Global Station for Biosurfaces and Drug Discovery, Hokkaido University.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Hokkaido University Hospital.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (cadherin 5)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Cadherins/*metabolism', 'Capillary Permeability/*drug effects', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Dasatinib/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Permeability', 'Pleural Effusion/*chemically induced/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction']",,['NOTNLM'],"['cAMP', 'cell morphology', 'dasatinib', 'permeability', 'pleural effusion', 'vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin']",2021/08/03 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/08/02 05:39'],"['2021/08/02 05:39 [entrez]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1248/bpb.b21-00270 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2021;44(8):1101-1110. doi: 10.1248/bpb.b21-00270.,1101-1110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: In the present research, we have tested whether promoter DNA methylation of a set of Wnt/non-Wnt genes such as [cadherin-2 (CDH2)], ""present in circulation"", could serve as ""bone-marrow biopsy surrogate"" and help in diagnosing the status, sub-type or treatment outcome in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. METHODS: Promoter DNA methylation was quantified in the bisulfite modified blood from the pediatric ALL patients (n= 86) in comparison with age-matched cancer-free subjects (n= 28), using real-time methylation specific PCR followed by rigorous statistical validations. RESULTS: The observed methylation index, sensitivity and specificity of selected molecular markers (viz., SALL1, WNT5alpha, LRP1b, CDH2) in patients' liquid-biopsies was clinically significant showing high positive correlation in the pre-B ALL cases (p-value < 0.001). A substantial drop in promoter methylation signal of the follow-up/post-treatment patients was also noted (p-value < 0.001), which suggested an impending role of minimally invasive liquid-biopsy approach in the diagnosis and/or therapeutic monitoring of pediatric leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst the reported metadata provides useful insight into the plausible involvement of epigenetic glitches in leukemogensis, our findings strengthen the remarkable functional consequences of dysregulated Wnt signaling genes in the hematological malignancies besides offering a novel panel of epigenetic marks.","['Hussan, Syeda Saliah', 'Maqsood, Neha', 'Wang, Qingbing', 'Tao, Sun', 'Sadaf, Saima']","['Hussan SS', 'Maqsood N', 'Wang Q', 'Tao S', 'Sadaf S']","['Biopharmaceuticals and Biomarkers Discovery Lab., School of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Biopharmaceuticals and Biomarkers Discovery Lab., School of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Department of Interventional Radiology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Biopharmaceuticals and Biomarkers Discovery Lab., School of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'CpG island', 'Wnt signaling pathway', 'biomarker', 'bisulfite conversion', 'diagnosis', 'promoter hypermethylation']",2021/08/03 06:00,2021/08/03 06:00,['2021/08/02 05:39'],"['2021/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/02 05:39 [entrez]']","['CBM200814 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-200814 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2021;32(4):459-470. doi: 10.3233/CBM-200814.,459-470,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We completed a prospective trial-based economic analysis of Canadian patients to study the direct medical costs and quality-adjusted benefit associated with these therapies. METHODS: Mean survival was calculated using the restricted mean survival method from randomization to the study time-horizon of 24 months. Health state utilities were collected using the EuroQOL EQ-5D instrument with Canadian tariffs applied to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs were applied to resource utilization data (expressed in 2019 US dollars). We examined costs and QALYs associated ibrutinib, ibrutinib with rituximab (IR), and BR therapy. RESULTS: A total of 55 patients were enrolled; two patients were excluded from the analysis. On-protocol costs (associated with protocol-specified resource use) were higher for patients receiving ibrutinib (mean $189,335; P < 0.0001) and IR (mean $219,908; P < 0.0001) compared to BR (mean $51,345), driven by higher acquisition costs for ibrutinib. Total mean costs (over 2-years) were $192,615 with ibrutinib, $223,761 with IR, and $55,413 with BR (P < 0.0001 for ibrutinib vs. BR and P < 0.0001 for IR vs. BR). QALYs were similar between the three treatment arms: 1.66 (0.16) for ibrutinib alone, 1.65 (0.24) for IR, and 1.66 (0.17) for BR; therefore, a formal cost-utility analysis was not conducted. CONCLUSIONS: Direct medical costs are higher for patients receiving ibrutinib-based therapies compared to chemoimmunotherapy in frontline chronic lymphocytic leukemia, with the cost of ibrutinib representing a key driver.","['Cheung, Matthew C', 'Mittmann, Nicole', 'Owen, Carolyn', 'Abdel-Samad, Nizar', 'Fraser, Graeme A M', 'Lam, Selay', 'Crump, Michael', 'Sperlich, Catherine', 'van der Jagt, Richard', 'Prica, Anca', 'Couban, Stephen', 'Woyach, Jennifer A', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Booth, Allison M', 'Mandrekar, Sumithra J', 'McDonald, Gail', 'Shepherd, Lois E', 'Yen, Hope', 'Chen, Bingshu E', 'Hay, Annette E']","['Cheung MC', 'Mittmann N', 'Owen C', 'Abdel-Samad N', 'Fraser GAM', 'Lam S', 'Crump M', 'Sperlich C', 'van der Jagt R', 'Prica A', 'Couban S', 'Woyach JA', 'Ruppert AS', 'Booth AM', 'Mandrekar SJ', 'McDonald G', 'Shepherd LE', 'Yen H', 'Chen BE', 'Hay AE']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Odette Cancer Centre, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; Canadian Cancer Trials Group, Queens University, Kingston, Canada.

METHODS: Patients with a history of lymphoma or leukaemia with a current age between 12 and 25 years were identified from the regional paediatric oncology database. The medical records and radiological findings were reviewed, and any spinal deformity identified. The treatment of the malignancy and the spinal deformity, if any, was noted. RESULTS: From a cohort of 346 patients, 19 (5.5%) had radiological evidence of scoliosis, defined as a Cobb angle of > 10 degrees . A total of five patients (1.4% of the total cohort) had a Cobb angle of > 40 degrees , all of whom had corrective surgery. No patient with scoliosis had other pathology as a possible cause of the scoliosis and all had been treated with high doses of steroids for leukaemia, either acute or chronic myeloid, or acute lymphoblastic. CONCLUSION: There is an increased prevalence of idiopathic-like scoliosis and larger curves (Cobb angle of > 40 degrees ) associated with childhood leukaemia, which has not been previously reported in the literature. Causative factors may relate to the underlying disease process and/or its treatment.

ISFN can progress to overt lymphoma, but precise parameters with which to assess this risk and its association with related diseases remain incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to explore these parameters. METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed 11 cases of ISFN and one of PFL between 2003 and 2018. Ten patients had ISFN in the lymph nodes, and one had ISFN in the spleen. Haematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical stains were reviewed. Involvement of follicles by ISFN was scored with a three-tier scheme. Of five patients with low ISFN scores, one had chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, one had mycosis fungoides, and three were free of haematopoietic disease. Among them, four are alive and one was lost to follow-up. Of the six ISFN patients with high scores, two had concurrent marginal zone lymphomas, one had concurrent diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), one had Castleman-like disease, one had progressive transformation of germinal centres with IgG4-related disease, and one had no haematopoietic disease; all are alive except for one who died of concurrent DLBCL. The patient with PFL developed DLBCL 7 years after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of this limited series, we conclude that only cases with high scores are associated with an overt lymphoma or an abnormal lymphoid process, and that scoring may be a useful parameter with which to assess the risk of associated lymphoma, and deserves further study. We also performed a comprehensive review of the literature.","['Tamber, Gurdip S', 'Chevarie-Davis, Myriam', 'Warner, Margaret', 'Seguin, Chantal', 'Caron, Carole', 'Michel, Rene P']","['Tamber GS', 'Chevarie-Davis M', 'Warner M', 'Seguin C', 'Caron C', 'Michel RP']","['Department of Pathology, McGill University, Alma, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Alma, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, McGill University Health Centre, Alma, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, McGill University Health Centre, Alma, Quebec, Canada.', ""Department of Pathology, Hotel Dieu D'Alma, Alma, Quebec, Canada."", 'Department of Pathology, McGill University, Alma, Quebec, Canada.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0120-1467'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210922,England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', 'follicular lymphoma', 'marginal zone lymphoma', 'partial involvement by follicular lymphoma', 'review']",2021/08/02 06:00,2021/08/02 06:00,['2021/08/01 21:18'],"['2021/07/18 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/02 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/01 21:18 [entrez]']",['10.1111/his.14535 [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 2021 Dec;79(6):1072-1086. doi: 10.1111/his.14535.

The present study aimed to examine such information needs among long-term YACSs, and identify characteristics of those with needs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Cancer Registry of Norway identified long-term YACSs diagnosed with breast cancer, colorectal cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, or malignant melanoma at the age of 19-39 years, between 1985 and 2009. Survivors were mailed a questionnaire, in which respondents reported their information needs on physical activity, diet, and rehabilitation services 5-30 years post-diagnosis. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the prevalence of information needs and associated factors. RESULTS: Of 1488 respondents (a response rate of 42%), 947 were included. Median age at diagnosis was 35 years (range 19-39) and median observation time since diagnosis was 14 years (range 5-30). In total, 41% reported information needs for information about physical activity, 45% about diet, and 47% about rehabilitation services. Information needs were associated with higher treatment intensity, increasing number of late effects, and an unhealthy lifestyle. CONCLUSION: A large proportion of long-term YACSs report information needs regarding lifestyle and/or rehabilitation more than a decade beyond treatment. Assessments of such information needs should become a part of long-term care of these cancer survivors.","['Thorsen, Lene', 'Bohn, Synne-Kristin H', 'Lie, Hanne C', 'Fossa, Sophie D', 'Kiserud, Cecilie E']","['Thorsen L', 'Bohn SH', 'Lie HC', 'Fossa SD', 'Kiserud CE']","['National Advisory Unit On Late Effects After Cancer Treatment, Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Service, Division of Cancer Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'National Advisory Unit On Late Effects After Cancer Treatment, Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway. synn@ous-hf.no.', 'National Advisory Unit On Late Effects After Cancer Treatment, Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Behavioural Sciences in Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'National Advisory Unit On Late Effects After Cancer Treatment, Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'National Advisory Unit On Late Effects After Cancer Treatment, Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.']",,['eng'],"['45980/Kreftforeningen', '218312/The Research Council of Norway']",['Journal Article'],20210801,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adult', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Exercise', 'Humans', 'Life Style', '*Melanoma', '*Neoplasms', 'Survivors', 'Young Adult']",PMC8636439,['NOTNLM'],"['Dietary advice', 'Information needs', 'Lifestyle advice', 'Long-term young adult cancer survivors', 'Physical activity/exercise advice', 'Rehabilitation services']",2021/08/02 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/08/01 21:14'],"['2021/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/01 21:14 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-021-06418-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-021-06418-z [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2022 Jan;30(1):521-533. doi: 10.1007/s00520-021-06418-z.

However, the complexity of the disease and the identification of new targets require the adaptation of treatment protocols to reduce side effects and increase benefit for the patients. One key regulator of leukemogenesis and chemotherapy resistance in AML is the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway. It is deregulated in numerous cancer entities and inhibition of its downstream transcription factors GLI translates into anti-leukemic effects. One major regulator of GLI is BRD4, a BET family member with epigenetic functions. We investigated the effect of ZEN-3365, a novel BRD4 inhibitor, on AML cells in regard to the HH pathway. We show that ZEN-3365 alone or in combination with GANT-61 reduced GLI promoter activity, cell proliferation and colony formation in AML cell lines and primary cells. Our findings strongly support the evaluation of the BRD4 inhibitor ZEN-3365 as a new therapeutic option in AML.","['Wellbrock, Jasmin', 'Behrmann, Lena', 'Muschhammer, Jana', 'Modemann, Franziska', 'Khoury, Kais', 'Brauneck, Franziska', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Campeau, Eric', 'Fiedler, Walter']","['Wellbrock J', 'Behrmann L', 'Muschhammer J', 'Modemann F', 'Khoury K', 'Brauneck F', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Campeau E', 'Fiedler W']","['Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation With Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany. j.wellbrock@uke.de.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation With Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation With Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation With Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation With Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation With Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation With Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Zenith Epigenetics Ltd, 4820 Richard Road SW, Suite 300, Calgary, AB, T3E 6L1, Canada.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation With Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210801,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",PMC8592969,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'BET inhibitor', 'GANT-61', 'GLI', 'Hedgehog', 'ZEN-3365']",2021/08/02 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/08/01 21:12'],"['2021/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/01 21:12 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-021-04602-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-021-04602-z [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2021 Dec;100(12):2933-2941. doi: 10.1007/s00277-021-04602-z.

However, TRAIL-R2 is highly expressed by many cancers suggesting pro-tumor functions. Indeed, TRAIL/TRAIL-R2 also activate pro-inflammatory pathways enhancing tumor cell invasion, migration, and proliferation. In addition, nuclear TRAIL-R2 (nTRAIL-R2) promotes malignancy by inhibiting miRNA let-7-maturation. Here, we show that TRAIL-R2 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53 in the nucleus, assigning a novel pro-tumor function to TRAIL-R2. Knockdown of TRAIL-R2 in p53 wild-type cells increases the half-life of p53 and the expression of its target genes, whereas its re-expression decreases p53 protein levels. Interestingly, TRAIL-R2 also interacts with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), a major regulator of p53 stability. PML-nuclear bodies are also the main sites of TRAIL-R2/p53 co-localization. Notably, knockdown or destruction of PML abolishes the TRAIL-R2-mediated regulation of p53 levels. In summary, our finding that nTRAIL-R2 facilitates p53 degradation and thereby negatively regulates p53 target gene expression provides insight into an oncogenic role of TRAIL-R2 in tumorigenesis that particularly manifests in p53 wild-type tumors.","['Willms, Anna', 'Schupp, Hella', 'Poelker, Michelle', 'Adawy, Alshaimaa', 'Debus, Jan Frederik', 'Hartwig, Torsten', 'Krichel, Tim', 'Fritsch, Jurgen', 'Singh, Steven', 'Walczak, Henning', 'von Karstedt, Silvia', 'Schafer, Heiner', 'Trauzold, Anna']","['Willms A', 'Schupp H', 'Poelker M', 'Adawy A', 'Debus JF', 'Hartwig T', 'Krichel T', 'Fritsch J', 'Singh S', 'Walczak H', 'von Karstedt S', 'Schafer H', 'Trauzold A']","['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Infection Prevention and Infectious Diseases, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', 'CECAD Cluster of Excellence, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry I, Medical Faculty, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'CECAD Cluster of Excellence, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Translational Genomics, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, Medical Faculty, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne, Medical Faculty, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany. atrauzold@email.uni-kiel.de.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6722-8729', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6936-9090', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4697-556X']",['eng'],"['KL2 TR001063/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'TR1063/6-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation)', 'Cluster of Excellence on Precision Medicine in Chronic Inflammation/Deutsche', 'Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation)', '70112281/Deutsche Krebshilfe (German Cancer Aid)']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210731,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,,IM,,PMC8325694,,,2021/08/02 06:00,2021/08/02 06:00,['2021/08/01 21:04'],"['2020/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/01 21:04 [entrez]', '2021/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-021-04048-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-021-04048-1 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2021 Jul 31;12(8):757. doi: 10.1038/s41419-021-04048-1.,757,['(c) 2021.

Despite the recent identification of novel driver mutations and advances in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis, little is known about the relationship between genetic abnormalities and chemoresistance in AML. In this study, we subjected 39 samples from patients with primary refractory AML to whole-exome and targeted sequencing analyses to identify somatic mutations contributing to chemoresistance in AML. First, we identified 49 genes that might contribute to chemotherapy resistance through the whole-exome sequencing of samples from 6 patients with primary refractory AML. We then identified a significantly higher frequency of mutations in the gene encoding BCL-6 co-repressor (BCOR) in patients with primary refractory AML through the targeted sequencing of all coding sequence of 49 genes. Notably, the presence of BCOR mutations appeared to have a negative impact on prognosis in our cohort and previous larger studies. Subsequently, to investigate the biological effect of BCOR mutations on sensitivity to anticancer drugs, we established BCOR knockout human leukemic cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Here, BCOR knockout cell lines exhibited statistically significant reductions in sensitivity to anticancer drugs, compared with the wild-type controls both in vitro and in vivo in xenograft mouse models. In conclusion, loss-of-function BCOR mutations appear to contribute to chemotherapy resistance and may be a promising therapeutic target in primary refractory AML.","['Honda, Akira', 'Koya, Junji', 'Yoshimi, Akihide', 'Miyauchi, Masashi', 'Taoka, Kazuki', 'Kataoka, Keisuke', 'Arai, Shunya', 'Kurokawa, Mineo']","['Honda A', 'Koya J', 'Yoshimi A', 'Miyauchi M', 'Taoka K', 'Kataoka K', 'Arai S', 'Kurokawa M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Cell Therapy and Transplantation Medicine, University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.

Glaucoma filtration surgery (GFS) is an important method to reduce IOP by guidance of aqueous humor into a newly built filtration bleb in the conjunctiva; management of the wound healing mechanism is essential for the success of GFS. Here, we investigated the roles of interleukin (IL)-6 family members during the wound healing process after GFS. At the surgical site, the expression levels of genes encoding IL-6, oncostatin M (OSM), their receptors, and collagen I were elevated at 3 h after GFS, whereas the levels of genes encoding transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA), type IV collagen, and fibronectin were elevated at 3 days after GFS. IL-6 trans-signaling and OSM signaling suppressed TGF-beta-induced expression of alpha-SMA and collagen IV, as well as activation of the non-canonical TGF-beta pathway, suggesting that IL-6 and OSM may aid in controlling the phase transition from inflammation to proliferation and remodeling. The suppressive effects of OSM were accompanied by STAT3 activation, such that STAT1 function was complementary to STAT3. Taken together, these observations indicated that IL-6 family members constitute early response genes after GFS, which can suppress TGF-beta-induced expression of late response genes at the surgical site after GFS.","['Watanabe-Kitamura, Fumika', 'Ogawa, Akiko', 'Fujimoto, Tomokazu', 'Iraha, Satoshi', 'Inoue-Mochita, Miyuki', 'Watanabe, Takahiro', 'Takahashi, Eri', 'Tanihara, Hidenobu', 'Inoue, Toshihiro']","['Watanabe-Kitamura F', 'Ogawa A', 'Fujimoto T', 'Iraha S', 'Inoue-Mochita M', 'Watanabe T', 'Takahashi E', 'Tanihara H', 'Inoue T']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, 860-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, 860-8556, Japan; Department of Modomics Biology & Medicine, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer (IDAC), Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, 860-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, 860-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, 860-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, 860-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, 860-8556, Japan.', 'Director of Hospital, Kumamoto University Hospital, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, 860-8556, Japan.

Besides radiotherapy and surgery, chemotherapy also plays an essential role in the treatment of liver cancer. Sorafenib and sorafenib-based combination therapies have been proven efficacy against tumors. However, previous clinical studies have indicated that some patients with liver cancer are resistant to sorafenib treatment and the existing strategies are not satisfactory in the clinic. Therefore, it is urgent to investigate strategies to improve the effectiveness of sorafenib for liver cancer and to explore effective drug combinations. In the present study, we found that dichloroacetate (DCA) could significantly enhance the anti-tumor effect of sorafenib on liver cancer cells, including reduced viability and dramatically promoted apoptosis in liver cancer cells. Moreover, compared to sorafenib alone, the combination of DCA and sorafenib markedly increased the degradation of anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 by enhancing its phosphorylation. Overexpression of Mcl-1 could significantly attenuate the synergetic effect of DCA and sorafenib on apoptosis induction in liver cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that the ROS-JNK pathway was obviously activated in the DCA combined sorafenib group. The levels of ROS and p-JNK were dramatically up-regulated in the two drug combination groups. Antioxidant NAC could alleviate the synergetic effects of DCA and sorafenib on ROS generation, JNK activation, Mcl-1 degradation, and cell apoptosis. Moreover, DCA and sorafenib's effects on Mcl-1 degradation and apoptosis could also be inhibited by JNK inhibitor 'SP'600125. Finally, the synergetic effects of DCA and sorafenib on tumor growth suppression, Mcl-1 degradation and induction of apoptosis were also validated in liver cancer xenograft in vivo. These findings indicate that DCA enhances the anti-tumor effect of sorafenib via the ROS-JNK-Mcl-1 pathway in liver cancer cells. This study may provide new insights to improve the chemotherapeutic effect of sorafenib, which may be bene fi cial for further clinical application of sorafenib in liver cancer treatment.","['Sun, Liangbo', 'Jiang, Yangzhou', 'Yan, Xiaojing', 'Dai, Xufang', 'Huang, Chen', 'Chen, Lingxi', 'Li, Tao', 'Zhang, Yueting', 'Xiao, Hanxi', 'Yang, Mingzhen', 'Xiang, Li', 'Zhang, Yang', 'Chen, Sha', 'Li, Shuhui', 'Chen, An', 'He, Fengtian', 'Lian, Jiqin']","['Sun L', 'Jiang Y', 'Yan X', 'Dai X', 'Huang C', 'Chen L', 'Li T', 'Zhang Y', 'Xiao H', 'Yang M', 'Xiang L', 'Zhang Y', 'Chen S', 'Li S', 'Chen A', 'He F', 'Lian J']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, 400038, China; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, 400038, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, 400038, China; Battalion One of Basic Medical Sciences, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, 400038, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, 400038, China.', 'Department of Educational College, Chongqing Normal University, Chongqing, 400038, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, 400038, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, 400038, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, 400038, China.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, 400038, China.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, 400038, China.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, 400038, China.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, 400038, China.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, 400038, China.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, 400038, China.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, 400038, China.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, 400038, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, 400038, China.

The genetic background and morphology of RS in CLL patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy is extensively characterised; however, our knowledge about RS in patients treated with targeted oral therapies should be extended. To understand the morphologic and molecular changes leading to RS in CLL patients treated with the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ibrutinib, and the BCL2 inhibitor, venetoclax, sequential samples from six CLL/SLL patients undergoing RS were collected in both the CLL and RS phases. A detailed immunophenotypic analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens of RS phase was performed, followed by extensive molecular characterisation of CLL and RS samples, including the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH) rearrangement, TP53 mutations, drug-induced resistance mutations in BTK and BCL2 genes and various copy number changes and point mutations detectable with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Rare, non-diffuse large B-cell lymphoma phenotypes of RS were observed in 3/6 cases, including plasmablastic lymphoma and a transitory entity between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The majority of cases were clonally related and harboured an unmutated variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. Abnormalities affecting the TP53 gene occurred in all patients, and every patient carried at least one genetic abnormality conferring susceptibility to RS. In the background of RS, 2/5 patients treated with ibrutinib showed a BTK C481S resistance mutation. One patient developed a BCL2 G101V mutation leading to venetoclax resistance and RS. In conclusion, our findings contribute to better understanding of RS pathogenesis in the era of targeted oral therapies. Rare phenotypic variants of RS do occur under the treatment of ibrutinib or venetoclax, and genetic factors leading to RS are similar to those identified in patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy. To our best knowledge, we have reported the first BCL2 G101V mutation in an RS patient treated with venetoclax.","['Gango, Ambrus', 'Kiss, Richard', 'Farkas, Peter', 'Hanna, Eid', 'Demeter, Judit', 'Deak, Beata', 'Levai, Dora', 'Kotmayer, Lili', 'Alpar, Donat', 'Matolcsy, Andras', 'Bodor, Csaba', 'Matrai, Zoltan', 'Timar, Botond']","['Gango A', 'Kiss R', 'Farkas P', 'Hanna E', 'Demeter J', 'Deak B', 'Levai D', 'Kotmayer L', 'Alpar D', 'Matolcsy A', 'Bodor C', 'Matrai Z', 'Timar B']","['HCEMM-SE Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, Budapest, Hungary; 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'HCEMM-SE Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, Budapest, Hungary; 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Haematology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Oncology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Oncology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'National Institute of Oncology, Budapest, Hungary.', 'National Institute of Oncology, Budapest, Hungary.', 'HCEMM-SE Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, Budapest, Hungary; 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'HCEMM-SE Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, Budapest, Hungary; 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'HCEMM-SE Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, Budapest, Hungary; 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'HCEMM-SE Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, Budapest, Hungary; 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Central Hospital of Southern Pest, National Institute for Haematology and Infectology, Budapest, Hungary.', 'HCEMM-SE Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, Budapest, Hungary; 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.

Here, we evaluated the mechanisms underlying acquired resistance to PDX and explored potential therapeutic strategies to overcome PDX resistance. METHODS: To investigate PDX resistance, we established two PDX-resistant T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines (CEM and MOLT4) through continuous exposure to increasing doses of PDX. The resistance mechanisms were evaluated by measuring PDX uptake, apoptosis induction and folate metabolism-related protein expression. We also applied gene expression analysis and methylation profiling to identify the mechanisms of resistance. We then explored rational drug combinations using a spheroid (3D)-culture assay. RESULTS: Compared with their parental cells, PDX-resistant cells exhibited a 30-fold increase in half-maximal inhibitory concentration values. Induction of apoptosis by PDX was significantly decreased in both PDX-resistant cell lines. Intracellular uptake of [(14)C]-PDX decreased in PDX-resistant CEM cells but not in PDX-resistant MOLT4 cells. There was no significant change in expression of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) or folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS). Gene expression array analysis revealed that DNA-methyltransferase 3beta (DNMT3B) expression was significantly elevated in both cell lines. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that adipogenesis and mTORC1 signaling pathways were commonly upregulated in both resistant cell lines. Moreover, CpG island hypermethylation was observed in both PDX resistant cells lines. In the 3D-culture assay, decitabine (DAC) plus PDX showed synergistic effects in PDX-resistant cell lines compared with parental lines. CONCLUSIONS: The resistance mechanisms of PDX were associated with reduced cellular uptake of PDX and/or overexpression of DNMT3B. Epigenetic alterations were also considered to play a role in the resistance mechanism. The combination of DAC and PDX exhibited synergistic activity, and thus, this approach might improve the clinical efficacy of PDX.","['Oiwa, Kana', 'Hosono, Naoko', 'Nishi, Rie', 'Scotto, Luigi', ""O'Connor, Owen A"", 'Yamauchi, Takahiro']","['Oiwa K', 'Hosono N', 'Nishi R', 'Scotto L', ""O'Connor OA"", 'Yamauchi T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, 23-3 Matsuokashimoaizuki, Eiheiji-cho, Yoshida-gun, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, 23-3 Matsuokashimoaizuki, Eiheiji-cho, Yoshida-gun, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan. hosono@u-fukui.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, 23-3 Matsuokashimoaizuki, Eiheiji-cho, Yoshida-gun, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan.', 'The Center of Lymphoid Malignancy, Columbia University Medical Center, College of Physicians and Surgeons, 630 West 168th St, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', 'The Center of Lymphoid Malignancy, Columbia University Medical Center, College of Physicians and Surgeons, 630 West 168th St, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Virginia, 1215 Lee Street, Charlottesville, VA, 22903, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, 23-3 Matsuokashimoaizuki, Eiheiji-cho, Yoshida-gun, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6336-3250'],['eng'],"['18K07294/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', '16K09844/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science']",['Journal Article'],20210731,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)']",IM,"['Aminopterin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Biomarkers', '*Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC8325835,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA-methyltransferase 3beta', 'Decitabine', 'Pralatrexate', 'Resistance']",2021/08/02 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2021/08/01 20:26'],"['2020/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/01 20:26 [entrez]', '2021/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-021-08607-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-021-08607-9 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2021 Jul 31;21(1):879. doi: 10.1186/s12885-021-08607-9.,879,['(c) 2021.

Despite this, many of these cytokines have unique roles that regulate the activity of bone forming osteoblasts, bone resorbing osteoclasts, bone-resident osteocytes, and cartilage cells (chondrocytes).

However, identifying molecular-based biomarkers for risk stratification of patients with MPNs remains a challenge. We have previously shown that interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF8) and IRF4 serve as tumor suppressors in myeloid cells. In this study, we evaluated the expression of IRF4 and IRF8 and the JAK2V617F mutant allele burden in patients with MPNs. Patients with decreased IRF4 expression were correlated with a more developed MPN phenotype in myelofibrosis (MF) and secondary AML (sAML) transformed from MPNs versus essential thrombocythemia (ET). Negative correlations between the JAK2V617F allele burden and the expression of IRF8 (P < 0.05) and IRF4 (P < 0.001) and between white blood cell (WBC) count and IRF4 expression (P < 0.05) were found in ET patients. IRF8 expression was negatively correlated with the JAK2V617F allele burden (P < 0.05) in polycythemia vera patients. Complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and no response (NR) were observed in 67.5%,10%, and 22.5% of ET patients treated with hydroxyurea (HU), respectively, in 12 months. At 3 months, patients in the CR group showed high IRF4 and IRF8 expression compared with patients in the PR and NR groups. In the 12-month therapy period, low IRF4 and IRF8 expression were independently associated with the unfavorable response to HU and high WBC count. Our data indicate that the expression of IRF4 and IRF8 was associated with the MPN phenotype, which may serve as biomarkers for the response to HU in ET.","['Huang, Xiao', 'Ma, Tingting', 'Zhu, Yongmei', 'Jiao, Bo', 'Yu, Shanhe', 'Wang, Kankan', 'Mi, Jian-Qing', 'Ren, Ruibao']","['Huang X', 'Ma T', 'Zhu Y', 'Jiao B', 'Yu S', 'Wang K', 'Mi JQ', 'Ren R']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, National Research Center for translational Medicine (Shanghai), Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, National Research Center for translational Medicine (Shanghai), Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, National Research Center for translational Medicine (Shanghai), Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, National Research Center for translational Medicine (Shanghai), Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, National Research Center for translational Medicine (Shanghai), Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, National Research Center for translational Medicine (Shanghai), Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China. kankanwang@hotmail.com.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, National Research Center for translational Medicine (Shanghai), Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China. jianqingmi@shsmu.edu.cn.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, National Research Center for translational Medicine (Shanghai), Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China. rbren@sjtu.edu.cn.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210731,China,Front Med,Frontiers of medicine,101549428,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['IRF4', 'IRF8', 'essential thrombocythemia', 'hydroxyurea', 'myeloproliferative neoplasms']",2021/08/01 06:00,2021/08/01 06:00,['2021/07/31 12:09'],"['2020/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/31 12:09 [entrez]', '2021/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11684-021-0858-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s11684-021-0858-1 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Front Med. 2021 Jul 31. pii: 10.1007/s11684-021-0858-1. doi: 10.1007/s11684-021-0858-1.,,['(c) 2021.

Recent studies on the potential long-term neurocognitive effects of cumulative propofol exposure have raised concerns about this practice. The recent pandemic introduced additional burdens to patients, with the requirement of a negative COVID-19 test prior to each sedated procedure. PROCEDURE: These factors prompted a quality improvement intervention at our institution where we aimed to reduce postinduction sedated LPs by 50%. Our intervention included patient and family education, followed by a simulation of the procedure for selected patients. Those converted to unsedated LPs were queried for their preference. Comparative cost, clinical time, and LP success rates were collected for sedated and unsedated LPs. RESULTS: Following the intervention, the percentage of LPs performed with sedation dropped from 100% to 48%. All LPs were successful using both techniques. Most patients who experienced the unsedated LP technique, and their guardians, strongly preferred this approach. Unsedated LPs significantly reduced clinical time (169 vs. 83 minutes) for families, decreased expenditures ($5736 reduction per procedure), and improved institutional opportunity cost due to a decrease in last-minute cancelations. CONCLUSION: We have shown that it is feasible to significantly reduce the use of sedation for LPs in patients with ALL, which has the potential to improve health and patient experience at a lower cost.","['Waters, Torin W', 'Dickens, David S']","['Waters TW', 'Dickens DS']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4419-9379', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8821-6022']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210731,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Hypnotics and Sedatives)', 'YI7VU623SF (Propofol)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'COVID-19/diagnosis', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypnotics and Sedatives/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Male', '*Pain Management/adverse effects/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Propofol/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'SARS-CoV-2/isolation & purification', '*Spinal Puncture/methods', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*lumbar puncture', '*pediatric ALL', '*sedation']",2021/08/01 06:00,2021/10/06 06:00,['2021/07/31 09:24'],"['2021/07/19 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/06 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/31 09:24 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.29272 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Nov;68(11):e29272. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29272.

MDS softgel capsule samples were subjected to stress testing per International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guidelines for impurity profiling study. MDS underwent extensive degradation under stress testing (acid, alkaline, oxidative, photolytic, thermolytic, and hydrolysis conditions) and formed four degradation products (DPs). MDS and its DPs were separated well from one another with good resolution using reserved-phase HPLC using an Inertsil ODS-3V column (250 x 4.6 mm, 5 mum) and a mobile phase of ammonium formate (40 mM) and acetonitrile. The stability-indicating characteristic of the newly developed method was proven for the estimation of MDS assay, and its organic impurities were free from interference. The validated method exhibited excellent linearity, accuracy, precision, specificity, detection limit, and quantitation limit within 25 min run time. Stress testing, robustness, and solution stability were performed to ensure the continuous performance of the developed method. The peak fractions of DPs formed under stress testing were isolated and characterized using LC-MS, (1) H and (13) C NMR, IR, and UV-Vis. The structure of the major DPs was predicted as DP1 based on the spectral data. The proposed method is effectively used for MDS in bulk drug and finished formulations in the pharmaceutical industry.","['Lakka, Narasimha Swamy', 'Kuppan, Chandrasekar', 'Ravinathan, Poornima']","['Lakka NS', 'Kuppan C', 'Ravinathan P']","[""Division of Chemistry, Department of Science and Humanities, VIGNAN'S Foundation for Science, Technology and Research (VFSTR), Vadlamudi, Guntur, India."", ""Division of Chemistry, Department of Science and Humanities, VIGNAN'S Foundation for Science, Technology and Research (VFSTR), Vadlamudi, Guntur, India."", 'Department of Science and Humanities, JMJ College for Women, Tenali, India.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2952-7493', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3780-6222']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210908,England,Biomed Chromatogr,Biomedical chromatography : BMC,8610241,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['LC-MS/MS', 'degradation product', 'impurity profiling', 'method development and validation', 'midostaurin', 'reversed phase-HPLC', 'stress testing']",2021/08/01 06:00,2021/08/01 06:00,['2021/07/31 09:20'],"['2021/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/01 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/31 09:20 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bmc.5222 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Chromatogr. 2021 Dec;35(12):e5222. doi: 10.1002/bmc.5222.

The present study aimed to assess the association of statin use with mortality in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). We identified all incident NHLs and CLLs in Sweden from 2007 to 2013 with subtype information in the Swedish Lymphoma and Cancer Registers. Using Cox regression, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of pre- or post-diagnosis statin use (yes/no, intensity) with lymphoma-specific, cardiovascular, or all-cause mortality; and for follicular lymphoma (FL) by initial treatment strategy (active/watch-and-wait). Among 16 098 incident NHL/CLL patients, 20% used statins at diagnosis. Pre- and post-diagnosis statin use, and statin intensity were not consistently associated with any mortality outcome in patients with NHL, overall or for any subtype. For actively treated patients with FL, statin use did not appear to increase lymphoma-specific mortality (vs. non-users, HR [95% CI]after diagnosis 0.87 [0.45-1.67]). For CLL, statin use was associated with all-cause and cardiovascular but not consistently with lymphoma-specific mortality. In conclusion, statin use was not associated with improved lymphoma survival but appears safe to use during lymphoma treatment.","['Branvall, Elsa', 'Ekberg, Sara', 'Eloranta, Sandra', 'Wasterlid, Tove', 'Birmann, Brenda M', 'Smedby, Karin E']","['Branvall E', 'Ekberg S', 'Eloranta S', 'Wasterlid T', 'Birmann BM', 'Smedby KE']","['Division of Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Capio S:t Gorans Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', ""Channing Division of Network Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0543-2665', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7063-467X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5806-0573', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4281-0349', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7550-5498']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210731,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/mortality', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cause of Death', 'Comorbidity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/drug therapy/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries', 'Rituximab/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*lymphoma', '*prognosis', '*statins', '*survival']",2021/08/01 06:00,2021/12/24 06:00,['2021/07/31 09:20'],"['2021/07/06 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/31 09:20 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.17733 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2021 Nov;195(4):552-560. doi: 10.1111/bjh.17733.

Three ET patients developed secondary acute myelogenous leukemia and three developed secondary myelofibrosis. The 5-year cumulative incidence of TE was 14.2% in ET and 21.3% in PV. Thus, the incidence was higher in PV; in particular, arterial TE (ATE) was evidently higher in PV than in ET. The 5-year cumulative incidence of SPMs was 2.5% in ET and 2.6% in PV. While the use of both aspirin and hydroxyurea reduced the incidence of ATE, hydroxyurea significantly increased the incidence of SPMs. The incidence of ET and PV was very low, and ET was more common than PV in children and young adults. The high incidence of TE in young patients suggests the importance of thrombosis prevention. However, hydroxyurea appears to increase the incidence of SPMs; therefore, the risks and benefits should be considered.","['Choi, Hyoung Soo', 'Hong, Junshik', 'Hwang, Sang Mee', 'Lee, Ju Hyun', 'Ma, Youngeun', 'Kim, Sang-A', 'Lee, Ji Yun', 'Lee, Jeong-Ok', 'Bang, Soo-Mee']","['Choi HS', 'Hong J', 'Hwang SM', 'Lee JH', 'Ma Y', 'Kim SA', 'Lee JY', 'Lee JO', 'Bang SM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, 82 Gumi-ro, 173 Beon-gil, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, 13620, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, 82 Gumi-ro, 173 Beon-gil, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, 13620, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, 82 Gumi-ro, 173 Beon-gil, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, 13620, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, 82 Gumi-ro, 173 Beon-gil, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, 13620, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, 82 Gumi-ro, 173 Beon-gil, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, 13620, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea. smbang7@snu.ac.kr.']",,['eng'],['SNUBH 13-2018-018/Seoul National University Bundang Hospital'],['Journal Article'],20210730,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fibrinolytic Agents)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Aspirin/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Fibrinolytic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Polycythemia Vera/complications/*drug therapy', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/etiology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/complications/*drug therapy', 'Thromboembolism/drug therapy/etiology', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Child', 'Essential thrombocythemia', 'Polycythemia vera', 'Second primary malignancy', 'Thromboembolism']",2021/08/01 06:00,2021/09/25 06:00,['2021/07/31 08:07'],"['2021/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/31 08:07 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-021-04527-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-021-04527-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2021 Oct;100(10):2567-2574. doi: 10.1007/s00277-021-04527-7.

Targeting MYC in cancer has been extremely challenging. Recently, we have demonstrated that the heart failure drug, proscillaridin A, produced anticancer effects with specificity toward MYC expressing leukemia cells. We also reported that decitabine, a hypomethylating drug, synergizes with proscillaridin A in colon cancer cells. Here, we investigated whether proscillaridin A exhibits epigenetic and anticancer activity against eRMS RD cells, overexpressing MYC oncogene, and its combination with decitabine. METHODS: We investigated the anticancer effects of proscillaridin A in eRMS RD cells in vitro. In response to drug treatment, we measured growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, loss of clonogenicity and self-renewal capacity. We further evaluated the impact of proscillaridin A on MYC expression and its downstream transcriptomic effects by RNA sequencing. Then, we measured protein expression of epigenetic regulators and their associated chromatin post-translational modifications in response to drug treatment. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data sets were coupled with transcriptomic results to pinpoint the impact of proscillaridin A on gene pathways associated with specific chromatin modifications. Lastly, we evaluated the effect of the combination of proscillaridin A and the DNA demethylating drug decitabine on eRMS RD cell growth and clonogenic potential. RESULTS: Clinically relevant concentration of proscillaridin A (5 nM) produced growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and loss of clonogenicity in eRMS RD cells. Proscillaridin A produced a significant downregulation of MYC protein expression and inhibition of oncogenic transcriptional programs controlled by MYC, involved in cell replication. Interestingly, significant reduction in total histone 3 acetylation and on specific lysine residues (lysine 9, 14, 18, and 27 on histone 3) was associated with significant protein downregulation of a series of lysine acetyltransferases (KAT3A, KAT3B, KAT2A, KAT2B, and KAT5). In addition, proscillaridin A produced synergistic growth inhibition and loss of clonogenicity when combined with the approved DNA demethylating drug decitabine. CONCLUSION: Proscillaridin A produces anticancer and epigenetic effects in the low nanomolar range and its combination with decitabine warrants further investigation for the treatment of eRMS.","['Huot, Marielle', 'Caron, Maxime', 'Richer, Chantal', 'Djibo, Rahinatou', 'Najmanovich, Rafael', 'St-Onge, Pascal', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Raynal, Noel J M']","['Huot M', 'Caron M', 'Richer C', 'Djibo R', 'Najmanovich R', 'St-Onge P', 'Sinnett D', 'Raynal NJM']","['Departement de Pharmacologie et Physiologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Center, 3175, Chemin de la Cote-Sainte-Catherine, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Center, 3175, Chemin de la Cote-Sainte-Catherine, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Center, 3175, Chemin de la Cote-Sainte-Catherine, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Departement de Pharmacologie et Physiologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Center, 3175, Chemin de la Cote-Sainte-Catherine, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Departement de Pharmacologie et Physiologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Center, 3175, Chemin de la Cote-Sainte-Catherine, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Center, 3175, Chemin de la Cote-Sainte-Catherine, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Departement de Pediatrie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Departement de Pharmacologie et Physiologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada. noel.raynal@umontreal.ca.', 'Sainte-Justine University Hospital Research Center, 3175, Chemin de la Cote-Sainte-Catherine, Montreal, QC, H3T 1C5, Canada. noel.raynal@umontreal.ca.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4241-6800'],['eng'],['Upcycle/Cancer Research Society'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210731,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (TSTD1 protein, human)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'KC6BL281EN (Proscillaridin)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Self Renewal/drug effects', 'Decitabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Repositioning', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Proscillaridin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma, Embryonal/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cardiac glycoside', '*Decitabine', '*Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma', '*Histone acetylation', '*MYC', '*Proscillaridin A']",2021/08/01 06:00,2022/01/04 06:00,['2021/07/31 08:06'],"['2021/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/31 08:06 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-021-04339-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-021-04339-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2021 Nov;88(5):845-856. doi: 10.1007/s00280-021-04339-6.

However, outcome is dismal and of short follow-up. The objective of the study was to determine long-term outcome and risk factors in patients with a history of CML Blast Crisis (BC; n = 96) or accelerated phase (n = 51) transplanted between 1990 and 2018. At transplant, patients had a median age of 39 (range 7-76) years and were in >/=CP2 (n = 70), in AP (n = 40) or in BC (n = 37) with a diagnosis-HSCT interval of median 1.9 (range 0.3-24.4) years. Overall survival (OS) amounted 34% (95% CI 22-46) and progression-free survival (PFS) 26% (95% CI 16-36) at 15 years. Adverse risk factors for OS and PFS were low CD34(+) count in the graft, donor age (>36 years) and BC. Cumulative incidence of Non-Relapse Mortality (NRM) was 28% (95% CI 18-38) and of relapse (RI) 43% (95% CI 33-53) at 15 years. PB-HSCT and HSCT after 2008 were favorable prognostic factors for NRM, while family donor and patient age >39 years were independently associated with higher RI. HSCT resulted in long-term OS in patients with advanced CML. OS was improved in non-BC patients, with donors </=36 years and with higher CD34(+) dose in the graft.","['Niederwieser, Christian', 'Morozova, Elena', 'Zubarovskaya, Ludmila', 'Zabelina, Tatjana', 'Klyuchnikov, Evgeny', 'Janson, Dietlinde', 'Wolschke, Christine', 'Christopeit, Maximilian', 'Ayuk, Francis', 'Moiseev, Ivan', 'Afanasyev, Boris V', 'Kroger, Nicolaus']","['Niederwieser C', 'Morozova E', 'Zubarovskaya L', 'Zabelina T', 'Klyuchnikov E', 'Janson D', 'Wolschke C', 'Christopeit M', 'Ayuk F', 'Moiseev I', 'Afanasyev BV', 'Kroger N']","['University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Hamburg, Germany.

Nevertheless, little is known about the impact of WBC at diagnosis considering the minimal residual disease (MRD) status at allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). We evaluated adult patients with Ph(+) ALL who achieved negative-MRD and received HCT in first complete remission between 2006 and 2018. The entire cohort was temporally divided into derivation (n = 258) and validation cohorts (n = 366). Using a threshold of 15,000/muL, which was determined by a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis in the derivation cohort, high WBC was associated with an increased risk of hematological relapse in both the derivation cohort (25.3% vs. 11.6% at 7 years, P = 0.004) and the validation cohort (16.2% vs. 8.5% at 3 years, P = 0.025). In multivariate analyses, high WBC was a strong predictor of hematological relapse in the derivation cohort (HR, 2.52, 95%CI 1.32-4.80, P = 0.005) and in the validation cohort (HR, 2.32, 95%CI, 1.18-4.55; P = 0.015). In conclusion, WBC at diagnosis with a new threshold of 15,000/muL should contribute to better risk stratification in patients with negative-MRD at HCT.","['Akahoshi, Yu', 'Arai, Yasuyuki', 'Nishiwaki, Satoshi', 'Tachibana, Takayoshi', 'Shinohara, Akihito', 'Doki, Noriko', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Tanaka, Masatsugu', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Shiratori, Souichi', 'Ozawa, Yukiyasu', 'Shono, Katsuhiro', 'Katayama, Yuta', 'Tanaka, Junji', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Kako, Shinichi']","['Akahoshi Y', 'Arai Y', 'Nishiwaki S', 'Tachibana T', 'Shinohara A', 'Doki N', 'Uchida N', 'Tanaka M', 'Kanda Y', 'Shiratori S', 'Ozawa Y', 'Shono K', 'Katayama Y', 'Tanaka J', 'Fukuda T', 'Atsuta Y', 'Kako S']","['Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan. akahoshiu@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Medicine, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Federation of National Public Service Personnel Mutual Aid Associations Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Faculty of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Chiba Aoba Municipal Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital and Atomic Bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Administration, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6825-9340', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9662-5093', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6430-8958', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7780-4459', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5530-6133', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5952-5926', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4866-9307', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5528-7112', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5163-0163', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5054-9104', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4404-2870', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2635-3395']",['eng'],['JP20J10298/MEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)'],['Journal Article'],20210730,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,,,,,2021/08/01 06:00,2021/08/01 06:00,['2021/07/31 07:30'],"['2021/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/01 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/31 07:30 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-021-01422-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-021-01422-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2021 Nov;56(11):2842-2848. doi: 10.1038/s41409-021-01422-7.

In this review, we describe the wide-ranging role of AML1/ETO in AML leukemogenesis, with a particular focus on the aberrant epigenetic regulation of gene transcription driven by this AML-defining mutation. We begin by analyzing how structural changes secondary to distinct genomic breakpoints and splice changes, as well as posttranscriptional modifications, influence AML1/ETO protein function. Next, we characterize how AML1/ETO recruits chromatin-modifying enzymes to target genes and how the oncofusion protein alters chromatin marks, transcription factor binding, and gene expression. We explore the specific impact of these global changes in the epigenetic network facilitated by the AML1/ETO oncofusion on cellular processes and leukemic growth. Furthermore, we define the genetic landscape of AML1/ETO-positive AML, presenting the current literature concerning the incidence of cooperating mutations in genes such as KIT, FLT3, and NRAS. Finally, we outline how alterations in transcriptional regulation patterns create potential vulnerabilities that may be exploited by epigenetically active agents and other therapeutics.","['Rejeski, Kai', 'Duque-Afonso, Jesus', 'Lubbert, Michael']","['Rejeski K', 'Duque-Afonso J', 'Lubbert M']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of the LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) Freiburg Partner Site, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany. michael.luebbert@uniklinik-freiburg.de.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) Freiburg Partner Site, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. michael.luebbert@uniklinik-freiburg.de.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. michael.luebbert@uniklinik-freiburg.de.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3905-0251', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8287-5673']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210730,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",PMC8460439,,,2021/08/01 06:00,2021/12/31 06:00,['2021/07/31 07:25'],"['2021/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/06/11 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/31 07:25 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-021-01952-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-021-01952-w [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2021 Sep;40(38):5665-5676. doi: 10.1038/s41388-021-01952-w.

Because addition of the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax resulted in compensatory upregulation of MCL1, we established a three-drug combination composed of sirolimus, venetoclax, and the MCL1 inhibitor S63845. This well-tolerated drug combination potently and synergistically induces apoptosis in both zebrafish and human NF1/PTEN-deficient melanoma cells, providing preclinical evidence justifying an early-stage clinical trial in patients with NF1/PTEN-deficient melanoma.","['He, Shuning', 'Zimmerman, Mark W', 'Layden, Hillary M', 'Berezovskaya, Alla', 'Etchin, Julia', 'Martel, Megan W', 'Thurston, Grace', 'Jing, Chang-Bin', 'van Rooijen, Ellen', 'Kaufman, Charles K', 'Rodig, Scott J', 'Zon, Leonard I', 'Patton, E Elizabeth', 'Mansour, Marc R', 'Look, A Thomas']","['He S', 'Zimmerman MW', 'Layden HM', 'Berezovskaya A', 'Etchin J', 'Martel MW', 'Thurston G', 'Jing CB', 'van Rooijen E', 'Kaufman CK', 'Rodig SJ', 'Zon LI', 'Patton EE', 'Mansour MR', 'Look AT']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. shuning_he@dfci.harvard.edu.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Stem Cell Program and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Stem Cell Program and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Stem Cell Program and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, MA, USA."", 'MRC Human Genetics Unit, MRC Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. m.mansour@ucl.ac.uk.', 'Department of Hematology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK. m.mansour@ucl.ac.uk.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.

Covid-19 vaccines offer the potential for protection against severe infection but relatively little is known regarding the profile of the antibody response following first or second vaccination. We studied spike-specific antibody responses following first and/or second Covid-19 vaccination in 299 patients with CLL compared with healthy donors. 286 patients underwent extended interval (10-12 week) vaccination. 154 patients received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and 145 patients received ChAdOx1. Blood samples were taken either by venepuncture or as dried blood spots on filter paper. Spike-specific antibody responses were detectable in 34% of patients with CLL after one vaccine (n = 267) compared to 94% in healthy donors with antibody titres 104-fold lower in the patient group. Antibody responses increased to 75% after second vaccine (n = 55), compared to 100% in healthy donors, although titres remained lower. Multivariate analysis showed that current treatment with BTK inhibitors or IgA deficiency were independently associated with failure to generate an antibody response after the second vaccine. This work supports the need for optimisation of vaccination strategy in patients with CLL including the potential utility of booster vaccines.","['Parry, H', 'McIlroy, G', 'Bruton, R', 'Ali, M', 'Stephens, C', 'Damery, S', 'Otter, A', 'McSkeane, T', 'Rolfe, H', 'Faustini, S', 'Wall, N', 'Hillmen, P', 'Pratt, G', 'Paneesha, S', 'Zuo, J', 'Richter, A', 'Moss, P']","['Parry H', 'McIlroy G', 'Bruton R', 'Ali M', 'Stephens C', 'Damery S', 'Otter A', 'McSkeane T', 'Rolfe H', 'Faustini S', 'Wall N', 'Hillmen P', 'Pratt G', 'Paneesha S', 'Zuo J', 'Richter A', 'Moss P']","['Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'National infection Service, Public Health England, Porton Down, Salisbury, SP4 OJG, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham, B15 2TT, Birmingham, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham, B15 2TT, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', ""St. James's University Hospital, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds, LS9 7TF, UK."", 'Queen Elizabeth Hospital, University Hospitals Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TH, UK.', 'Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, University Hospitals Birmingham, Bordesley Green East, B9 5SS, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.

Friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor (FLI1) is a bona fide marker of endothelial cells during early development. In zebrafish Tg( f li1:EGFP) (y1) , we identified two endothelial cell populations, high-fli1 (+) and low-fli1 (+), by the intensity of green fluorescent protein signal. By comparing RNA-sequencing analysis of non-fli1 expressing cells (fli1 (-)) with these two (fli1 (+)) cell populations, we identified several up-regulated genes, not previously recognized as important, during endothelial development. Compared with fli1 (-) and low-fli1 (+) cells, high-fli1 (+) cells showed up-regulated expression of the zinc finger transcription factor PRDI-BF1 and RIZ homology domain containing 16 (prdm16). Prdm16 knockdown (KD) by morpholino in the zebrafish larva was associated with impaired angiogenesis and increased number of low-fli1 (+) cells at the expense of high-fli1 (+) cells. In addition, PRDM16 KD in endothelial cells derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells impaired their differentiation and migration in vitro. Moreover, zebrafish mutants (mut) with loss of function for the oncogene LIM domain only 2 (lmo2) also showed reduced prdm16 gene expression combined with impaired angiogenesis. Prdm16 expression was reduced further in endothelial (CD31(+)) cells compared with CD31(-) cells isolated from l mo2-mutants (l mo2-mut) embryos. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR demonstrated that Lmo2 binds to the promoter and directly regulates the transcription of prdm16 This work unveils a mechanism by which prdm16 expression is activated in endothelial cells by Lmo2 and highlights a possible therapeutic pathway by which to modulate endothelial cell growth and repair.","['Matrone, Gianfranco', 'Xia, Bo', 'Chen, Kaifu', 'Denvir, Martin A', 'Baker, Andrew H', 'Cooke, John P']","['Matrone G', 'Xia B', 'Chen K', 'Denvir MA', 'Baker AH', 'Cooke JP']","['Center for Cardiovascular Regeneration, Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX 77030; gianfranco.matrone@ed.ac.uk.', ""British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, Queen's Medical Research Institute, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, United Kingdom."", 'Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX 77030.', ""British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, Queen's Medical Research Institute, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, United Kingdom."", ""British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, Queen's Medical Research Institute, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, United Kingdom."", 'Center for Cardiovascular Regeneration, Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX 77030.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7084-3546', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1441-5576', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0033-9138']",['eng'],"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'R01 GM125632/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL133254/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL148338/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RE/13/3/30183/BHF_/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom', 'RE/18/5/34216/BHF_/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom', 'CH/11/2/28733/BHF_/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom', 'RM/17/3/33381/BHF_/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom', 'CH/09/002/BHF_/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom', 'RG/16/10/32375/BHF_/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom', 'RE/18/5/34216/BHF_/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom', 'WT103782AIA/BHF_/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Endothelial Cells/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/*physiology', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/*physiology', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptome', 'Up-Regulation', 'Zebrafish', 'Zebrafish Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC8346798,['NOTNLM'],"['*angiogenesis', '*differentiation', '*endothelial cells', '*epigenetic factors', '*zebrafish']",2021/08/01 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/07/31 06:30'],"['2022/01/30 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/07/31 06:30 [entrez]', '2021/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['2008559118 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.2008559118 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2021 Aug 3;118(31). pii: 2008559118. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2008559118.,,,,['2022/01/30 00:00'],,['The authors declare no competing interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meta-analyses of epidemiological studies reported a strong association between non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and HCV. Direct oncogenic properties of HCV proteins and chronic antigenic stimulation are possible etiologies. We explored if NHL's prevalence has changed since older HCV therapy based on interferon that shared antiviral and anti-lymphoma properties was replaced with interferon-free direct-acting antivirals (DAA). We reviewed data from a nationwide database (Explorys, IBM) that aggregates records from 26 health-care-systems. We identified patients with chronic hepatitis C infection between June 2013 and June 2020. The control group was gender, race, and age-matched HCV-negative population. Statistical analysis used the odds ratio (OR) with P value <.001 for significance. There were 940 cases of NHL of 129,970 patients in the HCV group versus 107,480 cases of NHL of 37,961,970 in the control cohort [OR 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.4-2.7]. A positive association was present for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin T-cell lymphoma, and primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. There were no differences in Mantle cell lymphoma. The increased risk of HCV-associated lymphoma was persistent across genders, Caucasians and African-Americans, and age groups. While the risk of NHL in the HCV-negative population was higher in Caucasians than African-Americans (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.7-1.8), the risk of HCV-associated NHL was not different. Further prospective studies examining the risk of HCV-associated lymphoma following DAA are warranted.","['Alkrekshi, Akram', 'Kassem, Ahmad', 'Park, Changsu', 'Tse, William']","['Alkrekshi A', 'Kassem A', 'Park C', 'Tse W']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, The MetroHealth System campus of Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.

It is generally believed that ALT cells are related to the chromatin modification of telomeres. However, the mechanism of ALT needs to be further explored. RESULTS: Here we found that TRIM28/KAP1 is preferentially located on the telomeres of ALT cells and interacts with telomeric shelterin/telosome complex. Knocking down TRIM28 in ALT cells delayed cell growth, decreased the level of C-circle which is one kind of extrachromosomal circular telomeric DNA, increased the frequency of ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies (APBs), led to telomere prolongation and increased the telomere sister chromatid exchange in ALT cells. Mechanistically, TRIM28 protects telomere histone methyltransferase SETDB1 from degradation, thus maintaining the H3K9me3 heterochromatin state of telomere DNA. CONCLUSIONS: Our work provides a model that TRIM28 inhibits alternative lengthening of telomere phenotypes by protecting SETDB1 from degradation. In general, our results reveal the mechanism of telomere heterochromatin maintenance and its effect on ALT, and TRIM28 may serve as a target for the treatment of ALT tumor cells.","['Wang, Chuanle', 'Songyang, Zhou', 'Huang, Yan']","['Wang C', 'Songyang Z', 'Huang Y']","['MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Healthy Aging Research and SYSU-BCM Joint Research Center, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Healthy Aging Research and SYSU-BCM Joint Research Center, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, China.', 'Verna and Marrs Mclean Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Bioland Laboratory (Guangzhou Regenerative Medicine and Health Guangdong Laboratory), Guangzhou, 510005, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Healthy Aging Research and SYSU-BCM Joint Research Center, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China. huangy336@mail.sysu.edu.cn.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5466-7714'],['eng'],['81871109/National Natural Science Foundation of China'],['Journal Article'],20210730,England,Cell Biosci,Cell & bioscience,101561195,,,,PMC8325274,['NOTNLM'],"['Alternative lengthening of telomere phenotypes', 'Heterochromatin', 'SETDB1', 'TRIM28/KAP1']",2021/08/01 06:00,2021/08/01 06:01,['2021/07/31 06:17'],"['2021/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/31 06:17 [entrez]', '2021/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13578-021-00660-y [doi]', '10.1186/s13578-021-00660-y [pii]']",epublish,Cell Biosci. 2021 Jul 30;11(1):149. doi: 10.1186/s13578-021-00660-y.,149,['(c) 2021.

BAL is also considered as the leukaemic phase of Burkitt lymphoma (BL), in which t (8; 14) (q24; q32) or its variants are related to the myelocytomatosis oncogene (MYC) rearrangement (MYCr) is usually present. However, BAL with lysine methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A, previously called Mixed lineage leukaemia, MLL) gene rearrangement (KMT2Ar, previously called MLLr) is rare. RESULTS: Three BAL patients with KMT2Ar were enrolled between January 2017 and November 2019, accounting for 1.37% of the B-ALL population in our hospital. We also reviewed 24 previously reported cases of BAL and KMT2Ar and analysed the features, treatment, and prognosis. Total 13 males and 14 females were enrolled in our research, and the average age at diagnosis was 19.5 +/- 4.95 months old. In these 27 patients, renal, central nervous system (CNS) and skin involvement were existent in 6, 4 and 3 patients, respectively; 26 patients (26/27) showed non-ALL-L3 morphology, while one patient is ALL-L3; overexpression of CD19 was detected in most cases, negative or suspicious expression of CD20 was found in 64% of patients. KMT2Ar was reported, but MYCr was not observed. 25 patients (25/27) achieved complete remission after chemotherapy or Stem cell transplantation. The patients were sensitive to chemotherapy, prospective event-free survival (pEFS) of BAL patients with KMT2Ar who received allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) was higher than that in patients who received chemotherapy alone (83.33% vs 41.91%). CONCLUSION: BAL patients with KMT2Ar had unique manifestations, including younger age at diagnosis and overexpression of CD19; expression of CD20 was rare, and MYCr was undetectable. The pEFS was higher in patients undergoing allo-HSCT than in patients undergoing chemotherapy alone.","['Cui, Yinghui', 'Zhou, Min', 'Zou, Pinli', 'Liao, Xin', 'Xiao, Jianwen']","['Cui Y', 'Zhou M', 'Zou P', 'Liao X', 'Xiao J']","[""Division of Haematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, No. 136, Zhongshan 2nd Road, Yuzhong District, Chongqing, 400014, People's Republic of China."", ""Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."", ""National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."", ""Chongqing Key Laboratory of Paediatrics, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Chengdu Women's & Children's Central Hospital, Chengdu, People's Republic of China."", ""Division of Haematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, No. 136, Zhongshan 2nd Road, Yuzhong District, Chongqing, 400014, People's Republic of China."", ""National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."", ""Division of Haematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, No. 136, Zhongshan 2nd Road, Yuzhong District, Chongqing, 400014, People's Republic of China."", ""Chongqing Key Laboratory of Paediatrics, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."", ""Division of Haematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, No. 136, Zhongshan 2nd Road, Yuzhong District, Chongqing, 400014, People's Republic of China. tomahawk6502@sohu.com."", ""Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing, People's Republic of China. tomahawk6502@sohu.com."", ""National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, Chongqing, People's Republic of China. tomahawk6502@sohu.com."", ""Chongqing Key Laboratory of Paediatrics, Chongqing, People's Republic of China. tomahawk6502@sohu.com.""]",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8322-9286'],['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210730,England,Orphanet J Rare Dis,Orphanet journal of rare diseases,101266602,"['0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', '*Burkitt Lymphoma', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Nuclear Proteins', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Prospective Studies']",PMC8325316,['NOTNLM'],"['*Children', '*KMT2A rearrangement', '*Mature B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia']",2021/08/01 06:00,2021/08/06 06:00,['2021/07/31 06:15'],"['2021/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/31 06:15 [entrez]', '2021/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13023-021-01972-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s13023-021-01972-5 [pii]']",epublish,Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2021 Jul 30;16(1):331. doi: 10.1186/s13023-021-01972-5.,331,['(c) 2021.

We aimed to evaluate the level of soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin) and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2), and to determine correlation of sP-selectin with leukocyte count and F1 + 2 levels in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed AML (n = 25), CML (n = 13), and controls (n = 17) were recruited in this study. The diagnosis of AML and CML is based on 2001 WHO and/or FAB criteria. Levels of sP-selectin and F1 + 2 were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Behring ELISA Processor-III(R) and Behring Enzygnost F1 + 2). RESULTS: sP-selectin was significantly elevated in CML patients compared to AML patients (p = 0.001). Levels of F1 + 2 in AML and CML patients were significantly increased in comparison to controls (p < 0.001 and p = 0.043). Levels of sP-selectin were significantly correlated to leukocyte count (r = 0.437; p = 0.029) and F1 + 2 (r = 0.436; p = 0.029) in AML patients. CONCLUSIONS: AML and CML patients had an increased tendency to thrombosis. While CML patients had higher platelet and/or endothelial activation, hypercoagulable state are more pronounced in AML patients.","['Sukrisman, Lugyanti']",['Sukrisman L'],"['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia - Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. lugyanti@gmail.com.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4498-7735'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210730,England,Thromb J,Thrombosis journal,101170542,,,,PMC8325311,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CML', 'F1 + 2', 'sP-selectin']",2021/08/01 06:00,2021/08/01 06:01,['2021/07/31 06:10'],"['2021/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/31 06:10 [entrez]', '2021/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12959-021-00307-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12959-021-00307-5 [pii]']",epublish,Thromb J. 2021 Jul 30;19(1):51. doi: 10.1186/s12959-021-00307-5.,51,['(c) 2021.

DATA SOURCES: A literature search from January 2015 to June 2021 was performed using the key terms targeted therapies, myelodysplastic syndromes, DNA repair, erythroid differentiation therapy, epigenetic inhibitors, signal transduction inhibitors, and apoptosis-inducing agents. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Relevant clinical trials and articles in the English language were identified and reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: MDS are a heterogeneous group of malignant blood disorders affecting the bone marrow (BM), ultimately leading to BM failure, acute leukemia, and death. Selection of treatment is influenced by the severity of symptoms, cytopenia, cytogenetics, prognostic category, medical fitness, and patient preferences. Although current therapies such as erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) and hypomethylating agents (HMAs) help improve anemia and reduce transfusion burden, limited treatment options exist when patients experience treatment failure to ESAs or HMA. Recent regulatory approval of luspatercept, which targets the erythroid differentiation pathway, represents a major therapeutic advance in the management of anemia in MDS patients who are refractory to ESAs. Many investigational targeted therapies that aim at the myeloid lineage signaling pathway and the immune microenvironment are in active development. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: This nonexhaustive review summarizes and describes the recent data for targeted therapies for MDS. CONCLUSION: The development of novel and investigational therapeutic agents continues to contribute to an improved understanding of tumor biology. The precise therapeutic role and timing of these agents remain to be elucidated.","['Chung, Clement']",['Chung C'],"['Houston Methodist West Hospital, Houston, TX, USA.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7189-6612'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210730,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['biomarkers', 'epigenetics', 'immunotherapy', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'risk prognostication', 'targeted therapy']",2021/08/01 06:00,2021/08/01 06:00,['2021/07/31 05:57'],"['2021/07/31 05:57 [entrez]', '2021/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/10600280211036154 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Ann Pharmacother. 2021 Jul 30:10600280211036154. doi: 10.1177/10600280211036154.,10600280211036154,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To meet the need for a myeloablative regimen for older patients, we developed a novel fludarabine and busulfan MAC regimen. We fractionated the dose of busulfan and gave it for 6 days over a 2-week period and demonstrated the feasibility and safety of this approach. However, the disease-specific efficacy of this regimen is not known. The purpose of this study was to estimate the efficacy of fractionated busulfan regimen by estimating diseases specific survival outcomes. The conditioning regimen consisted of busulfan and fludarabine. On days -13 and -12 before HCT, patients received 80 mg/m(2) busulfan intravenously (IV) daily in an outpatient clinic. Additional chemotherapy was administered during inpatient treatment from day -6 through day -3, including fludarabine 40 mg/m(2) and busulfan IV once daily. The dosing of busulfan was determined from pharmacokinetic analyses to achieve for the course a target area under the curve of 20,000 +/- 12% mumol/min, which is close to the average exposure of myeloablative dose of busulfan. One hundred fifty patients with high-risk hematological malignancies up to 75 years were enrolled in this prospective phase II study. The objective was to evaluate NRM, relapse, survival, the rates of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and long-term complications. The median age of the patient population was 61 years (interquartile range, 55-67). The most common diagnoses were acute myeloid leukemia (AML; N = 59 [39.3%]), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 29 [19.3%]), and myelofibrosis (MF; N = 22 [14.7%]). Most had an unrelated donor (n = 93 [62%]) and received peripheral blood graft (n = 110 [73.3%]). Over half had an HCT-specific comorbidity index of >/=3 (n = 79 [52.7%]). The median follow-up among survivors was 43.4 months (interquartile range, 38.9-50.4). In patients with AML in complete remission, MDS, and myelofibrosis, 3-year overall survival was 66.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50.2-88.5%), 43.6% (95% CI, 28.6-66.4%), and 59.1% (95% CI, 41.7-83.7%) respectively. The cumulative incidence of NRM was 22% (15.3%-28.7%), extensive chronic GVHD was 27% (95% CI, 20-34%), bronchiolitis obliterans was 4.7% (95% CI, 1.3-8.1%), and secondary malignancy was 8.7% (95% CI, 4.1-13.2%) at 3 years. Lengthening the duration of busulfan (fractionation) permits safe delivery of myeloablative conditioning in older patients, leading to prolonged survival.

However, previous studies remain inconclusive about the benefit of this maintenance therapy and the absence of randomised, controlled trials in patients with low-risk or high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia provides uncertainty. We therefore aimed to determine if this therapy could be safely omitted beyond 1 year of treatment without leading to an inferior outcome in any risk subgroup of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. METHODS: This open-label, multicentre, randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial involved 20 major medical centres across China. We enrolled patients who were aged 0-18 years with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia that was subsequently in continuous remission for 1 year after initial treatment. Patients with secondary malignancy or primary immunodeficiency were excluded. Eligible patients were classified as having low-risk, intermediate-risk, or high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia based on minimal residual disease and immunophenotypic and genetic features of leukaemic cells. Randomisation and analyses were done separately for the low-risk and intermediate-to-high-risk cohorts. Randomisation was generated by the study biostatistician with a block size of six. Stratification factors included participating centre, sex, and age at diagnosis; the low-risk cohort was additionally stratified for ETV6-RUNX1 status, and the intermediate-to-high-risk cohort for cell lineage. Patients in each risk cohort were randomly assigned (1:1) to either receive (ie, the control group) or not receive (ie, the experimental group) seven pulses of intravenous vincristine (1.5 mg/m(2)) plus oral dexamethasone (6 mg/m(2) per day for 7 days) during the second year of treatment. The primary endpoint was difference in 5-year event-free survival between the experimental group and the control group for both the low-risk and intermediate-to-high-risk cohorts, with a non-inferiority margin of 0.05 (5%). The analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR-IPR-14005706. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2015, and Feb 20, 2020, 6141 paediatric patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were registered to this study. Approximately 1 year after diagnosis and treatment, 5054 patients in continuous remission were randomly assigned, including 2923 (1442 in the control group and 1481 in the experimental group) with low-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and 2131 (1071 control, 1060 experimental) with intermediate-to-high risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Median follow-up for patients who were alive at the time of analysis was 3.7 years (IQR 2.8-4.7). Among patients with low-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, no difference was observed in 5-year event-free survival between the control group and the experimental group (90.3% [95% CI 88.4-92.2] vs 90.2% [88.2-92.2]; p=0.90). The one-sided 95% upper confidence bound for the difference in 5-year event-free survival probability was 0.024, establishing non-inferiority. Among patients with intermediate-to-high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, no difference was observed in 5-year event-free survival between the control group and the experimental group (82.8% [95% CI 80.0-85.7] vs 80.8% [77.7-84.0]; p=0.90), but the one-sided 95% upper confidence bound for the difference in 5-year event-free survival probability was 0.055, giving a borderline inferior result for those in the experimental group. In the low-risk cohort, we found no differences in the rates of infections, symptomatic osteonecrosis, or other complications during the second year of maintenance treatment between patients in the control and experimental groups. Patients with intermediate-to-high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in the control group were more likely to develop grade 3-4 pneumonia (26 [2.4%] of 1071 vs ten [0.9%] of 1060) and vincristine-related peripheral neuropathy (17 [1.6%] vs six [0.6%]) compared with the experimental group. Incidence of grade 5 fatal infection was similar between the control group and the experimental group in both the low-risk cohort (two [0.1%] of 1442 vs five [0.3%] of 1481) and intermediate-to-high risk cohort (six [0.6%] of 1071 vs five [0.5%] of 1060). INTERPRETATION: Vincristine plus dexamethasone pulses might be omitted beyond 1 year of treatment for children with low-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Additional studies are needed for intermediate-to-high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

Although researchers in this space often rise to meet these challenges, there is considerable room for improvement in the analysis of retrospective data, the development of risk-stratification tools, and the design of randomised controlled trials. In this Viewpoint, we review the evidence behind the contemporary approach to risk stratification and treatment of polycythaemia vera.

CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell lymphopenia, resulting from HIV infection, chemotherapy, or immunosuppressive therapy, are primary risk factors for PML. Following its introduction in 1997, the immunomodulatory anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab, has received regulatory approval worldwide for treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, and pemphigus vulagris. Rituximab leads to prolonged B-lymphocyte depletion, potentially allowing John Cunningham viral infection to occur. Six unexpected cases of PML infection developing in rituximab-treated patients were first reported in 2002. We review 20 years of information on clinical findings, pathology, epidemiology, proposed pathogenesis, and risk-management issues associated with PML infection developing after rituximab treatment. Since the first case series report of 52 cases of rituximab-associated PML among patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in 2009, updated and diligent pharmacovigilance efforts have provided reassurance that this fatal toxicity is a rare clinical event with concurring causal factors. International harmonisation of safety warnings around rituximab-associated PML should be considered, with these notifications listing rituximab-associated PML under a section titled warnings and precautions as is the case in most countries, rather than a boxed warning as is the case in the USA.","['Bennett, Charles L', 'Focosi, Daniele', 'Socal, Mariana P', 'Bian, Julia C', 'Nabhan, Chadi', 'Hrushesky, William J', 'Bennett, Andrew C', 'Schoen, Martin W', 'Berger, Joseph R', 'Armitage, James O']","['Bennett CL', 'Focosi D', 'Socal MP', 'Bian JC', 'Nabhan C', 'Hrushesky WJ', 'Bennett AC', 'Schoen MW', 'Berger JR', 'Armitage JO']","['Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope and the Department of Comparative Medicine and Evidence Based Medicine, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA; School of Medicine and College of Pharmacy, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA; WJB Dorn VA Medical Center, Columbia, SC, USA.

The aim of this study was to investigate the activity of venetoclax combined with intensive chemotherapy in patients aged 65 years or younger with acute myeloid leukaemia. METHODS: This cohort study was done at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in the USA, as part of the single-centre, single arm, phase 2, CLIA trial. Here we report on the independent cohort investigating the safety and activity of venetoclax added to intensive chemotherapy (the CLIA regimen [cladribine, high-dose cytarabine, idarubicin]). Eligible patients were aged 18-65 years with a new diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia, mixed phenotype acute leukaemia, or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (>/=10% blasts or International Prognostic Scoring System >/=2 [intermediate]), who received no previous potentially curative therapy for leukaemia. Patients received cladribine (5 mg/m(2)) and cytarabine (1.5 g/m(2) for patients aged <60 years, 1 g/m(2) for patients aged >/=60 years) intravenously on days 1-5 and idarubicin (10 mg/m(2)) intravenously on days 1-3. Consolidation was cladribine (5 mg/m(2)) and cytarabine (1 g/m(2) for patients aged <60 years and 0.75 g/m(2) for patients aged >/=60 years) on days 1-3 and idarubicin (8 mg/m(2)) on days 1-2. Venetoclax (400 mg) was given on days 2-8 with each course. Patients with a known FLT3-ITD or FLT3-TKD mutation received midostaurin or gilteritinib. The primary outcome was composite complete response (complete response plus complete response with incomplete blood count recovery). Secondary outcomes were overall response, duration of response, event-free survival, overall survival, and safety. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02115295. FINDINGS: Between Feb 25, 2019, and March 23, 2021, 77 patients were assessed for eligibility, 50 of whom were enrolled. Median age was 48 years (IQR 37-56). 47 (94% [95% CI 83-98]) patients had composite complete response, with the same proportion also having an overall response; two (4% [1-14]) patients did not respond, and one (2% [0-11]) patient died during induction. 37 (82% [95% CI 68-92]) of 45 patients had undetectable measurable residual disease (MRD). At a median follow-up of 13.5 months (IQR 6.4-19.5), the median duration of response, event-free survival, and overall survival were not reached. At 12 months, the estimated duration of response was 74% (95% CI 60-92), event-free survival was 68% (54-85), and overall survival was 85% (75-97). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or worse were febrile neutropenia (42 [84%] patients), infection (six [12%]), and alanine aminotransferase elevations (six [12%]). There was one death during induction in a patient treated with CLIA-venetoclax plus a FLT3 inhibitor. Two patients died of infectious complications while in complete response in consolidation cycles, both of whom had FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukaemia and were receiving combined therapy with a FLT3 inhibitor. No deaths were deemed to be treatment related. INTERPRETATION: Venetoclax added to CLIA was safe and active in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, producing high rates of durable MRD-negative remissions and encouraging event-free survival and overall survival.

In the present work, a series of analogs of the LY83583 containing alkoxy group(s) in aminophenyl ring (AQQ1-15) were designed and synthesized via a two-step route and evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxic activity against four different cancer cell lines (K562, Jurkat, MT-2, and HeLa) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by MTT assay. The analog (AQQ13) was identified to possess the most potent cytotoxic activity against K562 human chronic myelogenous (CML) cell line (IC50 = 0.59 +/- 0.07 muM) with significant selectivity (SI = 4.51) compared to imatinib (IC50 = 5.46 +/- 0.85 muM; SI = 4.60). Based on its superior cytotoxic activity, the analog AQQ13 was selected for further mechanistic studies including determination of its apoptotic effects on K562 cell line via annexin V/ethidium homodimer III staining potency, ABL1 kinase inhibitory activity, and DNA cleaving capacity. Results ascertained that the analog AQQ13 induced apoptosis in K562 cell line with notable DNA-cleaving activity. However, AQQ13 demonstrated weak ABL1 inhibition indicating the correlation between anti-K562 and anti-ABL1 activities. In continuance, respectively conducted in silico molecular docking and Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) studies drew attention to enhanced binding interactions of AQQ13 towards DNA and its high compatibility with the potential limits of specified pharmacokinetic parameters making it as a potential anti-leukemic drug candidate. Our findings may provide a new insight for further development of novel quinolinequinone-based anticancer analogs against CML.","['Ciftci, Halil I', 'Bayrak, Nilufer', 'Yildiz, Mahmut', 'Yildirim, Hatice', 'Sever, Belgin', 'Tateishi, Hiroshi', 'Otsuka, Masami', 'Fujita, Mikako', 'Tuyun, Amac Fatih']","['Ciftci HI', 'Bayrak N', 'Yildiz M', 'Yildirim H', 'Sever B', 'Tateishi H', 'Otsuka M', 'Fujita M', 'Tuyun AF']","['Department of Drug Discovery, Science Farm Ltd., Kumamoto, Japan; Medicinal and Biological Chemistry Science Farm Joint Research Laboratory, School of Pharmacy, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Avcilar, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Chemistry Department, Gebze Technical University, Gebze, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Avcilar, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Medicinal and Biological Chemistry Science Farm Joint Research Laboratory, School of Pharmacy, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan; Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Anadolu University, Eskisehir, Turkey.', 'Medicinal and Biological Chemistry Science Farm Joint Research Laboratory, School of Pharmacy, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Drug Discovery, Science Farm Ltd., Kumamoto, Japan; Medicinal and Biological Chemistry Science Farm Joint Research Laboratory, School of Pharmacy, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Medicinal and Biological Chemistry Science Farm Joint Research Laboratory, School of Pharmacy, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.

However, the configurations at positions 24 and 25 and configuration-dependent bioactivity were not yet studied. In the current report, ten manoalide-like sesterterpenoids were isolated from Luffariella sp. (1-10). These stereoisomers were identified and separated for the first time since 1980 and their configurations at positions 24 and 25 were determined by analyzing their spectroscopic spectra. The configuration-dependent anti-proliferative activity of manoalide derivatives was examined by evaluating their effect on four leukemic cancer cell lines (Molt 4, K562, Sup-T1, and U937). The 24R,25S-isomers exhibited the most potent activity (IC50 0.50-7.67 muM). The anti-proliferative mechanism of action of 24R,25S-manoalide (7) was further studied on Molt 4 cells. Compound 7 exhibited apoptotic activity on Molt 4 cells through the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). It also inhibited the activity of human topoisomerase I and II. The apoptotic-inducing effect of 7 was further supported by the in vivo experiment by suppressing the volume of xenograft tumor growth (66.11%) compared with the control.","['Lai, Kuei-Hung', 'Peng, Bo-Rong', 'Hsu, Yu-Ming', 'El-Shazly, Mohamed', 'Du, Ying-Chi', 'Lu, Mei-Chin', 'Su, Jui-Hsin', 'Liu, Yi-Chang']","['Lai KH', 'Peng BR', 'Hsu YM', 'El-Shazly M', 'Du YC', 'Lu MC', 'Su JH', 'Liu YC']","['PhD Program in Clinical Drug Development of Herbal Medicine, College of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan; Traditional Herbal Medicine Research Center, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei 11031, Taiwan.

Clonal hematopoiesis has been the most intensively studied form of clonal expansion in the last decade. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is an age-related phenomenon observed in elderly individuals with no history of hematological malignancy. The most frequently mutated genes in CHIP are DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1, which are associated with initiation of leukemia. Importantly, CHIP has been the focus of a number of studies because it is an independent risk factor for myeloid malignancy, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and all-cause mortality. Animal models recapitulating human CHIP revealed that CHIP-associated mutations alter the number and function of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and promote leukemic transformation. Moreover, chronic inflammation caused by infection or aging confers a fitness advantage to the CHIP-associated mutant HSPCs. Myeloid cells, such as macrophages with a CHIP-associated mutation, accelerate chronic inflammation and are associated with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines. This positive feedback loop between CHIP and chronic inflammation promotes development of atherosclerosis and chronic heart failure and thereby increases the risk for CVD. Notably, HSPCs with a CHIP-associated mutation may alter not only innate but also acquired immune cells. This suggests that CHIP is involved in the development of solid cancers or immune disorders, such as aplastic anemia. In this review, we provide an overview of recent findings on CHIP. We also discuss potential interventions for treating CHIP and preventing myeloid transformation and CVD progression.","['Asada, Shuhei', 'Kitamura, Toshio']","['Asada S', 'Kitamura T']","[""The Institute of Laboratory Animals, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6116-7996'],['eng'],"['19J01570/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', '20H00537/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', '21K16252/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', 'Japanese Society of Hematology']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210812,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Dnmt3a protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aging/blood', 'Animals', 'Atherosclerosis/genetics', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clonal Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Cytokines/blood', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/blood/complications/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Mice', 'Models, Animal', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Risk Factors']",PMC8486184,['NOTNLM'],"['clonal hematopoiesis', 'hematopoietic stem cell', 'myeloid leukemia', 'solid tumor']",2021/07/31 06:00,2021/10/08 06:00,['2021/07/30 12:40'],"['2021/07/25 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/08 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/30 12:40 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.15094 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2021 Oct;112(10):3962-3971. doi: 10.1111/cas.15094.

Patients aged 16-24 years and 25-65 years were analyzed separately, and their outcomes were compared to those of patients who continued high-intensity chemotherapy in CR1 in studies (202U group and 202O group) by the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group (JALSG). In the HSCT-MRD group, patients younger than 25 years had lower overall survival (OS) than the 202U group, presumably due to the higher non-relapse mortality (NRM) in the HSCT-MRD group. Patients 25 years and older had similar OS to the 202O group. The lower relapse rate was counterbalanced by higher NRM in the HSCT-MRD group. In the HSCT-MUD group, patients in both age groups had similar OS to their corresponding groups in the JALSG studies. In conclusion, high-intensity chemotherapy may change the role of HSCT for Ph-negative ALL.","['Kako, Shinichi', 'Hayakawa, Fumihiko', 'Imai, Kiyotoshi', 'Tanaka, Junji', 'Mizuta, Shuichi', 'Nishiwaki, Satoshi', 'Kanamori, Heiwa', 'Mukae, Junichi', 'Ozawa, Yukiyasu', 'Kondo, Tadakazu', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Ota, Shuichi', 'Tanaka, Yoshinori', 'Murayama, Tohru', 'Kurahashi, Shingo', 'Sakura, Toru', 'Usui, Noriko', 'Ohtake, Shigeki', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Matsumura, Itaru', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko']","['Kako S', 'Hayakawa F', 'Imai K', 'Tanaka J', 'Mizuta S', 'Nishiwaki S', 'Kanamori H', 'Mukae J', 'Ozawa Y', 'Kondo T', 'Fukuda T', 'Ichinohe T', 'Ota S', 'Tanaka Y', 'Murayama T', 'Kurahashi S', 'Sakura T', 'Usui N', 'Ohtake S', 'Kiyoi H', 'Matsumura I', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Atsuta Y']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, 1-847 Amanuma, Omiya-ku, Saitama, Saitama, 330-8503, Japan. shinichikako@asahi-net.email.ne.jp.', 'Department of Pathophysiological Laboratory Sciences, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Otaru General Hospital, Otaru, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Immunology and Hematology, Kanazawa Medical University, Ishikawa, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Medicine, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Third Department of Internal Medicine, Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hyogo Cancer Center, Akashi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Toyohashi Municipal Hospital, Aichi, Japan.', 'Leukemia Research Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Division of Clinical Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Rheumatology, Faculty of Medicine, Kindai University, Osakasayama, Japan.', 'Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Administration, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2635-3395'],['eng'],"['JP19ck0106331/japan agency for medical research and development', '19ek0510023h0002/japan agency for medical research and development']",['Journal Article'],20210730,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Management', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'High-intensity chemotherapy', 'Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",2021/07/31 06:00,2021/12/17 06:00,['2021/07/30 12:35'],"['2021/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/17 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/30 12:35 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-021-03198-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-021-03198-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2021 Nov;114(5):608-619. doi: 10.1007/s12185-021-03198-4.

Therefore, finding new potential therapeutic agents is required. Since inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), is strongly expressed in EOCs and associated with the level of tumor grade, disruption of this inflammation pathway may provide another potential target for OCCC treatment. We previously reported that Kaempferia parviflora (KP) extract decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. However, the effects of KP on OCCC, especially the aspects related to inflammatory cytokines, have not been elucidated. Our current study demonstrated the effects of KP extract on cytokine production in TNF-alpha-induced OCCC TOV-21G cell line. This study showed that KP extract inhibited interleukin 6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) production at both transcription and translation levels via the suppression of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signal transduction. In contrast, KP extract increased the expression of inhibitor kappa B (IkappaB) protein which may delay NF-kappaB translocation into the nucleus upon TNF-alpha activation. Moreover, the suppression of cytokines released from KP treated-TOV-21G reduced the migration of monocyte cell (THP-1). KP extract also exhibited the inhibition of IL-6 and MCP-1 production from THP-1 activated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Cells treated with KP extract exhibited a decrease in extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation and induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein Mcl-1 (MCL-1) expression. Suppression of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production and inhibition of tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) migration support the possibility of using KP for OCCC treatment.","['Thaklaewphan, Phatarawat', 'Ruttanapattanakul, Jirapak', 'Monkaew, Sathit', 'Buatoom, Montanee', 'Sookkhee, Siriwoot', 'Nimlamool, Wutigri', 'Potikanond, Saranyapin']","['Thaklaewphan P', 'Ruttanapattanakul J', 'Monkaew S', 'Buatoom M', 'Sookkhee S', 'Nimlamool W', 'Potikanond S']","['Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; Graduate School, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.

Nontraumatic chylothorax caused by chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is rarely reported. Previous experience has implied that the main factor affecting the treatment of chylothorax is whether the anti-cancer treatment is effective. The patient diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/ small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) before the hospital admission, and not received any treatment. After four months, he had progressive dyspnea. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral pleural effusion with progressive lymphadenopathy, and massive chylous pleural effusion was drained by closed thoracic drainage. After a course of chemotherapy including fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR), the patient developed agranulocytosis and his pleural effusion was still abundant. After careful consideration, the patient refused to receive following chemotherapy and chose to take ibrutinib orally. Two months after oral ibrutinib, ultrasound examination showed that pleural effusion completely disappeared. In the next one year, the patient had a routine follow-up and was in good condition. To our knowledge, this is the first report of ibrutinib in the treatment of chylothorax associated with CLL. Ibrutinib provides a more palliative treatment for elderly CLL patients with chylothorax.","['Cheng, Ling', 'Huang, Mei', 'Wei, Jia', 'Xu, Hao', 'Zhou, Mi', 'Jiang, Lijun']","['Cheng L', 'Huang M', 'Wei J', 'Xu H', 'Zhou M', 'Jiang L']","['Department of Geriatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",,['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210721,China,Ann Palliat Med,Annals of palliative medicine,101585484,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chylothorax', 'case report', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', 'ibrutinib']",2021/07/31 06:00,2021/07/31 06:00,['2021/07/30 08:37'],"['2021/07/30 08:37 [entrez]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.21037/apm-21-989 [doi]', 'apm-21-989 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Ann Palliat Med. 2021 Jul 21. pii: apm-21-989. doi: 10.21037/apm-21-989.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the rarity of cases, lack of data, and consensus management, no recommendations exist to target the population at risk. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of 229 consecutive patients diagnosed with ALL with an age range of 1-21 years, treated at the Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon between October 2007 and February 2018. RESULTS: The incidence of CSVT was 10.5%. Using univariate analysis, increased risk of CSVT was observed with male gender, age >10 years, T-cell immunophenotype, intermediate/high-risk disease, maximum triglyceride (TG) level of >615 mg/dl, presence of mediastinal mass, and larger body surface area (BSA). With multivariate analysis, the only statistically significant risk factors were maximum TG level, BSA, presence of mediastinal mass, and risk stratification (intermediate/high risk). CONCLUSION: Our study was able to unveil TG level of >615 mg/dl, mediastinal mass, and a larger BSA as novel risk factors that have not been previously discussed in the literature.","['El-Khoury, Habib', 'Saifi, Omran', 'Haddad, Salame', 'Chahrour, Mohamad', 'Ghanem, Khaled M', 'Mubarak, Yaacoub', 'Tamim, Hani', 'Makki, Maha', 'Zakka, Cyril', 'Chan, Anthony K', 'Mahfouz, Rami', 'Tarek, Nidale', 'El-Solh, Hassan', 'Abboud, Miguel R', 'Saab, Raya', 'Muwakkit, Samar A']","['El-Khoury H', 'Saifi O', 'Haddad S', 'Chahrour M', 'Ghanem KM', 'Mubarak Y', 'Tamim H', 'Makki M', 'Zakka C', 'Chan AK', 'Mahfouz R', 'Tarek N', 'El-Solh H', 'Abboud MR', 'Saab R', 'Muwakkit SA']","['Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida, USA.', 'Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Thrombosis and Atherosclerosis Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Clinical Research Institute, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Thrombosis and Atherosclerosis Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4023-6566', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4796-4160', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8446-2349', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5776-2303', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3243-1342']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210729,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*CSVT', ""*Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon"", '*Lebanon', '*asparaginase', '*pediatric ALL']",2021/07/31 06:00,2021/07/31 06:00,['2021/07/30 07:11'],"['2021/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2021/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/30 07:11 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.29210 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Nov;68(11):e29210. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29210.

Because of these potential impacts, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify peer reviewed literature on air quality near commercial airports and assess the quality of the studies. The systematic review included reference database searches in PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, inclusive of years 2000 through 2020. We identified 3,301 articles, and based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria developed, seventy studies were identified for extraction and evaluation using a combination of supervised machine learning and manual screening techniques. These studies consistently showed that ultrafine particulate matter (UFP) is elevated in and around airports. Furthermore, many studies show elevated levels of particulate matter under 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5), black carbon, criteria pollutants, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as well. Finally, the systematic review, while not focused on health effects, identified a limited number of on-topic references reporting adverse health effects impacts, including increased rates of premature death, pre-term births, decreased lung function, oxidative DNA damage and childhood leukemia. More research is needed linking particle size distributions to specific airport activities, and proximity to airports, characterizing relationships between different pollutants, evaluating long-term impacts, and improving our understanding of health effects.","['Riley, Karie', 'Cook, Rich', 'Carr, Edward', 'Manning, Bryan']","['Riley K', 'Cook R', 'Carr E', 'Manning B']","['ICF Incorporated, L.L.C., 9300 Lee Highway, Fairfax, VA 22031-1207, U.

Pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox (Pbx)-regulating protein-1 (PREP1) is a ubiquitous homeodomain transcription factor involved in the adipogenic differentiation and insulin-sensitivity processes. Leptin, as pleiotropic adipokine, and TGF-beta, known to be expressed by primary pre-adipocytes [adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs)] and mature differentiated adipocytes, modulate inflammatory responses. We aimed to assess for the first time if leptin and TGF-beta interfere with PREP1 expression in both ASCs and mature differentiated adipocytes. Human ASCs were isolated from subcutaneous adipose liposuction and, after expansion, fully differentiated to mature adipocytes. In both ASCs and adipocytes, leptin and TGF-beta1 significantly decreased the expression of PREP1, alone and following concurrent Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation. Moreover, in adipocytes, but not in ASCs, leptin increased TLR4 and IL-33 expression, whereas TGF-beta1 enhanced TLR4 and IL-6 expression. Taken together, we provide evidence for a direct regulation of PREP1 by leptin and TGF-beta1 in ASCs and mature adipocytes. The effects of leptin and TGF-beta1 on immune receptors and cytokines, however, are limited to mature adipocytes, suggesting that modulating immune responses depends on the differentiation of ASCs. Further studies are needed to fully understand the regulation of PREP1 expression and its potential for the development of new therapeutic approaches in obesity-related diseases.","['Bruno, Andreina', 'Di Sano, Caterina', 'Simon, Hans-Uwe', 'Chanez, Pascal', 'Patti, Angelo Maria', 'Di Vincenzo, Serena', 'Dino, Paola', ""D'Esposito, Vittoria"", 'Formisano, Pietro', 'Beguinot, Francesco', 'Pace, Elisabetta']","['Bruno A', 'Di Sano C', 'Simon HU', 'Chanez P', 'Patti AM', 'Di Vincenzo S', 'Dino P', ""D'Esposito V"", 'Formisano P', 'Beguinot F', 'Pace E']","['Institute for Biomedical Research and Innovation (IRIB), National Research Council, Palermo, Italy.', 'Institute for Biomedical Research and Innovation (IRIB), National Research Council, Palermo, Italy.', 'Institute of Pharmacology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, Medical School Brandenburg, Neuruppin, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology and Allergology, Sechenov University, Moscow, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, Institute of Fundamental Medicine and Biology, Kazan Federal University, Kazan, Russia.', 'Department of Respiratory Diseases CIC Nord INSERM, INRAE, C2VN, Aix Marseille University, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Health Promotion Sciences Maternal and Infantile Care, Internal Medicine and Medical Specialties (PROMISE), University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.', 'Institute for Biomedical Research and Innovation (IRIB), National Research Council, Palermo, Italy.', 'Institute for Biomedical Research and Innovation (IRIB), National Research Council, Palermo, Italy.', 'URT Genomics of Diabetes, Institute of Experimental Endocrinology and Oncology, National Research Council, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medicine, Federico II University of Naples, Naples, Italy.', 'URT Genomics of Diabetes, Institute of Experimental Endocrinology and Oncology, National Research Council, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medicine, Federico II University of Naples, Naples, Italy.', 'URT Genomics of Diabetes, Institute of Experimental Endocrinology and Oncology, National Research Council, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medicine, Federico II University of Naples, Naples, Italy.', 'Institute for Biomedical Research and Innovation (IRIB), National Research Council, Palermo, Italy.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210713,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,PMC8315375,['NOTNLM'],"['PREP1', 'TGF-beta1', 'TLR4', 'adipocyte-derived stem cells', 'adipocytes', 'adipose tissue', 'immune system', 'leptin']",2021/07/31 06:00,2021/07/31 06:01,['2021/07/30 06:48'],"['2021/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/30 06:48 [entrez]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.700481 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Jul 13;9:700481. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.700481. eCollection 2021.,700481,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Bruno, Di Sano, Simon, Chanez, Patti, Di Vincenzo, Dino,', ""D'Esposito, Formisano, Beguinot and Pace.""]",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, large-scale data analysis of potential relationship between CXCL12 and AML remains insufficient. Methods: We collected abundant CXCL12 expression data and AML samples from several publicly available datasets. The CIBERSORT algorithm was used to quantify immune cell fractions and the online website of STRING was utilized for gene ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. The statistical analysis and graphical work were mainly performed via the R software. Results: CXCL12 expression was extremely down-regulated in AML. Clinically, low CXCL12 expression was correlated with higher white blood cells (WBCs) (P < 0.0001), more blasts in bone marrow (BM) (P < 0.001) and peripheral blood (PB) (P < 0.0001), FLT3-internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) (P = 0.010) and NPM1 mutations (P = 0.015). More importantly, reduced CXCL12 expression predicted worse overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in all AML, non-M3-AML, and cytogenetically normal (CN)-AML patients in three independent cohorts. As for immune cell infiltration, high CXCL12 expressed groups tended to harbor more memory B cells and plasma cells infiltration while low CXCL12 expressed groups exhibited more eosinophils infiltration. GO enrichment and KEGG pathways analysis revealed the potential biological progress the gene participating in. Conclusions: CXCL12 is significantly down-regulated in AML and low CXCL12 expression is an independent and poor predictor of AML prognosis. CXCL12 expression level correlates with clinical and immune characteristics of AML, which could provide potential assistance for treatment. Prospective studies are needed to further validate the impact of CXCL12 expression before routine clinical application in AML.","['Wang, Shi-Sen', 'Xu, Zi-Jun', 'Jin, Ye', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Xia, Pei-Hui', 'Wen, Xiangmei', 'Mao, Zhen-Wei', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun']","['Wang SS', 'Xu ZJ', 'Jin Y', 'Ma JC', 'Xia PH', 'Wen X', 'Mao ZW', 'Lin J', 'Qian J']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210720,United States,PeerJ,PeerJ,101603425,,,,PMC8300536,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CXCL12', 'CXCR4', 'Gene expression', 'Prognosis', 'SDF-1']",2021/07/31 06:00,2021/07/31 06:01,['2021/07/30 06:47'],"['2021/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/30 06:47 [entrez]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7717/peerj.11820 [doi]', '11820 [pii]']",epublish,PeerJ. 2021 Jul 20;9:e11820. doi: 10.7717/peerj.11820. eCollection 2021.,e11820,['(c) 2021 Wang et al.'],,,,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we aimed to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model of HD-MTX in Chinese pediatric patients with ALL for designing personalized dosage regimens. In total, 4,517 MTX serum concentration data for 311 pediatric patients with ALL, aged 0.75-15.2 years and under HD-MTX treatment, were retrospectively collected at a tertiary Children's Hospital in China. The non-linear mixed-effect model was used to establish the population PK model, using NONMEM software. The potential covariate effects of age, body weight, and biochemical measurements (renal and liver function) on MTX PK disposition were investigated. The model was then evaluated using goodness-of-fit, visual predictive check. MTX PK disposition was described using a three-compartment model reasonable well. Body weight, implemented as a fixed allometric function on all clearance and volume of distribution parameters, showed a substantial improvement in model fit. The final population model demonstrated that the MTX clearance estimate in a typical child with body weight of 19 kg was 6.9 L/h and the central distribution of volume estimate was 20.7 L. The serum creatinine significantly affected the MTX clearance, with a 0.97% decrease in clearance per 1 mumol/L of serum creatinine. Other covariates (e.g., age, sex, bilirubin, albumin, aspartate transaminase, concomitant medication) did not significantly affect PK properties of MTX. The proposed population PK model could describe the MTX concentration data in Chinese pediatric patients with ALL. This population PK model combined with a maximum a posteriori Bayesian approach could be used to estimate individual PK parameters, and optimize personalized MTX therapy in target patients, thus aiming to reduce toxicity and improve treatment outcomes.","['Gao, Xuan', 'Qian, Xiao-Wen', 'Zhu, Xiao-Hua', 'Yu, Yi', 'Miao, Hui', 'Meng, Jian-Hua', 'Jiang, Jun-Ye', 'Wang, Hong-Sheng', 'Zhai, Xiao-Wen']","['Gao X', 'Qian XW', 'Zhu XH', 'Yu Y', 'Miao H', 'Meng JH', 'Jiang JY', 'Wang HS', 'Zhai XW']","[""Outpatient and Emergency Management Office, National Children's Medical Center, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, National Children's Medical Center, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, National Children's Medical Center, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, National Children's Medical Center, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, National Children's Medical Center, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, National Children's Medical Center, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, National Children's Medical Center, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, National Children's Medical Center, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, National Children's Medical Center, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China.""]",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210713,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC8313761,['NOTNLM'],"['NONMEM', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'methotrexate', 'pediatric patients', 'population pharmacokinetics']",2021/07/31 06:00,2021/07/31 06:01,['2021/07/30 06:43'],"['2021/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/30 06:43 [entrez]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2021.701452 [doi]', '701452 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2021 Jul 13;12:701452. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2021.701452. eCollection 2021.,701452,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Gao, Qian, Zhu, Yu, Miao, Meng, Jiang, Wang and Zhai.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Entospletinib (GS-9973) is an oral, selective inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), currently in the phase II clinical trials for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Syk is abundantly present in the cells of hematopoietic lineage that mediates cell proliferation, differentiation, and adhesion. In this current study, we evaluated the efficacy of GS-9973 to overcome multidrug resistance (MDR) due to the overexpression of the ABCG2 transporter in the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line, NCI-H460/MX20. In vitro, 3 muM of GS-9973 reversed the drug resistance of NCI-H460/MX20 cell line to mitoxantrone or doxorubicin. GS-9973, at 3 muM reverses ABCG2-mediated MDR by blocking ABCG2 efflux activity and downregulating ABCG2 expression at the protein level but did not alter the ABCG2 mRNA expression and subcellular localization of the ABCG2 protein compared to drug-resistant cells incubated with the vehicle. GS-9973 produced a moderate concentration-dependent increase in the ATPase activity of ABCG2 (EC50 = 0.42 microM) and molecular docking data indicated that GS-9973 had a high affinity (-10.226 kcal/mol) for the substrate-binding site of ABCG2. Finally, HPLC analysis proved that the intracellular concentration of GS-9973 is not significantly different in both parental and resistant cell lines. In conclusion, our study suggests that in vitro, GS-9973 in combination with certain anticancer drugs, represent a strategy to overcome ABCG2-mediated MDR cancers.","['Narayanan, Silpa', 'Wu, Zhuo-Xun', 'Wang, Jing-Quan', 'Ma, Hansu', 'Acharekar, Nikita', 'Koya, Jagadish', 'Yoganathan, Sabesan', 'Fang, Shuo', 'Chen, Zhe-Sheng', 'Pan, Yihang']","['Narayanan S', 'Wu ZX', 'Wang JQ', 'Ma H', 'Acharekar N', 'Koya J', 'Yoganathan S', 'Fang S', 'Chen ZS', 'Pan Y']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY, 11439, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY, 11439, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY, 11439, USA."", 'Precision Medicine Center, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Shenzhen 518107, PR China.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY, 11439, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY, 11439, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY, 11439, USA."", 'Department of Oncology, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Shenzhen, 518107, PR China.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY, 11439, USA."", 'Precision Medicine Center, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Shenzhen 518107, PR China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210622,Australia,Int J Biol Sci,International journal of biological sciences,101235568,,IM,,PMC8315011,['NOTNLM'],"['*ABCG2', '*ATP binding cassette transporter', '*Entospletinib', '*MDR', '*Syk', '*reversal effect']",2021/07/31 06:00,2021/07/31 06:00,['2021/07/30 06:42'],"['2021/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/30 06:42 [entrez]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/ijbs.61229 [doi]', 'ijbsv17p2652 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Biol Sci. 2021 Jun 22;17(10):2652-2665. doi: 10.7150/ijbs.61229. eCollection 2021.,2652-2665,['(c) The author(s).'],,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using an ELISA-based assay that detects IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we determined serum antibody levels prior to immunization and 12-21 and 14-21 days following the first and second vaccinations, respectively, with mRNA-1273 (Moderna) or BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) among 103 MM patients (96 and 7 with active and smoldering disease, respectively). We stratified patients into clinically relevant responders (>250 IU/mL), partial responders (50-250 IU/mL, which was above pre-COVID-19 background), and nonresponders (<50 IU/mL). Smoldering MM patients responded better than those with active disease. Only 45% of active MM patients developed an adequate response, while 22% had a partial response. Lower spike antibody levels were associated with older age, impaired renal function, low lymphocyte counts, reduced uninvolved immunoglobulin levels, > second line of treatment, and among those not in complete remission. Patients who received mRNA-1273 vaccine had higher anti-spike antibody levels than those who were vaccinated with BNT162b2. Thus, most MM patients have impaired responses to mRNA vaccination against COVID-19, and specific clinical and myeloma-related characteristics predict vaccine responsiveness.","['Stampfer, Samuel D', 'Goldwater, Marissa-Skye', 'Jew, Scott', 'Bujarski, Sean', 'Regidor, Bernard', 'Daniely, David', 'Chen, Haiming', 'Xu, Ning', 'Li, Mingjie', 'Green, Tracy', 'Fung, Eddie', 'Aquino, Elias', 'Swift, Regina', 'Eshaghian, Shahrooz', 'Preugschat, Kurt', 'Feinstein, Aaron J', 'Spektor, Tanya M', 'Berenson, James R']","['Stampfer SD', 'Goldwater MS', 'Jew S', 'Bujarski S', 'Regidor B', 'Daniely D', 'Chen H', 'Xu N', 'Li M', 'Green T', 'Fung E', 'Aquino E', 'Swift R', 'Eshaghian S', 'Preugschat K', 'Feinstein AJ', 'Spektor TM', 'Berenson JR']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research, West Hollywood, CA, USA.', 'Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research, West Hollywood, CA, USA.', 'Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research, West Hollywood, CA, USA.', 'Berenson Cancer Center, West Hollywood, CA, USA.', 'Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research, West Hollywood, CA, USA.', 'Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research, West Hollywood, CA, USA.', 'Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research, West Hollywood, CA, USA.', 'Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research, West Hollywood, CA, USA.', 'Berenson Cancer Center, West Hollywood, CA, USA.', 'Berenson Cancer Center, West Hollywood, CA, USA.', 'Berenson Cancer Center, West Hollywood, CA, USA.', 'Berenson Cancer Center, West Hollywood, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'KP BIOSTATS, LLC, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana Medical Center, Tarzana, CA, USA.', 'ENT Group of Los Angeles, Tarzana, CA, USA.', 'ONCOtherapeutics, West Hollywood, CA, USA.', 'Institute for Myeloma and Bone Cancer Research, West Hollywood, CA, USA. jberenson@berensoncancercenter.org.', 'Berenson Cancer Center, West Hollywood, CA, USA. jberenson@berensoncancercenter.org.', 'ONCOtherapeutics, West Hollywood, CA, USA. jberenson@berensoncancercenter.org.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7365-6754', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1587-6104']",['eng'],"['T32 AI074492/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32AI074492/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National', 'Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210729,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus)', '0 (spike protein, SARS-CoV-2)', 'EPK39PL4R4 (2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273)', 'N38TVC63NU (BNT162 Vaccine)']",IM,"['2019-nCoV Vaccine mRNA-1273/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood/immunology', 'BNT162 Vaccine/*administration & dosage/immunology', 'COVID-19/epidemiology/*therapy/virology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications/*immunology/virology', 'SARS-CoV-2/*immunology', 'Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus/*immunology', 'Vaccination']",PMC8320411,,,2021/07/31 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/07/30 06:33'],"['2021/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/30 06:33 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-021-01354-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-021-01354-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Dec;35(12):3534-3541. doi: 10.1038/s41375-021-01354-7.

JAK2 kinase inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib, provide clinical benefit, but inhibition of wild-type (wt) JAK2 limits their clinical utility due to toxicity to normal cells, and small molecule inhibition of mutated JAK2 kinase activity can lead to drug resistance. Here, we present a strategy to target mutated JAK2 for degradation, using the cell's intracellular degradation machinery, while sparing non-mutated JAK2. We employed a chemical genetics screen, followed by extensive selectivity profiling and genetic studies, to identify the deubiquitinase (DUB), JOSD1, as a novel regulator of mutant JAK2. JOSD1 interacts with and stabilizes JAK2-V617F, and inactivation of the DUB leads to JAK2-V617F protein degradation by increasing its ubiquitination levels, thereby shortening its protein half-life. Moreover, targeting of JOSD1 leads to the death of JAK2-V617F-positive primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. These studies provide a novel therapeutic approach to achieving selective targeting of mutated JAK2 signaling in MPN.","['Yang, Jing', 'Weisberg, Ellen L', 'Liu, Xiaoxi', 'Magin, Robert S', 'Chan, Wai Cheung', 'Hu, Bin', 'Schauer, Nathan J', 'Zhang, Shengzhe', 'Lamberto, Ilaria', 'Doherty, Laura', 'Meng, Chengcheng', 'Sattler, Martin', 'Cabal-Hierro, Lucia', 'Winer, Eric', 'Stone, Richard', 'Marto, Jarrod A', 'Griffin, James D', 'Buhrlage, Sara J']","['Yang J', 'Weisberg EL', 'Liu X', 'Magin RS', 'Chan WC', 'Hu B', 'Schauer NJ', 'Zhang S', 'Lamberto I', 'Doherty L', 'Meng C', 'Sattler M', 'Cabal-Hierro L', 'Winer E', 'Stone R', 'Marto JA', 'Griffin JD', 'Buhrlage SJ']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA. james_griffin@dfci.harvard.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. james_griffin@dfci.harvard.edu.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. saraj_buhrlage@dfci.harvard.edu.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. saraj_buhrlage@dfci.harvard.edu.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6441-709X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5679-9531', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8413-5401', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9212-0776', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3004-4923', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5053-4199', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2086-1134', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1823-7930', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4562-1823']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210729,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,,,,,2021/07/31 06:00,2021/07/31 06:00,['2021/07/30 06:33'],"['2021/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/06/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/30 06:33 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-021-01336-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-021-01336-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2022 Jan;36(1):210-220. doi: 10.1038/s41375-021-01336-9.

Here, we screened compounds inhibiting breast cancer cell proliferation with HPIP fused with green fluorescent protein as a reporter. A novel agent named TXX-1-10 derived from rimonabant, an antagonist of cannabinoid receptor 1 with anticancer effects, has been discovered to reduce HPIP expression and has greater inhibitory effects on breast cancer cell growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo than rimonabant. TXX-1-10 regulates HPIP downstream targets, including several important kinases involved in cancer development and progression (e.g., AKT, ERK1/2, and FAK) as well as cell cycle-, apoptosis-, migration-, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes. Consistent with the results of anticancer effects, genome-wide RNA sequencing indicated that TXX-1-10 has more significant effects on regulation of the expression of genes related to DNA replication, cell cycle, apoptosis, cell adhesion, cell migration, and invasion than rimonabant. In addition, TXX-1-10 significantly regulated genes associated with the cell growth and extracellular matrix organization, many of which were shown to be regulated by HPIP. Moreover, compared with rimonabant, TXX-1-10 greatly reduces blood-brain barrier penetrability to avoid adverse central depressive effects. These findings suggest that HPIP inhibition may be a useful strategy for cancer treatment and TXX-1-10 is a promising candidate drug for cancer therapy.","['Li, Pengyun', 'Cao, Shengjie', 'Huang, Yubing', 'Zhang, Yanan', 'Liu, Jie', 'Cai, Xu', 'Zhou, Lulu', 'Li, Jianbin', 'Jiang, Zefei', 'Ding, Lihua', 'Zheng, Zhibing', 'Li, Song', 'Ye, Qinong']","['Li P', 'Cao S', 'Huang Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu J', 'Cai X', 'Zhou L', 'Li J', 'Jiang Z', 'Ding L', 'Zheng Z', 'Li S', 'Ye Q']","['Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, 100850, China.', 'Laboratory of Computer-Aided Drug Design & Discovery, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, 100850, China.', 'Laboratory of Computer-Aided Drug Design & Discovery, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, 100850, China.', 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, 100850, China.', 'Laboratory of Computer-Aided Drug Design & Discovery, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, 100850, China.', 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, 100850, China.', 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, 100850, China.', 'Laboratory of Computer-Aided Drug Design & Discovery, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, 100850, China.', 'Laboratory of Computer-Aided Drug Design & Discovery, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, 100850, China.', 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, 100850, China.', 'Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100071, China.', 'Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100071, China.', 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, 100850, China. dinglh2004@126.com.', 'Laboratory of Computer-Aided Drug Design & Discovery, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, 100850, China. zzbcaptain@aliyun.com.', 'Laboratory of Computer-Aided Drug Design & Discovery, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing, 100850, China. lis@bmi.ac.cn.', 'Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, 100850, China. yeqn66@yahoo.com.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5039-0348', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5280-8162', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8032-8919']",['eng'],"['81630067/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)']",['Journal Article'],20210729,United States,Cell Death Discov,Cell death discovery,101665035,,,,PMC8322322,,,2021/07/31 06:00,2021/07/31 06:01,['2021/07/30 05:54'],"['2021/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/06/07 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/30 05:54 [entrez]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41420-021-00580-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41420-021-00580-3 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Discov. 2021 Jul 29;7(1):198. doi: 10.1038/s41420-021-00580-3.,198,['(c) 2021.

While stem cell transplant serves as proof-of-principle that AML LSCs can be eliminated by the immune system, the translation of existing immunotherapies to AML has been met with limited success. Consequently, understanding and exploiting the unique immune-evasive mechanisms of AML LSCs is critical. METHODS: Analysis of stem cell datasets and primary patient samples revealed CD200 as a putative stem cell-specific immune checkpoint overexpressed in AML LSCs. Isogenic cell line models of CD200 expression were employed to characterize the interaction of CD200(+) AML with various immune cell subsets both in vitro and in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-humanized mouse models. CyTOF and RNA-sequencing were performed on humanized mice to identify novel mechanisms of CD200-mediated immunosuppression. To clinically translate these findings, we developed a fully humanized CD200 antibody (IgG1) that removed the immunosuppressive signal by blocking interaction with the CD200 receptor while also inducing a potent Fc-mediated response. Therapeutic efficacy of the CD200 antibody was evaluated using both humanized mice and patient-derived xenograft models. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that CD200 is selectively overexpressed in AML LSCs and is broadly immunosuppressive by impairing cytokine secretion in both innate and adaptive immune cell subsets. In a PBMC-humanized mouse model, CD200(+) leukemia progressed rapidly, escaping elimination by T cells, compared with CD200(-) AML. T cells from mice with CD200(+) AML were characterized by an abundance of metabolically quiescent CD8(+) central and effector memory cells. Mechanistically, CD200 expression on AML cells significantly impaired OXPHOS metabolic activity in T cells from healthy donors. Importantly, CD200 antibody therapy could eliminate disease in the presence of graft-versus-leukemia in immune competent mice and could significantly improve the efficacy of low-intensity azacitidine/venetoclax chemotherapy in immunodeficient hosts. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of CD200 is a stem cell-specific marker that contributes to immunosuppression in AML by impairing effector cell metabolism and function. CD200 antibody therapy is capable of simultaneously reducing CD200-mediated suppression while also engaging macrophage activity. This study lays the groundwork for CD200-targeted therapeutic strategies to eliminate LSCs and prevent AML relapse.","['Herbrich, Shelley', 'Baran, Natalia', 'Cai, Tianyu', 'Weng, Connie', 'Aitken, Marisa J L', 'Post, Sean M', 'Henderson, Jared', 'Shi, Chunhua', 'Richard-Carpentier, Guillame', 'Sauvageau, Guy', 'Baggerly, Keith', 'Al-Atrash, Gheath', 'Davis, R Eric', 'Daver, Naval', 'Zha, Dongxing', 'Konopleva, Marina']","['Herbrich S', 'Baran N', 'Cai T', 'Weng C', 'Aitken MJL', 'Post SM', 'Henderson J', 'Shi C', 'Richard-Carpentier G', 'Sauvageau G', 'Baggerly K', 'Al-Atrash G', 'Davis RE', 'Daver N', 'Zha D', 'Konopleva M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Oncology Research for Biologics and Immunotherapy Translation (ORBIT) platform, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'University of Montreal Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Oncology Research for Biologics and Immunotherapy Translation (ORBIT) platform, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA mkonople@mdanderson.org.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3825-6752'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', 'UQ4V77A8VA (antigens, CD200)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune Evasion/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD']",PMC8323398,['NOTNLM'],"['*immunomodulation', '*lymphocyte activation', '*metabolic networks and pathways', '*tumor escape']",2021/07/31 06:00,2022/01/12 06:00,['2021/07/30 05:50'],"['2021/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/30 05:50 [entrez]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['jitc-2021-002968 [pii]', '10.1136/jitc-2021-002968 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2021 Jul;9(7). pii: jitc-2021-002968. doi: 10.1136/jitc-2021-002968.,,"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Here, we report our investigation of trogocytosis of TYRO3, a cell membrane protein, from tumor target cells to natural killer (NK) cells and the associated functional consequences for NK cells. We found that although NK cells did not express endogenous TYRO3 on the cell surface, activated NK cells rapidly acquired TYRO3 from tumor cells via trogocytosis in vitro and in vivo. NK cells that acquired TYRO3, which we termed TYRO3(+) NK cells, had significantly enhanced cytotoxicity and IFNgamma production as well as higher expression of some activated surface markers compared with TYRO3(-) NK cells. Furthermore, the activation status of NK cells and TYRO3 expression levels on donor cells, either endogenous or ectopic, positively correlated with trogocytosis levels. When the antigen-presenting cell (APC) K562 leukemia cell line, a feeder cell line to expand NK cells, overexpressed TYRO3, TYRO3 was transferred to NK cells via trogocytosis, which improved NK-cell proliferation ex vivo. This provides a strategy to manufacture NK cells or their engineered counterparts, such as chimeric antigen receptor NK cells, for the treatment of cancer or infectious diseases.","['Lu, Ting', 'Ma, Rui', 'Li, Zhenlong', 'Mansour, Anthony G', 'Teng, Kun-Yu', 'Chen, Li', 'Zhang, Jianying', 'Barr, Tasha', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Yu, Jianhua']","['Lu T', 'Ma R', 'Li Z', 'Mansour AG', 'Teng KY', 'Chen L', 'Zhang J', 'Barr T', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Yu J']","['Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Computational and Quantitative Medicine, City of Hope National Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Los Angeles, California. mcaligiuri@coh.org jiayu@coh.org.', 'Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'Hematologic Malignancies Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Los Angeles, California. mcaligiuri@coh.org jiayu@coh.org.', 'Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'Hematologic Malignancies Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Los Angeles, California.', 'City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, California.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1404-7830', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4095-3020']",['eng'],"['R01 AI129582/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS106170/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA223400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA068458/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA210087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA163205/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA265095/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA068458/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA247550/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20210729,United States,Cancer Immunol Res,Cancer immunology research,101614637,,IM,,PMC8562593,,,2021/07/31 06:00,2021/07/31 06:00,['2021/07/30 05:49'],"['2020/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/04/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/30 05:49 [entrez]']","['2326-6066.CIR-20-1014 [pii]', '10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-20-1014 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Res. 2021 Oct;9(10):1229-1241. doi: 10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-20-1014.

Myeloid infiltration of the thyroid gland is extremely rare. Here, a unique case in which thyroid cancer tissue was infiltrated with myeloid cells is presented. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of thyroid papillary cancer infiltrated by blastic cells and bilateral breast and axillary myeloid sarcoma in a 30-year-old Caucasian female patient with a history of osteosarcoma and MDS-RAEB2. The patient firstly received 6 cycles of chemotherapy for osteosarcoma, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was performed after anthracycline-based chemotherapy due to MDS-RAEB2. The patient remained in remission on follow-up in terms of both osteosarcoma and MDS-RAEB2. Malignant features (Bethesda VI) were observed in the fine needle aspiration biopsy performed from a newly developed firm, fixed thyroid nodule approximately 4-5 cm in length in the left thyroid lobe. Because of the Bethesda VI thyroid nodule, the patient underwent total thyroidectomy. In the pathological evaluation, CD34-, CD117-, MPO-, and HLA-DR-positive blastic cells which infiltrated into follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma were detected. In the evaluation performed due to blastic cell infiltration, multiple lesions showing increased 18-fluorodeoxyglucose activity in bilateral breast and axillae were detected. Myeloid sarcoma was found as a result of tru-cut biopsy from these lesions. A fungal cystic lesion was detected in the frontal region of the patient who developed altered consciousness after the second cycle of treatment of myeloid sarcoma. During her follow-up in the intensive care unit, she died of cranial septic embolism and acute infarction. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we present a very interesting case that is the first. A staged approach to diagnosis with methods including immunohistochemical staining, radiological imaging methods, and cytogenetic and molecular analyses can help make the definitive diagnosis.","['Sozen, Mehmet', 'Vural, Cigdem', 'Selek, Alev', 'Kiraz, Umay', 'Canturk, Zeynep', 'Cetinarslan, Berrin', 'Gezer, Emre', 'Koksalan, Damla']","['Sozen M', 'Vural C', 'Selek A', 'Kiraz U', 'Canturk Z', 'Cetinarslan B', 'Gezer E', 'Koksalan D']","['Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kocaeli University Faculty of Medicine, Izmit, Kocaeli, Turkey. mehmetsozen07@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pathology, Kocaeli University Faculty of Medicine, Izmit, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kocaeli University Faculty of Medicine, Izmit, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'Department of Pathology, Kocaeli University Faculty of Medicine, Izmit, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kocaeli University Faculty of Medicine, Izmit, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kocaeli University Faculty of Medicine, Izmit, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kocaeli University Faculty of Medicine, Izmit, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kocaeli University Faculty of Medicine, Izmit, Kocaeli, Turkey.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8428-1115', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9405-9112', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0646-8697', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6721-4877', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7114-2565', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8041-8161', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5340-6106', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6349-2976']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20210729,England,World J Surg Oncol,World journal of surgical oncology,101170544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Prognosis', 'Thyroid Cancer, Papillary/surgery', '*Thyroid Neoplasms/surgery']",PMC8323301,['NOTNLM'],"['Breast', 'Myeloid sarcoma', 'Papillary thyroid carcinoma', 'Thyroid']",2021/07/31 06:00,2021/08/03 06:00,['2021/07/30 05:36'],"['2021/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/30 05:36 [entrez]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12957-021-02341-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12957-021-02341-z [pii]']",epublish,World J Surg Oncol. 2021 Jul 29;19(1):225. doi: 10.1186/s12957-021-02341-z.,225,['(c) 2021.

Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have aimed to reduce the risk of relapse by means of post-transplant maintenance therapy. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs comparing the efficacy and safety of maintenance with observation or placebo in patients with AML after allogeneic HSCT. We searched Cochrane Library, PubMed and conference proceedings up to Febuary 2021. RESULTS: Our search yielded five trials including 736 patients. Maintenance therapy consisted of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in 3 studies (sorafenib 2 studies; midostaurin 1 study) and hypomethylating agents (HMAs) in 2 studies (decitabine and azacytidine 1 study each). Maintenance therapy was associated with an improved overall survival (OS), HR = 0.61 (95% CI 0.47-0.80). Subgroup analysis revealed advantage in OS with either TKI or HMA maintenance. Relapse free survival (RFS) was also improved in the maintenance arm compared with the control arm HR = 0.51(95% CI 0.40 - 0.66). There was no difference between the two arms in overall grade 3/4 adverse events or overall infections, in grade 3/4 infections, or in acute and chronic graft versus host disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis shows that post-transplant maintenance therapy in AML patients is effective in improving RFS and OS, with a satisfactory safety profile.","['Pasvolsky, Oren', 'Shimony, Shai', 'Yeshurun, Moshe', 'Shargian, Liat', 'Wolach, Ofir', 'Raanani, Pia', 'Gafter-Gvili, Anat', 'Gurion, Ronit']","['Pasvolsky O', 'Shimony S', 'Yeshurun M', 'Shargian L', 'Wolach O', 'Raanani P', 'Gafter-Gvili A', 'Gurion R']","['Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Hospital, Petach Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Hospital, Petach Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Hospital, Petach Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Hospital, Petach Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Hospital, Petach Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Hospital, Petach Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Hospital, Petach Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Medicine A, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Hospital, Petach Tikva, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Hospital, Petach Tikva, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9193-0059', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7245-9652', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6429-148X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8662-0707']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",20210730,England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,['9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)'],IM,"['*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Sorafenib']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant', 'maintenance', 'meta-analysis']",2021/07/31 06:00,2021/09/18 06:00,['2021/07/30 05:31'],"['2021/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/18 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/30 05:31 [entrez]']",['10.1080/0284186X.2021.1955969 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2021 Oct;60(10):1335-1341. doi: 10.1080/0284186X.2021.1955969.

TKI plus chemotherapy has strikingly increased response rates and depth of response, and facilitated allo-HSCT, which decreases relapse and improves survival eventually. Meanwhile, for those with older age or comorbidities at diagnosis, TKI in combination with reduced-intensity chemotherapy or chemotherapy-free strategy reduces treatment-related mortality, deferred intensive chemotherapy increases molecular responses and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allo-HSCT improves survival finally. Of note, according to minimal residual disease (MRD) and BCR/ABL1 kinase domain mutation screening, prophylactic or preemptive maintenance therapy with a sensitive TKI decreases relapse further. Regarding transplantation-related mortality and impaired quality of life related to complications of allo-HSCT, autologous-HSCT (auto-HSCT) among those with early and persistent molecular remission and the most potent TKI ponatinib plus intensive chemotherapy has exhibited non-inferior survival to allo-HSCT. Even so, risk-adapted strategy isn't available now. Lastly, outcomes of relapse after allo-HSCT are dismal due to TKIs exposure, and new therapeutic interventions combined with TKIs shed light on this thorny problem.","['Zhang, Yuanfeng', 'Feng, Sizhou']","['Zhang Y', 'Feng S']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China; Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital of Qingdao University, Yantai, 264000, Shandong Province, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Heping District, Tianjin, 300020, China.

MRD of bone marrow samples from 165 patients carrying the three major fusion transcripts, including 74 BCR-ABL1, 54 ETV6-RUNX1, and 37 TCF3-PBX1, was analyzed by using the two qPCR-based methods. The correlation coefficient of both methods was good for TCF3-PBX1 (R(2) = 0.8088) and BCR-ABL1 (R(2) = 0.8094) ALL and moderate for ETV6-RUNX1 (R(2) = 0.5972). The concordance was perfect for TCF3-PBX1 ALL (97.2%), substantially concordant for ETV6-RUNX1 ALL (87.1%), and only moderate for BCR-ABL1 ALL (70.6%). The discordant MRD, positive for only one method with a difference greater than one log, was found in 4 of 93 samples (4.3%) with ETV6-RUNX1, 31 of 245 samples (12.7%) with BCR-ABL1, and none of TCF3-PBX1 ALL. None of the eight non-transplanted patients with BCR-ABL1-MRD (+)/Ig/TCR-MRD (-) with a median follow-up time of 73.5 months had hematologic relapses. Our study showed an excellent MRD concordance between the two qPCR-based methods in TCF3-PBX1 ALL, whereas qPCR for Ig/TCR is more reliable in BCR-ABL1 ALL.","['Huang, Ying-Jung', 'Kuo, Ming-Chung', 'Jaing, Tang-Her', 'Liu, Hsi-Che', 'Yeh, Ting-Chi', 'Chen, Shih-Hsiang', 'Lin, Tung-Liang', 'Yang, Chao-Ping', 'Wang, Po-Nan', 'Sheen, Jiunn-Ming', 'Chang, Te-Kau', 'Chang, Chia-Hui', 'Hu, Shu-Fen', 'Huang, Ting-Yu', 'Wang, Shih-Chung', 'Wu, Kang-Hsi', 'Chiou, Shyh-Shin', 'Hsiao, Chih-Cheng', 'Shih, Lee-Yung']","['Huang YJ', 'Kuo MC', 'Jaing TH', 'Liu HC', 'Yeh TC', 'Chen SH', 'Lin TL', 'Yang CP', 'Wang PN', 'Sheen JM', 'Chang TK', 'Chang CH', 'Hu SF', 'Huang TY', 'Wang SC', 'Wu KH', 'Chiou SS', 'Hsiao CC', 'Shih LY']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan; College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', ""College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Children's Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan."", ""Department of Hematology-Oncology, Mackay Children's Hospital and Mackay Medical College, Taipei, Taiwan."", ""Department of Hematology-Oncology, Mackay Children's Hospital and Mackay Medical College, Taipei, Taiwan."", ""College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Children's Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan."", 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', ""Department of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Children's Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan."", 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Chiayi, Chiayi, Taiwan.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, China Medical University Children's Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan."", 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Changhua Christian Children's Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan; Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan; College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.

True human dendritic cells (DC) cannot be cultured or passaged as opposed to immortalized cell lines. Research in the fields of immunogenic responses and immunotolerance in DCs has increased over the last decade. Autophagy has gained interest in these fields as well, and has been researched extensively in many other cell types as well. Here we have studied the applicability of cell line-derived dendritic cell-like cells of six myeloid cell lines aimed at research focussed on autophagy. METHODS: Six myeloid leukaemia cell lines were differentiated towards cell line-derived dendritic cell-like cells (cd-DC) using GM-CSF, IL-4, Ionomycine and PMA: HL60, KG1, MM6, MV-4-11, THP1 and U937. Autophagy was modulated using Rapamycin, Bafilomycin A1 and 3MA. Cell lines were genotyped for autophagy-related SNPs using RFLP. Marker expression was determined with FACS analysis and cytokine profiles were determined using Human Cytometric Bead Assay. Antigen uptake was assessed using Fluoresbrite microspheres. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: All researched cell lines harboured SNPs in the autophagy pathways. MM6 and THP1 derived cd-DCs resembled monocyte-derived DCs (moDC) most closely in marker expression, cytokine profiles and autophagy response. The HL60 and U937 cell lines proved least suitable for autophagy-related dendritic cell research. CONCLUSION: The genetic background of cell lines should be taken into account upon studying (the effects of) autophagy in any cell line. Although none of the studied cell lines recapitulate the full spectrum of DC characteristics, MM6 and THP1 derived cd-DCs are most suitable for autophagy-related research in dendritic cells.","['Prins, Marileen M C', 'van Roest, Manon', 'Vermeulen, Jacqueline L M', 'Tjabringa, G Sandra', 'van de Graaf, Stan F J', 'Koelink, Pim J', 'Wildenberg, Manon E']","['Prins MMC', 'van Roest M', 'Vermeulen JLM', 'Tjabringa GS', 'van de Graaf SFJ', 'Koelink PJ', 'Wildenberg ME']","['Tytgat Institute for Liver and Intestinal Research, Amsterdam Gastroenterology Endocrinology Metabolism, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

Continuing nationwide efforts by conducting multicenter clinical trials have been carried out in Japan since the mid-1990s by introducing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in first remission, which led to a modest improvement in outcome of infants with KMT2A-r ALL. Because of the emerging evidence that HSCT does not benefit every infant with KMT2A-r ALL, the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group (JPLSG) trial MLL-10 introduced risk stratification using age and presence of CNS leukemia and introduced intensive chemotherapy including high-dose cytarabine in early consolidation; indication of HSCT was restricted to the patients with high-risk features. The trial resulted in excellent 3-year event-free survival of 66.2% (standard error [SE], 5.6%) and overall survival of 83.9% (SE, 4.3%) for 75 patients with KMT2A-r ALL recruited between 2011 and 2015. This Japanese experience and the results of the infant ALL trials worldwide suggest the importance of introducing effective therapy in the early phase of therapy, thus clearing minimal residual disease as rapidly as possible. However, further improvement in outcome is unlikely with conventional treatment approaches. Introduction of biology-driven novel agents and/or immunotherapies through international collaboration would be key solutions to overcome the disease.","['Tomizawa, Daisuke', 'Miyamura, Takako', 'Koh, Katsuyoshi', 'Ishii, Eiichi']","['Tomizawa D', 'Miyamura T', 'Koh K', 'Ishii E']","[""Division of Leukemia and Lymphoma, Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Toon, Japan.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1520-7007'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210729,Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['KMT2A', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'infant', 'international collaboration', 'minimal residual disease']",2021/07/30 06:00,2021/07/30 06:00,['2021/07/29 17:41'],"['2021/07/29 17:41 [entrez]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ped.14935 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Pediatr Int. 2021 Jul 29. doi: 10.1111/ped.14935.,,['This article is protected by copyright.

Our previous study shows that a new Rohitukine derivative IIIM-290 restricts the growth of pancreatic cancer in vivo and in vitro. In the present findings, we report the mechanism of cell death induced by IIIM-290 in MOLT-4 cells (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and its anticancer potential against various murine leukemic tumor models in vivo. We found that IIIM-290 induced apoptosis through upregulation of different apoptotic proteins like PUMA, BAX, cytochrome c, cleaved (active) caspase-3, and cleaved PARP in MOLT-4 cells. Moreover, IIIM-290 abated mitochondrial membrane potential, elevated calcium levels, reactive oxygen species, and arrested growth of MOLT-4 cells in the synthesis (S) phase of the cell cycle. Interestingly, the elevation in proapoptotic markers was p53 dependent-the silencing of p53 abrogated apoptosis (programmed cell death) triggered by IIIM-290 in MOLT-4 cells. Furthermore, IIIM-290 significantly enhanced the survival of animals with P388 and L1210 leukemia. Thus, our results put IIIM-290 as a potential candidate for the anticancer lead.","['Mintoo, Mubashir', 'Khan, Sameer', 'Wani, Abubakar', 'Malik, Sumera', 'Bhurta, Deendyal', 'Bharate, Sandip', 'Malik, Fayaz', 'Mondhe, Dilip']","['Mintoo M', 'Khan S', 'Wani A', 'Malik S', 'Bhurta D', 'Bharate S', 'Malik F', 'Mondhe D']","['Cancer Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India.', 'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India.', 'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India.', 'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India.', 'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India.', 'Medicinal Chemistry Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India.', 'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India.', 'Medicinal Chemistry Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India.', 'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India.', 'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India.', 'Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3024-2647'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210729,United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0', '(5,7-dihydroxy-2-methyl-8-(4-(3-hydroxy-1-methyl)-piperidinyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-', 'one)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Piperidines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*CDK-9', '*L1210', '*MOLT-4', '*P388', '*apoptosis']",2021/07/30 06:00,2021/09/28 06:00,['2021/07/29 17:39'],"['2021/05/31 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/29 17:39 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mc.23332 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2021 Oct;60(10):671-683. doi: 10.1002/mc.23332.

Recent studies suggest that female survivors of childhood leukemia or sarcoma treated without chest radiation are also at elevated early onset breast cancer risk. However, the potential clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of early breast cancer screening among these women are uncertain. METHODS: Using data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, we adapted two Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) breast cancer simulation models to reflect the elevated risks of breast cancer and competing mortality among leukemia and sarcoma survivors. Costs and utility weights were based on published studies and databases. Outcomes included breast cancer deaths averted, false-positive-screening results, benign biopsies, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: In the absence of screening, the lifetime risk of dying from breast cancer among survivors was 6.8% to 7.0% across models. Early initiation of annual mammography with MRI screening between ages 25 and 40 would avert 52.6% to 64.3% of breast cancer deaths. When costs and quality of life impacts were considered, screening starting at age 40 was the only strategy with an ICER below the $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained cost-effectiveness threshold ($27,680 to $44,380 per QALY gained across models). CONCLUSIONS: Among survivors of childhood leukemia or sarcoma, early initiation of breast cancer screening at age 40 may reduce breast cancer deaths by half and is cost-effective. These findings could help inform screening guidelines for survivors treated without chest radiation.","['Yeh, Jennifer M', 'Lowry, Kathryn P', 'Schechter, Clyde B', 'Diller, Lisa R', ""O'Brien, Grace"", 'Alagoz, Oguzhan', 'Armstrong, Gregory T', 'Hampton, John M', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Leisenring, Wendy', 'Liu, Qi', 'Mandelblatt, Jeanne S', 'Miglioretti, Diana L', 'Moskowitz, Chaya S', 'Nathan, Paul C', 'Neglia, Joseph P', 'Oeffinger, Kevin C', 'Trentham-Dietz, Amy', 'Stout, Natasha K']","['Yeh JM', 'Lowry KP', 'Schechter CB', 'Diller LR', ""O'Brien G"", 'Alagoz O', 'Armstrong GT', 'Hampton JM', 'Hudson MM', 'Leisenring W', 'Liu Q', 'Mandelblatt JS', 'Miglioretti DL', 'Moskowitz CS', 'Nathan PC', 'Neglia JP', 'Oeffinger KC', 'Trentham-Dietz A', 'Stout NK']","[""Division of General Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'University of Washington, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Family and Social Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', ""Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, MA."", ""Division of General Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Department of Population Health Sciences and Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University, Washington, DC.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Davis, CA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, NY, NY.', 'The Hospital for Sick Children Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota Medical School.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, NC.', 'Department of Population Health Sciences and Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI.', 'Department of Population Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, Boston, MA.']",,['eng'],"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20210729,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,,,,,2021/07/30 06:00,2021/07/30 06:00,['2021/07/29 17:34'],"['2021/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/22 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/29 17:34 [entrez]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['6330765 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djab149 [doi]']",aheadofprint,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2021 Jul 29. pii: 6330765. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djab149.,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

The multicomponent reaction of salicylaldehydes, malononitrile and dialkyl phosphites catalyzed by pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDTA) provided the bicyclic derivatives in high yields. The method developed did not require chromatographic separation, since the products could be recovered from the reaction mixture by simple filtration. Our approach made also possible condensation with secondary phosphine oxides, and this reaction has not been previously reported in the literature. The crystal structures of five derivatives were studied by single-crystal XRD analysis.

Bacterial cultures may require a long incubation period and risk false-positive and false- negative results. Therefore, biomarkers distinguishing septic febrile neutropenia from other etiologies in acute leukemia patients play the important role in patient assessment and treatment planning. This study aims to determine the role of procalcitonin (PCT) and presepsin (PSPN) in infectious complication in comparison to C-reactive protein (CRP) on the first and third day at the onset of febrile neutropenia in patients with acute leukemia. METHODS: Between June 2018 and February 2019, 60 acute leukemia patients with febrile neutropenia receiving chemotherapy. The 41 acute myeloid leukemia patients and 19 acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients were recruited in this study. Their ages ranged from 14 to 65 years. PCT and PSPN were measured and were compared to CRP at the onset of febrile neutropenia and after 48 hours. 20 patients had a fever of unknown origin (FUO) and 40 patients had a bacterial infection. FINDINGS: Our results showed that the values of these markers were higher in patients with infection than patients without. The area under the curve (AUC) of PCT were 0.931 and 0.813 on day one and three respectively, which was the best in determination of infection. The cut-off values of PCT were 1.27 and 1.23 ng/mL and the cut off values of PSPN were 1.75 and 2.9 mug/L in the successive days, their clinical sensitivities were high. PCT and PSPN were capable of distinguishing the cause of febrile neutropenia from the onset of infection and predicting its complications (p<0.05). The PSPN level couldn't differentiate gram-positive or gram-negative bacterial infection. Significant differences were found between the mean values of the PSPN during the successive days in all patients and patients with bacteremia. This study illustrated a weak positive correlation between PCT and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, the negligible correlation between CRP and SOFA score and no significant correlation between PSPN and SOFA score. INTERPRETATION: PCT is an accurate biomarker in identifying infection in acute leukemia patients, its concentration is associated with the severity of bacterial sepsis. PSPN is superior to PCT for follow-up of patients.","['Moustafa, Rania', 'Albouni, Taissir', 'Aziz, Ghassan']","['Moustafa R', 'Albouni T', 'Aziz G']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Damascus University, Damascus, Syria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Damascus University, Damascus, Syria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine (Hematology), Faculty of Medicine, Damascus University, Damascus, Syria.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7808-6754'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210729,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (Procalcitonin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Febrile Neutropenia', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Procalcitonin', 'ROC Curve', 'Young Adult']",PMC8321513,,,2021/07/30 06:00,2021/11/04 06:00,['2021/07/29 17:25'],"['2020/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/29 17:25 [entrez]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0253842 [doi]', 'PONE-D-20-15039 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2021 Jul 29;16(7):e0253842. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0253842. eCollection 2021.,e0253842,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim was to assess donor-derived anti-CD7 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell safety and efficacy in patients with r/r T-ALL. METHODS: In this single-center, phase I trial, we administered anti-CD7 CAR T cells, manufactured from either previous stem-cell transplantation donors or new donors, to patients with r/r T-ALL, in single infusions at doses of 5 x 10(5) or 1 x 10(6) (+/-30%) cells per kilogram of body weight. The primary end point was safety with efficacy secondary. RESULTS: Twenty participants received infusions. Adverse events including cytokine release syndrome grade 1-2 occurred in 90% (n = 18) and grade 3-4 in 10% (n = 2), cytopenia grade 3-4 in 100% (n = 20), neurotoxicity grade 1-2 in 15% (n = 3), graft-versus-host disease grade 1-2 in 60% (n = 12), and viral activation grade 1-2 in 20% (n = 4). All adverse events were reversible, except in one patient who died through pulmonary hemorrhage related to fungal pneumonia, which occurred at 5.5 months, postinfusion. Ninety percent (n = 18) achieved complete remission with seven patients proceeding to stem-cell transplantation. At a median follow-up of 6.3 months (range, 4.0-9.2), 15 remained in remission. CAR T cells were still detectable in five of five patients assessed in month 6, postinfusion. Although patients' CD7-positive normal T cells were depleted, CD7-negative T cells expanded and likely alleviated treatment-related T-cell immunodeficiency. CONCLUSION: Among 20 patients with r/r T-ALL enrolled in this trial, donor-derived CD7 CAR T cells exhibited efficient expansion and achieved a high complete remission rate with manageable safety profile. A multicenter, phase II trial of donor-derived CD7 CAR T cells is in progress (NCT04689659).","['Pan, Jing', 'Tan, Yue', 'Wang, Guoling', 'Deng, Biping', 'Ling, Zhuojun', 'Song, Weiliang', 'Seery, Samuel', 'Zhang, Yanlei', 'Peng, Shuixiu', 'Xu, Jinlong', 'Duan, Jiajia', 'Wang, Zelin', 'Yu, Xinjian', 'Zheng, Qinlong', 'Xu, Xiuwen', 'Yuan, Ying', 'Yan, Fangrong', 'Tian, Zhenglong', 'Tang, Kaiting', 'Zhang, Jiecheng', 'Chang, Alex H', 'Feng, Xiaoming']","['Pan J', 'Tan Y', 'Wang G', 'Deng B', 'Ling Z', 'Song W', 'Seery S', 'Zhang Y', 'Peng S', 'Xu J', 'Duan J', 'Wang Z', 'Yu X', 'Zheng Q', 'Xu X', 'Yuan Y', 'Yan F', 'Tian Z', 'Tang K', 'Zhang J', 'Chang AH', 'Feng X']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Boren Clinical Translational Center, Department of Hematology, Beijing Boren Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin China.', 'Cytology Laboratory, Beijing Boren Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Beijing Boren Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Beijing Boren Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Faculty of Health and Medicine, Division of Health Research, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom.', 'Shanghai YaKe Biotechnology Ltd, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai YaKe Biotechnology Ltd, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Beijing Boren Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Beijing Boren Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Beijing Boren Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Medical Laboratory, Beijing Boren Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Medical Laboratory, Beijing Boren Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Medical Laboratory, Beijing Boren Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, TX.', 'Research Center of Biostatistics and Computational Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Longmian Avenue, Nanjing, China.', 'Gobroad Research Center, Gobroad Medical Group, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Beijing Boren Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hospital Management, Gobroad Medical Group, Beijing, China.', 'Shanghai YaKe Biotechnology Ltd, Shanghai, China.', 'Clinical Translational Research Center, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin China.', 'Central Laboratory, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8785-0336', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8277-1076', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7658-7691', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3163-480X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3347-5021', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4671-6587']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210729,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD7/*immunology', 'Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokine Release Syndrome/etiology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/etiology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/etiology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphopenia/etiology', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/etiology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*immunology', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*transplantation', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Virus Activation', 'Young Adult']",,,,2021/07/30 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/07/29 17:18'],"['2021/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/29 17:18 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.21.00389 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2021 Oct 20;39(30):3340-3351. doi: 10.1200/JCO.21.00389.

To identify novel FAK inhibitors, we designed and synthesized various thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine derivatives. An intensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) study led to the identification of 26 as a lead. Moreover, 26, a multitargeted kinase inhibitor, possesses excellent potencies against FLT3 mutants as well as FAK. Gratifyingly, 26 remarkably inhibits recalcitrant FLT3 mutants, including F691L, that cause drug resistance. Importantly, 26 is superior to PF-562271 in terms of apoptosis induction, anchorage-independent growth inhibition, and tumor burden reduction in the MDA-MB-231 xenograft mouse model. Also, 26 causes regression of tumor growth in the MV4-11 xenograft mouse model, indicating that it could be effective against acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Finally, in an orthotopic mouse model using MDA-MB-231, 26 remarkably prevents metastasis of orthotopic tumors to lymph nodes. Taken together, the results indicate that 26 possesses potential therapeutic value against highly invasive cancers and relapsed AML.","['Cho, Hanna', 'Shin, Injae', 'Yoon, Hojong', 'Jeon, Eunhye',

These two isoforms showed distinct differences in clinical manifestation, treatment effect, and prognosis risk. Herein, a strategy based on nanocluster beacon (NCB) fluorescence was developed to identify the e13a2 and e14a2 isoforms in one-pot. Because the fluorescence of AgNCs can be activated when they are placed in proximity to the corresponding enhancer sequences, thymine-rich (T-rich) or guanine-rich (G-rich). In this work, we explored an ideal DNA-AgNCs template as an excellent molecular reporter with a high signal-to-noise ratio. After recognition with the corresponding isoforms, the AgNCs can be pulled closer to the T-rich or G-rich sequences to form a three-way junction structure and generate fluorescence with corresponding wavelengths. Therefore, by distinguishing the corresponding wavelengths of AgNCs, we successfully identified two isoforms in one tube with the limitation of 16 pM for e13a2 and 9 pM for e14a2. Moreover, this strategy also realized isoform identification in leukemia cells and newly diagnosed CML patients within 40 min, which provides a powerful tool to distinguish fusion gene subtypes at the same time.","['Gou, Xiaolong', 'Xu, Lulu', 'Yang, Suqing', 'Cheng, Xiaoxue', 'Wu, Haiping', 'Zhang, Decai', 'Shi, Weicheng', 'Ding, Shijia', 'Zhang, Yuhong', 'Cheng, Wei']","['Gou X', 'Xu L', 'Yang S', 'Cheng X', 'Wu H', 'Zhang D', 'Shi W', 'Ding S', 'Zhang Y', 'Cheng W']","['The Center for Clinical Molecular Medical Detection, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'The Center for Clinical Molecular Medical Detection, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'The Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Jinan 250021, Shandong, China.', 'Chongqing Testing & Lnspection Center for Medical Devices, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'The Center for Clinical Molecular Medical Detection, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics (Ministry of Education), College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'The Center for Clinical Molecular Medical Detection, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'The Center for Clinical Molecular Medical Detection, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics (Ministry of Education), College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'The Center for Clinical Molecular Medical Detection, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'The Center for Clinical Molecular Medical Detection, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9183-1656', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1921-9761']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210729,United States,ACS Sens,ACS sensors,101669031,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*AgNCs', '*BCR/ABLp210 fusion gene', '*biosensor', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*fluorescence assay']",2021/07/30 06:00,2021/09/07 06:00,['2021/07/29 17:15'],"['2021/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/29 17:15 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acssensors.1c00695 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Sens. 2021 Aug 27;6(8):2928-2937. doi: 10.1021/acssensors.1c00695.

Previously, attempts to use ATRA in non-APML in the clinic, however, have been underwhelming, likely due to persistent signaling through other oncogenic drivers. Dysregulated JAK/STAT signaling is known to drive several hematologic malignancies, and targeting JAK1 and JAK2 with the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib has led to improvement in survival in primary myelofibrosis and alleviation of vasomotor symptoms and splenomegaly in polycythemia vera and myelofibrosis. OBJECTIVE: While dose-dependent anemia and thrombocytopenia limit the use of JAK2 inhibition, selectively targeting JAK1 has been explored as a means to suppress inflammation and STAT-associated pathologies related to neoplastogenesis. The objective of this study is to employ JAK1 inhibition (JAK1i) in the presence of ATRA as a potential therapy in non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Efficacy of JAK1i using INCB52793 was assessed by changes in cell cycle and apoptosis in treated AML cell lines. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis evaluated effects of JAK1i. Synergy between JAK1i+ ATRA was assessed in cell lines in vitro while efficacy in vivo was assessed by tumor reduction in MV-4-11 cell line-derived xenografts. RESULTS: Here we describe novel synergistic activity between JAK1i inhibition and ATRA in non-M3 leukemia. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis confirmed structural and functional changes related to maturation while in vivo combinatory studies revealed significant decreases in leukemic expansion. CONCLUSIONS: JAK1i+ ATRA lead to decreases in cell cycle followed by myeloid differentiation and cell death in human leukemias. These findings highlight potential uses of ATRA-based differentiation therapy of non-M3 human leukemia.","['Ramsey, Haley E', 'Stengel, Kristy', 'Pino, James C', 'Johnston, Gretchen', 'Childress,

Intussusception as a complication in leukemia, although described, is exceedingly rare. Also, it is usually seen after chemotherapy and not as a part of the native disease process. This case report aims to highlight such a rare association which warrants clinical and pathological attention. CASE PRESENTATION: A 14 year old male presented with an acute abdomen. Initial routine investigations revealed a deranged blood picture. On further examination of bone marrow aspirate, biopsy and detailed immunohistochemical studies a diagnosis of B-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL) was made. Concurrent ultrasound of the abdomen to find a cause for severe abdominal pain revealed an Ileo-colic intussusception. The patient was started on steroids; however he succumbed to his illness after two days, before surgery could be attempted. CONCLUSION: Rare presentations of relatively common diseases are a hurdle for timely and effective medical intervention. Although a rare condition in itself in leukemic patients, the occurrence of Intussusception in this particular patient, especially when no chemotherapy was initiated, is a very rare event. This case report was made to add to the relatively scarce literature available on this particular association. As it is a surgically treatable condition and since delay in diagnosis may lead to poorer prognosis, possibility of co-existence of ALL and intussusception should be borne in mind by all treating physicians and hematopathologists for effective patient care.","['Majumder, Ankur', 'Misra, Sunayana', 'Kumar, Vijay', 'Arora, Shilpa Khanna']","['Majumder A', 'Misra S', 'Kumar V', 'Arora SK']","['Department of Pathology, ABVIMS & Dr. RML Hospital, 110001, New Delhi, India. drankurmajumder@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pathology, ABVIMS & Dr. RML Hospital, 110001, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Pathology, ABVIMS & Dr. RML Hospital, 110001, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, ABVIMS & Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi, India.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1869-5416'],['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20210729,England,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst,Journal of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute,9424566,,IM,"['Biopsy', 'Child', 'Humans', '*Intussusception/diagnosis/etiology', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Ultrasonography']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Gastrointestinal Complications', 'Hematopathology', 'Intussusception', 'Surgery']",2021/07/30 06:00,2021/08/19 06:00,['2021/07/29 12:29'],"['2021/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/29 12:29 [entrez]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s43046-021-00079-z [doi]', '10.1186/s43046-021-00079-z [pii]']",epublish,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst. 2021 Jul 29;33(1):18. doi: 10.1186/s43046-021-00079-z.,18,['(c) 2021.

The application of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy to patients with AML has been limited, in particular by the lack of a tumor-specific target antigen. CD70 is a promising antigen to target AML, as it is expressed on most leukemic blasts, whereas little or no expression is detectable in normal bone marrow samples. To target CD70 on AML cells, we generated a panel of CD70-CAR T cells that contained a common single-chain variable fragment (scFv) for antigen detection, but differed in size and flexibility of the extracellular spacer and in the transmembrane and the costimulatory domains. These CD70scFv CAR T cells were compared with a CAR construct that contained human CD27, the ligand of CD70 fused to the CD3zeta chain (CD27z). The structural composition of the CAR strongly influenced expression levels, viability, expansion, and cytotoxic capacities of CD70scFv-based CAR T cells, but CD27z-CAR T cells demonstrated superior proliferation and antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo, compared with all CD70scFv-CAR T cells. Although CD70-CAR T cells recognized activated virus-specific T cells (VSTs) that expressed CD70, they did not prevent colony formation by normal hematopoietic stem cells. Thus, CD70-targeted immunotherapy is a promising new treatment strategy for patients with CD70-positive AML that does not affect normal hematopoiesis but will require monitoring of virus-specific T-cell responses.","['Sauer, Tim', 'Parikh, Kathan', 'Sharma, Sandhya', 'Omer, Bilal', 'Sedloev, David', 'Chen, Qian', 'Angenendt, Linus', 'Schliemann, Christoph', 'Schmitt, Michael', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Gottschalk, Stephen', 'Rooney, Cliona M']","['Sauer T', 'Parikh K', 'Sharma S', 'Omer B', 'Sedloev D', 'Chen Q', 'Angenendt L', 'Schliemann C', 'Schmitt M', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Gottschalk S', 'Rooney CM']","[""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital-Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', ""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital-Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", ""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital-Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", ""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital-Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX."", 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine A, University Hospital of Muenster, Muenster, Germany; and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine A, University Hospital of Muenster, Muenster, Germany; and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', ""Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston Methodist Hospital-Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX.""]","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5412-324X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1479-5305', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2502-9910', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3991-7468']",['eng'],"['P01 CA094237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA126752/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD27 Ligand)', '0 (CD70 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)']",IM,"['CD27 Ligand/*immunology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*immunology', 'Single-Chain Antibodies/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'THP-1 Cells']",PMC8323977,,,2021/07/30 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/07/29 12:25'],"['2020/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/07/29 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/07/29 12:25 [entrez]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(21)00641-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020008221 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2021 Jul 29;138(4):318-330. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020008221.,318-330,['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,['2022/07/29 00:00'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though there are several treatment regimens available in the clinics against this disease, a perfect chemotherapeutic agent for the same is still under investigation. Natural plant-derived secondary metabolites are used in clinics to treat leukemia for better benefits with reduced side-effects. Likely, several bioactive compounds from Callistemon sp. were reported for their bioactive benefits. Furthermore, acylphloroglucinol derivatives from Callistemon salignus, showed both antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities in various adherent human cancer cell lines. Thus, in the present study, a natural acylphloroglucinol (2,6-dihydroxy-4-methoxyisobutyrophenone, L72) was tested for its antiproliferative efficacy in HEL cells. The MTT and the cell cycle analysis study revealed that L72 treatment can offer antiproliferative effects, both time and dose-dependent manner, causing G2/M cell cycle arrest. The western blot analysis revealed that L72 treatment triggered intrinsic apoptotic machinery and activated p21. Likewise, L72 could downregulate the gene expressions of XIAP, FLT3, IDH2, and SOD2, which was demonstrated by qPCR analysis, thus promoting its antiproliferative action. The L72 could impede STAT3 expression, which was evidenced by insilico autodock analysis and western blot analysis using STAT3 inhibitor, Pimozide. The treatment of transgenic (Flk-1+/egfr+) zebrafish embryos resulted in the STAT3 gene inhibition, proving its anti-angiogenic effect, as well. Thus, the study revealed that L72 could act as an antiproliferative agent, by triggering caspase-dependent intrinsic apoptosis, reducing cell proliferation by attenuating STAT3, and activating an anti-angiogenic pathway via Flk-1inhibition.","['Hu, Mi', 'Varier, Krishnapriya M', 'Li, Zhicao', 'Qin, Xujie', 'Rao, Qing', 'Song, Jingrui', 'Hu, Anling', 'Hang, Yubing', 'Yuan, Chunmao', 'Gajendran, Babu', 'Shu, Liping', 'Wen, Min', 'Li, Yanmei', 'Liu, Haiyang']","['Hu M', 'Varier KM', 'Li Z', 'Qin X', 'Rao Q', 'Song J', 'Hu A', 'Hang Y', 'Yuan C', 'Gajendran B', 'Shu L', 'Wen M', 'Li Y', 'Liu H']","['State Key Laboratory for Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants/Department of Immunology, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, PR China; The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academic of Sciences, Guiyang 550014, PR China; Key Laboratory of Regenerative Medicine of Guizhou Province, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants/Department of Immunology, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, PR China; The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academic of Sciences, Guiyang 550014, PR China; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550025, Guizhou, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Medicine of Guizhou Province, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Phytochemistry and Plant Resources in West China, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650204, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants/Department of Immunology, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, PR China; The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academic of Sciences, Guiyang 550014, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants/Department of Immunology, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, PR China; The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academic of Sciences, Guiyang 550014, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants/Department of Immunology, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, PR China; The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academic of Sciences, Guiyang 550014, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants/Department of Immunology, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, PR China; The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academic of Sciences, Guiyang 550014, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants/Department of Immunology, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, PR China; The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academic of Sciences, Guiyang 550014, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants/Department of Immunology, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, PR China; The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academic of Sciences, Guiyang 550014, PR China; School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550025, Guizhou, PR China.

Herein, the leishmanicidal and cytotoxicity evaluation of 16 2-arylidene indan-1,3-diones is described. The compounds were evaluated against the leukemia cell lines HL60 and Nalm6, and the most effective ones were 2-(4-nitrobenzylidene)-1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione (4) and 4-[(1,3-dioxo-1H-inden-2(3H)-ylidene)methyl]benzonitrile (10), presenting IC50 values of around 30 micromol/L against Nalm6. The leishmanicidal activity was assessed on Leishmania amazonensis, with derivative 4 (IC50 = 16.6 micromol/L) being the most active. A four-dimensional quantitative structure-activity analysis (4D-QSAR) was applied to the indandione derivatives, through partial least-squares regression. The statistics presented by the regression models built with the selected field descriptors of Coulomb (C) and Lennard-Jones (L) nature, considering the activities against L. amazonensis, HL60, and Nalm6 leukemia cells, were, respectively, R(2) = 0.88, 0.92, and 0.98; Q(2) = 0.83, 0.88, and 0.97. The presence of positive Coulomb descriptors near the carbonyl groups indicates that these polar groups are related to the activities. Besides, the presence of positive Lennard-Jones descriptors close to substituents R(3) or R(1) indicates that bulky nonpolar substituents in these positions tend to increase the activities. This study provides useful insights into the mode of action of indandione derivatives for each biological activity involved.","['de Souza, Ana P M', 'Costa, Maria C A', 'de Aguiar, Alex R', 'Bressan, Gustavo C', 'de Almeida Lima, Graziela D', 'Lima, Wallace P', 'Borsodi, Maria P G', 'Bergmann, Bartira R', 'Ferreira, Marcia M C', 'Teixeira, Robson R']","['de Souza APM', 'Costa MCA', 'de Aguiar AR', 'Bressan GC', 'de Almeida Lima GD', 'Lima WP', 'Borsodi MPG', 'Bergmann BR', 'Ferreira MMC', 'Teixeira RR']","['Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Brazil.', 'Theoretical and Applied Chemometrics Laboratory (LQTA), Institute of Chemistry, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Brazil.', 'Escola de Ciencias da Saude, Universidade do Grande Rio, Duque de Caxias, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica e Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Brazil.', 'Escola de Ciencias da Saude, Universidade do Grande Rio, Duque de Caxias, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Biofisica Carlos Chagas Filho, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Biofisica Carlos Chagas Filho, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Biofisica Carlos Chagas Filho, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Theoretical and Applied Chemometrics Laboratory (LQTA), Institute of Chemistry, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Brazil.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3181-1108'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210729,Germany,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Archiv der Pharmazie,0330167,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['2-arylidene indan-1,3-diones', '4D-QSAR', 'cytotoxic activity', 'indan-1,3-dione', 'leishmanicidal activity']",2021/07/30 06:00,2021/07/30 06:00,['2021/07/29 08:49'],"['2021/06/23 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/29 08:49 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ardp.202100081 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pharm (Weinheim). 2021 Oct;354(10):e2100081. doi: 10.1002/ardp.202100081.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of crocin on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. Forty rats were randomly divided into four groups: (a) control [received normal saline as a dose of 1 ml/kg by intraperitoneal injection (ip) for 15 days], (b) crocin (received crocin as a dose of 40 mg/kg/24h by ip for 15 days), (c) DOX (received DOX as a dose of 2 mg/kg/48h by ip in six injection, cumulative dose 12 mg/kg), and (d) DOX+crocin (received DOX as a dose of 2 mg/kg/48h by ip in six injection, and crocin as a dose of 40 mg/kg/24h i.p for 15 days). As compared to the controls, the results showed that DOX administration caused significant increases in lipid indices [triglyseride (TG), low-dencity lipoproteins (LDL) (p<0.001), and very low-dencity lipoproteins (VLDL) (p<0.005)], oxidative stress parameters [malondialdehyde (MDA) and total oxidant status (TOS) (p<0.001)] and cardiac markers [creatine kinase-muscle/brain (CK-MB) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) (p<0.001)]. Besides, significant decreases in antioxidant defense systems [glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and total antioxidant status (TAS) (p<0.001)] were observed. The present study also demonstrated that co-administration of crocin with DOX significantly ameliorated the lipid profile (p<0.005), cardiac markers (p<0.005), and oxidative stress indices (p<0.001) as compared to DOX group. Histopathologically, significant increase in the mean histopathological damage score (MHDS) was found in the DOX group as compared to the controls (p<0.001). In contrast, the administration of crocin with DOX alleviated MHDS in myocardium (p<0.001). Taken together, our results reveal that crocin might be a cardioprotective agent in DOX-treated patients for cancer.","['Abdulkareem Aljumaily, Sara Asaad', 'Demir, Mehmet', 'Elbe, Hulya', 'Yigitturk, Gurkan', 'Bicer, Yasemin', 'Altinoz, Eyup']","['Abdulkareem Aljumaily SA', 'Demir M', 'Elbe H', 'Yigitturk G', 'Bicer Y', 'Altinoz E']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Karabuk University, Karabuk, Turkey.', 'Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Karabuk University, Karabuk, Turkey.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Mugla Sitki Kocman University, Mugla, Turkey.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Mugla Sitki Kocman University, Mugla, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Karabuk University, Karabuk, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Karabuk University, Karabuk, Turkey. eyupaltinoz@karabuk.edu.tr.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3991-9773'],['eng'],['TYL-2020-2298/karabuk universitesi'],['Journal Article'],20210728,Germany,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,Environmental science and pollution research international,9441769,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '36-88-4 (Carotenoids)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '877GWI46C2 (crocin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', '*Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Cardiotoxicity/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Carotenoids', '*Doxorubicin', 'Humans', 'Myocardium/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Rats']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Doxorubicin', 'apoptosis', 'crocin', 'myocardial toxicity', 'oxidative stress']",2021/07/30 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/07/29 07:00'],"['2021/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/29 07:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11356-021-15409-w [doi]', '10.1007/s11356-021-15409-w [pii]']",ppublish,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2021 Dec;28(46):65802-65813. doi: 10.1007/s11356-021-15409-w.

While patients with longer remission after initial alloSCT are recommended to receive cell therapy (CT) such as 2(nd)alloSCT or donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), survival for patients who relapse within 6 months of alloSCT has been dismal. We evaluated the outcomes of AML relapse after alloSCT to assess the impact of different treatments on long-term survival. One hundred and seventy-two patients with AML underwent alloSCT at the Penn State Cancer Institute from January 2014 to August 2019. Sixty-nine patients relapsed (median age, 60 years; range, 10-75). Of these, 4 patients underwent 2(nd)alloSCT, and 26 received DLI. One-year overall survival (OS) in all cases was 20.3% (95% CI: 11.8-30.4%). Patients with ECOG performance status (PS) 0-2 at relapse showed a better 1-year OS than those with PS 3-4. Median OS for patients who received chemotherapy only or chemotherapy with CT was 74 or 173.5 days, respectively (p < 0.001). Relapsed patients receiving conventional re-induction chemotherapy were categorized as the high-intensity chemotherapy (H) group, while those receiving treatments such as hypomethylating agents or targeted agents were categorized as the low-intensity chemotherapy (L) group. The H group showed a better 1-year OS compared with the L group. Patients who received H + CT showed a better 1-year OS of 52.9% than the other 3 groups (p < 0.001). Even for patients with post-alloSCT remission duration of less than 6 months, the statistical significance was preserved. Factors including age, donor source at 1(st)alloSCT, time to relapse, blast counts, PS at relapse, and treatment type after post-alloSCT relapse were used for a multivariate analysis, and matched or mismatched related donor and H + CT after alloSCT were identified as independent factors associated with OS. These findings support the use of H + CT as the treatment option of choice for AML patients who relapse after alloSCT when feasible.","['Shah, Neal', 'Rakszawski, Kevin', 'Nickolich, Myles', 'Ehmann, Christopher', 'Wirk, Baldeep', 'Naik, Seema', 'Rybka, Witold', 'Zheng, Hong', 'Mierski, Joseph', 'Silar, Brooke', 'Mackey, Gina', 'Greiner, Robert', 'Brown, Valerie', 'Claxton, David', 'Mineishi, Shin', 'Minagawa, Kentaro']","['Shah N', 'Rakszawski K', 'Nickolich M', 'Ehmann C', 'Wirk B', 'Naik S', 'Rybka W', 'Zheng H', 'Mierski J', 'Silar B', 'Mackey G', 'Greiner R', 'Brown V', 'Claxton D', 'Mineishi S', 'Minagawa K']","['Department of Medicine, Penn State Cancer Institute, 500 University Dr., Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Penn State Cancer Institute, 500 University Dr., Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Penn State Cancer Institute, 500 University Dr., Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Penn State Cancer Institute, 500 University Dr., Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Penn State Cancer Institute, 500 University Dr., Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Penn State Cancer Institute, 500 University Dr., Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Penn State Cancer Institute, 500 University Dr., Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Penn State Cancer Institute, 500 University Dr., Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Penn State Cancer Institute, 500 University Dr., Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Penn State Cancer Institute, 500 University Dr., Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Penn State Cancer Institute, 500 University Dr., Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', ""Penn State Children's Hospital, 500 University Dr., Hershey, PA, 17033, USA."", ""Penn State Children's Hospital, 500 University Dr., Hershey, PA, 17033, USA."", 'Department of Medicine, Penn State Cancer Institute, 500 University Dr., Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Penn State Cancer Institute, 500 University Dr., Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Penn State Cancer Institute, 500 University Dr., Hershey, PA, 17033, USA. kminagawa@pennstatehealth.psu.edu.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1740-7109'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210729,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Donor lymphocyte infusion', 'High-intensity chemotherapy', 'Relapse after allogeneic transplant']",2021/07/30 06:00,2021/09/25 06:00,['2021/07/29 06:59'],"['2021/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/29 06:59 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-021-04616-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-021-04616-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2021 Oct;100(10):2585-2592. doi: 10.1007/s00277-021-04616-7.

Herein, we assess the benefit of venetoclax plus low-dose cytarabine in the Japanese subgroup of VIALE-C patients (n = 27). METHODS: VIALE-C, a randomized (2:1), double-blind study (NCT03069352), enrolled untreated patients (>/=18 years) with acute myeloid leukaemia. Patients received venetoclax (600 mg days 1-28, 4-day ramp-up in cycle 1) or placebo in 28-day cycles with low-dose cytarabine (20 mg/m2 days 1-10). The primary endpoint was median overall survival. RESULTS: In the Japanese subgroup, at a 6-month follow-up from the primary analysis, median overall survival for venetoclax (n = 18) and placebo (n = 9), plus low-dose cytarabine, was 4.7 and 8.1 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.928, 95% confidence intervals : 0.399, 2.156). The rate of complete remission plus complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery was higher with venetoclax plus low-dose cytarabine (44.4%) vs placebo plus low-dose cytarabine (11.1%). All patients experienced at least 1 adverse event. The most common grade >/=3 adverse events with venetoclax or placebo, plus low-dose cytarabine, were febrile neutropenia (50.0% vs 44.4%, respectively) and thrombocytopenia (27.8% vs 44.4%, respectively). Serious adverse events were reported in 50.0 and 33.3% of patients in the venetoclax and placebo, plus low-dose cytarabine arms, respectively; pneumonia was the most common (22.2% each). CONCLUSIONS: Limited survival benefit in the Japanese subgroup can be attributed to small patient numbers and to baseline imbalances observed between treatment arms, with more patients in the venetoclax plus low-dose cytarabine arm presenting poor prognostic factors. Venetoclax plus low-dose cytarabine was well tolerated in Japanese patients with acute myeloid leukaemia ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.","['Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'Yoshida, Chikashi', 'Usuki, Kensuke', 'Takada, Satoru', 'Matsumura, Itaru', 'Dobashi, Nobuaki', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Miyamoto, Toshihiro', 'Iida, Hiroatsu', 'Asou, Norio', 'Kuroda, Junya', 'Ichikawa, Satoshi', 'Komatsu, Norio', 'Mendes, Wellington', 'Honda, Hideyuki', 'Okubo, Sumiko', 'Kurokawa, Misaki', 'Jiang, Qi', 'Wei, Andrew', 'Ishizawa, Kenichi']","['Yamauchi T', 'Yoshida C', 'Usuki K', 'Takada S', 'Matsumura I', 'Dobashi N', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Miyamoto T', 'Iida H', 'Asou N', 'Kuroda J', 'Ichikawa S', 'Komatsu N', 'Mendes W', 'Honda H', 'Okubo S', 'Kurokawa M', 'Jiang Q', 'Wei A', 'Ishizawa K']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Fukui Hospital, Fukui, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization, Mito Medical Center, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, NTT Medical Center Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Leukemia Research Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Kindai University Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Clinical Oncology/Hematology, The Jikei University Daisan Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Saitama Medical University International Medical Center, Hidaka, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'AbbVie GK, Tokyo, Japan.', 'AbbVie GK, Osaka, Japan.', 'AbbVie GK, Tokyo, Japan.', 'AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, The Alfred Hospital and Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Third Internal Medicine, Yamagata University Hospital, Yamagata, Japan.']",,['eng'],['AbbVie and Genentech'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic', '*Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Japan', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Sulfonamides']",PMC8405845,['NOTNLM'],"['*Japan', '*VIALE-C', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*low-dose cytarabine', '*venetoclax']",2021/07/30 06:00,2021/11/25 06:00,['2021/07/29 06:56'],"['2021/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/29 06:56 [entrez]']","['6329815 [pii]', '10.1093/jjco/hyab112 [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 2021 Aug 30;51(9):1372-1382. doi: 10.1093/jjco/hyab112.,1372-1382,"['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

Yet, the mechanisms governing the transcription of Rag1 and Rag2 remain to be fully determined, particularly in thymocytes. Combining cDNA microarray and ChIP-seq analysis, we identify Rag1 and Rag2 as novel Notch1 transcriptional targets in acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells. We further demonstrate that Notch1 transcriptional complexes directly bind the Rag1 and Rag2 locus in not only T-ALL but also primary double negative (DN) T-cell progenitors. Specifically, dimeric Notch1 transcriptional complexes activate Rag1 and Rag2 through a novel cis-element bearing a sequence-paired site (SPS). In T-ALL and DN cells, dimerization-defective Notch1 causes compromised Rag1 and Rag2 expression; conversely, dimerization-competent Notch1 achieves optimal upregulation of both. Collectively, these results reveal Notch1 dimerization-mediated transcription as one of the mechanisms for activating Rag1 and Rag2 expression in both primary and transformed thymocytes. Our data suggest a new role of Notch1 dimerization in compelling efficient TCRbeta rearrangements in DN progenitors during T-cell development.","['Dong, Yang', 'Guo, Hao', 'Wang, Donghai', 'Tu, Rongfu', 'Qing, Guoliang', 'Liu, Hudan']","['Dong Y', 'Guo H', 'Wang D', 'Tu R', 'Qing G', 'Liu H']","['Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Frontier Science Center for Immunology and Metabolism, Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Frontier Science Center for Immunology and Metabolism, Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Frontier Science Center for Immunology and Metabolism, Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Frontier Science Center for Immunology and Metabolism, Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Frontier Science Center for Immunology and Metabolism, Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Frontier Science Center for Immunology and Metabolism, Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210712,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,PMC8311795,['NOTNLM'],"['Double negative thymocyte', 'Notch1 dimerization', 'Recombination activating genes', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'T-cell development']",2021/07/30 06:00,2021/07/30 06:01,['2021/07/29 06:52'],"['2021/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/29 06:52 [entrez]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.703338 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Jul 12;9:703338. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.703338. eCollection 2021.,703338,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Dong, Guo, Wang, Tu, Qing and Liu.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, there is an urgent need to develop unique therapeutic approaches to treat cancer with superior potency and efficacy. This study investigates a new approach to develop a potent combinational therapy to treat advanced stage leukemia. Biologically active alpha-amino amide analogs (RS)-N-(2-(cyclohexylamino)-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl)-N-phenylpropiolamide (alpha-AAA-A) and (RS)-N-(2-(cyclohexylamino)-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl)-N-phenylbut2-enamide (alpha-AAA-B) were synthesized using linear Ugi multicomponent reaction. Cytotoxicities and IC50 values of alpha-AAA-A and alpha-AAA-B against leukemia cancer cell lines (HL-60 and K562) were analyzed though MTT assay. Cytotoxic assay analyzed percent killing of leukemia cell lines due to the effect of gammadelta T cells alone or in combination with alpha-AAA-A or alpha-AAA-B. Synthesized biologically active molecule alpha-AAA-A exhibited increased cytotoxicity of HL-60 (54%) and K562 (44%) compared with alpha-AAA-B (44% and 36% respectively). Similarly, alpha-AAA-A showed low IC50 values for HL-60 (1.61 +/- 0.11 muM) and K562 (3.01 +/- 0.14 muM) compared to alpha-AAA-B (3.12 +/- 0.15 muM and 6.21 +/- 0.17 muM respectively). Additive effect of amide analogs and gammadelta T cells showed significantly high leukemia cancer cell killing as compared to gammadelta T cells alone. A unique combinational therapy with gammadelta T cells and biologically active anti-cancer molecules (alpha-AAA-A/B), concomitantly may be a promising cancer therapy.","['Otaibi, Ahmed Al', 'Sherwani, Subuhi', 'Al-Zahrani, Salma Ahmed', 'Alshammari, Eida Mohammed', 'Khan, Wahid Ali', 'Alsukaibi, Abdulmohsen Khalaf D', 'Khan, Shahper Nazeer', 'Khan, Mohd Wajid Ali']","['Otaibi AA', 'Sherwani S', 'Al-Zahrani SA', 'Alshammari EM', 'Khan WA', 'Alsukaibi AKD', 'Khan SN', 'Khan MWA']","[""Department of Chemistry, College of Sciences, University of Ha'il, Ha'il, Saudi Arabia."", ""Department of Biology, College of Sciences, University of Ha'il, Ha'il, Saudi Arabia."", ""Department of Chemistry, College of Sciences, University of Ha'il, Ha'il, Saudi Arabia."", ""Department of Chemistry, College of Sciences, University of Ha'il, Ha'il, Saudi Arabia."", 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, College of Medicine, King Khalid University, Abha, Saudi Arabia.', ""Department of Chemistry, College of Sciences, University of Ha'il, Ha'il, Saudi Arabia."", 'Interdisciplinary Nanotechnology Centre, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India.', ""Department of Chemistry, College of Sciences, University of Ha'il, Ha'il, Saudi Arabia."", ""Molecular Diagnostic and Personalised Therapeutics Unit, University of Ha'il, Ha'il, Saudi Arabia.""]",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210712,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC8311656,['NOTNLM'],"['biologically active molecules', 'cancer', 'combinational therapy', 'cytotoxicity', 'leukemia', 'gammadelta T cells']",2021/07/30 06:00,2021/07/30 06:01,['2021/07/29 06:51'],"['2021/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/29 06:51 [entrez]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.706586 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Jul 12;11:706586. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.706586. eCollection 2021.,706586,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Otaibi, Sherwani, Al-Zahrani, Alshammari, Khan, Alsukaibi,', 'Khan and Khan.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these prognostic factors, cytogenetic results are increasing in importance day by day. FLT3 mutations are among the most common molecular abnormalities in AML, patients with recurrent or refractory (R/R) AML with this mutation have a low response rate to salvage therapy. Gilteritinib has activity against FLT3, ALK and AXL. This article shall present two cases, for which Gilteritinib was used, a new FLT3 inhibitor, and the results of the treatment. Case 1: A 52-year-old female patient presented to the emergency clinic with weakness and fever. In initial biochemical analysis, leukocyte was 104000/mm(3). Peripheral smear contained diffuse myeloid blastoid cells, peripheral blood flow cytometry also supported the AML M0-1 phenotype. The bone marrow biopsy aspiration performed on the 14(th) day of induction ""3+7"" treatment, contained diffuse blastic infiltrate and supported refractory disease. In addition to the FLAG-IDA salvage regimen, 120 mg/day Gilteritinib was also started. Bone marrow aspiration performed on the 28(th) day of salvage therapy was compatible with remission. Case 2: 53 years old male patient with also no comorbidity other than known hypertension. In the initial biochemical analysis of the patient, leukocyte was 156000/mm(3), platelet 58000/mm(3) and hemoglobin 7.6 g/dl. Peripheral blood flow cytometry supported the AML M5 phenotype, whose peripheral smear showed diffuse monoblastoid cells. On the 14(th) day of the patient's 3+7 induction treatment, the control bone marrow aspiration showed diffuse blast infiltration and was considered refractory, FLAG-IDA salvage therapy with again 120 mg/day Gilteritinib per oral were started. On the 28(th) day, control bone marrow aspiration was evaluated as remission. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Unlike other FLT 3 inhibitors, Gilteritinib has been shown to be a highly effective agent in R/R AML with FLT3 mutations. Being the first data to be reported from Turkey, we think it would be quite guiding the titular.","['Serin, Istemi', 'Dogu, Mehmet Hilmi', 'Huq, Gulben Erdem', 'Yokus, Osman']","['Serin I', 'Dogu MH', 'Huq GE', 'Yokus O']","['Department of Hematology Istanbul, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Science Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Hematology, Liv Hospital Ulus, Istinye University Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pathology Istanbul, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Science Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology Istanbul, Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, University of Health Science Istanbul, Turkey.']",,['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210615,United States,Am J Blood Res,American journal of blood research,101569577,,,,PMC8303015,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'FLT3', 'gilteritinib', 'prognosis', 'refractory']",2021/07/30 06:00,2021/07/30 06:01,['2021/07/29 06:50'],"['2021/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/29 06:50 [entrez]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/30 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Blood Res. 2021 Jun 15;11(3):271-278. eCollection 2021.,271-278,['AJBR Copyright (c) 2021.'],,,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The typical features of T-LGL leukemia include an increased number of large granular lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, cytopenia (most commonly neutropenia), and mild-to-moderate splenomegaly. Up to 28% of patients with T-LGL leukemia have rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study reports ten atypical cases (seven women and three men, median age 60.5 years) of RA-associated T-LGL leukemia presenting with lymphopenia, severe neutropenia, and marked splenomegaly. The weight of the spleens ranged from 892 to 2100 g (median 1100 g). Bone marrow histology and differential counts of bone marrow aspirates revealed no peculiarities in nine of ten cases. The red pulp of the spleen was expanded and showed moderate to strong infiltration by medium-sized slightly pleomorphic lymphocytes in nine cases and subtle infiltration in one. Although lymphocytic infiltration involved both cords and sinusoids, it was more apparent within the splenic cords. The white pulp was preserved and contained prominent germinal centers in eight patients and was atrophic in two patients. Immunohistochemically, malignant lymphocytes were CD3+, CD43+, and CD4- in all cases and TIA-1+ in nine out of ten. TCRalphabeta positivity and TCRgammadelta positivity was observed in six and four cases out of ten, respectively. All ten patients had T cell clonality in the spleen tissue, but in three cases it was absent in both blood and bone marrow. STAT3 mutations in the spleen tissue were detected in three of ten cases. In all eight cases studied, neither isochromosome 7q nor trisomy 8 was detected in the spleen tissue. Cases of RA-associated T-LGL leukemia with low LGL count in the peripheral blood, neutropenia, and marked splenomegaly present a diagnostic challenge and can be misdiagnosed as Felty's syndrome or hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma.","['Gorodetskiy, Vadim', 'Probatova, Natalya', 'Sidorova, Yulia', 'Kupryshina, Natalia', 'Obukhova, Tatiana', 'Vasilyev, Vladimir', 'Ryzhikova, Natalya', 'Sudarikov, Andrey']","['Gorodetskiy V', 'Probatova N', 'Sidorova Y', 'Kupryshina N', 'Obukhova T', 'Vasilyev V', 'Ryzhikova N', 'Sudarikov A']","['Department of Intensive Methods of Therapy, V.

Here, we find that the RNA-binding protein IGF2BP3, which is overexpressed in MLL-translocated leukemia, strongly amplifies MLL-Af4-mediated leukemogenesis. Deletion of Igf2bp3 significantly increases the survival of mice with MLL-Af4-driven leukemia and greatly attenuates disease, with a minimal impact on baseline hematopoiesis. At the cellular level, MLL-Af4 leukemia-initiating cells require Igf2bp3 for their function in leukemogenesis. At the molecular level, IGF2BP3 regulates a complex posttranscriptional operon governing leukemia cell survival and proliferation. IGF2BP3-targeted mRNA transcripts include important MLL-Af4-induced genes, such as those in the Hoxa locus, and the Ras signaling pathway. Targeting of transcripts by IGF2BP3 regulates both steady-state mRNA levels and, unexpectedly, pre-mRNA splicing. Together, our findings show that IGF2BP3 represents an attractive therapeutic target in this disease, providing important insights into mechanisms of posttranscriptional regulation in leukemia.","['Tran, Tiffany M', 'Philipp, Julia', 'Bassi, Jaspal Singh', 'Nibber, Neha', 'Draper, Jolene M', 'Lin, Tasha L', 'Palanichamy, Jayanth Kumar', 'Jaiswal, Amit Kumar', 'Silva, Oscar', 'Paing, May', 'King, Jennifer', 'Katzman, Sol', 'Sanford, Jeremy R', 'Rao, Dinesh S']","['Tran TM', 'Philipp J', 'Bassi JS', 'Nibber N', 'Draper JM', 'Lin TL', 'Palanichamy JK', 'Jaiswal AK', 'Silva O', 'Paing M', 'King J', 'Katzman S', 'Sanford JR', 'Rao DS']","['Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA.', 'Molecular, Cellular, and Integrative Physiology Interdepartmental Ph.D. Program, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, UCSC, Santa Cruz, CA, 95064, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, UCSC, Santa Cruz, CA, 95064, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA.', 'Molecular Biology Interdepartmental Doctoral Program, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, 110029, India.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA.', 'Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA.', 'UCSC Genomics Institute, Santa Cruz, CA, 95064, USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, UCSC, Santa Cruz, CA, 95064, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA.

JARID2 is the only accessory subunit of PRC2 that known to trigger an allosteric activation of methyltransferase. Yet, this mechanism cannot be generalised to all PRC2 variants as, in vertebrates, JARID2 is mutually exclusive with most of the accessory subunits of PRC2. Here we provide functional and structural evidence that the vertebrate-specific PRC2 accessory subunit PALI1 emerged through a convergent evolution to mimic JARID2 at the molecular level. Mechanistically, PRC2 methylates PALI1 K1241, which then binds to the PRC2-regulatory subunit EED to allosterically activate PRC2. PALI1 K1241 is methylated in mouse and human cell lines and is essential for PALI1-induced allosteric activation of PRC2. High-resolution crystal structures revealed that PALI1 mimics the regulatory interactions formed between JARID2 and EED. Independently, PALI1 also facilitates DNA and nucleosome binding by PRC2. In acute myelogenous leukemia cells, overexpression of PALI1 leads to cell differentiation, with the phenotype altered by a separation-of-function PALI1 mutation, defective in allosteric activation and active in DNA binding. Collectively, we show that PALI1 facilitates catalysis and substrate binding by PRC2 and provide evidence that subunit-induced allosteric activation is a general property of holo-PRC2 complexes.","['Zhang, Qi', 'Agius, Samuel C', 'Flanigan, Sarena F', 'Uckelmann, Michael', 'Levina, Vitalina', 'Owen, Brady M', 'Davidovich, Chen']","['Zhang Q', 'Agius SC', 'Flanigan SF', 'Uckelmann M', 'Levina V', 'Owen BM', 'Davidovich C']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.

We compared age at cancer diagnosis for U.S. Hispanics, a population that is younger on average, and non-Hispanic whites (NHW), before and after adjustment for the age structure of the source population. METHODS: We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data from 18 U.S. regions in 2015 for 34 cancer sites to calculate crude and adjusted (using age- and sex-specific weights) mean ages at diagnosis. Differences in age at diagnosis comparing Hispanics to NHWs (delta) were assessed using independent sample t tests. RESULTS: Crude mean ages at diagnosis were lower among Hispanic males and females for all sites combined and for most cancer sites. After age-adjustment, Hispanic (vs. NHW) males remained younger on average at diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia [delta = -6.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), -8.1 to -4.1 years], testicular cancer (delta =-4.7; 95% CI, -5.4 to -4.0), Kaposi sarcoma (delta =-3.6; 95% CI,-6.3 to -0.8), mesothelioma (delta =-3.0; 95% CI,-4.3 to -1.7), and anal cancer (delta =-2.4; 95% CI, -3.9 to -0.8), and older at diagnosis of gallbladder cancer (delta = +3.8; 95% CI, 1.8 to 5.7) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (delta = +7.5; 95% CI, 5.7 to 9.4), and Hispanic (vs. NHW) females remained younger at diagnosis of mesothelioma (delta = -3.7; 95% CI, -6.7 to -0.7) and gallbladder cancer (delta = -3.0; 95% CI, -4.3 to -1.7) and older at diagnosis of skin cancer (delta = +3.8; 95% CI, 3.1 to 4.5), cervical cancer (delta = +4.1; 95% CI, 3.3 to 4.8), and Hodgkin's lymphoma (delta = +7.0; 95% CI, 5.0 to 9.1). CONCLUSIONS: On average, Hispanics are diagnosed with cancer at younger ages than NHWs; however, for many cancers these differences reflect the younger age structure in Hispanics. IMPACT: Population age structure should be considered when comparing age at cancer diagnosis across racial/ethnic groups.","['Parada, Humberto Jr', 'Vu, Andrew H', 'Pinheiro, Paulo S', 'Thompson, Caroline A']","['Parada H Jr', 'Vu AH', 'Pinheiro PS', 'Thompson CA']","['Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, San Diego State University, San Diego, California. hparada@sdsu.edu.', 'University of California, San Diego Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, California.', 'Department of Radiation Medicine and Applied Science, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, San Diego State University, San Diego, California.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, San Diego State University, San Diego, California.', 'University of California, San Diego Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, California.', 'The Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Longevity Science, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6562-8577', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8502-835X']",['eng'],"['KL2 TR001444/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA132379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 CA234317/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 MD012397/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AG059299/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA132384/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20210728,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,,PMC8492520,,,2021/07/30 06:00,2021/07/30 06:00,['2021/07/29 05:56'],"['2021/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/04/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/29 05:56 [entrez]']","['1055-9965.EPI-21-0389 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-21-0389 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2021 Oct;30(10):1904-1912. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-21-0389.

Ivosidenib is a once daily (QD), orally available, potent, mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (mIDH1) inhibitor approved for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and intensive chemotherapy-ineligible newly diagnosed AML, with a susceptible IDH1 mutation. We characterized the protein binding, metabolism, metabolites, cell permeability, and drug-drug interaction potential of ivosidenib in humans, monkeys, dogs, rats, and/or mice in in vitro experiments. In vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) profiling and assessment of drug distribution and excretion was undertaken in rats, dogs, and monkeys administered single-dose ivosidenib. The PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship between ivosidenib and 2-HG was analyzed in an mIDH1 xenograft mouse model. Ivosidenib was well absorbed, showed low clearance, and moderate to long terminal half-life (5.3-18.5 hours) in rats, dogs, and monkeys. Brain to plasma exposure ratio was low (2.3%), plasma protein binding was high, and oxidative metabolism was the major elimination pathway. Ivosidenib had high cell permeability and was identified as a substrate for P-glycoprotein. There was moderate induction of cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 but minimal P450 inhibition or autoinduction. Tumor 2-HG reduction appeared to be dose- and drug-exposure-dependent. Ivosidenib showed a favorable PK profile in several animal species, along with a clear PK/PD relationship demonstrating 2-HG inhibition that translated well to patients with AML. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Ivosidenib is a mutant IDH1 (mIDH1) inhibitor approved for the treatment of certain patients with mIDH1 acute myeloid leukemia. In Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys, ivosidenib demonstrated a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, and in female BALB/c mice showed clear dose- and exposure-dependent inhibition of the oncometabolite, d-2-hydroxyglutarate, which is present at abnormal levels in mIDH1 tumors. These findings led to the further development of ivosidenib and are consistent with data from patients with mIDH1 cancers and healthy participants.","['Chen, Yue', 'Nagaraja, Nelamangala V', 'Fan, Bin', 'Utley, Luke', 'Lemieux, Rene M', 'Popovici-Muller, Janeta', 'Dang, Lenny', 'Kim, Hyeryun', 'Yan, Liping', 'Su, Shin-San M', 'Biller, Scott A', 'Yang, Hua']","['Chen Y', 'Nagaraja NV', 'Fan B', 'Utley L', 'Lemieux RM', 'Popovici-Muller J', 'Dang L', 'Kim H', 'Yan L', 'Su SM', 'Biller SA', 'Yang H']","['Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts (Y.C., N.V.N., B.F., L.U., R.M.L., J.P.-M., L.D., H.K., S.-S.M.S., S.A.B., H.Y.);

In this study, we generated Idh2(R140Q) transgenic mice to examine the role of the Idh2(R140Q) mutation in leukemia. No leukemia developed in Idh2(R140Q) transgenic mice, suggesting a need for additional genetic events for leukemia development. Because myeloid cells from NUP98-HOXD13 fusion (NHD13) transgenic mice frequently acquire somatic Idh mutations when they transform to acute myeloid leukemia, we generated Idh2(R140Q)/NHD13 double transgenic mice. Idh2(R140Q)/NHD13 transgenic mice developed an immature T-cell leukemia with an immunophenotype similar to double-negative 1 (DN1) or DN2 thymocytes. Idh2(R140Q)/NHD13 leukemic cells were enriched for an early thymic precursor transcriptional signature, and the gene expression profile for Idh2(R140Q)/NHD13 DN1/DN2 T-ALL closely matched that of human early/immature T-cell precursor (EITP) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Moreover, recurrent mutations found in patients with EITP ALL, including KRAS, PTPN11, JAK3, SH2B3, and EZH2 were also found in Idh2(R140Q)/NHD13 DN1/DN2 T-ALL. In vitro treatment of Idh2(R140Q)/NHD13 thymocytes with enasidenib, a selective inhibitor of mutant IDH2, led to a marked decrease in leukemic cell proliferation. These findings demonstrate that Idh2(R140Q)/NHD13 mice can serve as a useful in vivo model for the study of early/immature thymocyte precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia development and therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: T-cell leukemia induced in Idh2(R140Q)/NUP98-HOXD13 mice is immunophenotypically, transcriptionally, and genetically similar to human EITP ALL, providing a model for studying disease development and treatment.","['Goldberg, Liat', 'Negi, Vijay', 'Chung, Yang Jo', 'Onozawa, Masahiro', 'Zhu, Yuelin J', 'Walker, Robert L', 'Pierce, Rachel', 'Patel, Daxesh P', 'Krausz, Kristopher W', 'Gonzalez, Frank J', 'Goodell, Margaret A', 'Rodriguez, Benjamin A T', 'Meltzer, Paul S', 'Aplan, Peter D']","['Goldberg L', 'Negi V', 'Chung YJ', 'Onozawa M', 'Zhu YJ', 'Walker RL', 'Pierce R', 'Patel DP', 'Krausz KW', 'Gonzalez FJ', 'Goodell MA', 'Rodriguez BAT', 'Meltzer PS', 'Aplan PD']","['Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Metabolism, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Metabolism, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Metabolism, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Valo Health, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland. aplanp@mail.nih.gov.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7990-2140', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1111-2932']",['eng'],"['Z01 BC010983/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 SC010378/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA BC010982/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA SC010378/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20210728,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NUP98-HOXA13 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'DNA Methylation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Heterografts', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Thymocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transcriptome']",PMC8487989,,,2021/07/30 06:00,2022/01/04 06:00,['2021/07/29 05:55'],"['2021/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/04/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/29 05:55 [entrez]']","['0008-5472.CAN-21-1027 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-21-1027 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2021 Oct 1;81(19):5033-5046. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-21-1027.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the dominant stromal cells in tumor microenvironment (TME), but their role in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains unclear. Here, RT-PCR and Western blotting in bone marrow mononuclear cells revealed higher proportions of CAFs markers alpha-SMA and FAP in the newly diagnosed and relapsed B-ALL patients. In vitro experiments, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) acquired a CAFs phenotype after co-culture with leukemia cells, which produced high level of tumor-promoting growth factors and reduced the daunorubicin (DNR)-induced damage to B-ALL cells. As for its mechanism, CAFs activation was mediated by TGF-beta up-regulation in the co-culture system, and TGF-beta triggered MSCs conversion into CAFs relying on the SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway. Further LY2109761 and AMD3100 effectively decreased the activation of CAFs through inhibiting TGF-beta receptor and CXCR4. Comparative experiments with MSCs and transformed CAFs prompted that CAFs had more obvious effect than MSCs on stimulating leukemia progression through accelerating leukemia cell migration and invasion. These results clarified the important role of CAFs in B-ALL progression and the possible mechanisms of CAFs activation in leukemia microenvironment, which might provide a theoretical basis for B-ALL patients to find more effective targeted therapies targeting the bone marrow microenvironment.","['Pan, Chengyun', 'Liu, Ping', 'Ma, Dan', 'Zhang, Siyu', 'Ni, Ming', 'Fang, Qin', 'Wang, Jishi']","['Pan C', 'Liu P', 'Ma D', 'Zhang S', 'Ni M', 'Fang Q', 'Wang J']","['Department of Haematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China; School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China; Hematological Institute of Guizhou Province, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China; Hematological Institute of Guizhou Province, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China; Hematological Institute of Guizhou Province, Guizhou, China; Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre and Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centre, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China; Hematological Institute of Guizhou Province, Guizhou, China; Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre and Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centre, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China; Hematological Institute of Guizhou Province, Guizhou, China; Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre and Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centre, Guizhou, China.

Increasing studies show that Hhex plays a significant role in development, including anterior-posterior axis formation, vascular development and HSCs self-renewal etc. Hhex is linked to many diseases such as cancers, leukemia, and type-2 diabetes. Although Hhex is reported to inhibit cell migration and invasion of breast and prostate epithelial cells by upregulating Endoglin expression, the effect and molecular mechanism for lung cancer cell motility regulation remains elusive. METHODS: Human non-small cell lung cancer cells and HEK293FT cells were used to investigate the molecular mechanism of Hhex regulating lung cancer cell migration by using Western blot, immunoprecipitation, wound-healing scratch assay, laser confocal. RESULTS: Our data indicated that Hhex could inhibit cell migration and cell protrusion formation in lung cancer cells. In addition, Hhex inhibited CFL1 phosphorylation to keep its F-actin-severing activity. RHOGDIA was involved in Hhex-induced CFL1 phosphorylation regulation. Hhex enhanced RHOGDIA interaction with RHOA/CDC42, thus maintaining RHOA/CDC42 at an inactive form. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these data indicate that Hhex inhibited the activation of RHOA/CDC42 by enhancing interaction of RHOGDIA with RHOA/CDC42, and then RHOA/ CDC42-p-CFL1 signaling pathway was blocked. Consequently, the formation of Filopodium and Lamellipodium on the cell surface was suppressed, and thus the ability of lung cancer cells to migrate was decreased accordingly. Our findings show Hhex plays an important role in regulating migration of lung cancer cells and may provide a potential target for lung cancer therapy.

Recently, a BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was introduced with a high efficacy of 95% in immunocompetent individuals. We investigated the safety and efficacy of BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in patients with CLL from nine medical centers in Israel, In total 400 patients were included, of which 373 were found to be eligible for the analysis of antibody response. The vaccine appeared to be safe and only grade 1-2 adverse events were seen in 50% of the patients. Following the second dose, antibody response was detected in 43% of the cohort. In treatment- naive patients 61% responded to the vaccine, while only 18%, 37% and 5% of patients with CLL ongoing, previously treated with BTKi, or recent anti CD20 antibody developed responses respectively. 62% and 14% of patients treated with BCL2 monotherapy or combined with anti CD20 developed immune response respectively. Neutralizing antibodies demonstrated high concordance with positive serologic response to spike (S) protein. Based on our results a simple scoring model including recent treatment with anti-CD20, age younger than 70 years, treatment naive status, and normal IGG, IGA, IGM and hemoglobin levels. The sum of all the above parameters can serve as a possible estimate to predict whether a given CLL patient will develop sufficient antibodies. In conclusion, the vaccine was found to be safe in patients with CLL, but its efficacy is limited particularly in treated patients.","['Benjamini, Ohad', 'Rokach, Lior', 'Itchaki, Gilad', 'Braester, Andrei', 'Shvidel, Lev', 'Goldschmidt, Neta', 'Shapira, Shirley', 'Dally, Najib', 'Avigdor, Abraham', 'Rahav, Galia', 'Lustig, Yaniv', 'Ben David, Shirley Shapiro', 'Fineman, Riva', 'Paz, Alona', 'Bairey, Osnat', 'Polliack, Aaron', 'Levy, Ilana', 'Tadmor, Tamar']","['Benjamini O', 'Rokach L', 'Itchaki G', 'Braester A', 'Shvidel L', 'Goldschmidt N', 'Shapira S', 'Dally N', 'Avigdor A', 'Rahav G', 'Lustig Y', 'Ben David SS', 'Fineman R', 'Paz A', 'Bairey O', 'Polliack A', 'Levy I', 'Tadmor T']","['Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.', 'Department of Software and Information Systems Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, Israel.', 'Hematology Institute, Kaplan Medical Center, Rehovot, Israel.', 'Hematology, Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Health Division, Maccabi Healthcare Services, Aviv.', 'Division of Hematology, Ziv Medical Center, Safed, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.', 'The Infectious Disease Unit, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel; Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.', 'Central Virology Laboratory, Ministry of Health and Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'Health Division, Maccabi Healthcare Services, Aviv.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Infectious Disease Unit, Bnai Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel; The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.', 'Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.', 'Hematology, Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Hematology Unit, Bnai Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel; Hematology Unit, Bnai Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.

However, an increase in novel targeted agents, which has been brought about in part by a deeper understanding of the genetic makeup of AML, has led to remission-inducing regimens that do not require traditional cytotoxic agents. Combinations of a hypomethylating agent (HMA) and venetoclax have doubled the chance of remission for patients considered unfit for induction chemotherapy who would have traditionally been offered singleagent HMA. In fact, this regimen may rival the complete remission rate achieved with induction chemotherapy for certain populations such as the very elderly and those with secondary AML, but equivalency has yet to be established. Further advances include the addition of gemtuzumab ozogamicin and FLT3 inhibitors to induction chemotherapy, which improves survival for patients with core-binding factor and FLT3-mutated AML, respectively. Still, much work is needed to improve the outcomes of the highest-risk subgroups: frail patients and those with high-risk cytogenetics and/or TP53 mutations. Promisingly, the landscape of AML therapy is shifting dramatically and no longer is intensity, when feasible, always the best answer for AML.","['McCurdy, Shannon R', 'Luger, Selina M']","['McCurdy SR', 'Luger SM']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology/Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology/Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA. selina.luger@pennmedicine.upenn.edu.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211001,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Gemtuzumab/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Remission Induction']",PMC8485660,,,2021/07/30 06:00,2021/10/28 06:00,['2021/07/29 03:39'],"['2021/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/29 03:39 [entrez]']",['10.3324/haematol.2020.269134 [doi]'],epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Oct 1;106(10):2544-2554. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2020.269134.,2544-2554,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China, from January 2013 to November 2020. METHODOLOGY: Based on the bioinformatics analysis, the expression levels of GPX1, SOCS5 and IL7 in the bone marrow of 64 AML patients (non-M3) and 32 healthy individuals were evaluated by real-time PCR. Correlation between GPX1 expression and the clinical characteristics, response to induced chemotherapy, and survival time of AML patients were analysed as the outcome measure. RESULTS: GPX1 was significantly downregulated in AML patients, which helped in distinguishing AML patients from normal controls. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) was 0.741 (p <0.001). Additionally, GPX1 expression was correlated with gender (r = -0.250, p = 0.045), FAB classification (r = -0.332, p = 0.004), and chemotherapy response (r = 0.366, p = 0.003). AML patients with high GPX1 expression levels had a lower rate of remission (p = 0.021) and poor long-term survival (p = 0.036) than those with low GPX1 expression levels. CONCLUSION: Low GPX1 expression in AML patients may be closely associated with the pathogenesis and chemoresistance of AML.

Most of these acylation marks are enriched and co-exist with acetylation on active gene regulatory elements. Their seemingly redundant functions hinder our understanding of histone acylations' specific roles. Here, by using an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell model and blasts from individuals with B-precusor ALL (B-ALL), we demonstrate a role of mitochondrial activity in controlling the histone acylation/acetylation ratio, especially at histone H4 lysine 5 (H4K5). An increase in the ratio of non-acetyl acylations (crotonylation or butyrylation) over acetylation on H4K5 weakens bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4) bromodomain-dependent chromatin interaction and enhances BRD4 nuclear mobility and availability for binding transcription start site regions of active genes. Our data suggest that the metabolism-driven control of the histone acetylation/longer-chain acylation(s) ratio could be a common mechanism regulating the bromodomain factors' functional genomic distribution.","['Gao, Mengqing', 'Wang, Jin', 'Rousseaux, Sophie', 'Tan, Minjia', 'Pan, Lulu', 'Peng, Lijun', 'Wang, Sisi', 'Xu, Wenqian', 'Ren, Jiayi', 'Liu, Yuanfang', 'Spinck, Martin', 'Barral, Sophie', 'Wang, Tao', 'Chuffart, Florent', 'Bourova-Flin, Ekaterina', 'Puthier, Denis', 'Curtet, Sandrine', 'Bargier, Lisa', 'Cheng, Zhongyi', 'Neumann, Heinz', 'Li, Jian', 'Zhao, Yingming', 'Mi, Jian-Qing', 'Khochbin, Saadi']","['Gao M', 'Wang J', 'Rousseaux S', 'Tan M', 'Pan L', 'Peng L', 'Wang S', 'Xu W', 'Ren J', 'Liu Y', 'Spinck M', 'Barral S', 'Wang T', 'Chuffart F', 'Bourova-Flin E', 'Puthier D', 'Curtet S', 'Bargier L', 'Cheng Z', 'Neumann H', 'Li J', 'Zhao Y', 'Mi JQ', 'Khochbin S']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200025 Shanghai, China;

Using knockdown screening and single-cell transcriptional analysis, we demonstrate that DUSP4 is the phosphatase that specifically inactivates p38 kinase to promote megakaryocyte (Mk) differentiation. Mechanistically, PRMT1-mediated methylation of DUSP4 triggers its ubiquitinylation by an E3 ligase HUWE1. Interestingly, the mechanistic axis of the DUSP4 degradation and p38 activation is also associated with a transcriptional signature of immune activation in Mk cells. In the context of thrombocytopenia observed in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), we demonstrate that high levels of p38 MAPK and PRMT1 are associated with low platelet counts and adverse prognosis, while pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK or PRMT1 stimulates megakaryopoiesis. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of the PRMT1-DUSP4-p38 axis on Mk differentiation and present a strategy for treatment of thrombocytopenia associated with MDS.","['Su, Hairui', 'Jiang, Ming', 'Senevirathne, Chamara', 'Aluri, Srinivas', 'Zhang, Tuo', 'Guo, Han', 'Xavier-Ferrucio, Juliana', 'Jin, Shuiling', 'Tran, Ngoc-Tung', 'Liu, Szu-Mam', 'Sun, Chiao-Wang', 'Zhu, Yongxia', 'Zhao, Qing', 'Chen, Yuling', 'Cable, LouAnn', 'Shen, Yudao', 'Liu, Jing', 'Qu, Cheng-Kui', 'Han, Xiaosi', 'Klug, Christopher A', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Chen, Yabing', 'Nimer, Stephen D', 'Zheng, Y George', 'Iancu-Rubin, Camelia', 'Jin, Jian', 'Deng, Haiteng', 'Krause, Diane S', 'Xiang, Jenny', 'Verma, Amit', 'Luo, Minkui', 'Zhao, Xinyang']","['Su H', 'Jiang M', 'Senevirathne C', 'Aluri S', 'Zhang T', 'Guo H', 'Xavier-Ferrucio J', 'Jin S', 'Tran NT', 'Liu SM', 'Sun CW', 'Zhu Y', 'Zhao Q', 'Chen Y', 'Cable L', 'Shen Y', 'Liu J', 'Qu CK', 'Han X', 'Klug CA', 'Bhatia R', 'Chen Y', 'Nimer SD', 'Zheng YG', 'Iancu-Rubin C', 'Jin J', 'Deng H', 'Krause DS', 'Xiang J', 'Verma A', 'Luo M', 'Zhao X']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.', 'Chemical Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA; Program of Pharmacology, Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY 10021, USA.', 'Chemical Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY 10461, USA.', 'Genomics and Epigenomics Core Facility, Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY 10021, USA.', 'Chemical Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA; Tri-Institutional PhD Program in Chemical Biology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale Stem Cell Center, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.', 'Chemical Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.', 'Department of School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.', 'Array BioPharma, Boulder, CO 80301 USA.', 'Mount Sinai Center for Therapeutics Discovery, Departments of Pharmacological Sciences and Oncological Sciences, Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA.', 'Mount Sinai Center for Therapeutics Discovery, Departments of Pharmacological Sciences and Oncological Sciences, Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA.', 'Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, School of Medicine, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA; Veterans Affairs Birmingham Medical Center, Research Department, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, FL 33146 USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology Division, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA.', 'Mount Sinai Center for Therapeutics Discovery, Departments of Pharmacological Sciences and Oncological Sciences, Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA.', 'Department of School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale Stem Cell Center, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.', 'Genomics and Epigenomics Core Facility, Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY 10021, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY 10461, USA.

Dysregulation of homeobox (Hox) genes is frequently observed in patients with leukemia. Consistent with this, HoxA genes are upregulated in the SET-Nup214 (+) T-ALL cell line and patients. Although SET-Nup214 has been reported to be recruited to the promoter regions of HoxA genes, the detailed mechanisms of how SET-Nup214 specifically binds to HoxA gene promoters and regulates HoxA gene expression are not known. In this study, we demonstrated that SET-Nup214 interacts with MLL via the SET acidic region of SET-Nup214. SET-Nup214 and MLL cooperatively enhance the promoter activity of the HoxA10 gene. Neither the SET region alone nor the Nup214 region alone sufficiently enhanced the HoxA10 gene promoter. Our results indicated that the SET portion of the SET-Nup214-fusion protein is important for interactions with MLL and transcription enhancement of the HoxA10 gene. Thus, our study will contribute to the understanding of how SET-Nup214 and MLL disturb the expression of HoxA10 gene in leukemia.","['Cigdem, Sadik', 'Saito, Shoko', 'Nishikata, Daiki', 'Nagata, Kyosuke', 'Okuwaki, Mitsuru']","['Cigdem S', 'Saito S', 'Nishikata D', 'Nagata K', 'Okuwaki M']","['Laboratory of Biochemistry, School of Pharmacy, Kitasato University, Minato-ku, Japan.', 'Department of Infection Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Biochemistry, School of Pharmacy, Kitasato University, Minato-ku, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Biochemistry, School of Pharmacy, Kitasato University, Minato-ku, Japan.', 'University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Biochemistry, School of Pharmacy, Kitasato University, Minato-ku, Japan.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3906-3992', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0980-0170']",['eng'],"['17K08620/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', 'Takeda Science Foundation']",['Journal Article'],20210808,England,Genes Cells,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,9607379,"['0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (NUP214 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '140441-81-2 (HOXA10 protein, human)']",IM,"['Gene Expression', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', '*Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",,['NOTNLM'],"['HoxA10', 'MLL', 'SET-Nup214', 'leukemia', 'transcription']",2021/07/29 06:00,2022/01/14 06:00,['2021/07/28 17:31'],"['2021/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/28 17:31 [entrez]']",['10.1111/gtc.12886 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Cells. 2021 Oct;26(10):830-837. doi: 10.1111/gtc.12886.

We retrospectively analyzed 4708 adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who had been recruited into the Study Alliance Leukemia trials, to investigate the prognostic impact of CEBPAsm. CEBPA mutations were identified in 240 patients (5.1%): 131 CEBPAbi and 109 CEBPAsm (60 affecting the N-terminal transactivation domains [CEBPAsmTAD] and 49 the C-terminal DNA-binding or basic leucine zipper region [CEBPAsmbZIP]). Interestingly, patients carrying CEBPAbi or CEBPAsmbZIP shared several clinical factors: they were significantly younger (median, 46 and 50 years, respectively) and had higher white blood cell (WBC) counts at diagnosis (median, 23.7 x 109/L and 35.7 x 109/L) than patients with CEBPAsmTAD (median age, 63 years, median WBC 13.1 x 109/L; P < .001). Co-mutations were similar in both groups: GATA2 mutations (35.1% CEBPAbi; 36.7% CEBPAsmbZIP vs 6.7% CEBPAsmTAD; P < .001) or NPM1 mutations (3.1% CEBPAbi; 8.2% CEBPAsmbZIP vs 38.3% CEBPAsmTAD; P < .001). CEBPAbi and CEBPAsmbZIP, but not CEBPAsmTAD were associated with significantly improved overall (OS; median 103 and 63 vs 13 months) and event-free survival (EFS; median, 20.7 and 17.1 months vs 5.7 months), in univariate and multivariable analyses. Additional analyses revealed that the clinical and molecular features as well as the favorable survival were confined to patients with in-frame mutations in bZIP (CEBPAbZIP-inf).

They are widely believed to have redundant functions, but we describe a unique role for STAT5B in driving the self-renewal of hematopoietic and leukemic stem cells (HSCs/LSCs). We find STAT5B to be specifically activated in HSCs and LSCs, where it induces many genes associated with quiescence and self-renewal, including the surface marker CD9. Levels of CD9 represent a prognostic marker for patients with STAT5-driven leukemia, and our findings suggest that anti-CD9 antibodies may be useful in their treatment to target and eliminate LSCs.

A new class of small-molecule anticancer drugs, BH3 mimetics, now enable specific targeting of these proteins in patients. BH3 mimetics act by inhibiting the prosurvival BCL2 proteins to enable the activation of BAX and BAK, apoptosis effectors that permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membrane, triggering apoptosis directly in many cells and sensitizing others to cell death when combined with other antineoplastic drugs. Venetoclax, a specific inhibitor of BCL2, is the first approved in class, demonstrating striking single agent activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and in other lymphoid neoplasms, as well as activity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML), especially when used in combination. Key insights from the venetoclax experience include that responses occur rapidly, with major activity as monotherapy proving to be the best indicator for success in combination regimens. This emphasizes the importance of adequate single-agent studies for drugs in this class. Furthermore, secondary resistance is common with long-term exposure and often mediated by genetic or adaptive changes in the apoptotic pathway, suggesting that BH3 mimetics are better suited to limited duration, rather than continuous, therapy. The success of venetoclax has inspired development of BH3 mimetics targeting MCL1. Despite promising preclinical activity against MYC-driven lymphomas, myeloma, and AML, their success may particularly depend on their tolerability profile given physiological roles for MCL1 in several nonhematologic tissues.","['Roberts, Andrew W', 'Wei, Andrew H', 'Huang, David C S']","['Roberts AW', 'Wei AH', 'Huang DCS']","['Blood Cells and Blood Cancer Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia; and.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Blood Cells and Blood Cancer Division, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7341-5720', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7514-3298', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3101-4873']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Drug Discovery', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,,,2021/07/29 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/07/28 17:26'],"['2021/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/28 17:26 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(21)01408-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020006785 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2021 Sep 30;138(13):1120-1136. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020006785.,1120-1136,['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, patients with BTKi-resistant disease have shortened survival. Clinical and molecular risk factors, such as number of prior therapies and presence of TP53 mutations, can be used to predict patients at the highest risk of developing BTKi resistance. Many mechanisms of BTKi resistance have been reported with mutations in BTK and phospholipase C gamma2 supported with the most data. The introduction of venetoclax has lengthened the survival of patients with BTKi-resistant disease. Ongoing clinical trials with promising treatment modalities, such as next-generation BTKi and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, have reported promising efficacy in patients with BTKi-resistant disease.

Because of high event-free survival (EFS) and hypersensitivity of the leukemic blasts to chemotherapy, the prior Children's Oncology Group protocol ML-DS protocol (AAML0431) reduced overall treatment intensity but lacking risk stratification, retained the high-dose cytarabine course (HD-AraC), which was highly associated with infectious morbidity. Despite high EFS of ML-DS, survival for those who relapse is rare. AAML1531 introduced therapeutic risk stratification based on the previously identified prognostic factor, measurable residual disease (MRD) at the end of the first induction course. Standard risk (SR) patients were identified by negative MRD using flow cytometry (<0.05%) and did not receive the historically administered HD-AraC course. Interim analysis of 114 SR patients revealed a 2-year EFS of 85.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 75.7-95.5), which was significantly lower than for MRD- patients treated with HD-AraC on AAML0431 (P = .0002). Overall survival at 2 years was 91.0% (95% CI, 83.8-95.0). Twelve SR patients relapsed, mostly within 1 year from study entry and had a 1-year OS of 16.7% (95% CI, 2.7-41.3). Complex karyotypes were more frequent in SR patients who relapsed compared with those who did not (36% vs 9%; P = .0248). MRD by error-corrected sequencing of GATA1 mutations was piloted in 18 SR patients and detectable in 60% who relapsed vs 23% who did not (P = .2682).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Retrospective review of children with suspected bone tumours referred to a specialist musculoskeletal oncology service between September 2019 and August 2020. Data recorded included patient age and gender, lesion location, the presence of a pathological fracture on the initial plain radiograph, and the final diagnosis made either by image-guided biopsy/curettage or based on typical imaging features. RESULTS: 231 patients were included with 233 lesions (138 males and 93 females with mean age 10.5 years, range 3 months-18 years). Final diagnosis was based on histology in 85 (36.5%) cases and imaging in 148 (63.5%) cases, 52 (22.3%) lesions classed as non-neoplastic, 139 (59.7%) as benign and 42 (18%) as malignant. Pathological fractures were seen in 41 cases (17.6%) at presentation, involving the humerus in 19 (46.3%), the femur in 14 (34.1%), the tibia in 3 (7.3%), the fibula and radius in two each (4.9%) and the second toe proximal phalanx in 1 (2.4%) (p < 0.001). The commonest underlying lesions included simple bone cyst (n = 17; 41.5%) and non-ossifying fibroma (n = 10; 24.4%). Only 4 cases (9.75%) were malignant, one case each of osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, leukaemia and BCOR undifferentiated round cell sarcoma. Pathological fracture occurred in 27.7% of non-malignant lesions and 9.5% of malignant lesions, this difference being statistically significant (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Pathological fractures were seen in 17.6% of paediatric bone tumours, tumour-like lesions, being significantly associated with humeral location and non-malignant diagnosis. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Demonstrates the frequency, location and underlying diagnosis of pathological fractures in paediatric bone tumour and tumour-like lesions.","['Chaib, Boussad', 'Malhotra, Karan', 'Khoo, Michael', 'Saifuddin, Asif']","['Chaib B', 'Malhotra K', 'Khoo M', 'Saifuddin A']","['Department of General Medicine, Maidstone Hospital, Kent, UK.', 'Department of Orthopaedics, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore, UK.', 'Department of Radiology, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore, UK.', 'Department of Radiology, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore, UK.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3876-2150'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210728,England,Br J Radiol,The British journal of radiology,0373125,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Bone and Bones/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Fractures, Spontaneous/*diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Image-Guided Biopsy', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Radiography/*methods', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,2021/07/29 06:00,2021/08/28 06:00,['2021/07/28 17:14'],"['2021/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/28 17:14 [entrez]']",['10.1259/bjr.20201341 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Radiol. 2021 Sep 1;94(1125):20201341. doi: 10.1259/bjr.20201341.

""Complex"" retroviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), use cis-acting elements on the unspliced gRNA in conjunction with trans-acting viral proteins to facilitate this escape. ""Simple"" retroviruses, such as Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) and murine leukemia virus (MLV), exclusively use cis-acting elements on the gRNA in conjunction with host nuclear export proteins for nuclear escape. Uniquely, the simple retrovirus Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) has a Gag structural protein that cycles through the nucleus prior to plasma membrane binding. This trafficking has been implicated in facilitating gRNA nuclear export and is thought to be a required mechanism. Previously described mutants that abolish nuclear cycling displayed enhanced plasma membrane binding, enhanced virion release, and a significant loss in genome incorporation resulting in loss of infectivity. Here, we describe a nuclear cycling-deficient RSV Gag mutant that has similar plasma membrane binding and genome incorporation to wild-type (WT) virus and surprisingly is replication competent, albeit with a slower rate of spread than observed in WT virus. This mutant suggests that RSV Gag nuclear cycling is not strictly required for RSV replication. IMPORTANCE While mechanisms for retroviral Gag assembly at the plasma membrane are beginning to be characterized, characterization of intermediate trafficking locales remain elusive. This is in part due to the difficulty of tracking individual proteins from translation to plasma membrane binding. Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) Gag nuclear cycling is a unique phenotype that may provide comparative insight to viral trafficking evolution and may present a model intermediate to cis- and trans-acting mechanisms for gRNA export.","['Ricana, Clifton L', 'Johnson, Marc C']","['Ricana CL', 'Johnson MC']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, Missouri, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Bond Life Sciences Center, University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, Missouri, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9733-9136', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6431-7133']",['eng'],['R21 AI143363/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20210728,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/genetics/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/virology', 'Gene Products, gag/*genetics/metabolism', 'Genome, Viral/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Rous sarcoma virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Virion/metabolism', 'Virus Assembly']",PMC8475522,['NOTNLM'],"['*assembly', '*genome packaging', '*nuclear export', '*nuclear import', '*protein trafficking', '*retrovirus']",2021/07/29 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2021/07/28 12:20'],"['2022/03/27 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/28 12:20 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.00648-21 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2021 Sep 27;95(20):e0064821. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00648-21.

METHODS: This study was carried out on 87 consecutive newly diagnosed adult AML patients of which 75 are evaluated for both LCN, BCL2L12 (All 87 are evaluated for LCN). In addition, 20 donors of matched age and sex healthy individuals from donors for bone marrow transplantation were included as a control group. RESULTS: No statistical significant correlation was found between LCN over-expression and the control group , there was no statistical significance between its expression and age, sex, hepatomegally, splenomegally and lymphadenopathy, also there was no statistical significance regarding peripheral blood and bone marrow findings, immunophenotyping, cytogenetics or molecular findings and MRD at day 15.No statistical significance was found between BCL2L12 expression and the control group again there was no statistical significance between its expression and age, sex, hepatomegally, splenomegally and lymphadenopathy, also there was no statistical significance regarding peripheral blood and bone marrow findings, immunophenotyping, cytogenetics or molecular findings and MRD at day 15. CONCLUSION: LCN and BCL2L12 were found to be expressed with non significant difference in AML as in normal subjects; however studies on large number of cases are needed to confirm our finding. The role of LCN and BCL2L12 need to be verified by further large-scale sample and further studies.<br />.","['Khozam, Lucie G', 'El Shimy, Reham A A', 'Shafik, Roxan E']","['Khozam LG', 'El Shimy RAA', 'Shafik RE']","['Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Egypt.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1278-7229', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1470-985x', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7403-839x']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210701,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (BCL2L12 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Lipocalin-2)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Lipocalin-2/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Muscle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism']",PMC8607092,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL2L12', 'Bone Marrow', 'LCN', 'acute myeloid leukemia']",2021/07/29 06:00,2021/12/30 06:00,['2021/07/28 09:37'],"['2021/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/28 09:37 [entrez]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.7.2267 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2021 Jul 1;22(7):2267-2272. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.7.2267.,2267-2272,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, an inverse relationship between miRNA-15a levels with Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 expression has been observed in CLL patients. In this study, the effect of miRNA-15a on apoptosis and sensitivity of the CLL cells to fludarabine was investigated. METHODS: After treatments, the Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 expression levels were quantified by RT-qPCR. Trypan blue assay was used to explore the effects of miRNA-15a and fludarabine on cell proliferation. The cytotoxicity was measured using MTT assay and combination index analysis. Cell death was determined using cell death detection ELISA assay and caspase-3 activity assay Kits. RESULTS: Results showed that miRNA-15a clearly decreased the mRNA levels of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 in a time dependent manner, which led to CLL-II cell proliferation inhibition and enhancement of apoptosis (p < 0.05, relative to control). Transfection of the miRNA-15a synergistically reduced the cell survival rate and lowered the IC50 value of fludarabine. Furthermore, miRNA-15a significantly enhanced the apoptotic effect of fludarabine. CONCLUSIONS: Our data propose that suppression of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 by miRNA-15a can effectively inhibit the cell proliferation and sensitize CLL cells to fludarabine. Therefore, miRNA-15a can be considered as a potential therapeutic target in CLL resistant patients.","['Ashofteh, Nooshin', 'Amini, Razieh', 'Molaee, Neda', 'Karami, Hadi', 'Baazm, Maryam']","['Ashofteh N', 'Amini R', 'Molaee N', 'Karami H', 'Baazm M']","['Department of Molecular Medicine and Biotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Biotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Molecular and Medicine Research Center, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Biotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Molecular and Medicine Research Center, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8824-8160'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210701,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",PMC8607086,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcl-2', 'CLL', 'Fludarabine', 'Mcl-1', 'MiRNA-15a']",2021/07/29 06:00,2021/12/30 06:00,['2021/07/28 09:37'],"['2021/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/28 09:37 [entrez]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.7.2191 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2021 Jul 1;22(7):2191-2198. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.7.2191.,2191-2198,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM: In this study, isoMPO was evaluated in bone marrow biopsies (BMB) from adults with B-ALL using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in relation to a number of risk-stratification factors and patients' outcomes. METHODS: Sixty B-ALL adult patients were selected upon electronic database search. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, therapy and survival data were reviewed and tabulated. Flowcytometry (FCM), histopathology and IHC available material were reviewed to confirm the diagnostic criteria according to our standard laboratory protocols. IHC was performed on BMB using antiMPO. Cases were divided into MPO+ve and MPO-ve based on a 3% blast cell staining threshold. RESULTS: Using IHC, 26.7% of B-ALLs were MPO+ve, in most of which >/=10% of blasts were stained. Among standard risk-stratification factors, isoMPO was associated with a mean WBC count above 30x109/L. MPO+ patients achieved therapeutic complete remission at lower rates and were more prone to progressive/refractory disease and relapse. There was a concordant expression of MPO in FCM and IHC. All of the aforementioned parameters reached the level of significance when compared to the MOP-ve group. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed a significantly lower survival probability for the MPO+ group than the MOP-ve one (p= 0.0066; Log-rank test) and also when separating MPO+ and -ve patients by gender (p= 0.0033; Log-rank test). CONCLUSION: isoMPO occur in a considerable percentage of B-ALL in adults contributing to misdiagnosis. It depicts poor outcomes and might be introduced as a B-ALL risk-stratification factor.<br />.","['Fawzy, Maha Mohamed', 'Abd El-hafez, Amal', 'El-Ashwah, Shaimaa', 'Abouzeid, Tarek E.', 'Waheeb, Maryan Fahmi', 'Saif, Maha', 'Mortada, Metwaly Ibrahim', 'Ghannam, Mayada A.', 'Sheta, Heba']","['Fawzy MM', 'Abd El-hafez A', 'El-Ashwah S', 'Abouzeid TE', 'Waheeb MF', 'Saif M', 'Mortada MI', 'Ghannam MA', 'Sheta H']","['Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Clinical Hematology Unit, Oncology Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Clinical Hematology Unit, Oncology Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Internal Medicine Department, Oncology Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Internal Medicine Department, Oncology Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3346-5168', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3465-1955', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4771-1120']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210701,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (MPO protein, human)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Peroxidase/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",PMC8607084,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adult B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Flowcytometry', '*immunohistochemistry', '*response to therapy', '*survival']",2021/07/29 06:00,2021/12/30 06:00,['2021/07/28 09:37'],"['2021/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/28 09:37 [entrez]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.7.2143 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2021 Jul 1;22(7):2143-2152. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.7.2143.,2143-2152,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is technically and logistically challenging to screen patients routinely in limited-resource settings. This study aimed to evaluate blood MTX levels at 24- and 48-hours from start of infusion in relation to clinical toxicity in childhood ALL. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted on 32 consecutive children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had received at least one cycle of 1 g/m2 HD-MTX intravenous infusion as a part of consolidation treatment based on the 2013 Indonesian ALL Protocol. In total, 68 cycles were evaluated. Serum MTX concentrations were measured using enzyme immunoassay. MTX toxicity was categorized using common toxicity criteria (CTCAE) 3.0 version. The association between MTX level and clinical toxicity was assessed by non-parametric analysis. RESULTS: The 24-hours MTX level was median 29.8 ng/mL (0.065 micromol/L) (IQR 8.1-390.6) with a modest decrease in 48-hours MTX serum level in all cycles (median 28.3 ng/mL and 0.062 micromol/L; IQR 0.35-28.7; p <0.05). The two most common toxicities were hepatotoxicity (32.2%) and neutropenia (30.9%). Nephrotoxicity and febrile neutropenia occurred in 8.8% and 5.8% of patients, respectively, with low percentage of mucositis (4.3%) and thrombocytopenia (5.6%) recorded. No statistically significant association was found between MTX levels and clinical toxicity, except for liver toxicity. CONCLUSION: Serum MTX levels at 24-hours and 48-hours are low, followed by only 4.4% grade III/IV hepatotoxicity and 26,4% grade III/IV neutropenia. There is no significant association between the clinical toxicity and MTX levels at the two points of measurement. An attempt to increase the MTX dose and/or to introduce a loading dose should be considered in subsequent ALL protocol as supported by further pharmacokinetic MTX studies in the Indonesian population.","['Sari, Nur Melani', 'Rakhmilla, Lulu E', 'Bashari, Muhammad Hasan', 'Zazuli, Zulfan', 'Suryawan, Nur', 'Susanah, Susi', 'Reniarti, Lelani', 'Raspati, Harry', 'Supriyadi, Eddy', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Idjradinata, Ponpon']","['Sari NM', 'Rakhmilla LE', 'Bashari MH', 'Zazuli Z', 'Suryawan N', 'Susanah S', 'Reniarti L', 'Raspati H', 'Supriyadi E', 'Kaspers GJL', 'Idjradinata P']","['Hematology Oncology Division, Department of Child Health Faculty of Medicine Universitas Padjadjaran/Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia.', 'Department of Public Health, Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Faculty of Medicine Universitas Padjadjaran, Bandung, Indonesia.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Division of Pharmacology and Therapy, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran, Bandung, Indonesia.', 'Department of Pharmacology-Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Bandung Institute Technology, Bandung, Indonesia.', 'Amsterdam UMC, location Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Hematology Oncology Division, Department of Child Health Faculty of Medicine Universitas Padjadjaran/Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia.', 'Hematology Oncology Division, Department of Child Health Faculty of Medicine Universitas Padjadjaran/Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia.', 'Hematology Oncology Division, Department of Child Health Faculty of Medicine Universitas Padjadjaran/Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia.', 'Hematology Oncology Division, Department of Child Health Faculty of Medicine Universitas Padjadjaran/Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia.', 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology Division, Department of Pediatrics, Dr Sardjito Hospital-Faculty of Medicine Public Health and Nursing Universitas, Gajah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.', 'Princess Maxima Center for pediatric oncology, Utrecht, Netherlands.', ""Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Pediatric Oncology, Netherlands, Netherlands."", 'Hematology Oncology Division, Department of Child Health Faculty of Medicine Universitas Padjadjaran/Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia.']","['ORCID: 0000000290629624', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0119-7952', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7298-0317', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4052-512X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3887-2117', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7716-8475']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210701,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', '*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Indonesia', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies']",PMC8607079,['NOTNLM'],"['2013 ALL Indonesian protocol', 'Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Toxicity', 'high dose methotrexate']",2021/07/29 06:00,2021/12/30 06:00,['2021/07/28 09:37'],"['2021/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/28 09:37 [entrez]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.7.2025 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2021 Jul 1;22(7):2025-2031. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.7.2025.,2025-2031,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequently, 2 years later, MEIS1, the human homolog, was cloned in the liver and cerebellum, and was found to be highly expressed in myeloid leukemia cells. The MEIS1 gene, located on chromosome 2p14, encodes a 390amino acid protein with six domains. The expression of homeobox protein MEIS1 is affected by cell type, age and environmental conditions, as well as the pathological state. Certain types of modifications of MEIS1 and its protein interaction with homeobox or preBcell leukemia homeobox proteins have been described. As a transcription factor, MEIS1 protein is involved in cell proliferation in leukemia and some solid tumors. The present review article discusses the molecular biology, modifications, proteinprotein interactions, as well as the role of MEIS1 in cell proliferation of cancer cells and MEIS1 inhibitors. It is suggested by the available literature MEIS1 has potential to become a cancer therapeutic target.","['Yao, Maozhong', 'Gu, Yong', 'Yang, Zhaoxin', 'Zhong, Keyan', 'Chen, Zhanjuan']","['Yao M', 'Gu Y', 'Yang Z', 'Zhong K', 'Chen Z']","['Clinical Research Center, Hainan Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Haikou, Hainan 570203, P.R.

Intrahepatic left portal vein and superior mesenteric vein anastomosis, also known as meso-Rex bypass (MRB), is becoming the gold standard treatment for EHPVO. We analyzed the value of preoperative computed tomography (CT) in determining whether MRB is feasible in children with EHPVO. RESULTS: We retrieved data on 76 children with EHPVO (50 male, 26 female; median age, 5.9 years) who underwent MRB (n = 68) or the Warren procedure (n = 8) from 2013 to 2019 and retrospectively analyzed their clinical and CT characteristics. The Rex recess was categorized into four subtypes (types 1-4) depending on its diameter in CT images. Of all 76 children, 7.9% had a history of umbilical catheterization and 1.3% had leukemia. Sixteen patients (20 lesions) had associated malformations. A total of 72.4% of Rex recesses could be measured by CT, and their mean diameter was 3.5 +/- 1.8 mm (range 0.6-10.5 mm). A type 1, 2, 3, and 4 Rex recess was present in 9.2%, 53.9%, 11.8%, and 25.0% of patients, respectively. MRB could be performed in patients with types 1, 2, and 3, but those with type 4 required further evaluation. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of CT were 100%, 83.8%, 42.1%, 100%, and 85.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Among the four types of Rex recesses on CT angiography, types 1-3 allow for the performance of MRB.","['Wu, Huiying', 'Zhou, Ning', 'Lu, Lianwei', 'Chen, Xiwen', 'Liu, Tao', 'Zhang, Binbin', 'Liu, Hongsheng', 'Wen, Zhe']","['Wu H', 'Zhou N', 'Lu L', 'Chen X', 'Liu T', 'Zhang B', 'Liu H', 'Wen Z']","[""Department of Radiology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, 9 Jinsui Road, Guangzhou, 510623, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Radiology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, 9 Jinsui Road, Guangzhou, 510623, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Radiology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, 9 Jinsui Road, Guangzhou, 510623, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Radiology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, 9 Jinsui Road, Guangzhou, 510623, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Pediatric Surgery, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, 9 Jinsui Road, Guangzhou, 510623, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Pediatric Surgery, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, 9 Jinsui Road, Guangzhou, 510623, Guangdong, China."", ""Department of Radiology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, 9 Jinsui Road, Guangzhou, 510623, Guangdong, China. radiologygz@126.com."", ""Department of Pediatric Surgery, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, 9 Jinsui Road, Guangzhou, 510623, Guangdong, China. zhewen2000@126.com.""]",,['eng'],"['2016A020215021/Guangdong Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong', 'Province']",['Journal Article'],20210727,Germany,Insights Imaging,Insights into imaging,101532453,,,,PMC8316534,['NOTNLM'],"['Cavernous transformation', 'Computed tomography', 'Pediatrics', 'Portal hypertension', 'Rex shunt']",2021/07/29 06:00,2021/07/29 06:01,['2021/07/28 06:44'],"['2021/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/28 06:44 [entrez]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13244-021-01057-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s13244-021-01057-8 [pii]']",epublish,Insights Imaging. 2021 Jul 27;12(1):109. doi: 10.1186/s13244-021-01057-8.,109,['(c) 2021.

The vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) enhancer, located 157 Kb downstream of its promoter, is demethylated in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). VEGFA has several alternative splicing isoforms with different roles in cancer progression. Since transcription and splicing are coupled, we wondered whether VEGFA enhancer activity can also regulate the gene's alternative splicing to contribute to the pathology of CML. Our results show that mutating the VEGFA +157 enhancer promotes exclusion of exons 6a and 7 and activating the enhancer by tethering a chromatin activator has the opposite effect. In line with these results, CML patients present with high expression of +157 eRNA and inclusion of VEGFA exons 6a and 7. In addition, our results show that the positive regulator of RNAPII transcription elongation, CCNT2, binds VEGFA's promoter and enhancer, and its silencing promotes exclusion of exons 6a and 7 as it slows down RNAPII elongation rate. Thus our results suggest that VEGFA's +157 enhancer regulates its alternative splicing by increasing RNAPII elongation rate via CCNT2. Our work demonstrates for the first time a connection between an endogenous enhancer and alternative splicing regulation of its target gene.","['Dahan, Sara', 'Sharma, Aveksha', 'Cohen, Klil', 'Baker, Mai', 'Taqatqa, Nadeen', 'Bentata, Mercedes', 'Engal, Eden', 'Siam, Ahmad', 'Kay, Gillian', 'Drier, Yotam', 'Elias, Shlomo', 'Salton, Maayan']","['Dahan S', 'Sharma A', 'Cohen K', 'Baker M', 'Taqatqa N', 'Bentata M', 'Engal E', 'Siam A', 'Kay G', 'Drier Y', 'Elias S', 'Salton M']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Institute for Medical Research Israel-Canada, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Institute for Medical Research Israel-Canada, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Institute for Medical Research Israel-Canada, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Institute for Medical Research Israel-Canada, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Institute for Medical Research Israel-Canada, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Institute for Medical Research Israel-Canada, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Institute for Medical Research Israel-Canada, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Institute for Medical Research Israel-Canada, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Institute for Medical Research Israel-Canada, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.', 'The Lautenberg Center for Immunology and Cancer Research, IMRIC, Faculty of Medicine, The Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Institute for Medical Research Israel-Canada, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem 91120, Israel.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1725-2995', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8812-5577']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210713,England,NAR Cancer,NAR cancer,101769553,,,,PMC8276762,,,2021/07/29 06:00,2021/07/29 06:01,['2021/07/28 06:36'],"['2021/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/28 06:36 [entrez]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1093/narcan/zcab029 [doi]', 'zcab029 [pii]']",epublish,NAR Cancer. 2021 Jul 13;3(3):zcab029. doi: 10.1093/narcan/zcab029. eCollection 2021 Sep.,zcab029,"['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

It can be caused by mutations that turn on oncogenes or turn off tumour suppressor genes. For instance, changes in certain genes including Rb and p53 are common in ALL cells. Oncogenes and TSGs may serve as a modulator gene to regulate the gene expression level via their respective target genes. To investigate the regulatory relationship between oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes and transcription factors at the post translational level in childhood ALL, we performed an integrative network analysis on the gene regulation in the post-translational level for childhood ALL based on many publicly available cancer gene expression data including TARGET and GEO database. Methods: We collected 259 childhood ALL-related genes from the latest online leukemia database, Leukemia Gene Literature Database. These 259 genes were selected from a comprehensive systematic literature with experimental evidences. The identified and curated genes were also associated with patient survival cases and we incorporated this pediatric ALL-related gene list into our analysis. We extracted the known human TFs from the TRRUST database. Among 259 childhood ALL-related genes, 101 unique regulators were mapped to the list of oncogene and tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) from the ONGene and the TSGene databases, and these included 74 TSGs, 62 oncogenes and 46 TF genes. Results: The resulted regulation was presented as a hierarchical regulatory network with transcription factors (TFs) as intermediate regulators connecting the top modulators (oncogene and TSGs) to the common target genes. Cross-validation was applied to the results from the TARGET dataset by identifying the consistent regulatory motifs based on three independent ALL expression datasets. A three-layer regulatory network of consistent positive modulators in childhood ALL was constructed in which 74 modulators (40 oncogenes, 34 TSGs) are considered as the most important regulators. The middle layer and the bottom layer contain 34 TFs and 176 target genes, respectively. Oncogenes mostly participated in positive regulation of gene expression and the transcription process of RNA II polymerase, while TSGs were mainly involved in the negative regulation of gene expression. In addition, the oncogene-specific targets were enriched with regulators of the MAPK cascade while tumour suppressor-specific targets were associated with cell death. Conclusion: The results revealed that oncogenes and TSGs possess a different functional regulatory pattern with regard to not only their biological functions but also their specific target genes in childhood ALL cancer progression. Taken together, our findings could contribute to a better understanding of the important regulatory mechanisms and this method could be used to analyse the targeted genes at the post-translational level in childhood ALL through integrative network analysis.","['Wee, YongKiat', 'Liu, Yining', 'Zhao, Min']","['Wee Y', 'Liu Y', 'Zhao M']","['School of Science and Engineering, University of the Sunshine Coast, Sunshine Coast, QLD, Australia.', 'The School of Public Health, Institute for Chemical Carcinogenesis, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'School of Science and Engineering, University of the Sunshine Coast, Sunshine Coast, QLD, Australia.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5498-3434'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210714,United States,PeerJ,PeerJ,101603425,,,,PMC8286060,['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood leukaemia', 'Gene regulatory', 'Integrative network analysis', 'Oncogene', 'Tumour suppressor gene']",2021/07/29 06:00,2021/07/29 06:01,['2021/07/28 06:33'],"['2019/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/28 06:33 [entrez]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7717/peerj.11803 [doi]', '11803 [pii]']",epublish,PeerJ. 2021 Jul 14;9:e11803. doi: 10.7717/peerj.11803. eCollection 2021.,e11803,['(c) 2021 Wee et al.'],,,,['Min Zhao is an Academic Editor for PeerJ.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retrospectively, we investigated the prognostic and predictive impact of FLT3-ITD insertion site (IS) in 452 patients randomized within the RATIFY trial, which evaluated midostaurin additionally to intensive chemotherapy. Next-generation sequencing identified 908 ITDs, with 643 IS in the juxtamembrane domain (JMD) and 265 IS in the tyrosine kinase domain-1 (TKD1). According to IS, patients were categorized as JMDsole (n = 251, 55%), JMD and TKD1 (JMD/TKD1; n = 117, 26%), and TKD1sole (n = 84, 19%). While clinical variables did not differ among the 3 groups, NPM1 mutation was correlated with JMDsole (P = 0.028). Overall survival (OS) differed significantly, with estimated 4-year OS probabilities of 0.44, 0.50, and 0.30 for JMDsole, JMD/TKD1, and TKD1sole, respectively (P = 0.032). Multivariate (cause-specific) Cox models for OS and cumulative incidence of relapse using allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in first complete remission as a time-dependent variable identified TKD1sole as unfavorable and HCT as favorable factors. In addition, Midostaurin exerted a significant benefit only for JMDsole. Our results confirm the distinct molecular heterogeneity of FLT3-ITD and the negative prognostic impact of TKD1 IS in AML that was not overcome by midostaurin.","['Rucker, Frank G', 'Du, Ling', 'Luck,

Somatic mutations in the DNMT3A gene are also the most common cause of clonal hematopoiesis, and can initiate acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing, we studied DNA methylation in peripheral blood cells of 11 DOS patients and found a focal, canonical hypomethylation phenotype, which is most severe with the dominant negative DNMT3A(R882H) mutation. A germline mouse model expressing the homologous Dnmt3a(R878H) mutation phenocopies most aspects of the human DOS syndrome, including the methylation phenotype and an increased incidence of spontaneous hematopoietic malignancies, suggesting that all aspects of this syndrome are caused by this mutation.","['Smith, Amanda M', 'LaValle, Taylor A', 'Shinawi, Marwan', 'Ramakrishnan, Sai M',

Mutations in the cohesin loader, NIPBL/Scc2, were first described and are the most frequent in clinically diagnosed CdLS patients. The molecular mechanisms driving CdLS phenotypes are not understood. In addition to its canonical role in sister chromatid cohesion, cohesin is implicated in the spatial organization of the genome. Here, we investigate the transcriptome of CdLS patient-derived primary fibroblasts and observe the downregulation of genes involved in development and system skeletal organization, providing a link to the developmental alterations and limb abnormalities characteristic of CdLS patients. Genome-wide distribution studies demonstrate a global reduction of NIPBL at the NIPBL-associated high GC content regions in CdLS-derived cells. In addition, cohesin accumulates at NIPBL-occupied sites at CpG islands potentially due to reduced cohesin translocation along chromosomes, and fewer cohesin peaks colocalize with CTCF.","['Garcia, Patricia', 'Fernandez-Hernandez, Rita', 'Cuadrado, Ana', 'Coca, Ignacio', 'Gomez, Antonio', 'Maqueda, Maria', 'Latorre-Pellicer, Ana', 'Puisac, Beatriz', 'Ramos, Feliciano J', 'Sandoval, Juan', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Mosquera, Jose Luis', 'Rodriguez, Jairo', 'Pie, J', 'Losada, Ana', 'Queralt, Ethel']","['Garcia P', 'Fernandez-Hernandez R', 'Cuadrado A', 'Coca I', 'Gomez A', 'Maqueda M', 'Latorre-Pellicer A', 'Puisac B', 'Ramos FJ', 'Sandoval J', 'Esteller M', 'Mosquera JL', 'Rodriguez J', 'Pie J', 'Losada A', 'Queralt E']","[""Cell Cycle Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL), Av.

Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been used for the treatment of myelofibrosis for several years, but there is a lack of comparative information between those treatments. A systematic review and network meta-analysis was performed on randomized controlled trials in patients with myelofibrosis receiving JAK inhibitor or placebo or control. Primary outcomes were efficacy on spleen volume reduction and total symptom score reduction. Additional analyses were conducted on anemia and thrombopenia events. Seven studies were included in the network meta-analysis including 1953 patients randomly assigned to four JAK inhibitors-ruxolitinib, fedratinib, pacritinib, momelotinib-or control. In first-line therapy, momelotinib and fedratinib were associated with comparable efficacy to ruxolitinib, and with less toxicity on erythrocytes and platelets, respectively. Pacritinib was less effective on splenomegaly than ruxolitinib as a first-line treatment but seemed effective in second line, after ruxolitinib exposure. Fedratinib and ruxolitinib that are FDA approved in myelofibrosis have both confirmed being valuable option to treat splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms, and their slightly different tolerance-profiles can guide therapeutic choice for first-line treatment, according to patient profile. Momelotinib could be another option especially due to its positive effect on anemia.","['Sureau, Lea', 'Orvain, Corentin', 'Ianotto, Jean-Christophe', 'Ugo, Valerie', 'Kiladjian, Jean-Jacques', 'Luque Paz, Damien', 'Riou, Jeremie']","['Sureau L', 'Orvain C', 'Ianotto JC', 'Ugo V', 'Kiladjian JJ', 'Luque Paz D', 'Riou J']","['Univ Angers, Inserm, CRCINA, Angers, France.', ""CHU Angers, Laboratoire d'hematologie, Angers, France."", ""Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire 'Grand Ouest Against Leukemia' (FHU GOAL), Angers, France."", 'Univ Angers, Inserm, CRCINA, Angers, France.', ""Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire 'Grand Ouest Against Leukemia' (FHU GOAL), Angers, France."", 'CHU Angers, Service des maladies du sang, Angers, France.', ""Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire 'Grand Ouest Against Leukemia' (FHU GOAL), Angers, France."", 'CHRU Brest, Hematologie Clinique, Institut de Cancero-Hematologie, Brest, France.', 'Univ Angers, Inserm, CRCINA, Angers, France.', ""CHU Angers, Laboratoire d'hematologie, Angers, France."", ""Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire 'Grand Ouest Against Leukemia' (FHU GOAL), Angers, France."", ""Universite de Paris, APHP, Hopital Saint-Louis, Centre d'Investigations Cliniques, INSERM CIC 1427, Paris, France."", 'Univ Angers, Inserm, CRCINA, Angers, France. damien.luquepaz@chu-angers.fr.', ""CHU Angers, Laboratoire d'hematologie, Angers, France. damien.luquepaz@chu-angers.fr."", ""Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire 'Grand Ouest Against Leukemia' (FHU GOAL), Angers, France. damien.luquepaz@chu-angers.fr."", 'Univ Angers, INSERM, UMR 1066, CNRS 6021, MINT, Angers, France. jeremie.riou@univ-angers.fr.', 'CHU Angers, DRCI, Departement de biostatistiques et methodologie, Angers, France. jeremie.riou@univ-angers.fr.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5451-3464', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9074-7287', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4523-675X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7056-9257']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210727,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,,IM,,PMC8316412,,,2021/07/29 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2021/07/28 05:48'],"['2021/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/28 05:48 [entrez]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41408-021-00526-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41408-021-00526-z [pii]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2021 Jul 27;11(7):135. doi: 10.1038/s41408-021-00526-z.,135,['(c) 2021.

However, the cytotoxic effects of GNRs have not been fully explored. OBJECTIVE: Therefore, the main objective of this study was to determine the selective cytotoxic effect of GNRs towards several human tumor cell lines. METHODS: To address this issue, three sizes of GNRs (10-nm, 25-nm, and 50-nm) were tested against two human tumor cell lines, namely, human hepatoma HepG2 and human prostate PC3 cancer cells. As GNRs are usually stored in soft tissues inside living bodies, we also tested the effect of GNRs on murine splenocyte viability. To determine if the GNRs displayed selectivity cytotoxicity towards cancer cells, active GNRs with the size showing the least cytotoxicity to splenocytes were then tested against a panel of 11 human tumor cell lines and two human non-tumor cell lines. RESULTS: Our results showed that the most cytotoxic size of GNRs is 10-nm, followed by the 25-nm GNRs, while the 50-nm GNRs did not show a significant effect. In addition, the 25-nm GNRs were the least cytotoxic to splenocytes when tested for 24 and 48 h. These GNRs showed a selective cytotoxic effect to prostate cancer PC3 cells with median inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 8.3 + 0.37 microM, myeloblastic leukemia HL60 cells (IC50 = 19.7 + 0.89 microM), cervical cancer HeLa cells (IC50 = 24.6 + 0.37 microM), renal adenocarcinoma 786.0 cells (IC50 = 27.34 + 0.6 microM), and hepatoma HepG2 cells (IC50 = 27.79 + 0.03 microM) when compared to the effect on the non-tumor human cells; skin fibroblast BJ cell line (IC50 = 40.13 + 0.7 microM) or epithelial breast MCF10A cells (IC50 = 33.2 + 0.89 microM). A high selectivity indices (SI) were observed in GNRs-treated PC3 and HL60 cells with values ranging from 1.69 to 4.83, whereas moderate SIs were observed in GNRs-treated HeLa, 786.0, and HepG2 cells with values ranging from 1.19 to 1.63. Other cells did not show a similar selective effect, including human laryngeal HEp2 cells, colon HCT116, metastatic renal adenocarcinoma ACHN cells, and human breast cancer cells (MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 cells). The effect of GNRs was confirmed using the colony formation assay and the effect was found to be cell cycle specific. Finally, it was shown that laser treatment can potentiate the cytotoxic effect of the 25-nm GNRs. CONCLUSION: GNRs are selective cytotoxic agents and they have the potential to act as candidate anticancer agents.","['El Gendy, Mohamed', 'Weinfeld, Michael', 'Abdoon, Ahmed']","['El Gendy M', 'Weinfeld M', 'Abdoon A']","['Drug Bioassay-Cell Culture Laboratory, Pharmacognosy Department, Pharmaceutical and Drug Industries Research Division, National Research Centre, Dokki, Giza 12622, Egypt.', 'Department of Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta.

We developed a predictive model using the ASFC method based on the sigma surface areas (Ssigma-surface) of fragments/groups for estimating the toxicity of ILs. A toxicity dataset of 140 ILs towards leukemia rat cell line (ICP-81) was gathered and employed to train and validate models. The Ssigma-surface values of atoms in each group were firstly calculated from the COSMO profiles of cations and anions for ILs. Then the Ssigma-surface values of 26 groups were obtained and used as input descriptors for modelling. The R(2) and MSE of the built ASFC model were 0.924 and 0.071, respectively. Results indicate that the ASFC model developed by the new approach possesses great accuracy and reliability. In total, the ASFC method has extensive potential for the application of estimating diverse properties of ILs and other compounds due to its remarkable advantages.","['Kang, Xuejing', 'Zhao, Yongsheng', 'Chen, Zhongbing']","['Kang X', 'Zhao Y', 'Chen Z']","['Department of Applied Ecology, Faculty of Environmental Sciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, Kamycka 129, Praha - Suchdol 16500, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106-5080, United States.

Currently, vector particles are mostly produced employing adherent viral packaging cell lines (VPCs) rendering the scale up of production laborious, and thus cost-intensive. Here, we describe the rapid establishment of a human suspension 293-F cell line derived ecotropic MLV VPC. Using transposon vector technology, a packaging and envelope expression cassette as well as a transfer vector facilitated the establishment of a stable VPC yielding high titers of up to 5.2 x 10(6) transducing units/mL (TU/mL). Vectors were concentrated using ultrafiltration devices and upon one freeze-thaw-cycle still routinely yielded titers of > 1 x 10(6) TU/mL. Formation of replication-competent retroviruses was not detected. However and as a first generation transfer vector was used in this proof-of-concept (POC) study, gag gene sequences were transduced into target cells within a range of 1-10 copies per 1000 genomes indicating the homologous recombination of packaging construct elements with the transfer vector. High yield VPC vector productivity was stable over a couple of months and unintended integration of the transposase gene was not observed. Ecotropic MLV vector particles were demonstrated to efficiently transduce primary murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. This novel concept should foster the future establishment of suspension VPCs.","['van Heuvel, Yasemin', 'Berg, Karen', 'Hirch, Tanja', 'Winn, Kristina', 'Modlich, Ute', 'Stitz, Jorn']","['van Heuvel Y', 'Berg K', 'Hirch T', 'Winn K', 'Modlich U', 'Stitz J']","['Research Group Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Faculty of Applied Natural Sciences, TH Koln - University of Applied Sciences, Chempark Leverkusen E28, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Allee, 51368, Leverkusen, Germany; Institute of Technical Chemistry, Leibniz University Hannover, Callinstrasse, 530167, Hannover, Germany.', 'Research Group Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Faculty of Applied Natural Sciences, TH Koln - University of Applied Sciences, Chempark Leverkusen E28, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Allee, 51368, Leverkusen, Germany; Research Group Translational Hepatology and Stem Cell Biology, Cluster of Excellence REBIRTH, Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Research Group for Gene Modification in Stem Cells, Paul-Ehrlich-Institute, Division of Veterinary Medicine, Paul-Ehrlich-Str. 51-59, 63225, Langen, Germany.', 'Research Group Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Faculty of Applied Natural Sciences, TH Koln - University of Applied Sciences, Chempark Leverkusen E28, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Allee, 51368, Leverkusen, Germany.', 'Research Group for Gene Modification in Stem Cells, Paul-Ehrlich-Institute, Division of Veterinary Medicine, Paul-Ehrlich-Str. 51-59, 63225, Langen, Germany.', 'Research Group Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Faculty of Applied Natural Sciences, TH Koln - University of Applied Sciences, Chempark Leverkusen E28, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Allee, 51368, Leverkusen, Germany.

Recent studies re-evaluating this dichotomous variable have shown that higher numbers of cytogenetic abnormalities (ie, >/=5) have a worse overall survival in patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy. We sought to determine if increasing karyotypic complexity, treated as a continuous variable, was prognostic of survival for patients treated with ibrutinib for CLL. We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients with CLL treated with single-agent ibrutinib or in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody at our institution. We included 456 patients with both treatment-naive and RR disease. Median number of prior therapies was 2 (range, 0-13), 30% of patients had presence of del(17p), and 75% expressed unmutated IGHV. Fifty percent had >/=3 cytogenetic abnormalities, including 30% with >/=5. In a multivariable analysis, increasing karyotypic complexity was an independent predictor of shorter progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.10; P < .0001) and overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.12; P < .0001). Furthermore, we found that presence of clonal evolution determined by cytogenetic analysis at progression was prognostic of subsequent survival (P = .02). This solidifies karyotypic complexity as an important prognostic factor for patients with CLL treated with ibrutinib. Further research should consider sequential karyotypic analysis as a determination of risk of progression and death in patients with CLL.","['Kittai, Adam S', 'Miller, Cecelia', 'Goldstein, Daniel', 'Huang, Ying', 'Abruzzo, Lynne V', 'Beckwith, Kyle', 'Bhat, Seema A', 'Bond, David A', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Rogers, Kerry A', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Byrd, John C', 'Woyach, Jennifer A']","['Kittai AS', 'Miller C', 'Goldstein D', 'Huang Y', 'Abruzzo LV', 'Beckwith K', 'Bhat SA', 'Bond DA', 'Grever MR', 'Heerema NA', 'Rogers KA', 'Ruppert AS', 'Byrd JC', 'Woyach JA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Arthur G.

Study was carried out on 88 gastric specimens (58 GC and 30 chronic gastritis cases). Immunohistochemical staining for Fli-1 and BCL-2 was done. There was significant lower Fli-1 and BCL-2 expression in GC than chronic gastritis. Advanced tumor stage showed significant relation with both low Fli-1 expression and negative BCL-2 expression. There was significant direct correlation between BCL-2 positivity and Fli-1 expression in GC. Cox-regression analysis showed that distant metastasis was the first independent factor affecting patients' OS. Fli-1 could act as tumor-suppressor protein involved in GC carcinogenesis. In addition, both Fli-1 and BCL-2 may be used as good prognostic markers in GC. The direct correlation between BCL-2 and Fli-1 expression could potentiate Fli-1 and BCL-2 as therapeutic targets in GC, acting together to inhibit cellular proliferation.","['Hemida, Aiat Shaban', 'Holah, Nanis Shawky']","['Hemida AS', 'Holah NS']","['Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Menoufia University, Shebin El Kom, Egypt.', 'Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Menoufia University, Shebin El Kom, Egypt.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210727,England,J Immunoassay Immunochem,Journal of immunoassay & immunochemistry,100963688,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL-2', 'Fli-1', 'gastric carcinoma', 'immunohistochemistry']",2021/07/28 06:00,2021/07/28 06:00,['2021/07/27 17:14'],"['2021/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/28 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/27 17:14 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15321819.2021.1954948 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunoassay Immunochem. 2022 Jan 2;43(1):1954948. doi: 10.1080/15321819.2021.1954948.

Advances in molecular research have greatly improved our understanding of the process of leukemia formation in AML. Osteopontin (OPN) is a novel molecule that mediates critical processes for cancer progression. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative expression of OPN gene isoforms in AML patients on days 0, 14, and 28 after chemotherapy. The bone marrow samples were collected from 40 newly diagnosed AML patients (24 male and 16 female with a mean age of 30 years) at the initial time of diagnosis, 14 and 28 days after treatment. The peripheral blood samples of 10 healthy individuals were also collected as the control group. The expression of OPN isoforms was investigated by Real-Time Quantitative PCR. The expression of VEGFc/STAT3/CXCR4 was also investigated by Real-Time PCR. Findings indicated that OPNb and OPNc isoforms had significantly overexpression in AML patients on 14 and 28 days after treatment compared to normal samples (P < 0.05). The level of OPNb and OPNc isoforms was increased significantly in M0, M1, and M2 subgroups with overexpression of VEGFc/STAT3/CXCR4, 28 days after starting chemotherapy (P < 0.05). Our results suggested that OPNb and OPNc isoforms play a major role in cancer relapse. Therefore, they can be used as a valuable prognostic and diagnostic biomarker for relapse of the AML disease. However, these findings need confirmation with further studies.","['Ferdowsi, Shirin', 'Ghaffari, Seyed H', 'Shiraji, Sahar Tavakkoli', 'Mousavi, Seyed Asadollah', 'Mohammadi, Saeed']","['Ferdowsi S', 'Ghaffari SH', 'Shiraji ST', 'Mousavi SA', 'Mohammadi S']","['Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Research Institute for Oncology, Hematology and Cell Therapy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Research Institute for Oncology, Hematology and Cell Therapy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Research Institute for Oncology, Hematology and Cell Therapy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran. smohammadi@sina.tums.ac.ir.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. smohammadi@sina.tums.ac.ir.', 'Research Institute for Oncology, Hematology and Cell Therapy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. smohammadi@sina.tums.ac.ir.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2190-6042'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210727,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (SPP1 protein, human)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteopontin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Chemoresistance', 'Osteopontin', 'Relapse', 'Splice isoforms']",2021/07/28 06:00,2022/01/04 06:00,['2021/07/27 12:29'],"['2021/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/27 12:29 [entrez]', '2021/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12032-021-01539-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12032-021-01539-1 [pii]']",epublish,Med Oncol. 2021 Jul 27;38(9):102. doi: 10.1007/s12032-021-01539-1.,102,"['(c) 2021.

However, the optimal therapeutic approach to R/R adult T-ALL remains poorly established. AREAS COVERED: At present, cytoreductive therapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is considered to be the most clinically relevant and curative modality for R/R T-ALL. Above all, achieving minimal residual disease (MRD) is a key factor for successful allo-SCT and maintaining long-term remission for R/R patients. As a salvage regimen, nelarabine is the only therapy that was specifically approved for use in patients with R/R T-ALL. A combination of conventional chemotherapeutic agents and novel agents, such as venetoclax, can be used as alternatives for cytoreduction and bridging to transplantation. Relevant literatures published in the last 30 years were searched from PubMed to review the topic of T-ALL, and allo-SCT. EXPERT OPINION: An effective salvage regimen, to achieve negative MRD, followed by allo-SCT is currently the best way to improve the clinical outcomes of adult R/R T-ALL. Moreover, posttransplant therapies, such as prophylactic or preemptive donor leukocyte infusion and hypomethylating agents, need to be considered as sequential therapy.","['Baek, Dong Won', 'Lee, Jung Min', 'Kim, Juhyung', 'Cho, Hee Jeong', 'Moon, Joon Ho', 'Sohn, Sang Kyun']","['Baek DW', 'Lee JM', 'Kim J', 'Cho HJ', 'Moon JH', 'Sohn SK']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210809,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'T-cell', 'post-transplant therapy', 'relapsed/refractory', 'stem cell transplantation']",2021/07/28 06:00,2021/07/28 06:00,['2021/07/27 12:16'],"['2021/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/28 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/27 12:16 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2021.1960817 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2021 Aug;14(8):765-775. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2021.1960817.

In leukocytes, dephosphorylation of ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins is linked to cell adhesion events. To elucidate the relationship between surface stiffness, cell adhesion, and ERM dephosphorylation in leukocytes, we examined the relationship in the myelogenous leukemia line, KG-1, by treatment with modulation drugs. KG-1 cells have ring-shaped cortical actin with microvilli as the only F-actin cytoskeleton, and the actin structure constructs the mechanical stiffness of the cells. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and staurosporine, which induced cell adhesion to fibronectin surface and ERM dephosphorylation, caused a decrease in surface stiffness in KG-1 cells. Calyculin A, which inhibited ERM dephosphorylation and had no effect on cell adhesion, did not affect surface stiffness. To clarify whether decreasing cell surface stiffness and inducing cell adhesion are equivalent, we examined KG-1 cell adhesion by treatment with actin-attenuated cell softening reagents. Cytochalasin D clearly diminished cell adhesion, and high concentrations of Y27632 slightly induced cell adhesion. Only Y27632 slightly decreased ERM phosphorylation in KG-1 cells. Thus, decreasing cell surface stiffness and inducing cell adhesion are not equivalent, but these phenomena are coordinately regulated by ERM dephosphorylation in KG-1 cells.","['Kihara, Takanori', 'Matsumoto, Teru', 'Nakahashi, Yoshihito', 'Tachibana, Kouichi']","['Kihara T', 'Matsumoto T', 'Nakahashi Y', 'Tachibana K']","['Department of Life and Environment Engineering, Faculty of Environmental Engineering, The University of Kitakyushu, 1-1 Hibikino, Wakamatsu, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, 808-0135, Japan. tkihara@kitakyu-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Life and Environment Engineering, Faculty of Environmental Engineering, The University of Kitakyushu, 1-1 Hibikino, Wakamatsu, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, 808-0135, Japan.', 'Department of Life and Environment Engineering, Faculty of Environmental Engineering, The University of Kitakyushu, 1-1 Hibikino, Wakamatsu, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, 808-0135, Japan.', 'Biomedical Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8566, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, 143 Shimokasuya, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5052-6380'],['eng'],"['JP23107006/japan society for the promotion of science', 'JP21K04797/japan society for the promotion of science', 'Grant for Young Scientists/institute of environmental science and technology, the', 'university of kitakyushuis en wetenschapsfilosofie, universiteit utrecht']",['Journal Article'],20210726,Japan,Hum Cell,Human cell,8912329,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cell adhesion', 'Cortical actin', 'ERM', 'Leukocytes', 'Mechanical stiffness']",2021/07/28 06:00,2021/07/28 06:00,['2021/07/27 07:22'],"['2021/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/28 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/27 07:22 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13577-021-00584-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s13577-021-00584-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Hum Cell. 2021 Nov;34(6):1709-1716. doi: 10.1007/s13577-021-00584-2.

From September 2014 to November 2020; 20 patients with AML (15 from The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, 4 from The First Affiliated Hospital; and College of Clinical Medicine of Henan University of Science and Technology, and 1 from Anyang District Hospital) with hematological remission but AML1-ETO fusion gene positivity were treated with different doses of the ITI regimen to monitor changes in AML1-ETO fusion gene levels. Twenty patients were treated with a routine dose of the ITI regimen, including 13 males and 7 females. The median patient age was 38 (14-70 years). The fusion gene was negative in 10 patients after 1 (0.5 ~ 8.6) month, significantly decreased in 4 patients after 2.8 (1 ~ 6) months, increased in 4 patients, and unchanged in 2 patients. The 4 patients with elevated levels of the fusion gene were treated with an increased dose of the ITI regimen, and all four patients became negative, for a total effective rate of 90%.

Improvement was observed in patients' response to a higher dose administration, and patients tolerated the treatment well.","['Mi, Ruihua', 'Chen, Lin', 'Yang, Haiping', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Liu, Jia', 'Yin, Qingsong', 'Wei, Xudong']","['Mi R', 'Chen L', 'Yang H', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu J', 'Yin Q', 'Wei X']","['The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University/Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, 450008, China.', 'The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University/Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, 450008, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital, and College of Clinical Medicine of Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, 471003, China.', 'Anyang District Hospital, Anyang, 455000, China.', 'The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University/Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, 450008, China.', 'The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University/Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, 450008, China.', 'The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University/Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, 450008, China. xudongwei@zzu.edu.cn.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210727,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Fusion/drug effects', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Thalidomide/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",PMC8440286,['NOTNLM'],"['AML1-ETO fusion gene', 'Interferon', 'Interleukin-2', 'Myeloid leukemia', 'Thalidomide']",2021/07/28 06:00,2021/09/25 06:00,['2021/07/27 07:16'],"['2021/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/27 07:16 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-021-04621-w [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-021-04621-w [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2021 Oct;100(10):2593-2601. doi: 10.1007/s00277-021-04621-w.

While Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are the most common hematologic malignancies seen in patients with FA, cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have also been described in the literature but it is uncommon. In our case report, a 12 years 5 months old boy, who was detected with heterozygote mutation of FANCC gene and nonsynonymous single nucleotide variability (SNV) mutation of AKAP9 gene, presented with precursor T cell ALL (T-ALL) at onset, myelodysplasia or myeloid biomarkers were not found at initial diagnosis. He received chemotherapy and achieved complete remission (CR) after a course of remission induction, but severe cytopenia was presented, sepsis and Invasive fungal infection also arose. With following-up and continue chemotherapy, secondary AML arose 17 months later, the patient died of sepsis related to chemotherapy at AML status. FA patients usually presented with homozygous or bilateral heterozygosity mutation in literature reports, whereas heterozygosity gene mutation of FANCC and AKAP9 has not reported yet. AKAP9 protein which was encoded by AKAP9 gene is widely distributed in many kinds of cells, thus ensuring the specificity and accuracy of signal transduction. We speculate that AKAP9 protein may interfere with the normal signal transduction of heterozygous mutation expression of FANCC gene and result in the inactivation of FANCC gene function. Unfortunately, the patient died of sepsis and we don't have enough blood samples to explore the role of AKAP9 gene mutation in patients with heterozygosity FANCC gene mutation.","['Guo, Yuxia', 'Liao, Xin', 'Zou, Pinli', 'Xiao, Jianwen']","['Guo Y', 'Liao X', 'Zou P', 'Xiao J']","[""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."", 'Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."", 'Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."", 'Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."", 'China International Science and Technology Cooperation Center for Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing, China.']",,['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210725,China,AME Case Rep,AME case reports,101730832,,,,PMC8256112,['NOTNLM'],"['Fanconi anemia (FA)', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'case report', 'children']",2021/07/28 06:00,2021/07/28 06:01,['2021/07/27 07:12'],"['2020/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/27 07:12 [entrez]', '2021/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/acr-20-151 [doi]', 'acr-05-20-151 [pii]']",epublish,AME Case Rep. 2021 Jul 25;5:29. doi: 10.21037/acr-20-151. eCollection 2021.,29,['2021 AME Case Reports.

MS is seen most commonly in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and less frequently in chronic myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome. In rarer instances, MS has been shown to precede the development of myeloid tumors by acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). In particular, isolated MS involving spine is extremely rare. We herein present a rare case of isolated spinal MS in non-leukemic patient. This is a previously relatively healthy 47-year-old man who presented with signs of lumbar spinal cord compression, initially reported as schwannoma on imaging, later diagnosed with spinal MS on pathology. Further workup did not reveal any evidence of bone marrow or other hematological involvement. The patient successfully treated by L4/L5 laminectomy and debulking with subsequent radiation resulting in substantial decrease in size of tumor with significant improvement in symptoms during follow up. This case not only describes a rare case of isolated MS of lumbar spine, but also highlights the potential treatment challenges of such a rare diagnosis. We review the available literature, discuss available treatment options, and highlight the need for further investigations along with increased clinician awareness.","['Bhandohal, Janpreet S', 'Moosavi, Leila', 'Garcia-Pacheco, Igor', 'Yakoub, Gian', 'Polineni, Rahul D', 'Cobos, Everardo']","['Bhandohal JS', 'Moosavi L', 'Garcia-Pacheco I', 'Yakoub G', 'Polineni RD', 'Cobos E']","['Department of Medicine, Kern Medical Center-UCLA, Bakersfield, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Kern Medical Center-UCLA, Bakersfield, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Kern Medical Center-UCLA, Bakersfield, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Kern Medical Center-UCLA, Bakersfield, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kern Medical Center-UCLA, Bakersfield, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kern Medical Center-UCLA, Bakersfield, CA, USA.']",,['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210725,China,AME Case Rep,AME case reports,101730832,,,,PMC8256117,['NOTNLM'],"['Chloroma', 'case report', 'myeloblastoma', 'myeloid sarcoma (MS)']",2021/07/28 06:00,2021/07/28 06:01,['2021/07/27 07:12'],"['2020/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/27 07:12 [entrez]', '2021/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/acr-20-110 [doi]', 'acr-05-20-110 [pii]']",epublish,AME Case Rep. 2021 Jul 25;5:27. doi: 10.21037/acr-20-110. eCollection 2021.,27,['2021 AME Case Reports.

Ten of 16 patients with large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) with progressive disease after CAR19 treatment had absent or low CD19. Lower surface CD19 density pretreatment was associated with progressive disease. To prevent relapse with CD19(-) or CD19(lo) disease, we tested a bispecific CAR targeting CD19 and/or CD22 (CD19-22.BB.z-CAR) in a phase I clinical trial ( NCT03233854 ) of adults with relapsed/refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and LBCL. The primary end points were manufacturing feasibility and safety with a secondary efficacy end point. Primary end points were met; 97% of products met protocol-specified dose and no dose-limiting toxicities occurred during dose escalation. In B-ALL (n = 17), 100% of patients responded with 88% minimal residual disease-negative complete remission (CR); in LBCL (n = 21), 62% of patients responded with 29% CR. Relapses were CD19(-/lo) in 50% (5 out of 10) of patients with B-ALL and 29% (4 out of 14) of patients with LBCL but were not associated with CD22(-/lo) disease. CD19/22-CAR products demonstrated reduced cytokine production when stimulated with CD22 versus CD19. Our results further implicate antigen loss as a major cause of CAR T cell resistance, highlight the challenge of engineering multi-specific CAR T cells with equivalent potency across targets and identify cytokine production as an important quality indicator for CAR T cell potency.","['Spiegel, Jay Y', 'Patel, Shabnum', 'Muffly, Lori', 'Hossain, Nasheed M', 'Oak, Jean', 'Baird, John H',

Three doses of donor NK cells (1 x 10(5)-1 x 10(8) cells/kg/dose) were administered on days -2, +7, and +28. Results were compared with an independent contemporaneously treated case-matched cohort of 160 patients from the CIBMTR database.After a median follow-up of 24 months, the 2-year relapse rate was 4% vs. 38% (p = 0.014), and disease-free survival (DFS) was 66% vs. 44% (p = 0.1) in the cases and controls, respectively. Only one relapse occurred in the study group, in a patient with the high level of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) presented before transplantation.

However, the contributions and molecular mechanisms of circRNAs to gallbladder cancer (GBC) remain largely unknown. In the present study, our results showed circPVT1 expression was significantly upregulated in GBC tissues and cells. Higher circPVT1 expression was correlated with lymph node metastasis, advanced TNM stage, and poor overall survival (OS) in patients with GBC. Subsequently, knockdown of circPVT1 significantly impeded GBC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, while induced cell apoptosis in vitro. However, upregulated circPVT1 had the opposite effects. In vivo, we also demonstrated that knockdown of circPVT1 inhibited tumor growth. Furthermore, we confirmed that circPVT1 could regulate Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) expression by sponging to miR-339-3p, which affected tumor progression in GBC cells. In summary, our findings indicated that circPVT1 may serve as a promising prognostic marker and therapeutic target for GBC.","['Wang, Shouhua', 'Su, Ting Ting', 'Tong, Huanjun', 'Shi, Weibin', 'Ma, Fei', 'Quan, Zhiwei']","['Wang S', 'Su TT', 'Tong H', 'Shi W', 'Ma F', 'Quan Z']","['Department of General Surgery, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. mafei@xinhuamed.com.cn.', 'Department of General Surgery, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. quanzhiwei@xinhuamed.com.cn.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0779-4096'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210726,United States,Cell Death Discov,Cell death discovery,101665035,,,,PMC8313687,,,2021/07/28 06:00,2021/07/28 06:01,['2021/07/27 06:34'],"['2021/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/07 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/27 06:34 [entrez]', '2021/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41420-021-00577-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41420-021-00577-y [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Discov. 2021 Jul 26;7(1):191. doi: 10.1038/s41420-021-00577-y.,191,['(c) 2021.

Epigenetic mechanisms could be involved in this association. The current study aimed to evaluate if specific epigenetic marks in VAT are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) to identify epigenetic hallmarks of adipose tissue-related CRC. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation was evaluated in VAT from 25 healthy participants and 29 CRC patients, using the Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip. The epigenome-wide methylation analysis identified 170,184 sites able to perfectly separate the CRC and healthy samples. The differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCpGs) showed a global trend for increased methylated levels in CRC with respect to healthy group. Most of the genes encoded by the DMCpGs belonged to metabolic pathways and cell cycle, insulin resistance, and adipocytokine signalling, as well as tumoural transformation processes. In gene-specific analyses, involved genes biologically relevant for the development of CRC include PTPRN2, MAD1L1, TNXB, DIP2C, INPP5A, HDCA4, PRDM16, RPTOR, ATP11A, TBCD, PABPC3, and IER2. The methylation level of some of them showed a discriminatory capacity for detecting CRC higher than 90%, showing IER2 to have the highest capacity. This study reveals that a specific methylation pattern of VAT is associated with CRC. Some of the epigenetic marks identified could provide useful tools for the prediction and personalized treatment of CRC connected to excess adiposity.","['Izquierdo, Andrea G', 'Boughanem, Hatim', 'Diaz-Lagares, Angel', 'Arranz-Salas, Isabel', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Tinahones, Francisco J', 'Casanueva, Felipe F', 'Macias-Gonzalez, Manuel', 'Crujeiras, Ana B']","['Izquierdo AG', 'Boughanem H', 'Diaz-Lagares A', 'Arranz-Salas I', 'Esteller M', 'Tinahones FJ', 'Casanueva FF', 'Macias-Gonzalez M', 'Crujeiras AB']","['Epigenomics in Endocrinology and Nutrition Group, Epigenomics Unit, Instituto De Investigacion Sanitaria De Santiago De Compostela (IDIS), Complejo Hospitalario Universitario De Santiago De Compostela (CHUS/SERGAS), and Centro De Investigacion Biomedica En Red Fisiopatologia De La Obesidad Y Nutricion (Ciberobn), Spain.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Nutrition, Virgen De La Victoria University Hospital, University of Malaga (IBIMA), Spain and Centro De Investigacion Biomedica En Red Physiopathology of Obesity and Nutrition (Ciberobn), Malaga, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics, Translational Medical Oncology (Oncomet), Instituto De Investigacion Sanitaria De Santiago De Compostela (IDIS), Complejo Hospitalario Universitario De Santiago De Compostela (CHUS/SERGAS), and Centro De Investigacion Biomedica En Red Oncologia (CIBERONC), Spain.', 'Unit of Anatomical Pathology, Virgen de la Victoria University Hospital, Malaga, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; Centro De Investigacion Biomedica En Red Oncologia (CIBERONC), Madrid, Spain; Institucio Catalana De Recerca I Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; Physiological Sciences Department, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Barcelona (UB), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Nutrition, Virgen De La Victoria University Hospital, University of Malaga (IBIMA), Spain and Centro De Investigacion Biomedica En Red Physiopathology of Obesity and Nutrition (Ciberobn), Malaga, Spain.', 'Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology Group.

Taking imatinib (IMA) as an example, we developed an efficient workflow to describe IMA biodegradation with activated sludge (AS) from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). IMA is a cytostatic pharmaceutical; a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia. Its reported ecotoxic, endocrine and genotoxic effects imply high risk for aquatic wildlife and human health, however its fate in the environment is not yet well known. The study was conducted in a batch biotransformation setup, at two AS concentration levels and in presence and absence of carbon source. Degradation profiles and formation of IMA transformation products (TPs) were investigated using UHPLC-QqOrbitrap-MS/MS which showed that IMA is readily biodegradable. TPs were determined using multivariate statistical analysis. Eight TPs were determined and tentatively identified, six of them for first time. Hydrolysis of amide bond, oxidation, demethylation, deamination, acetylation and succinylation are proposed as major biodegradation pathways. TP235, the product of amide bond hydrolysis, was detected and quantified in actual wastewaters, at levels around 1 ng/L. This calls for more studies on the environmental fate of IMA in order to properly asses the environmental risk and hazard associated to IMA and its TPs.","['Tkalec, Ziga', 'Negreira, Noelia', 'Lopez de Alda, Miren', 'Barcelo, Damia', 'Kosjek, Tina']","['Tkalec Z', 'Negreira N', 'Lopez de Alda M', 'Barcelo D', 'Kosjek T']","['Jozef Stefan Institute, Department of Environmental Sciences, Jamova 39, Ljubljana, Slovenia; Jozef Stefan International Postgraduate School, Jamova 39, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Water, Environmental and Food Chemistry Unit (ENFOCHEM), Department of Environmental Chemistry, Institute of Environmental Assessment and Water Research (IDAEA), Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Water, Environmental and Food Chemistry Unit (ENFOCHEM), Department of Environmental Chemistry, Institute of Environmental Assessment and Water Research (IDAEA), Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Barcelona, Spain.

ALVs isolated from chickens were divided into six subgroups (A-J). In 2012, a strain of a putative novel subgroup of ALVs was isolated from Chinese native chickens in Jiangsu Province and named as ALV-K. In this study, three ALV-K strains (JS14LH01, JS13LH14, and JS15SG01) were isolated from chickens with suspected ALV infection in Jiangsu Province. Their complete genomes were amplified, sequenced, and analyzed systematically. The results showed that JS14LH01 and JS13LH14 were ALV-K and ALV-E recombinant strains. Whereas JS15SG01 is an ALV-K, ALV-E, and ALV-J multiple recombinant strain containing the U3 region of ALV-J. The pathogenicity test of JS15SG01 revealed that, compared with previous ALV-K strains, the viremia and viral shedding level of JS15SG01-infected chickens were significantly increased, reaching 100 % and 59 %, respectively. More important, JS15SG01 induced significant proliferation of gliocytes in the cerebral cortex of infected chickens, accompanied by the neurotropic phenomenon. This is the first report about a multiple recombinant ALV-K strain that could invade and injure the brain tissue of chickens in China.

SEM-LA induced apoptosis in U937 cells, which showed increased NOX4 expression, procaspase-8 degradation, and t-Bid production. FADD depletion inhibited SEM-LA-elicited caspase-8 activation, t-Bid production, and cell death, indicating that SEM-LA activated death receptor-mediated apoptosis in U937 cells. SEM-LA stimulated Ca(2+)-mediated Akt activation, which in turn increased Sp1- and p300-mediated NOX4 transcription. The upregulation of NOX4 expression promoted ROS-mediated p38 MAPK phosphorylation, leading to protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-regulated tristetraprolin (TTP) degradation. Remarkably, TTP downregulation increased the stability of TNF-alpha mRNA, resulting in the upregulation of TNF-alpha protein expression. Abolishment of Ca(2+)-NOX4-ROS axis-mediated p38 MAPK activation attenuated SEM-LA-induced TNF-alpha upregulation and protected U937 cells from SEM-LA-mediated cytotoxicity. The restoration of TTP expression alleviated the effect of TNF-alpha upregulation and cell death induced by SEM-LA. Altogether, the data in this study demonstrate that SEM-LA activates TNF-alpha-mediated apoptosis in U937 cells through the NOX4/p38 MAPK/PP2A axis. We think that a similar pathway can also explain the death of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells after SEM-LA treatment.","['Chiou, Jing-Ting', 'Shi, Yi-Jun', 'Lee, Yuan-Chin', 'Wang, Liang-Jun', 'Chen, Ying-Jung', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Chiou JT', 'Shi YJ', 'Lee YC', 'Wang LJ', 'Chen YJ', 'Chang LS']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Department of Fragrance and Cosmetic Science, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan; Department of Biotechnology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.

To explore the roles of Meis genes in head development during evolution of vertebrates, we have identified four meis genes in the sea lamprey genome and characterized their patterns of expression and regulation, with a focus on the hindbrain and pharynx. Each of the lamprey meis genes displays temporally and spatially dynamic patterns of expression, some of which are coupled to rhombomeric domains in the developing hindbrain and select pharyngeal arches. Studies of Meis loci in mouse and zebrafish have identified enhancers that are bound by Hox and TALE (Meis and Pbx) proteins, implicating these factors in the direct regulation of Meis expression. We examined the lamprey meis loci and identified a series of cis-elements conserved between lamprey and jawed vertebrate meis genes. In transgenic reporter assays we demonstrated that these elements act as neural enhancers in lamprey embryos, directing reporter expression in appropriate domains when compared to expression of their associated endogenous meis gene. Sequence alignments reveal that these conserved elements are in similar relative positions of the meis loci and contain a series of consensus binding motifs for Hox and TALE proteins. This suggests that ancient Hox and TALE-responsive enhancers regulated expression of ancestral vertebrate meis genes in segmental domains in the hindbrain and have been retained in the meis loci during vertebrate evolution. The presence of conserved Meis, Pbx and Hox binding sites in these lamprey enhancers links Hox and TALE factors to regulation of lamprey meis genes in the developing hindbrain, indicating a deep ancestry for these regulatory interactions prior to the divergence of jawed and jawless vertebrates.","['Parker, Hugo J', 'De Kumar, Bony', 'Pushel, Irina', 'Bronner, Marianne E', 'Krumlauf, Robb']","['Parker HJ', 'De Kumar B', 'Pushel I', 'Bronner ME', 'Krumlauf R']","['Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO, 64110, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO, 64110, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO, 64110, USA.', 'Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, 91125, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO, 64110, USA; Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Kansas University Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, 66160, USA.

It is being developed as part of a multiagent chemotherapeutic regimen to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma patients who develop E coli-derived asparaginase hypersensitivity. A population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model was developed for JZP-458 using serum asparaginase activity (SAA) data from a phase 1, single-dose study (JZP458-101) in healthy adults. Effects of intrinsic covariates (body weight, body surface area, age, sex, and race) on JZP-458 PK were evaluated. The model included SAA data from 24 healthy adult participants from the phase 1 study who received JZP-458: intramuscular (IM) data at 12.5 mg/m(2) (N = 6) and 25 mg/m(2) (N = 6), and intravenous (IV) data at 25 mg/m(2) (N = 6) and 37.5 mg/m(2) (N = 6). Model simulations of adult and pediatric SAA profiles were performed to explore the likelihood of achieving a therapeutic target nadir SAA (NSAA) level >/=0.1 IU/mL based on different administration strategies. PopPK modeling and simulation suggest JZP-458 is expected to achieve 72-hour NSAA levels >/=0.1 IU/mL in 100% of adult or pediatric populations receiving IM administration at 25 mg/m(2) , and in 80.9% of adult and 94.5% of pediatric populations receiving IV administration at 37.5 mg/m(2) on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday (M/W/F) dosing schedule. Based on these results, the recommended starting dose for the phase 2/3 pivotal study is 25 mg/m(2) IM or 37.5 mg/m(2) IV on a M/W/F dosing schedule in pediatric and adult patients.","['Lin, Tong', 'Dumas, Todd', 'Kaullen, Josh', 'Berry, N Seth', 'Choi, Mi Rim', 'Zomorodi, Katie', 'Silverman, Jeffrey A']","['Lin T', 'Dumas T', 'Kaullen J', 'Berry NS', 'Choi MR', 'Zomorodi K', 'Silverman JA']","['Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, California, USA.', 'IQVIA, Overland Park, Kansas, USA.', 'IQVIA, Overland Park, Kansas, USA.', 'IQVIA, Overland Park, Kansas, USA.', 'Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, California, USA.', 'Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, California, USA.', 'Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, California, USA.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210726,United States,Clin Pharmacol Drug Dev,Clinical pharmacology in drug development,101572899,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['JZP-458', 'asparaginase', 'asparaginase hypersensitivity', 'healthy adult participants', 'population PK', 'recombinant Erwinia asparaginase', 'serum asparaginase activity']",2021/07/27 06:00,2021/07/27 06:00,['2021/07/26 17:40'],"['2021/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/26 17:40 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cpdd.1002 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Pharmacol Drug Dev. 2021 Dec;10(12):1503-1513. doi: 10.1002/cpdd.1002.

Occasionally, we have observed the entire natural clinical course of one extremely indolent APL patient, who developed from pre-APL stage (<20% promyelocytes in bone marrow) to overt-APL stage (>/=20% promyelocytes in bone marrow) with one nearly 2-year latency. Strikingly, we identified one novel fusion RBCK1-TRIB3 in the pre-APL stage but not overt-APL stage sample.

However, its precise roles in leukemogenesis remain elusive. Here, we show that HOXA9 maintains gene expression for multiple anti-apoptotic pathways to promote leukemogenesis. In MLL fusion-mediated leukemia, MLL fusion directly activates the expression of MYC and HOXA9. Combined expression of MYC and HOXA9 induced leukemia, whereas single gene transduction of either did not, indicating a synergy between MYC and HOXA9. HOXA9 sustained expression of the genes implicated in the hematopoietic precursor identity when expressed in hematopoietic precursors, but did not reactivate it once silenced. Among the HOXA9 target genes, BCL2 and SOX4 synergistically induced leukemia with MYC. Not only BCL2, but also SOX4 suppressed apoptosis, indicating that multiple anti-apoptotic pathways underlie cooperative leukemogenesis by HOXA9 and MYC.

We conducted an open-label, randomized, noninferiority, phase III trial comparing acalabrutinib and ibrutinib in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). METHODS: Patients with previously treated CLL with centrally confirmed del(17)(p13.1) or del(11)(q22.3) were randomly assigned to oral acalabrutinib 100 mg twice daily or ibrutinib 420 mg once daily until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was independent review committee-assessed noninferiority of progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Overall, 533 patients (acalabrutinib, n = 268; ibrutinib, n = 265) were randomly assigned. At the data cutoff, 124 (46.3%) acalabrutinib patients and 109 (41.1%) ibrutinib patients remained on treatment. After a median follow-up of 40.9 months, acalabrutinib was determined to be noninferior to ibrutinib with a median PFS of 38.4 months in both arms (95% CI acalabrutinib, 33.0 to 38.6 and ibrutinib, 33.0 to 41.6; hazard ratio: 1.00; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.27). All-grade atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter incidence was significantly lower with acalabrutinib versus ibrutinib (9.4% v 16.0%; P = .02); among other selected secondary end points, grade 3 or higher infections (30.8% v 30.0%) and Richter transformations (3.8% v 4.9%) were comparable between groups and median overall survival was not reached in either arm (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.15), with 63 (23.5%) deaths with acalabrutinib and 73 (27.5%) with ibrutinib. Treatment discontinuations because of adverse events occurred in 14.7% of acalabrutinib-treated patients and 21.3% of ibrutinib-treated patients. CONCLUSION: In this first direct comparison of less versus more selective Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors in CLL, acalabrutinib demonstrated noninferior PFS with fewer cardiovascular adverse events.","['Byrd, John C', 'Hillmen, Peter', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Kater, Arnon P', 'Chanan-Khan, Asher', 'Furman, Richard R', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Yenerel, Mustafa Nuri', 'Illes, Arpad', 'Kay, Neil', 'Garcia-Marco, Jose A', 'Mato, Anthony', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier', 'Seymour, John F', 'Lepretre, Stephane', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Rothbaum, Wayne', 'Izumi, Raquel', 'Hamdy, Ahmed', 'Patel, Priti', 'Higgins, Kara', 'Sohoni, Sophia', 'Jurczak, Wojciech']","['Byrd JC', 'Hillmen P', 'Ghia P', 'Kater AP', 'Chanan-Khan A', 'Furman RR', ""O'Brien S"", 'Yenerel MN', 'Illes A', 'Kay N', 'Garcia-Marco JA', 'Mato A', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J', 'Seymour JF', 'Lepretre S', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Robak T', 'Rothbaum W', 'Izumi R', 'Hamdy A', 'Patel P', 'Higgins K', 'Sohoni S', 'Jurczak W']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.', ""St James's University Hospital, Leeds, UK."", 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'Amsterdam University Medical Centers, University of Amsterdam, on behalf of Hovon, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Mayo Clinic Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Weill Cornell Medicine, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY.', 'Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California-Irvine, Irvine, CA.', 'Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Mayo Clinic Rochester, Rochester, MN.', 'Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.', 'University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Royal Melbourne Hospital and University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France.', 'Normandie University UNIROUEN, Rouen, France.', 'Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Acerta, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Acerta, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Acerta, South San Francisco, CA.', 'AstraZeneca, South San Francisco, CA.', 'AstraZeneca, South San Francisco, CA.', 'AstraZeneca, South San Francisco, CA.', 'Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, Krakow, Poland.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9830-0711', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5617-4403', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3750-7342', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3190-1891', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1677-7626', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6473-1342', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5951-5055', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8724-1875', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2188-6835']",['eng'],['R35 CA197734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210726,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'I42748ELQW (acalabrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage', 'Survival Rate']",PMC8547923,,,2021/07/27 06:00,2021/12/22 06:00,['2021/07/26 17:15'],"['2022/11/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/22 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/26 17:15 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.21.01210 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2021 Nov 1;39(31):3441-3452. doi: 10.1200/JCO.21.01210.

However, the nonapoptotic functions of MCL1 may influence their therapeutic potential. Overall, the complexity of MCL1 regulation and function represent challenges to the clinical application of MCL1 inhibitors.

Instead, the function and underlying mechanisms of circ_0000143 in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) remain unclear. In this study, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was executed to probe circ_0000143 expression in bone marrow samples from T-ALL patients. T-ALL cell lines (MOLT4 and CCRF-CEM) were used to construct cell models. The biological functions of circ_0000143 were studied by CCK-8 assay, Transwell assay, flow cytometry and Western blotting in vitro. Bioinformatics analysis, dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and RIP assay were applied to predict and validate the interaction between circ_0000143 and miR-142-3p, as well as miR-142-3p and cyclic glucocorticoid receptor alpha (GRalpha). It was revealed that circ_0000143 expression level was significantly reduced in T-ALL samples compared with healthy control. Circ_0000143 overexpression suppressed the viability, migration and invasion, and induced apoptosis of T-ALL cell line.

Here, leveraging efforts from materials science, biocompatible PEGylated arsenene nanodots (AsNDs@PEG) with high monoelemental arsenic purity that can selectively and effectively treat solid tumors are synthesized. The intrinsic selective killing effect of AsNDs@PEG is closely related to high oxidative stress in tumor cells, which leads to an activated valence-change of arsenic (from less toxic As(0) to severely toxic oxidation states), followed by decreased superoxide dismutase activity and massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. These effects occur selectively within cancer cells, causing mitochondrial damage, cell-cycle arrest, and DNA damage. Moreover, AsNDs@PEG when applied in a multi-drug combination strategy with beta-elemene, a plant-derived anticancer drug, achieves synergistic antitumor outcomes, and its newly discovered on-demand photothermal properties facilitate the elimination of the tumors without recurrence, potentially further expanding its clinical utility. In line of the practicability for a large-scale fabrication and negligible systemic toxicity of AsNDs@PEG (even at high doses and with repetitive administration), a new-concept arsenical drug with high therapeutic efficacy for selective solid tumor therapy is provided.","['Liu, Chuang', 'Sun, Shan', 'Feng, Qiang', 'Wu, Gongwei', 'Wu, Yiting', 'Kong, Na', 'Yu, Zhangsen', 'Yao, Junlie', 'Zhang, Xingcai', 'Chen, Wei', 'Tang, Zhongmin', 'Xiao, Yufen', 'Huang, Xiangang', 'Lv, Aman', 'Yao, Chenyang', 'Cheng, Haibo', 'Wu, Aiguo', 'Xie, Tian', 'Tao, Wei']","['Liu C', 'Sun S', 'Feng Q', 'Wu G', 'Wu Y', 'Kong N', 'Yu Z', 'Yao J', 'Zhang X', 'Chen W', 'Tang Z', 'Xiao Y', 'Huang X', 'Lv A', 'Yao C', 'Cheng H', 'Wu A', 'Xie T', 'Tao W']","['Cixi Institute of Biomedical Engineering, CAS Key Laboratory of Magnetic Materials and Devices, Zhejiang Engineering Research Center for Biomedical Materials, Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ningbo, 315201, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China.', ""Center for Nanomedicine and Department of Anesthesiology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", 'Cixi Institute of Biomedical Engineering, CAS Key Laboratory of Magnetic Materials and Devices, Zhejiang Engineering Research Center for Biomedical Materials, Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ningbo, 315201, China.', 'Cixi Institute of Biomedical Engineering, CAS Key Laboratory of Magnetic Materials and Devices, Zhejiang Engineering Research Center for Biomedical Materials, Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ningbo, 315201, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02215, USA.', 'Cixi Institute of Biomedical Engineering, CAS Key Laboratory of Magnetic Materials and Devices, Zhejiang Engineering Research Center for Biomedical Materials, Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ningbo, 315201, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, School of Medicine, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 311121, China.', ""Center for Nanomedicine and Department of Anesthesiology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA."", 'Cixi Institute of Biomedical Engineering, CAS Key Laboratory of Magnetic Materials and Devices, Zhejiang Engineering Research Center for Biomedical Materials, Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ningbo, 315201, China.', 'Cixi Institute of Biomedical Engineering, CAS Key Laboratory of Magnetic Materials and Devices, Zhejiang Engineering Research Center for Biomedical Materials, Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ningbo, 315201, China.', 'John A.

As a pioneer, arsenic trioxide has been approved for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Many in vitro studies suggested that arsenic trioxide could also be used in the treatment of solid tumors. However, the transition from bench to bedside turned out to be challenging, especially in terms of the drug bioavailability and concentration reaching tumor tissues. To address these issues, nanomedicine tools have been proposed. As nanocarriers of arsenic trioxide, various materials have been examined including liposomes, polymer, and inorganic nanoparticles, and many other materials. This review gives an overview of the existing strategies of delivery of arsenic trioxide in cancer treatment with a focus on the drug encapsulation approaches and medicinal impact in the treatment of solid tumors. It focuses on the progress in the last years and gives an outlook and suggestions for further improvements including theragnostic approaches and targeted delivery.","['Sonksen, Marthe', 'Kerl, Kornelius', 'Bunzen, Hana']","['Sonksen M', 'Kerl K', 'Bunzen H']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany."", 'Chair of Solid State and Materials Chemistry, Institute of Physics, University of Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5676-8102', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1824-0291']",['eng'],['2016_A181/Else Kroner-Fresenius-Stiftung'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210726,United States,Med Res Rev,Medicinal research reviews,8103150,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['arsenic trioxide', 'cancer therapy', 'drug delivery', 'nanoparticles', 'theragnostics']",2021/07/27 06:00,2021/07/27 06:00,['2021/07/26 12:37'],"['2021/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/26 12:37 [entrez]']",['10.1002/med.21844 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Res Rev. 2022 Jan;42(1):374-398. doi: 10.1002/med.21844.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A partitioned survival model was developed to determine incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for InO versus SoC. Parametric survival models were fit to overall survival and progression-free survival Kaplan-Meier data from the INO-VATE ALL phase III trial. Two base cases were run using (1) Swedish and (2) Norwegian inputs (costs and discount rates). Core clinical inputs and utilities did not differ between countries. Analyses were then conducted to reflect the preferred assumptions of TLV and NoMA. Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The base case deterministic ICERs for InO versus SoC were euro16,219/quality-adjusted life years (QALY) in Sweden (probabilistic euro19,415) and euro44,405/QALY in Norway (probabilistic euro47,305). The ICERs using our model but applying the preferred assumptions of TLV or NoMA were euro74,061/QALY (probabilistic euro77,484) and euro59,391/QALY (probabilistic euro63,632), respectively. Differences between our base cases and the ICERs with TLV and NoMA settings were mainly explained by the exclusion of productivity costs and use of pooled post-haematopoietic stem-cell transplant (post-HSCT) survival in Sweden and use of higher HSCT costs in Norway. All ICERs remained below the approximated willingness-to-pay thresholds. The probability of InO being cost-effective ranged from 77 to 99% versus SoC. CONCLUSIONS: InO can likely be considered cost-effective versus SoC under our and the HTA-preferred settings.","['van Oostrum, I', 'Russell-Smith, T A', 'Jakobsson, M', 'Torup Ostby, J', 'Heeg, B']","['van Oostrum I', 'Russell-Smith TA', 'Jakobsson M', 'Torup Ostby J', 'Heeg B']","['Ingress-Health, Weena 316-318, 3012 NJ, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Pfizer Inc, New York, USA.

Chemotherapy and radiation therapy and other medications are employed to treat various types of cancer. However, each treatment has its own set of side effects, owing to its low specificity. As a result, there is an urgent need for newer therapeutics that do not disrupt healthy cells' normal functioning. Depriving nutrient or non/semi-essential amino acids to which cancerous cells are auxotrophic remains one such promising anticancer strategy. L-Arginine (Arg) is a semi-essential vital amino acid involved in versatile metabolic processes, signaling pathways, and cancer cell proliferation. Hence, the administration of Arg depriving enzymes (ADE) such as arginase, arginine decarboxylase (ADC), and arginine deiminase (ADI) could be effective in cancer therapy. The Arg auxotrophic cancerous cells like hepatocellular carcinoma, human colon cancer, leukemia, and breast cancer cells are sensitive to ADE treatment due to low expression of crucial enzymes argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), and ornithine transcarbamylase (OCT). These therapeutic enzyme treatments induce cell death through inducing autophagy, apoptosis, generation of oxidative species, i.e., oxidative stress, and arresting the progression and expansion of cancerous cells at certain cell cycle checkpoints. The enzymes are undergoing clinical trials and could be successfully exploited as potential anticancer agents in the future.","['Kumari, Neha', 'Bansal, Saurabh']","['Kumari N', 'Bansal S']","['Department of Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Jaypee University of Information Technology Waknaghat, Solan, 173234, Himachal Pradesh, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Jaypee University of Information Technology Waknaghat, Solan, 173234, Himachal Pradesh, India. saurab.bansal02@gmail.com.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0574-4063'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210726,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzymes)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arginine/*metabolism', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzymes/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Arginase', '*Arginine decarboxylase', '*Arginine deiminase', '*Argininosuccinate synthetase', '*Auxotrophic cancer', '*Deprivation therapy', '*Therapeutic enzyme']",2021/07/27 06:00,2021/11/19 06:00,['2021/07/26 12:30'],"['2021/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/19 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/26 12:30 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-021-04335-w [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-021-04335-w [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2021 Oct;88(4):565-594. doi: 10.1007/s00280-021-04335-w.

This update assessed growth and safety profiles in patients who had completed >/=48, 28-day treatment cycles of nilotinib 230 mg/m2 twice daily, or previously discontinued the study. Height was assessed regularly and reported using standard deviation scores (SDSs) based on World Health Organization growth charts. All data were summarized descriptively (cutoff, 6 March 2019). Overall, 33 patients in the R/I cohort and 25 patients in the ND cohort received nilotinib. Each cohort showed a negative slope in height SDS over the course of the study, indicating attenuated growth rates during nilotinib treatment: overall median change from baseline in height SDS after 48 cycles was -0.54 SDS (range, - 1.6 to 0.4) and -0.91 SDS (-1.4 to -0.1) in R/I and ND cohorts, respectively.

This study evaluated the effect of bisphosphonate (BP) treatment on the evolution of ON lesions in childhood ALL.Material and Methods: We included a national cohort of ALL patients diagnosed with symptomatic ON before 18 years of age and treated with BPs (N = 10; five males). Patients were followed both clinically and with serial MRIs. ON lesions were graded according to the Niinimaki classification.Results: The 10 patients had a total of 55 ON lesions. The median age was 13.3 years at ALL diagnosis and 14.8 years at ON diagnosis. Four patients had received HSCT before the ON diagnosis. BPs used were pamidronate (N = 7), alendronate (N = 2) and ibandronate (N = 1). The duration of BP treatment varied between 4 months and 4 years. In 4/10 patients, BP treatment was given during the chemotherapy. BPs were well-tolerated, with no severe complications or changes in kidney function. At the end of follow up 13/55 (24%) ON lesions were completely healed both clinically and radiographically; all these lesions were originally graded 3 or less. In contrast, ON lesions originally classified as grade 5 (joint destruction; N = 4) remained at grade 5. All grade 5 hip joint lesions needed surgical treatment. During BP treatment, the pain was relieved in 7/10 patients. At the end of follow-up, none of the patients reported severe or frequent pain.Conclusion: BP treatment was safe and seemed effective in relieving ON-induced pain in childhood ALL. After articular collapse (grade 5) lesions did not improve with BP treatment. Randomized controlled studies are needed to further elucidate the role of BPs in childhood ALL-associated ON.","['Utriainen, Pauliina', 'Niinimaki, Tuukka T', 'Huurre, Anu J', 'Vepsalainen, Kaisa L', 'Makitie, Outi M', 'Niinimaki, Riitta A']","['Utriainen P', 'Niinimaki TT', 'Huurre AJ', 'Vepsalainen KL', 'Makitie OM', 'Niinimaki RA']","[""Children's Hospital and Pediatric Research Center, University of Helsinki, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland."", 'Research Program for Clinical and Molecular Metabolism, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Surgery, Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.', 'Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Turku University Hospital, FICAN-West, Turku University, Turku, Finland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kuopio University Hospital, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland.', ""Children's Hospital and Pediatric Research Center, University of Helsinki, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland."", 'Research Program for Clinical and Molecular Metabolism, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.', 'PEDEGO Unit, University of Oulu, Finland.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9148-9291'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210726,England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,"['0 (Bone Density Conservation Agents)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', 'OYY3447OMC (Pamidronate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Bone Density Conservation Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Diphosphonates/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Osteonecrosis/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy', 'Pamidronate', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Radiography']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'bisphosphonates', 'child', 'magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)', 'osteonecrosis']",2021/07/27 06:00,2021/08/25 06:00,['2021/07/26 12:20'],"['2021/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/26 12:20 [entrez]']",['10.1080/0284186X.2021.1950928 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2021 Sep;60(9):1140-1145. doi: 10.1080/0284186X.2021.1950928.

Results showed that miR-148a-3p played a crucial role in AML, and the level was lower in AML cells, especially in J111 and KG-1a cells. In J111 and KG-1a cells, the up-regulation of miR-148a-3p mimics blocked the cell growth by arresting cell cycle at G2/M and enhancing cell apoptosis. Transwell and EMT markers detection indicated that miR-148a-3p reduced the cell migration and invasion. Afterward, through bioinformatics analysis, it showed that the CDK6 is one of the direct target genes of miR-148a-3p. DLR assay confirmed the target regulation. CDK6 overexpression reversed the effects of miR-148a-3p on AML cells. Collectively, miR-148a-3p inhibited the process of AML cells through disturbing the CDK-6 expression, implying that the trageting miR-148a-3p might be regarded as effective therapy of AML.","['Zhou, Hong', 'Jia, Xiaofeng', 'Yang, Fan', 'Shi, Pengfei']","['Zhou H', 'Jia X', 'Yang F', 'Shi P']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."", 'College of Life Sciences, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.""]",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8888-3845'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Bioengineered,Bioengineered,101581063,"['0 (MIRN148 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', '*Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*CDK6', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*invasion', '*migration', '*mir-148a-3p', '*proliferation']",2021/07/27 06:00,2021/12/16 06:00,['2021/07/26 08:49'],"['2021/07/26 08:49 [entrez]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/21655979.2021.1956400 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioengineered. 2021 Dec;12(1):4508-4519. doi: 10.1080/21655979.2021.1956400.,4508-4519,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Survival rates vary considerably according to the cancer type. The purpose of this study was to analyze long-term survival trends for cancer types with the highest mortality among AYAs to determine where the greatest burden is and to identify areas for future research. METHODS: Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry and the National Center for Health Statistics, the authors examined the incidence, mortality, and survival for the 9 cancer types with the highest mortality rates in this age group from 1975 to 2016. JPSurv, new survival trend software, was used in the analysis. RESULTS: Results suggested significant improvements in 5-year relative survival for brain and other nervous system tumors, colon and rectum cancer, lung and bronchus cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (all P values < .05). Limited or no improvement in survival was found for female breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, and bone and joint sarcomas. CONCLUSIONS: Five-year relative survival for multiple cancer types in AYAs has improved, but some common cancer types in this group still show limited survival improvements (eg, ovarian cancer). Survival improvements in colorectal cancer have been overshadowed by its rising incidence, which suggests a substantial disease burden. Future research should focus on female breast, bone, ovarian, and cervical cancers, which have seen minimal or no improvements in survival. LAY SUMMARY: Survival trends for adolescents and young adults with cancer are presented from a 40-year period. Although survival progress is noted for brain cancer, lung cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and colon and rectum cancer, the incidence of colon and rectum cancer remains high. Minimal progress is evident for female breast, bone, ovarian, and cervical cancers, which are in need of renewed focus.","['Lewis, Denise Riedel', 'Siembida, Elizabeth J', 'Seibel, Nita L', 'Smith, Ashley Wilder', 'Mariotto, Angela B']","['Lewis DR', 'Siembida EJ', 'Seibel NL', 'Smith AW', 'Mariotto AB']","['Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Center for Health Innovation and Outcomes Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York.', 'Division of Cancer Treatment and Detection, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3385-2958', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1131-8359', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6259-7955']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210726,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)', 'adolescent and young adult', 'cancer', 'epidemiology', 'survival trends', 'survivorship']",2021/07/27 06:00,2021/07/27 06:00,['2021/07/26 06:58'],"['2021/06/10 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/26 06:58 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33793 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2021 Nov 15;127(22):4277-4286. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33793.

This study aimed to clarify factors associated with in-hospital death in patients with coagulopathy during induction therapy for APL. We retrospectively identified patients with newly diagnosed APL who received induction therapy including all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and developed coagulopathy, using a nationwide inpatient database in Japan. Of 1115 eligible patients, 175 (15%) died at a median of 13 days (interquartile range, 7-30) after admission. In the multivariable analysis, compared with younger patients (aged < 40 years), the occurrence of in-hospital death was significantly more common among older patients (aged >/= 40 and < 60 years: odds ratio = 2.58 [95% confidence interval: 1.29-5.19]; aged >/= 60 and < 80 years: 7.66 [3.89-15.10]; aged >/= 80 years: 16.83 [7.41-38.21]). Delayed initiation of ATRA and no conventional chemotherapy were significantly associated with in-hospital death (1.79 [1.16-2.76] and 2.40 [1.47-3.92], respectively). A total of 699 patients (63%) received anticoagulant therapies, but none of these was significantly associated with lower mortality. Although the present study was constrained by a lack of laboratory findings because of database limitations, the results showed that untreated patients with APL, especially the elderly, had a poor prognosis. Immediate administration of ATRA may reduce in-hospital mortality.","['Matsuda, Kensuke', 'Jo, Taisuke', 'Toyama, Kazuhiro', 'Nakazaki, Kumi', 'Matsui, Hiroki', 'Fushimi, Kiyohide', 'Yasunaga, Hideo', 'Kurokawa, Mineo']","['Matsuda K', 'Jo T', 'Toyama K', 'Nakazaki K', 'Matsui H', 'Fushimi K', 'Yasunaga H', 'Kurokawa M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.

Intensive ALL treatment schedules including corticosteroids and asparaginase have been shown to give rise to skeletal abnormalities such as osteonecrosis and low bone mineral density (BMD), which may lead to debilitating sequelae in survivors. Although osteonecrosis and low BMD are different entities with suggested separate pathophysiological mechanisms, recent studies indicate that osteonecrosis is associated with accelerated BMD decline. Common underlying mechanisms for osteonecrosis and BMD decline are considered, such as an enhanced sensitivity to corticosteroids in children who suffer from both osteonecrosis and low BMD. In addition, restriction of weight-bearing activities, which is generally advised in patients with osteonecrosis, could aggravate BMD decline. This induces a clinical dilemma, since bone stimulation is important to maintain BMD but alternative interventions for osteonecrosis are limited. Furthermore, this recent finding of accelerated BMD decline in children with osteonecrosis emphasizes the need to develop effective preventive measures for osteonecrosis, which may include targeting BMD decline.","['van Atteveld, Jenneke E', 'de Winter, Demi Tc', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Neggers, Sebastian Jcmm', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M']","['van Atteveld JE', 'de Winter DT', 'Pieters R', 'Neggers SJ', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM']","['Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Heidelberglaan 25, 3584 CS Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Heidelberglaan 25, 3584 CS Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Heidelberglaan 25, 3584 CS Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Heidelberglaan 25, 3584 CS Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Heidelberglaan 25, 3584 CS Utrecht, the Netherlands.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210623,England,Fac Rev,Faculty reviews,101769226,,,,PMC8265561,['NOTNLM'],"['Osteonecrosis', 'bone mineral density', 'childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",2021/07/27 06:00,2021/07/27 06:01,['2021/07/26 06:52'],"['2021/07/26 06:52 [entrez]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.12703/r/10-57 [doi]'],epublish,Fac Rev. 2021 Jun 23;10:57. doi: 10.12703/r/10-57. eCollection 2021.,57,['Copyright: (c) 2021 van Atteveld JE et al.'],,,,"['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.No competing interests', 'were disclosed.No competing interests were disclosed.No competing interests were', 'disclosed.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a novel gene network approach, we integrated DNA methylation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 194 cases) with the corresponding gene expression profile. Our integrated gene network analysis classified AML patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups. The identified high-risk group had significantly shorter overall survival compared to the low-risk group (p-value </=10(-11)). Specifically, our approach identified a particular subgroup of nine high-risk AML cases that died within 2 years after diagnosis. These high-risk cases otherwise would be incorrectly classified as intermediate-risk solely based on cytogenetics, mutation profiles, and common molecular characteristics of AML. We confirmed the prognostic value of our integrative gene network approach using two independent datasets, as well as through comparison with European LeukemiaNet and LSC17 criteria. Our approach could be useful in the prognostication of a subset of borderline AML cases. These cases would not be classified into appropriate risk groups by other approaches that use gene expression, but not DNA methylation data. Our findings highlight the significance of epigenomic data, and they indicate integrating DNA methylation data with gene coexpression networks can have a synergistic effect.","['Samimi, Hanie', 'Mehta, Isha', 'Docking, Thomas Roderick', 'Zainulabadeen, Aamir', 'Karsan, Aly', 'Zare, Habil']","['Samimi H', 'Mehta I', 'Docking TR', 'Zainulabadeen A', 'Karsan A', 'Zare H']","['Department of Computer Science, Texas State University, San Marcos, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Cell Systems & Anatomy, The University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, Texas, USA.', ""Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", 'Department of Computer Science, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, USA.', ""Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", 'Department of Cell Systems & Anatomy, The University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, Texas, USA.', ""Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer's and Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Texas Health Sciences Center, San Antonio, Texas, USA.""]","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6753-892X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5902-6238']",['eng'],['RF1 AG063507/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20210313,United States,EJHaem,EJHaem,101761942,,,,PMC8294109,,,2021/07/27 06:00,2021/07/27 06:01,['2021/07/26 06:52'],"['2022/05/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/07/26 06:52 [entrez]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1002/jha2.187 [doi]'],ppublish,EJHaem. 2021 May;2(2):211-218. doi: 10.1002/jha2.187.

Here we show that AMP kinase (AMPK) activators can induce the reversion of primed mouse epiblast stem cells (mEpiSCs) to the naive pluripotent state. The addition of AMPK activators alone or together with leukemia inhibitory factor to primed mEpiSCs induced the appearance of naive-like cells. After passaging in naive culture conditions, the colony morphology, protein expression, and global gene expression profiles indicated the naive state, as did germline transmission ability. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies suggested that p38 is a critical downstream target in AMPK activation. Finally, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the reversion process through AMPK signaling passes an intermediate naive-like population. In conclusion, the AMPK pathway is a critical driving force in the reversion of primed to naive pluripotency.","['Liu, Yajing', 'Yamane, Junko', 'Tanaka, Akito', 'Fujibuchi, Wataru', 'Yamashita, Jun K']","['Liu Y', 'Yamane J', 'Tanaka A', 'Fujibuchi W', 'Yamashita JK']","['The Department of Cell Growth and Differentiation, Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'The Department of Life Science Frontiers, Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'The Department of Animal Research Facility, Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'The Department of Life Science Frontiers, Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'The Department of Cell Growth and Differentiation, Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210625,United States,iScience,iScience,101724038,,,,PMC8283141,['NOTNLM'],"['Cell biology', 'Stem cells research', 'Transcriptomics']",2021/07/27 06:00,2021/07/27 06:01,['2021/07/26 06:48'],"['2020/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/01 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/26 06:48 [entrez]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.isci.2021.102783 [doi]', 'S2589-0042(21)00751-3 [pii]']",epublish,iScience. 2021 Jun 25;24(7):102783. doi: 10.1016/j.isci.2021.102783. eCollection 2021 Jul 23.,102783,['(c) 2021 The Author(s).'],,,,"['Y.L. and J.K.Y. applied for a patent related to this work as co-inventors.

Here, we report the case of a 61-year-old male undergoing a conditioning regimen with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and 2-Gy total body irradiation in preparation of a haplo-identical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). He received the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine 6 weeks prior allo-HSCT and was hospitalized a month prior because of a COVID-19 bilateral pneumonia. On discharge, he showed two negative SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal PCR swabs as well as a high SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer. On admission for allo-HSCT, he tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 again. Conditioning with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and 2-Gy total body irradiation was started and the patient developed lymphopenia. During his hospital stay, he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in a PCR test twice but remained asymptomatic. The conditioning regimen was continued as planned. Later during his stay, the patient showed undetectable SARS-CoV-2 load four times. This case documents possible reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and raises questions about reactivation risks among recipients of stem cell transplants and other immunocompromised patients.","['Via, Vera Dalla', 'von Rotz, Matthias', 'Battig, Veronika', 'Leuzinger, Karoline', 'Hirsch, Hans H', 'Passweg, Jakob', 'Stussi, Georg', 'Medinger, Michael']","['Via VD', 'von Rotz M', 'Battig V', 'Leuzinger K', 'Hirsch HH', 'Passweg J', 'Stussi G', 'Medinger M']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Petersgraben 4, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland.grid.410567.1', 'Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.grid.410567.1', 'Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.grid.410567.1', 'Clinical Virology, Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.grid.410567.1', 'Transplantation and Clinical Virology, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.grid.6612.30000 0004 1937 0642', 'Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.grid.410567.1', 'Clinical Virology, Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.grid.410567.1', 'Transplantation and Clinical Virology, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.grid.6612.30000 0004 1937 0642', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Petersgraben 4, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland.grid.410567.1', 'Oncological Institute of Italian Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Petersgraben 4, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland.grid.410567.1', 'Division of Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.grid.410567.1']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0427-7747'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210720,Switzerland,SN Compr Clin Med,SN comprehensive clinical medicine,101740833,,,,PMC8294269,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2']",2021/07/27 06:00,2021/07/27 06:00,['2021/07/26 06:47'],"['2021/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/26 06:47 [entrez]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s42399-021-01020-0 [doi]', '1020 [pii]']",aheadofprint,SN Compr Clin Med. 2021 Jul 20:1-5. doi: 10.1007/s42399-021-01020-0.,1-5,['(c) The Author(s) 2021.'],,,,['Conflict of InterestThe authors declare no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primary MDS is a potentially premalignant clonal disorder that may progress to overt acute leukemia in 25%-50% of cases. However, most of these cases evolve into acute myeloid leukemia and rarely progress to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Thus, transformation of MDS into B-cell ALL is rare. CASE SUMMARY: A 58-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for reduced blood cell counts. Based on all the test results and the World Health Organization diagnosis and classification, the patient was finally diagnosed with ring-shaped sideroblastic MDS with refractory hemocytopenia due to multilineage dysplasia. We used red blood cell transfusions and other symptomatic support treatments. After 4 years, the patient felt dizziness, fatigue, and night sweats. We improved bone marrow and peripheral blood and other related auxiliary examinations. He was eventually diagnosed with B-lineage acute lymphocytic leukemia (MDS transformation). CONCLUSION: The number of peripheral blood cells, type of MDS, proportion of primitive cells in bone marrow, and number and quality of karyotypes are all closely related to the conversion of MDS to ALL.","['Zhu, Ye-Jing', 'Ma, Xiang-Yu', 'Hao, Yun-Liang', 'Guan, Yun']","['Zhu YJ', 'Ma XY', 'Hao YL', 'Guan Y']","['Department of Clinical Medicine, Clinical College of Jining Medical University, Jining 272000, Shandong Province, China.', ""Department of Science and Education, People's Hospital of Rizhao, Rizhao 276800, Shandong Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Jining First People's Hospital, Jining 272000, Shandong Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Jining First People's Hospital, Jining 272000, Shandong Province, China. gyuanun1989@163.com.""]",,['eng'],,['Case Reports'],,United States,World J Clin Cases,World journal of clinical cases,101618806,,,,PMC8283593,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'B-lineage acute lymphocytic leukemia', 'Case report', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes']",2021/07/27 06:00,2021/07/27 06:01,['2021/07/26 06:39'],"['2020/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/26 06:39 [entrez]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.12998/wjcc.v9.i19.5191 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Clin Cases. 2021 Jul 6;9(19):5191-5196. doi: 10.12998/wjcc.v9.i19.5191.,5191-5196,"['(c)The Author(s) 2021.

This study was designed to investigate the role of p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) in AML progression and chemosensitivity, highlighting the mechanism of stroma-mediated chemoresistance. Methods: The GEPIA and TCGA datasets were used to analyze the relationship between PAK1 mRNA expression and various clinical parameters of AML patients. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined to evaluate the role of PAK1 on chemosensitivity in AML by silencing PAK1 with shRNA or small molecular inhibitor. Human BMSC (HS-5) was utilized to mimic the leukemia bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) in vitro, and co-culture model was established to investigate the role of PAK1 in BMSC-mediated drug resistance. Results: p21-activated kinase 1 high expression was shown to be associated with shorter overall survival in AML patients. The silence of PAK1 could repress cell proliferation, promote apoptosis, and enhance the sensitivity of AML cells to chemotherapeutic agents. More importantly, BMSCs induced PAK1 up-regulation in AML cells, subsequently activating the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. The effect of BMSC-mediated apoptotic-resistance could be partly reversed by knock down of PAK1. Conclusion: p21-activated kinase 1 is a potential prognostic predictor for AML patients. PAK1 may play a pivotal role in mediating BMM-induced drug resistance, representing a novel therapeutic target in AML.","['Li, Banban', 'Jia, Ruinan', 'Li, Wei', 'Zhou, Ying', 'Guo, Dongmei', 'Teng, Qingliang', 'Du, Shenghong', 'Li, Mingying', 'Li, Wei', 'Sun, Tao', 'Ma, Daoxin', 'Ji, Min', 'Ji, Chunyan']","['Li B', 'Jia R', 'Li W', 'Zhou Y', 'Guo D', 'Teng Q', 'Du S', 'Li M', 'Li W', 'Sun T', 'Ma D', 'Ji M', 'Ji C']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Taian City Central Hospital, Taian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Taian City Central Hospital, Taian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Taian City Central Hospital, Taian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Taian City Central Hospital, Taian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Shandong Key Laboratory of Immunohematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Shandong Key Laboratory of Immunohematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210708,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,PMC8297649,['NOTNLM'],"['ERK1/2', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'bone marrow stromal cell', 'drug resistance', 'p21-activated kinase 1']",2021/07/27 06:00,2021/07/27 06:01,['2021/07/26 06:38'],"['2021/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/26 06:38 [entrez]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.686695 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Jul 8;9:686695. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.686695. eCollection 2021.,686695,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Li, Jia, Li, Zhou, Guo, Teng, Du, Li, Li, Sun, Ma, Ji and Ji.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 109 children receiving chemotherapy for acute leukemia in our hospital from January 2018 to January 2020 were selected as research subjects. The children were divided into the control group (n=53) and the observation group (n=56) on the basis of admission time point. The control-group children were given conventional nursing measures, and the observation-group children received informatization-based extended nursing care. Patients, self-care ability and their satisfaction with nursing care, and children's quality of life, anxiety and depression between the two groups were compared prior and post intervention. RESULTS: After intervention, the score in each dimension and the total scores of caring abilities in the two groups of patients increased remarkably than those before intervention (P<0.05), and the caring skills, health knowledge and the improvement of total score of nursing ability in observation group was more obvious than which in the control group (P<0.05). Besides, the score in each dimension and the total scores of the living quality in the two groups of children after intervention increased significantly than those before intervention (P<0.05), and the indexes in observation group were remarkably higher than those in control group (P<0.05). The scores of anxiety and depression in both groups after intervention were significantly lower than those before intervention (P<0.05), and the reduction degree in observation group was greater than that in control group (P<0.05). In addition, the satisfaction rate of parents in observation group was notably higher than that in control group (P<0.05).

The inhibitory effects of 12-epi-napelline on K-562 and HL-60 cells were evaluated using the CCK-8 assay, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry, and the expression of related proteins was measured by western blot. A K-562 tumor model was established to evaluate the antitumor effect of 12-epi-napelline in vivo. A reduction in leukemia cell viability was observed after treatment with 12-epi-napelline. It was determined that the cell cycle was arrested in the G0/G1 phase, and the cell apoptosis rate was increased. Moreover, caspase-3 and Bcl-2 were downregulated, whereas cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9 were upregulated. Further study revealed that 12-epi-napelline could suppress the expression of PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, and mTOR. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) attenuated 12-epi-napelline-induced apoptosis and ameliorated the repression of PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, and mTOR by 12-epi-napelline.

This beneficial effect is derived mainly from graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects mediated by alloreactive T cells. However, these alloreactive T cells can also induce graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a life-threatening complication after allo-HSCT. Significant progress has been made in the dissociation of GVL effects from GVHD by modulating alloreactive T cell immunity. However, many factors may influence alloreactive T cell responses in the host undergoing allo-HSCT, including the interaction of alloreactive T cells with both donor and recipient hematopoietic cells and host non-hematopoietic tissues, cytokines, chemokines and inflammatory mediators. Interferons (IFNs), including type I IFNs and IFN-gamma, primarily produced by monocytes, dendritic cells and T cells, play essential roles in regulating alloreactive T cell differentiation and function. Many studies have shown pleiotropic effects of IFNs on allogeneic T cell responses during GVH reaction. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, are important to regulate IFNs' production and function during GVHD. In this review, we discuss recent findings from preclinical models and clinical studies that characterize T cell responses regulated by IFNs and epigenetic mechanisms, and further discuss pharmacological approaches that modulate epigenetic effects in the setting of allo-HSCT.","['Zhao, Chenchen', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Zheng, Hong']","['Zhao C', 'Zhang Y', 'Zheng H']","['Penn State Cancer Institute, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, United States.', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Penn State Cancer Institute, Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, United States.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210708,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'DNA Methylation', 'Disease Susceptibility', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/*etiology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferons/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism']",PMC8297501,['NOTNLM'],"['*GVHD', '*IFN- gamma', '*alloreactive T cells', '*epigenetic regulation', '*type I interferon']",2021/07/27 06:00,2021/12/21 06:00,['2021/07/26 06:24'],"['2021/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/26 06:24 [entrez]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.717540 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Jul 8;12:717540. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.717540. eCollection 2021.,717540,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhao, Zhang and Zheng.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far, the broad application of peptide vaccines in cancer patients is hampered by challenges of time- and cost-intensive personalized vaccine design, and the lack of neoepitopes from tumor-specific mutations, especially in low-mutational burden malignancies. In this study, we developed an immunopeptidome-guided workflow for the design of tumor-associated off-the-shelf peptide warehouses for broadly applicable personalized therapeutics. Comparative mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidome analyses of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) samples, as representative example of low-mutational burden tumor entities, and a dataset of benign tissue samples enabled the identification of high-frequent non-mutated CLL-associated antigens. These antigens were further shown to be recognized by pre-existing and de novo induced T cells in CLL patients and healthy volunteers, and were evaluated as pre-manufactured warehouse for the construction of personalized multi-peptide vaccines in a first clinical trial for CLL (NCT04688385). This workflow for the design of peptide warehouses is easily transferable to other tumor entities and can provide the foundation for the development of broad personalized T cell-based immunotherapy

The clinical, molecular, and immunological features; function of neutrophils; and prognosis of patients with SCN4 have not been fully elucidated. Methods: Two Chinese pediatric patients with G6PC3 mutations were enrolled in this study. Clinical data, genetic and immunologic characteristics, and neutrophil function were evaluated in patients and controls before and after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment. Results: Both patients had histories of pneumonia, inguinal hernia, cryptorchidism, and recurrent oral ulcers. Patient 1 also had asthma and otitis media, and patient 2 presented with prominent ectatic superficial veins and inflammatory bowel disease. DNA sequencing demonstrated that both patients harbored heterozygous G6PC3 gene mutations. Spontaneous and FAS-induced neutrophil apoptosis were significantly increased in patients, and improved only slightly after G-CSF treatment, while neutrophil respiratory burst and neutrophil extracellular traps production remained impaired in patients after G-CSF treatment. Conclusion: G-CSF treatment is insufficient for patients with SCN4 patients, who remain at risk of infection. Where possible, regular G-CSF treatment, long-term prevention of infection, are the optimal methods for cure of SCN4 patients. It is important to monitor closely for signs of leukemia in SCN4 patients. Once leukemia occurs in SCN4 patients, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the most important choice of treatment.","['Dai, Rongxin', 'Lv, Ge', 'Li, Wenyan', 'Tang, Wenjing', 'Chen, Junjie',

DNA methylation is most extensively studied epigenetic alteration in malignancies. Recent research studies in the field have brought out translational implications of promoter methylation of tumor suppressor gene p15 in tumors. Therefore, we studied the role of DNA Methylation of p15 gene in AML and MDS. Methods: The study was carried out in 41 consecutive AML/MDS cases reporting to hematological OPD of a tertiary care center along with 25 age and sex-matched healthy controls. The methylation status in the promoter region of the p15 gene was assessed by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) from blood samples after ethical approval and informed consent of the patients and controls. The association of methylation status was studied with clinical presentations, AML subtypes, and cytogenetics using Chi-square test/Fisher's exact test tools. Results: A total of 41 cases included in the study comprised 33 cases of AML and 08 cases of MDS with an age range between 06 months and 82 years. Of the 41 cases, 29 revealed promoter methylation of the p15 gene, which compared to healthy controls was found statistically significant (p < 0.001). The methylation status did not significantly correlate with AML subtypes or the cytogenetic abnormalities detected in cases. Conclusion: The outcome of the study indicates p15 promoter DNA methylation in cases of AML and MDS may identify those individuals who might benefit from the targeted therapeutic approaches.","['Sampath, Sangeetha', 'Misra, Pratibha', 'Yadav, Sandeep Kumar', 'Sharma, Sanjeevan', 'Somasundaram, Venkatesan']","['Sampath S', 'Misra P', 'Yadav SK', 'Sharma S', 'Somasundaram V']","['Professor (Biochemistry), Command Hospital (Air Force), Bengaluru, India.', 'Professor & Head, Department of Biochemistry, Armed Forces Medical College, Pune, India.', 'Assistant Professor, Subharti Medical College, SVSU, Meerut, UP, India.', 'Senior Advisor (Medicine & Hematology), Command Hospital (Central Command), Lucknow, India.', 'Senior Advisor (Pathology) & Hematopathologist, Army Hospital (R&R), Delhi Cantt, India.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210626,India,Med J Armed Forces India,"Medical journal, Armed Forces India",7602492,,,,PMC8282539,['NOTNLM'],"['Bisulfite modification', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenetics', 'Hematological malignancy', 'INK4b']",2021/07/27 06:00,2021/07/27 06:01,['2021/07/26 06:15'],"['2020/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/07/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/07/26 06:15 [entrez]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.mjafi.2021.04.014 [doi]', 'S0377-1237(21)00116-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Med J Armed Forces India. 2021 Jul;77(3):337-342. doi: 10.1016/j.mjafi.2021.04.014.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of miRNA-101 on the sensitivity of A549 lung cancer cells to etoposide. Methods: The study was conducted during 2018 and 2019 at Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran. The effect of miRNA-101 on Mcl-1 expression was assessed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), and trypan blue exclusion assays were performed to determine the effect of treatments on cell survival and proliferation, respectively. The interaction between miRNA-101 and etoposide was evaluated using the combination index analysis of Chou-Talalay. Apoptosis was quantified using ELISA cell death assay. ANOVA and Bonferroni's tests were used to determine statistical differences between the groups (P<0.05). GraphPad Prism software (version 6.01) was used for data analysis. Results: The results showed that miRNA-101 clearly inhibited the expression of Mcl-1 and reduced the growth of A549 cells, relative to blank control and negative control miRNA (P<0.05). Transfection of miRNA-101 synergistically enhanced the sensitivity of the A549 cells to etoposide. Apoptosis assay data also showed that miRNA-101 triggered apoptosis and augmented the etoposide-mediated apoptosis. Conclusion: Up-regulation of miRNA-101 inhibited cell survival and proliferation, and sensitized A549 cells to etoposide by suppressing Mcl-1 expression. miRNA-101 replacement therapy can be considered as an effective therapeutic strategy in non-small cell lung cancer.","['Shahverdi, Mahshid', 'Amri, Jamal', 'Karami, Hadi', 'Baazm, Maryam']","['Shahverdi M', 'Amri J', 'Karami H', 'Baazm M']","['Molecular and Medicine Research Center, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Biotechnology, School of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Traditional and Complementary Medicine Research Center, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Biotechnology, School of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Iran,Iran J Med Sci,Iranian journal of medical sciences,8104374,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (MIRN101 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques/methods', 'Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Iran', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'MicroRNAs/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*drug effects']",PMC8288490,['NOTNLM'],"['* Apoptosis', '* Etoposide', '* Lung neoplasms', '* MicroRNA-101', '* Myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 protein']",2021/07/27 06:00,2021/07/27 06:01,['2021/07/26 06:14'],"['2019/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/31 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/26 06:14 [entrez]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.30476/ijms.2020.83173.1203 [doi]', 'IJMS-46-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Iran J Med Sci. 2021 Jul;46(4):298-307. doi: 10.30476/ijms.2020.83173.1203.,298-307,['Copyright: (c) Iranian Journal of Medical Sciences.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The field of allo-HCT has witnessed significant advances, including broadening indications for transplantation, availability of alternative donor sources, less toxic preparative regimens, new cell manipulation techniques, and novel GVHD prevention methods, all of which have expanded the applicability of the procedure. These advances have led to clinical practice conundrums when applying traditional definitions of hematopoietic recovery, graft rejection, graft failure, poor graft function, and donor chimerism, because these may vary based on donor type, cell source, cell dose, primary disease, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, and conditioning intensity, among other variables. To address these contemporary challenges, we surveyed a panel of allo-HCT experts in an attempt to standardize these definitions. We analyzed survey responses from adult and pediatric transplantation physicians separately. Consensus was achieved for definitions of neutrophil and platelet recovery, graft rejection, graft failure, poor graft function, and donor chimerism, but not for delayed engraftment. Here we highlight the complexities associated with the management of mixed donor chimerism in malignant and nonmalignant hematologic diseases, which remains an area for future research. We recognize that there are multiple other specific, and at times complex, clinical scenarios for which clinical management must be individualized.","['Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A', 'Kumar, Ambuj', 'Ayala, Ernesto', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Nishihori, Taiga', 'Marsh, Rebecca', 'Burroughs, Lauri M', 'Majhail, Navneet', 'Al-Homsi, A Samer', 'Al-Kadhimi, Zaid S', 'Bar, Merav', 'Bertaina, Alice', 'Boelens, Jaap J', 'Champlin, Richard', 'Chaudhury, Sonali', 'DeFilipp, Zachariah', 'Dholaria, Bhagirathbhai', 'El-Jawahri, Areej', 'Fanning, Suzanne', 'Fraint, Ellen', 'Gergis, Usama', 'Giralt, Sergio', 'Hamilton, Betty K', 'Hashmi, Shahrukh K', 'Horn, Biljana', 'Inamoto, Yoshihiro', 'Jacobsohn, David A', 'Jain, Tania', 'Johnston, Laura', 'Kanate, Abraham S', 'Kansagra, Ankit', 'Kassim, Adetola', 'Kean, Leslie S', 'Kitko, Carrie L', 'Knight-Perry, Jessica', 'Kurtzberg, Joanne', 'Liu, Hien', 'MacMillan, Margaret L', 'Mahmoudjafari, Zahra', 'Mielcarek, Marco', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Nemecek, Eneida', 'Olson, Timothy S', 'Oran, Betul', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel', 'Prockop, Susan E', 'Pulsipher, Michael A', 'Pusic, Iskra', 'Riches, Marcie L', 'Rodriguez, Cesar', 'Romee, Rizwan', 'Rondon, Gabriela', 'Saad, Ayman', 'Shah, Nina', 'Shaw, Peter J', 'Shenoy, Shalini', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Talano, Julie', 'Verneris, Michael R', 'Veys, Paul', 'Wagner, John E', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Hamadani, Mehdi', 'Carpenter, Paul A']","['Kharfan-Dabaja MA', 'Kumar A', 'Ayala E', 'Aljurf M', 'Nishihori T', 'Marsh R', 'Burroughs LM', 'Majhail N', 'Al-Homsi AS', 'Al-Kadhimi ZS', 'Bar M', 'Bertaina A', 'Boelens JJ', 'Champlin R', 'Chaudhury S', 'DeFilipp Z', 'Dholaria B', 'El-Jawahri A', 'Fanning S', 'Fraint E', 'Gergis U', 'Giralt S', 'Hamilton BK', 'Hashmi SK', 'Horn B', 'Inamoto Y', 'Jacobsohn DA', 'Jain T', 'Johnston L', 'Kanate AS', 'Kansagra A', 'Kassim A', 'Kean LS', 'Kitko CL', 'Knight-Perry J', 'Kurtzberg J', 'Liu H', 'MacMillan ML', 'Mahmoudjafari Z', 'Mielcarek M', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A', 'Nemecek E', 'Olson TS', 'Oran B', 'Perales MA', 'Prockop SE', 'Pulsipher MA', 'Pusic I', 'Riches ML', 'Rodriguez C', 'Romee R', 'Rondon G', 'Saad A', 'Shah N', 'Shaw PJ', 'Shenoy S', 'Sierra J', 'Talano J', 'Verneris MR', 'Veys P', 'Wagner JE', 'Savani BN', 'Hamadani M', 'Carpenter PA']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapies Program, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.

Notably, KMT2A-fusions are prevalent in 70% of infant leukaemias but fail to phenocopy short latency leukaemogenesis in mammalian models, suggesting additional factors are necessary for transformation. Given the lack of additional somatic mutation, the role of epigenetic regulation in cell specification, and our prior results of germline KMT2C variation in infant leukaemia patients, we hypothesized that germline dysfunction of KMT2C altered haematopoietic specification. In isogenic KMT2C KO hPSCs, we found genome-wide differences in histone modifications at active and poised enhancers, leading to gene expression profiles akin to mesendoderm rather than mesoderm highlighted by a significant increase in NODAL expression and WNT inhibition, ultimately resulting in a lack of in vitro hemogenic endothelium specification.

This case report presents the results of two rounds of controlled ovarian stimulations (COSs) performed after an induced abortion. The patient had mixed phenotype acute leukemia diagnosed during early pregnancy and underwent a surgical abortion, followed by ovarian stimulation using urinary follicle-stimulating hormone (uFSH) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. Oocyte retrieval was subsequently performed for oocyte cryopreservation. Despite good hormonal and ultrasonic follicular growth, no oocytes were obtained. During a second COS performed at a low human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level (less than 100 IU/L), several mature oocytes were obtained, suggesting that higher hCG levels during COS induce the absence of mature oocytes during normal follicular growth. It is recommended to start COS post-abortion after confirming a low hCG level while considering the timing of cancer treatment.","['Hamada, Haru', 'Hayama, Tomonari', 'Ijuin, Akifumi', 'Miyakoshi, Ai', 'Kasai, Michi', 'Tochihara, Shiori', 'Saito, Marina', 'Nishi, Mayuko', 'Ueno, Hiroe', 'Yamamoto, Mizuki', 'Komeya, Mitsuru', 'Yumura, Yasushi', 'Sakakibara, Hideya', 'Miyagi, Etsuko', 'Murase, Mariko']","['Hamada H', 'Hayama T', 'Ijuin A', 'Miyakoshi A', 'Kasai M', 'Tochihara S', 'Saito M', 'Nishi M', 'Ueno H', 'Yamamoto M', 'Komeya M', 'Yumura Y', 'Sakakibara H', 'Miyagi E', 'Murase M']","['Reproductive Medical Center, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Reproductive Medical Center, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Gynecology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Reproductive Medical Center, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Reproductive Medical Center, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Maternity and Neonate Center, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Reproductive Medical Center, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Reproductive Medical Center, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Reproductive Medical Center, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Reproductive Medical Center, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Reproductive Medical Center, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Reproductive Medical Center, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Reproductive Medical Center, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Gynecology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Reproductive Medical Center, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0909-478X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1943-594X']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210724,England,Gynecol Endocrinol,Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,8807913,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'cryopreservation', 'fertility preservation', 'hCG level', 'post-abortion ovarian stimulation', 'premature luteinization']",2021/07/27 06:00,2021/07/27 06:00,['2021/07/26 05:25'],"['2021/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/26 05:25 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09513590.2021.1950135 [doi]'],ppublish,Gynecol Endocrinol. 2021 Nov;37(11):1050-1053. doi: 10.1080/09513590.2021.1950135.

Since the mechanism of induction of benzene toxicity is due to active metabolites through cytochrome p450 enzymes and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), we hypothesized that natural compound such linalool with anti-inflammatory/antioxidant properties could be effective in reducing its toxicity. Lymphocytes isolated from healthy individuals were simultaneously cotreated with different concentrations of LIN (10, 25 and 50 microM) and benzene (50 microM) for 4 h at 37 degrees C. After incubation, the toxicity parameters such cytotoxicity, ROS formation, lysosomal membrane integrity, mitochondria membrane potential (DeltaPsim) collapse, oxidized/reduced glutathione (GSH/GSSG) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were analyzed using biochemical and flow cytometry evaluations. Our data showed that benzene (50 microM) induced a significant increase in cytotoxicity, ROS formation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) collapse, lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress while LIN with antioxidant potential reversed the toxic effects of benzene on isolated human lymphocytes. Our results suggest that LIN reduces and reverses benzene-induced cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and lysosomal/mitochondrial damages in human lymphocyte. This study demonstrated that cotreatment of LIN with benzene can reduce several parameters indicative of oxidative stress. As such, LIN could represent a potential therapeutic agent in reducing certain aspects of benzene-induced toxicity.","['Salimi, Ahmad', 'Khodaparast, Farzad', 'Bohlooli, Shahab', 'Hashemidanesh, Niloufar', 'Baghal, Elahe', 'Rezagholizadeh, Lotfollah']","['Salimi A', 'Khodaparast F', 'Bohlooli S', 'Hashemidanesh N', 'Baghal E', 'Rezagholizadeh L']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, Ardabil, Iran.', 'Traditional Medicine and Hydrotherapy Research Center, Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, Ardabil, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, Ardabil, Iran.', 'Students Research Committee, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, Ardabil, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, Ardabil, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, Ardabil, Iran.', 'Students Research Committee, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, Ardabil, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, Ardabil, Iran.', 'Students Research Committee, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, Ardabil, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, Ardabil, Iran.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3026-6398'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210726,United States,Drug Chem Toxicol,Drug and chemical toxicology,7801723,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Benzene', 'cytotoxicity', 'human lymphocytes', 'oxidative stress linalool']",2021/07/27 06:00,2021/07/27 06:00,['2021/07/26 05:24'],"['2021/07/26 05:24 [entrez]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/01480545.2021.1957563 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Drug Chem Toxicol. 2021 Jul 26:1-9. doi: 10.1080/01480545.2021.1957563.,1-9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion ([Fip1-like 1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha]; F/P) leads to the proliferation of the eosinophilic lineage and thus to a clonal hypereosinophilic syndrome that is highly responsive to imatinib. Methods: We previously reported on a nationwide retrospective study of 151 patients with F/P-associated clonal hypereosinophilic syndrome. Patients from this cohort with a clinical history of ischemic stroke (as well as 2 additional cases) were further analyzed to better define their clinical picture and outcomes. Results: Sixteen male patients (median age, 51 [43-59] years) with low-to-intermediate cardiovascular risk were included. Median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 4 (range, 1-6). Most cerebral imaging disclosed multiple bilateral infarctions of watershed distribution (69%). Despite frequent cardiac involvement (50%), cardiac thrombus was evidenced in a single patient and, according to the TOAST classification (Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment), 62.5% of strokes were presumably of undetermined etiology. Among the 15 patients treated with imatinib, and after a median follow-up of 4.5 years, stroke recurred in only 3 patients (consisting of either cardio embolic or hemorrhagic events, unrelated to the first episode). Conclusions: F/P+ clonal hypereosinophilic syndrome is a diagnosis to consider in patients with unexplained ischemic stroke and hypereosinophilia (especially in the setting of multiple cortical borderzone distribution) and warrants prompt initiation of imatinib.","['Tennenbaum, Juliette', 'Groh, Matthieu', 'Venditti, Laura', 'Campos-Gazeau, France', 'Chalayer, Emilie', 'De Broucker, Thomas', 'Hamidou, Mohamed', 'Hunault, Mathilde', 'Lyoubi, Aicha', 'Meunier, Raphaelle', 'Muron, Thierry', 'Sene, Damien', 'Slama, Borhane', 'Guidoux, Celine', 'Lefevre, Guillaume', 'Kahn, Jean-Emmanuel', 'Denier, Christian', 'Rohmer, Julien']","['Tennenbaum J', 'Groh M', 'Venditti L', 'Campos-Gazeau F', 'Chalayer E', 'De Broucker T', 'Hamidou M', 'Hunault M', 'Lyoubi A', 'Meunier R', 'Muron T', 'Sene D', 'Slama B', 'Guidoux C', 'Lefevre G', 'Kahn JE', 'Denier C', 'Rohmer J']","['National Reference Center for Hypereosinophilic syndromes (CEREO), France (J.T., M.G., M.

Although AML patients are susceptible to fluid overload (FO) (e.g., in the context of chemotherapy protocols, during sepsis treatment or to prevent tumor lysis syndrome), little attention has been paid to its role in AML patients undergoing induction chemotherapy. AML patients receiving induction chemotherapy between 2014 and 2019 were included in this study. FO was defined as >/=5% weight gain on day 7 of induction chemotherapy compared to baseline weight determined on the day of admission. We found FO in 23 (12%) of 187 AML patients undergoing induction chemotherapy. Application of >100 ml crystalloid fluids/kg body weight until day 7 of induction chemotherapy was identified as an independent risk factor for FO.

Here we hypothesized that adaptive mechanisms to MYC-induced replicative and oxidative stress, consisting in DNA damage response (DDR) activation and BCL-2 overexpression, could represent the biologic basis of the poor prognosis and chemoresistance observed in MYC/BCL-2-positive lymphoma. We first integrated targeted gene expression profiling (T-GEP), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, and characterization of replicative and oxidative stress biomarkers in two independent DLBCL cohorts. The presence of oxidative DNA damage biomarkers identified a poor prognosis double expresser (DE)-DLBCL subset, characterized by relatively higher BCL-2 gene expression levels and enrichment for DH lymphomas. Based on these findings, we tested therapeutic strategies based on combined DDR and BCL-2 inhibition, confirming efficacy and synergistic interactions in in vitro and in vivo DH-DLBCL models. These data provide the rationale for precision-therapy strategies based on combined DDR and BCL-2 inhibition in DH or DE-DLBCL.","['Rossi, Alessandra', 'Orecchioni, Stefania', 'Falvo, Paolo', 'Tabanelli, Valentina', 'Baiardi, Elena', 'Agostinelli, Claudio', 'Melle, Federica', 'Motta, Giovanna', 'Calleri, Angelica', 'Fiori, Stefano', 'Corsini, Chiara', 'Casadei, Beatrice', 'Mazzara, Saveria', 'Vitolo, Umberto', 'Bertolini, Francesco', 'Zinzani, Pier Luigi', 'Alcalay, Myriam', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Pileri, Stefano', 'Tarella, Corrado', 'Derenzini, Enrico']","['Rossi A', 'Orecchioni S', 'Falvo P', 'Tabanelli V', 'Baiardi E', 'Agostinelli C', 'Melle F', 'Motta G', 'Calleri A', 'Fiori S', 'Corsini C', 'Casadei B', 'Mazzara S', 'Vitolo U', 'Bertolini F', 'Zinzani PL', 'Alcalay M', 'Pelicci PG', 'Pileri S', 'Tarella C', 'Derenzini E']","['Onco-Hematology Division, IEO European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Hematology-Oncology, IEO European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Hematology-Oncology, IEO European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of diagnostic Haematopathology, IEO European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Onco-Hematology Division, IEO European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematopathology Unit, Department of Experimental, Diagnostic, and Specialty Medicine (DIMES), Bologna University School of Medicine, Bologna, Italy.', 'Haematopathology Unit, IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Division of diagnostic Haematopathology, IEO European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of diagnostic Haematopathology, IEO European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of diagnostic Haematopathology, IEO European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of diagnostic Haematopathology, IEO European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Hematology-Oncology, IEO European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology ""L. e A.

The majority of patients initially show therapy response, but in two-thirds of cases the leukemia returns, typically during treatment. The glucocorticoid drug prednisone is established as a major player in the treatment of leukemia and the in vivo response to prednisone monotreatment is currently the best indicator of risk for MLL-r iALL. We used two different single-cell RNA sequencing technologies to analyze the expression of a prednisone-dependent signature, derived from an independent study, in diagnostic bone marrow and peripheral blood biopsies. This allowed us to classify individual leukemic cells as either resistant or sensitive to treatment and show that quantification of these two groups can be used to better predict the occurrence of future relapse in individual patients. This work also sheds light on the nature of the therapy-resistant subpopulation of relapse-initiating cells. Leukemic cells associated with high relapse risk are characterized by basal activation of glucocorticoid response, smaller size, and a quiescent gene expression program with cell stemness properties. These results improve current risk stratification and elucidate leukemic therapy-resistant subpopulations at diagnosis.","['Candelli, Tito', 'Schneider, Pauline', 'Garrido Castro, Patricia', 'Jones, Luke A', 'Bodewes, Eduard', 'Rockx-Brouwer, Dedeke', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Holstege, Frank C P', 'Margaritis, Thanasis', 'Stam, Ronald W']","['Candelli T', 'Schneider P', 'Garrido Castro P', 'Jones LA', 'Bodewes E', 'Rockx-Brouwer D', 'Pieters R', 'Holstege FCP', 'Margaritis T', 'Stam RW']","['Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, 3584 CS, Utrecht, The Netherlands.

Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(30): 1198-1207. Summary. Chronic myeloid leukemia is a rare clonal stem cell disorder. The pathological overproduction of the myeloid cell line is caused by abnormal function of a tyrosine kinase encoded by a fusion gene (BCR/ABL1) which is formed upon a reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22. Long-term, often lifelong treatment with BCR/ABL1-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors provides excellent disease control and overall survival rates close to the general survival of a healthy population in a significant proportion of patients. These patients require continuous oncohematological monitoring in accordance with the current diagnostic and treatment guidelines. However, undesirable side effects may occur that extend the treatment of the patients to a multidisciplinary approach involving a number of nonhematological specialities. Currently, five types of tyrosine kinase inhibitors are available in Hungary, with very different side effect profiles. At the start of treatment or in the event of a change in therapy, patient- and leukemia-specific assessments should be taken to select the most proper tyrosine kinase inhibitors treatment. Given the excellent survival outcomes achieved with long-term tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment, there is an increasing number of patients who might experience adverse events of different kind or severity, which often results in patients ending up in different, nonhematological medical situations. The description of the most frequently observed complications in connection with a detailed cross-sectional analysis of our own patient cohort is also presented here resembling everyday clinical practice. It is very important that practitioners of other medical professions (general practitioner, internist, cardiologist, angiologist, diabetologist, pulmonologist, gastroenterologist, etc.) should be aware of the possible side effects of specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. They can help to assist the clinical hematologist in planning the appropriate tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy as well as in professional caretaking of these patients.

Combining this with clonal architecture data may permit truly personalized therapy. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) exhibits clonal diversity, evolution and selection, spontaneously and under treatment pressure. We apply a dynamic simulation model to published CLL clonal architecture data to explore alternative therapeutic strategies, focusing on BTK inhibition. By deriving parameters of clonal growth and death behavior we model continuous vs time-limited ibrutinib therapy, and find that, despite persistence of disease, time to clinical progression may not differ. This is a testable hypothesis. We model IgVH-mutated CLL vs unmutated CLL by varying proliferation and find, based on the limited available data about clonal dynamics after such therapy, that there are differences predicted in response to anti-CD20 efficacy.

Temporal changes in HSC/HPC gene expression underlie concomitant changes in self-renewal capacity, lineage biases, and hematopoietic output. Moreover, they can modify disease phenotypes. For example, childhood leukemias have distinct driver mutation profiles relative to adult leukemias, and they may arise from distinct cells of origin. The putative relationship between neonatal HSC/HPC ontogeny and childhood blood disorders highlights the importance of understanding how, at a mechanistic level, HSCs transition from fetal to adult transcriptional states. In this perspective piece, we summarize recent work indicating that the transition is uncoordinated and imprecisely timed. We discuss implications of these findings, including mechanisms that might enable neonatal HSCs and HPCs to acquire adultlike properties over a drawn-out period, in lieu of precise gene regulatory networks. The transition from fetal to adult transcriptional programs coincides with a pulse of type I interferon signaling that activates many genes associated with the adultlike state. This pulse may sensitize HSCs/HPCs to mutations that drive leukemogenesis shortly after birth. If we can understand how developmental switches modulate HSC and HPC fate after birth-both under normal circumstances and in the setting of disease-causing mutations-we can potentially reprogram these switches to treat or prevent childhood leukemias.","['Li, Yanan', 'Magee, Jeffrey A']","['Li Y', 'Magee JA']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, 660 S.

Pimozide is a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist and antipsychotic shown to exhibit anticancer activity. Herein, we investigated whether pimozide exerts anti-ATL effects and explored the mechanisms underlying these effects. Pimozide inhibited cell growth and survival in HTLV-1-infected T cells but not in the uninfected T cells. The dopamine D2 receptor subfamily mRNA expression levels in HTLV-1-infected T cells were high. Pimozide induced G1 cell cycle arrest concomitant with the upregulation of p21/p27/p53, and suppression of cyclin D2/E, cyclin-dependent kinase 2/4/6 and c-Myc expression, and pRb phosphorylation. Pimozide also induced apoptosis by activating caspases, upregulating pro-apoptotic proteins and downregulating anti-apoptotic proteins. Additionally, it promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and increased the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker activating transcription factor 4 and the DNA damage-inducible protein GADD45alpha and the phosphorylation of the DNA damage marker H2AX. Furthermore, pimozide-induced cytotoxicity was partially inhibited by a ROS scavenger, and pan-caspase and necroptosis inhibitors, indicating the involvement of caspase-dependent and -independent lethal pathways. The activities of the nuclear factor-kappaB, Akt, STAT3/5 and AP-1 signaling pathways were inhibited via the dephosphorylation of IkappaBalpha, IkappaB kinase alpha/beta, Akt and STAT3/5, in addition to reduced JunB and JunD expression in HTLV-1-infected T cells. Pimozide also exhibited potent anti-ATL activity in the xenograft mouse model. These findings demonstrated the efficacy of pimozide as a potential therapeutic agent for ATL.","['Ishikawa, Chie', 'Mori, Naoki']","['Ishikawa C', 'Mori N']","['Department of Microbiology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan; Division of Health Sciences, Transdisciplinary Research Organization for Subtropics and Island Studies, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, 903-0213, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the ability of this score in predicting the 2-year overall survival (OS-2), leukemia-free survival (LFS-2) and transplant-related mortality (TRM) in acute leukemia (AL) adult patients undergoing a first allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) at a transplant center in Brazil. METHODS: In this prospective, cohort study, we used the formula published by Shouval et al. to calculate the AL-EBMT score and stratify patients into three risk categories. RESULTS: A total of 79 patients transplanted between 2008 and 2018 were analyzed. The median age was 38 years. Acute myeloid leukemia was the most common diagnosis (68%). Almost a quarter of the cases were at an advanced stage. All hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCTs) were human leukocyte antigen-matched (HLA-matched) and the majority used familial donors (77%). Myeloablative conditioning was used in 92% of the cases. Stratification according to the AL-EBMT score into low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups yielded the following results: 40%, 12% and 47% of the cases, respectively. The high scoring group was associated with a hazard ratio of 2.1 (p = 0.007), 2.1 (p = 0.009) and 2.47 (p = 0.01) for the 2-year OS, LFS and TRM, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study supports the ability of the AL-EBMT score to reasonably predict the 2-year post-transplant OS, LFS and TRM and to discriminate between risk categories in adult patients with AL, thus confirming its usefulness in clinical decision-making in this setting. Larger, multicenter studies may further help confirm these findings.","['Teixeira, Gustavo Machado', 'Martinho, Glaucia Helena', 'de Macedo, Antonio Vaz', 'Santoro, Ana Luiza Roscoe', 'Vercosa, Marisa Ribeiro', 'Lodi, Fernanda Maia', 'Nobre, Vandack']","['Teixeira GM', 'Martinho GH', 'de Macedo AV', 'Santoro ALR', 'Vercosa MR', 'Lodi FM', 'Nobre V']","['Hospital das Clinicas da Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (HC UFMG), Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; Hospital Alberto Cavalcanti/ FHEMIG, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.

Over the past decade, advanced molecular diagnostics have led to the discovery of new molecularly-defined tumor types with prognostic and therapeutic implications. Methylation profiles, whole genome sequencing, and transcriptomics have defined subgroups and revealed heterogeneity within commonly defined tumor entities(2)(,)(3). These findings have also revealed important differences between adult and pediatric brain tumors of similar histology. The majority of pediatric low grade gliomas (pLGG) are defined by alterations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway including BRAFV600E point mutation, K1AA1549-BRAF fusion, and FGFR1 alterations as opposed to IDH1/2 mutations and 1p/19q co-deletion seen more frequently in adult low grade gliomas(4). These findings have led to targeted therapies, namely BRAF and MEK inhibitors, which are currently being evaluated in phase III clinical trials and may soon supplant chemotherapy as standard of care for pLGG's. While targeted therapy trials for pediatric brain tumors have had significant success, immunotherapy remains a challenge in a group of tumors with generally lower mutational burden compared to adult tumors and relatively ""cold"" immune microenvironment. Despite this, a wide array of immunotherapy trials including vaccine therapies, immune checkpoint blockade, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, and viral therapies are on-going. Unique to pediatrics, multiple clinical trials have sought to answer the question of whether the most malignant pediatric brain tumors in the youngest patients can be successfully treated with high dose chemotherapy in lieu of radiation to avoid devastating long-term neurocognitive deficits. Due to the collaborative work of multiple pediatric neuro-oncology consortiums, the recent history of pediatric brain tumor research is one of efficient translation from bench to bedside in a rare group of tumors resulting in significant progress in the field. Here, advances in the areas of molecular characterization, targeted and immune-based therapies, and reduction in long term co-morbidities will be reviewed.","['Plant-Fox, Ashley S', ""O'Halloran, Katrina"", 'Goldman, Stewart']","['Plant-Fox AS', ""O'Halloran K"", 'Goldman S']","[""Ann and Robert H.

Aspergillus endocarditis (AE) is a relatively rare disease but can be life-threatening. CASE REPORTS: We report here on five cases of endocarditis due to invasive aspergillosis: a 58-year-old man receiving immunosuppressive medication following a kidney graft, a 58-year-old man undergoing chemotherapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, a 55-year-old man receiving corticosteroids for IgA vasculitis, a 52-year-old HIV-infected woman under no specific treatment and a 17-year-old boy under immunosuppressive therapy for auto-immune chronic neutropenia. DISCUSSION: Aspergillus accounts for 25-30% of fungal endocarditis and 0.25% to 8.5% of all cases of infectious endocarditis. Aspergillus endocarditis results from invasion of the lung arterioles by hyphae and blood dissemination. It is associated with a very high mortality rate (42-68%). Diagnosing Aspergillus endocarditis is mainly problematic because blood cultures are almost always negative, and fever may be absent. Immunosuppression, haematological malignancies, recent cardiothoracic surgery, negative blood cultures with endocarditis and/or systemic or pulmonary emboli are predictors of AE. In the setting of endocarditis, some clinical characteristics may raise early suspicions of aspergillosis rather than a non-fungal agent: no fever, vegetations affecting the mitral valve, non-valve or aortotomy sites, aortic abscess or pseudo-aneurysm. The identification of invasive aspergillosis is based on a chest CT scan, microscopy/culture or other serological and molecular tests. The treatment of Aspergillus endocarditis requires triazole antifungal drugs, and frequently additional surgical debridement. CONCLUSION: Aspergillus endocarditis is rare but is associated with a very high mortality rate. Knowledge of its predictive factors and key clinical features can help to differentiate aspergillosis from non-fungal endocarditis and may enable improved survival rates.","['Chevalier, K', 'Barde, F', 'Benhamida, S', 'Le Meur, M', 'Thyrault, M', 'Bentoumi, Y', 'Lau, N', 'Lebut, J']","['Chevalier K', 'Barde F', 'Benhamida S', 'Le Meur M', 'Thyrault M', 'Bentoumi Y', 'Lau N', 'Lebut J']","['Department of Intensive Care Unit, Groupe Hospitalier Nord Essonne, Site Longjumeau, 159, rue du President Francois Mitterrand, 91160 Longjumeau, France.

Genetic mutations affecting the FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) and Wilm's tumor (WT-1) genes are associated with poor prognosis in AML. In this work, efficiency of HRM method for detection of FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKD, and WT-1 mutations was assessed in comparison with direct sequencing. METHOD: A total of 58 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded BM biopsy specimens of AML patients were analyzed. Mutation detection was performed by HRM method and the results were consequently compared with direct sequencing RESULTS: FLT3 and WT-1 mutations were detected in 21 (36.2%) and 3 (5.17%) samples, respectively. Among all FLT3 mutations, 10 (17.2%) and 11 (18.2%) samples were harboring the FLT3-ITD and-TKD gene mutations, respectively. Frequency of the FLT3-ITD was not statistically different in females (51%) and males (49%). Also, FLT3-TKD was more common in males although the differences in gender distribution were not statistically significant (P = 0.721 and P = 0.626, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Regarded as the desirable characteristic, the present study is generally distinguished by the similar previous ones due to assessing the FFPE BM tissue from the perspective of the type of assessed sample. This discrepancy between our results and those in prior studies may be due to the disparity of the studied population size, adopted methods as well as the sample type. In this survey, regarding to low amount of extracted DNA from the paraffinized samples, the HRM method was efficient in determining the mentioned mutations.","['Mahmoudi, Aida', 'Moradabadi, Alireza', 'Noroozi-Aghideh, Ali']","['Mahmoudi A', 'Moradabadi A', 'Noroozi-Aghideh A']","['Department of Biology, Payam Noor University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of laboratory sciences, Khomein University of Medical Sciences, Khomein, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Paramedicine, Aja University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

The mainstay of TLS management is aggressive intravenous hydration. However, the epidemiology of fluid overload (FO) and acute kidney injury (AKI) in this population is understudied. In this study, we aimed to describe the incidence, severity, and complications of FO and AKI among pediatric patients with TLS. METHODS: We completed a single-center retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients with a new diagnosis of hematologic malignancy over a 10-year period. Patients with TLS were analyzed in two groups based on the severity of AKI and FO. Charts were reviewed for complications associated with AKI and FO including hypoxemia, mechanical ventilation, hyponatremia, pulmonary edema, pediatric intensive care (PICU) admission, and need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). RESULTS: We analyzed 56 patients with TLS for FO and AKI. We found severe FO (>/=10%) occurred in 35.7% (n = 20). PICU admission occurred in 35% of patients with severe FO compared to 8.3% in those with mild/moderate FO <10% (p = .013). Complications of hypoxemia (30% vs. 5.6%, p = .012) and pulmonary edema (25% vs. 2.8%, p = .010) were more common among those with severe FO. AKI occurred in 37.5% (n = 21) patients and resulted in a significant increase in PICU admission and requirement for RRT (p = .001 and <.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our results show FO and AKI are common, and often unrecognized complications of TLS associated with increased morbidity. Prospective, multicenter studies are needed to further dissect the burden of FO and AKI within this vulnerable population.","['Flood, Kayla', 'Rozmus, Jacob', 'Skippen, Peter', 'Matsell, Douglas G', 'Mammen, Cherry']","['Flood K', 'Rozmus J', 'Skippen P', 'Matsell DG', 'Mammen C']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Nephrology, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Oncology and Hematology, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Critical Care, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Nephrology, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Nephrology, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.""]","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1232-9474', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6716-0381', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4530-8554', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8389-8746']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210724,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute kidney injury', 'fluid overload', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'tumor lysis syndrome']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/07/25 06:00,['2021/07/24 12:13'],"['2021/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/24 12:13 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.29255 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Dec;68(12):e29255. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29255.

Subsequent relapse and radiation-related morbidity remain the causes of treatment failure and long-term sequelae. COG AALL02P2 aimed to maintain outcomes in patients with late iCNS-R using intensified chemotherapy and a decrease in cranial irradiation from 1800 to 1200 cGy. PROCEDURES: COG AALL02P2 enrolled 118 eligible patients with B-cell ALL (B-ALL) and late iCNS-R who received intensified systemic therapy, triple intrathecal chemotherapy, and 1200 cGy cranial irradiation delivered at 12 months, with maintenance chemotherapy continuing until 104 weeks postdiagnosis. RESULTS: The 3-year event-free survival (EFS) and OS were 64.3% +/- 4.5% and 79.6% +/- 3.8%, with 46.1% (18/39) of second relapses including the CNS. Of the 112 patients who completed therapy, 78 received protocol-specified radiation. Study enrollment was closed after interim monitoring analysis showed inferior EFS compared to POG 9412. Patients with initial NCI standard-risk classification fared better than high-risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: COG AALL02P2 showed inferior EFS but similar OS compared to POG 9412. Limitations included a small sample size, more intensive prior therapies, and a significant number of patients (34/118, 29%) who did not receive protocol-directed radiation due to early relapse prior to 1 year or did not otherwise follow the treatment plan. New approaches are needed to improve outcome for these patients and determine the optimal timing and dose of cranial radiation in the treatment of iCNS-R.","['Hastings, Caroline', 'Chen, Yichen', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Ritchey, A Kim', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Carroll, William L', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Marcus, Robert B', 'Barredo, Julio C']","['Hastings C', 'Chen Y', 'Devidas M', 'Ritchey AK', 'Winick NJ', 'Carroll WL', 'Hunger SP', 'Wood BL', 'Marcus RB', 'Barredo JC']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology Oncology, University of California San Francisco Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland, Oakland, California, USA."", ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology Oncology, University of Pittsburg Medical Center Children's Hospital of Pittsburg, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York City, New York, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", ""Department of Hematopathology, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA."", 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Ascension Sacred Heart Hospital, Pensacola, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3149-0762', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6636-3870', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4654-4145']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210724,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CNS relapse', 'childhood', 'leukemia']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/07/25 06:00,['2021/07/24 12:13'],"['2021/06/16 00:00 [revised]', '2021/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/24 12:13 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.29256 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Dec;68(12):e29256. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29256.

A recent study reported that lactucin could induce apoptosis in leukemia cells. However, its cytotoxicity and potential molecular mechanisms underlying cancer cell death remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the direct effect and underlying mechanism of action of lactucin on renal cancer cells. METHODS: MTT assay and flow cytometry were performed to evaluate the rate of cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. Western blotting, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and protein stability analyses were performed to analyze the effect of lactucin on the expression of apoptosis-related proteins such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and CFLAR (CASP8 and FADD like apoptosis regulator) long isoform (CFLARL) in Caki-1 human renal cancer cells. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was evaluated using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Lactucin treatment induced apoptosis in Caki-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner via activation of the caspase pathway. It downregulated BCL-2 and CFLARL expression levels by suppressing BCL-2 transcription and CFLARL protein stability, respectively. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-1-cysteine, a ROS scavenger, attenuated the lactucin-induced apoptosis and restored the BCL-2 and CFLARL expression to basal levels. Lactucin-facilitated BCL-2 downregulation was regulated at the transcriptional level through the inactivation of the NF-kappaB pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to demonstrate that lactucin-induced apoptosis is mediated by ROS production, which in turn activates the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway by inhibiting BCL-2 and CFLARL expression in Caki-1 cells.","['Jang, Ji Hoon', 'Park, Cho-Young', 'Sung, Eon-Gi', 'Song, In-Hwan', 'Kim, Joo-Young', 'Jung, Chuleui', 'Sohn, Ho-Yong', 'Lee, Tae-Jin']","['Jang JH', 'Park CY', 'Sung EG', 'Song IH', 'Kim JY', 'Jung C', 'Sohn HY', 'Lee TJ']","['Department of Anatomy, College of Medicine, Yeungnam University, 170 Hyeonchung-ro, Nam-Gu, 42415, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy, College of Medicine, Yeungnam University, 170 Hyeonchung-ro, Nam-Gu, 42415, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy, College of Medicine, Yeungnam University, 170 Hyeonchung-ro, Nam-Gu, 42415, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy, College of Medicine, Yeungnam University, 170 Hyeonchung-ro, Nam-Gu, 42415, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy, College of Medicine, Yeungnam University, 170 Hyeonchung-ro, Nam-Gu, 42415, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Plant Medicals, Andong National University, 36729, Andong, South Korea.', 'Department of Food and Nutrition, Andong National University, 36729, Andong, South Korea. hysohn@anu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Anatomy, College of Medicine, Yeungnam University, 170 Hyeonchung-ro, Nam-Gu, 42415, Daegu, South Korea. tjlee@med.yu.ac.kr.']",,['eng'],"['NRF-2018R1A6A1A03024862/Ministry of Education, Science and Technology']",['Journal Article'],20210724,Korea (South),Genes Genomics,Genes & genomics,101481027,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'BCL-2', 'CFLARL', 'Lactucin', 'ROS', 'Renal cancer']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/07/25 06:00,['2021/07/24 12:11'],"['2021/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/24 12:11 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13258-021-01142-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s13258-021-01142-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Genes Genomics. 2021 Oct;43(10):1199-1207. doi: 10.1007/s13258-021-01142-8.

METHODS: A retrospective review of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System scores reported by patients from the database of our previous large-scale study, which was collected between May 2018 and January 2019. We described the prevalence of CSSs in proportion and severity in mean +/- SD. RESULTS: Of 546 cancer patients, 209 were breast cancer, 159 were colon cancer, and 178 were leukemia. The majority of participants were females 345 (63.2%), and the mean age of the entire study sample was 49.4 +/- 13.93. Diminished feeling of well-being was the most prevalent CSS across the three cancers, with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001). Fatigue (6.59 +/- 2.07), pain (6.55 +/- 2.01), and loss of appetite were the most distressing CSSs (6.49 +/- 1.99) across the whole sample. Loss of appetite (6.34 +/- 2.05) was the most distressing CSS in breast cancer, fatigue (6.97 +/- 2.07) in leukemia, and pain (7.00 +/- 2.11) in colon cancer. Statistically significant differences were found in the severity between the three cancer in pain (p < 0.001), fatigue (p = 0.010), nausea (p = 0.001), and diminished feeling of well-being (p = 0.033). Cancer type, sleeping hours, dependence on caregiver, female gender, level of education, and employment were significantly associated with higher odds of CSS severity. CONCLUSION: Breast and colon cancer and leukemia patients undergoing chemotherapy experience multiple distressing CSSs. Our study validates CSSs as a discrete set of distressing symptoms that may serve and guide quality of care assessment and cancer clinical research, particularly among patients undergoing chemotherapy.","['AlFayyad, Isamme', 'Al-Tannir, Mohamad', 'AlShammari, Amjad']","['AlFayyad I', 'Al-Tannir M', 'AlShammari A']","['Research Center, King Fahad Medical City, P.O.

Due to remaining of leukemic quiescent cells that are not affected by tyrosine kinase inhibitors, it has been suggested the use of pioglitazone, a PPARgamma agonist, together with imatinib as a strategy for the maintenance of deep molecular response. The clinical benefit to this association is still controversial, and the metabolic alteration along this process remains unclear. Therefore, we applied a metabolomic protocol using high-resolution mass spectrometry to profile plasmatic metabolic response of a prospective cohort of ten individuals under discontinuation of imatinib and pioglitazone protocol. By comparing patients under pioglitazone and imatinib treatment with imatinib monotherapy and discontinuation phase, we were able to annotate 41 and 36 metabolites, respectively. The metabolic alterations observed during imatinib-pioglitazone combined therapy are associated with an extensive lipid remodeling, with activation of beta-oxidation pathway, in addition to the presence of markers that suggest mitochondrial dysfunction.","['Povoa, Valquiria Mariane Oliveira', 'Delafiori, Jeany', 'Dias-Audibert, Flavia Luisa', 'de Oliveira, Arthur Noin', 'Lopes, Ana Beatriz Pascoal', 'de Paula, Erich Vinicius', 'Pagnano, Katia Borgia Barbosa', 'Catharino, Rodrigo Ramos']","['Povoa VMO', 'Delafiori J', 'Dias-Audibert FL', 'de Oliveira AN', 'Lopes ABP', 'de Paula EV', 'Pagnano KBB', 'Catharino RR']","['Hematology and Hemotherapy Center, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.', 'INNOVARE Biomarkers Laboratory, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.', 'INNOVARE Biomarkers Laboratory, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.', 'INNOVARE Biomarkers Laboratory, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.', 'INNOVARE Biomarkers Laboratory, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil. kborgia@unicamp.br.', 'INNOVARE Biomarkers Laboratory, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil. rrc@unicamp.br.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7219-2644'],['eng'],"['88882.434900/2019-01/Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior', '88887.513974/2020-00/Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior', '141200/2018-9/Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico', '2019/05718-3/Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo']","['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",20210724,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'X4OV71U42S (Pioglitazone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Metabolic Diseases/chemically induced/metabolism/*pathology', '*Metabolome', 'Middle Aged', 'Non-Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Pioglitazone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Withholding Treatment', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Imatinib', '*Lipids', '*Mass spectrometry', '*Metabolomics', '*Pioglitazone']",2021/07/25 06:00,2022/01/04 06:00,['2021/07/24 12:07'],"['2021/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 12:07 [entrez]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12032-021-01551-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s12032-021-01551-5 [pii]']",epublish,Med Oncol. 2021 Jul 24;38(9):100. doi: 10.1007/s12032-021-01551-5.,100,"['(c) 2021.

Studies have shown utility of TRBC1, in conjunction with other T-cell markers, as reliable means to identify T-cell clonality by flow cytometry. One limitation of surface TRBC1 (sTRBC1) evaluation is it cannot be detected in surface CD3 (sCD3)-negative T cells, such as normal or abnormal immature T-cell precursors. Here, we assess surface and cytoplasmic TRBC1 expression patterns in the differential diagnosis of T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) vs normal thymocyte expansions. METHODS: Forty-three samples containing T-ALL, thymoma, normal thymus, and/or indolent T-lymphoblastic proliferation (i-TLBP), were evaluated. RESULTS: All 24 cases with normal thymocytes or i-TLBPs revealed a characteristic and reproducible sCD3/sTRBC1 expression pattern indicative of polytypic T-cell maturation. In contrast, all 19 T-ALLs lacked this polytypic maturation pattern and were either completely negative for sCD3/sTRBC1 or showed a minor sCD3-positive subset with a monotypic TRBC1 expression pattern. Cytoplasmic TRBC1 evaluation in 9 T-ALLs demonstrated a monotypic intracellular TRBC1-positive (n = 4) or TRBC1-negative (n = 5) expression, indicative of clonality. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate flow cytometric evaluation of surface and cytoplasmic TRBC1 expression can aid detection of T-cell clonality and differential diagnosis of immature T-cell proliferations.","['Horna, Pedro', 'Otteson, Gregory E', 'Shi, Min', 'Jevremovic, Dragan', 'Yuan, Ji', 'Olteanu, Horatiu']","['Horna P', 'Otteson GE', 'Shi M', 'Jevremovic D', 'Yuan J', 'Olteanu H']","['Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5741-4293', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1792-5822', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5783-4485']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Flow cytometry', 'T-ALL', 'T-cell clonality', 'TRBC1', 'Thymoma']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/07/25 06:00,['2021/07/24 08:35'],"['2021/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/24 08:35 [entrez]']","['6327586 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqab098 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2022 Jan 6;157(1):64-72. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqab098.,64-72,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2021.

However, knowledge on FoP in parents of childhood cancer survivors is scarce. This study aimed to determine the proportion of parents who show dysfunctional levels of FoP, to investigate gender differences, and to examine factors associated with FoP in mothers and fathers. METHODS: Five hundred sixteen parents of pediatric cancer survivors (aged 0-17 years at diagnosis of leukemia or central nervous system (CNS) tumor) were consecutively recruited after the end of intensive cancer treatment. We conducted hierarchical multiple regression analyses for mothers and fathers and integrated parent-, patient-, and family-related factors in the models. RESULTS: Significantly more mothers (54%) than fathers (41%) suffered from dysfunctional levels of FoP. Maternal FoP was significantly associated with depression, a medical coping style, a child diagnosed with a CNS tumor in comparison to leukemia, and lower family functioning (adjusted R(2) = .30, p < .001). Paternal FoP was significantly associated with a lower level of education, depression, a family coping style, a child diagnosed with a CNS tumor in comparison to leukemia, and fewer siblings (adjusted R(2) = .48, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: FoP represents a great burden for parents of pediatric cancer survivors. We identified associated factors of parental FoP. Some of these factors can be targeted by health care professionals within psychosocial interventions and others can provide an indication for an increased risk for higher levels of FoP. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Psychosocial support targeting FoP in parents of childhood cancer survivors is highly indicated.","['Peikert, Mona L', 'Inhestern, Laura', 'Krauth, Konstantin A', 'Escherich, Gabriele', 'Rutkowski, Stefan', 'Kandels, Daniela', 'Schiekiera, Louis J', 'Bergelt, Corinna']","['Peikert ML', 'Inhestern L', 'Krauth KA', 'Escherich G', 'Rutkowski S', 'Kandels D', 'Schiekiera LJ', 'Bergelt C']","['Department of Medical Psychology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Psychology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany. l.inhestern@uke.de.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Klinik Bad Oexen, Oexen 27, 32549, Bad Oeynhausen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany.', ""Swabian Children's Cancer Center, Medical Faculty, University of Augsburg, Stenglinstrasse 2, 86156, Augsburg, Germany."", 'Department of Medical Psychology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Psychology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistrasse 52, 20246, Hamburg, Germany.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3754-7363'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210723,United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Fear', 'Parents', 'Pediatrics', 'Psycho-oncology', 'Survivors']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/07/25 06:00,['2021/07/24 06:25'],"['2021/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 06:25 [entrez]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11764-021-01076-w [doi]', '10.1007/s11764-021-01076-w [pii]']",aheadofprint,J Cancer Surviv. 2021 Jul 23. pii: 10.1007/s11764-021-01076-w. doi: 10.1007/s11764-021-01076-w.,,['(c) 2021.

Over the past decade, increased attention has been focused on identifying suitable immunotherapeutic strategies for AML, and in particular on targeting leukemic cells and their progenitors. However, recent studies have also underlined the important contribution of the leukemic microenvironment in facilitating tumor escape mechanisms leading to disease recurrence. Here, we describe the immunological features of the AML niche, with particular attention to the crosstalk between the AML blasts and the cellular components of the altered tumor microenvironment (TME) and the mechanisms of immune escape that hamper the therapeutic effects of the most advanced treatments. Considering the AML complexity, immunotherapy approaches may benefit from a rational combination of complementary strategies aimed at preventing escape mechanisms without increasing toxicity.","['Tettamanti, Sarah', 'Pievani, Alice', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Dotti, Gianpietro', 'Serafini, Marta']","['Tettamanti S', 'Pievani A', 'Biondi A', 'Dotti G', 'Serafini M']","['Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano-Bicocca/Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano-Bicocca/Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano-Bicocca/Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy. abiondi.unimib@gmail.com.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano-Bicocca/Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6757-6173', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8105-6476']",['eng'],"['GR-2016-02363491/Ministero della Salute (Ministry of Health, Italy)', 'Rete Oncologica/Ministero della Salute (Ministry of Health, Italy)', 'AIRC 5x1000 2018-21147/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (Italian', 'Association for Cancer Research)', 'AIRC 2015-17248/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (Italian', 'Association for Cancer Research)', ""PRIN 2017-NAZ-0412/Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca"", '(Ministry of Education, University and Research)']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210723,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,,,,,2021/07/25 06:00,2021/07/25 06:00,['2021/07/24 06:16'],"['2021/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/24 06:16 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-021-01350-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-021-01350-x [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2022 Jan;36(1):13-22. doi: 10.1038/s41375-021-01350-x.

Nevertheless, MTX resistance is quite a common issue in clinical practice. There are some premises that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) gene battery may take part in MTX metabolism. In the present retrospective study, we analyzed genes expression of AHR genes battery associated with MTX metabolism in whole blood of RA patients with good and poor response to MTX treatment. Additionally, sequencing, genotyping and bioinformatics analysis of AHR repressor gene (AHRR) c.565C > G (rs2292596) and c.1933G > C (rs34453673) have been performed. Theoretically, both changes may have an impact on H3K36me3 and H3K27me3. Evolutionary analysis revealed that rs2292596 may be possibly damaging. Allele G in rs2292596 and DAS28 seems to be associated with a higher risk of poor response to MTX treatment in RA. RA patients with poor response to MTX treatment revealed upregulated AhR and SLC19A1 mRNA level. Treatment with IL-6 inhibitor may be helpful to overcome the low-dose MTX resistance. Analysis of gene expression revealed possible another cause of poor response to MTX treatment which is different from that observed in the case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Wajda, Anna', 'Walczuk, Ewa', 'Stypinska, Barbara', 'Lach, Jakub', 'Yermakovich, Danat', 'Sivitskaya, Larysa', 'Romanowska-Prochnicka, Katarzyna', 'Wysocki, Tomasz', 'Jaronczyk, Malgorzata', 'Paradowska-Gorycka, Agnieszka']","['Wajda A', 'Walczuk E', 'Stypinska B', 'Lach J', 'Yermakovich D', 'Sivitskaya L', 'Romanowska-Prochnicka K', 'Wysocki T', 'Jaronczyk M', 'Paradowska-Gorycka A']","['Department of Molecular Biology, National Institute of Geriatrics, Rheumatology and Rehabilitation, Warsaw, Poland. annawajda2046@gmail.com.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, National Institute of Geriatrics, Rheumatology and Rehabilitation, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, National Institute of Geriatrics, Rheumatology and Rehabilitation, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Biobank Lab, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'BBMRI.pl Consortium, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Institute of Genetics and Cytology, National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, Minsk, Belarus.', 'Institute of Genetics and Cytology, National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, Minsk, Belarus.', 'Department of Systemic Connective Tissue Diseases, National Institute of Geriatrics, Rheumatology and Rehabilitation, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of General and Experimental Pathology with Centre for Preclinical Research and Technology (CEPT), Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Systemic Connective Tissue Diseases, National Institute of Geriatrics, Rheumatology and Rehabilitation, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Drug Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, National Medicines Institute, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, National Institute of Geriatrics, Rheumatology and Rehabilitation, Warsaw, Poland.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6384-2916', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0712-6939', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6359-4967', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1704-4937']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210723,United States,Pharmacogenomics J,The pharmacogenomics journal,101083949,,IM,,PMC8455325,,,2021/07/25 06:00,2021/07/25 06:00,['2021/07/24 06:14'],"['2020/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/24 06:14 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41397-021-00238-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41397-021-00238-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacogenomics J. 2021 Oct;21(5):608-621. doi: 10.1038/s41397-021-00238-4.

Maximizing efficacy of these treatments requires refining patient selection. To this end, we analyzed two recent AML studies profiling the gene expression and ex vivo drug response of primary patient samples. We find that ex vivo samples often exhibit a general sensitivity to (any) drug exposure, independent of drug target. We observe that this ""general response across drugs"" (GRD) is associated with FLT3-ITD mutations, clinical response to standard induction chemotherapy, and overall survival. Further, incorporating GRD into expression-based regression models trained on one of the studies improved their performance in predicting ex vivo response in the second study, thus signifying its relevance to precision oncology efforts. We find that venetoclax response is independent of GRD but instead show that it is linked to expression of monocyte-associated genes by developing and applying a multi-source Bayesian regression approach. The method shares information across studies to robustly identify biomarkers of drug response and is broadly applicable in integrative analyses.","['White, Brian S', 'Khan, Suleiman A', 'Mason, Mike J', 'Ammad-Ud-Din, Muhammad', 'Potdar, Swapnil', 'Malani, Disha', 'Kuusanmaki, Heikki', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Heckman, Caroline', 'Kallioniemi, Olli', 'Kurtz, Stephen E', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Tognon, Cristina E', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Aittokallio, Tero', 'Wennerberg, Krister', 'Guinney, Justin']","['White BS', 'Khan SA', 'Mason MJ', 'Ammad-Ud-Din M', 'Potdar S', 'Malani D', 'Kuusanmaki H', 'Druker BJ', 'Heckman C', 'Kallioniemi O', 'Kurtz SE', 'Porkka K', 'Tognon CE', 'Tyner JW', 'Aittokallio T', 'Wennerberg K', 'Guinney J']","['Computational Oncology, Sage Bionetworks, Seattle, WA, USA. bstephenwhite@gmail.com.', 'The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, CT, USA. bstephenwhite@gmail.com.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), Helsinki Institute of Life Science (HiLIFE), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Computational Oncology, Sage Bionetworks, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), Helsinki Institute of Life Science (HiLIFE), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), Helsinki Institute of Life Science (HiLIFE), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), Helsinki Institute of Life Science (HiLIFE), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), Helsinki Institute of Life Science (HiLIFE), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Biotech Research & Innovation Centre (BRIC) and Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Biology (DanStem), University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), Helsinki Institute of Life Science (HiLIFE), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), Helsinki Institute of Life Science (HiLIFE), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Scilifelab, Karolinska Institute, Solna, Sweden.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'HUS Comprehensive Cancer Center, Hematology Research Unit Helsinki and iCAN Digital Precision Cancer Center Medicine Flagship, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), Helsinki Institute of Life Science (HiLIFE), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.', 'Department of Cancer Genetics, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Centre for Biostatistics and Epidemiology (OCBE), University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), Helsinki Institute of Life Science (HiLIFE), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Biotech Research & Innovation Centre (BRIC) and Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Biology (DanStem), University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Computational Oncology, Sage Bionetworks, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2954-4410', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9614-3281', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8331-8206', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4324-8706', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4872-3078', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2133-0960', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0886-9769']",['eng'],"['R01 CA214428/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '279163/Academy of Finland (Suomen Akatemia)', '296516/Academy of Finland (Suomen Akatemia)']",['Journal Article'],20210723,England,NPJ Precis Oncol,NPJ precision oncology,101708166,,,,PMC8302655,,,2021/07/25 06:00,2021/07/25 06:01,['2021/07/24 06:13'],"['2020/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 06:13 [entrez]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41698-021-00209-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41698-021-00209-9 [pii]']",epublish,NPJ Precis Oncol. 2021 Jul 23;5(1):71. doi: 10.1038/s41698-021-00209-9.,71,['(c) 2021.

CK2 is overexpressed and overactive in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B cell lymphomas, leading to inappropriate activation of the NF-kappaB, JAK/STAT, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways and tumor growth. However, whether CK2 regulates normal B cell development and differentiation is not known. We generated mice lacking CK2alpha specifically in B cells (using CD19-driven Cre recombinase). These mice exhibited cell-intrinsic expansion of marginal zone B cells at the expense of transitional B cells, without changes in follicular B cells. Transitional B cells required CK2alpha to maintain adequate BCR signaling. In the absence of CK2alpha, reduced BCR signaling and elevated Notch2 signaling activation increased marginal zone B cell differentiation. Our results identify a previously unrecognized function for CK2alpha in B cell development and differentiation.","['Wei, Hairong', 'Yang, Wei', 'Hong, Huixian', 'Yan, Zhaoqi', 'Qin, Hongwei', 'Benveniste, Etty N']","['Wei H', 'Yang W', 'Hong H', 'Yan Z', 'Qin H', 'Benveniste EN']","['Department of Cell, Developmental, and Integrative Biology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294; and.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental, and Integrative Biology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294; and.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental, and Integrative Biology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294; and.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental, and Integrative Biology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294; and.', 'Gladstone Institute of Neurological Disease, San Francisco, CA 94158.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental, and Integrative Biology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294; and hqin@uab.edu.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental, and Integrative Biology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294; and.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7283-8775', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7511-5078']",['eng'],"['R01 CA158534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA194414/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS057563/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210723,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Csnk2a1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Casein Kinase II/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Integrases/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC8323969,,,2021/07/25 06:00,2021/08/10 06:00,['2021/07/24 05:40'],"['2021/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/08/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/24 05:40 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.2100059 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.2100059 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2021 Aug 1;207(3):799-808. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.2100059.

Here we demonstrate that an oncogenic mutant form of NPM1 (NPM1c) impairs mitochondrial function. NPM1c also hampers formation of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NB), which are regulators of mitochondrial fitness and key senescence effectors. Actinomycin D (ActD), an antibiotic with unambiguous clinical efficacy in relapsed/refractory NPM1c-AMLs, targets these primed mitochondria, releasing mitochondrial DNA, activating cyclic GMP-AMP synthase signaling, and boosting reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The latter restore PML NB formation to drive TP53 activation and senescence of NPM1c-AML cells. In several models, dual targeting of mitochondria by venetoclax and ActD synergized to clear AML and prolong survival through targeting of PML. Our studies reveal an unexpected role for mitochondria downstream of NPM1c and implicate a mitochondrial/ROS/PML/TP53 senescence pathway as an effector of ActD-based therapies. SIGNIFICANCE: ActD induces complete remissions in NPM1-mutant AMLs. We found that NPM1c affects mitochondrial biogenesis and PML NBs. ActD targets mitochondria, yielding ROS which enforce PML NB biogenesis and restore senescence.

METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, China National Knowledge of Infrastructure, and Wanfang data were systematically searched until October 31, 2020, for AML treatment with and without HHT. Fixed- and random-effect models were used to pool main outcomes, and between-study heterogeneity was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 37 articles (2846 patients) fitting our criterion were included. The pooled overall response rate for the patients treated with HHT was 82% (CI, 77.9%-85.6%; I(2) = 73.5%), and the complete response rate was 63.4% (CI, 58.8%-68%; I(2) = 67.3%). Our study showed that patients treated with HHT have more overall response and complete response benefits and less cardiotoxicity and relapse rate. Subgroup analysis showed that patients with AML treated with HHT have significant overall response benefits in patients younger than 60 (odds ratio [OR], 1.63; CI, 1.33-2; I(2) = 1.7%; P < .001), the newly diagnosed (OR, 1.59; CI, 1.15-2.21; I(2) = 34.7%; P = .006), and relapsed/refractory patients (OR, 2.13; CI, 1.38-3.29; I(2) = 32.3%; P = .001). Better complete remission benefits were observed in patients younger than 60 (OR, 1.32; CI, 1.1-1.59; I(2) = 7%; P = .004), the newly diagnosed (OR, 1.32; CI, 1.08-1.62; I(2) = 33.5%; P = .006), and relapsed/refractory patients (OR, 1.81; CI, 1.19-2.77; P = .006). For elderly patients, HHT treatment reduced relapse risk by 76.6% (OR, 0.23; CI, 0.09-0.63; I(2) = 0%; P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: HHT can be a reliable choice with less cardiotoxicity for patients with AML, especially for the newly diagnosed or patients younger than 60. For elderly intolerant patients, the use of HHT can reduce relapse.","['Mi, Ruihua', 'Zhao, Jin', 'Chen, Lin', 'Wei, Xudong', 'Liu, Jia', 'Wei, Xudong']","['Mi R', 'Zhao J', 'Chen L', 'Wei X', 'Liu J', 'Wei X']","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.

Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) is known as a treatment-associated complication; however, the full clinical spectra of PSH remain to be elusive. CASE REPORT: A 5-year-old girl was diagnosed of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M5. After the intensification therapy, she developed recurrent symptoms of episodic tachycardia, hypertension and perspiration lasting for several hours per day. The low-frequency-high-frequency ratio on Holter electrocardiography was rapidly increased from 0.84 to 2.24 at the onset of the paroxysmal event, whereas the video-monitoring electroencephalography (EEG) never identified ictal patterns of epileptiform discharges during the episodes. Thus, the diagnosis of PSH was given at 7 years of age. Myoclonic and generalized tonic-clonic seizures frequently appeared from 10 years of age, which poorly responded to anticonvulsants. EEG showed diffuse slow-wave bursts with multifocal spikes. Serial head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed diffuse cerebral and hippocampal atrophy, but not inflammatory lesions in the limbic system. CONCLUSION: We first demonstrate a pediatric case with PSH who developed drug-resistant epilepsy 3 years after the onset of PSH. Our data suggest the pathophysiological link of persistent PSH with chemotherapy-associated brain damage.","['Taira, Ryoji', 'Yamamura, Kenichiro', 'Maeda, Tomoko', 'Sakata, Ayumi', 'Watanabe, Eriko', 'Shimogawa, Takafumi', 'Mukae, Nobutaka', 'Ikeda, Chizuru', 'Migita, Masahiro', 'Watanabe, Osamu', 'Koga, Yuhki', 'Sakai, Yasunari', 'Ohga, Shouichi']","['Taira R', 'Yamamura K', 'Maeda T', 'Sakata A', 'Watanabe E', 'Shimogawa T', 'Mukae N', 'Ikeda C', 'Migita M', 'Watanabe O', 'Koga Y', 'Sakai Y', 'Ohga S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Perinatal and Pediatric Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Hospital Organization Kumamoto Saishun Medical Center, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Japanese Red Cross Kumamoto Hospital, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Neurology and Geriatrics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Perinatal and Pediatric Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.

While many individuals with detectable mCAs have no notable adverse outcomes, mCA-associated gene dosage alterations as well as clonal expansion of mutated leukocyte clones could increase susceptibility to disease. RESULTS: We performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) using existing data from 482,396 UK Biobank (UKBB) participants to investigate potential associations between mCAs and incident disease. Of the 1290 ICD codes we examined, our adjusted analysis identified a total of 50 incident disease outcomes associated with mCAs at PheWAS significance levels. We observed striking differences in the diseases associated with each type of alteration, with autosomal mCAs most associated with increased hematologic malignancies, incident infections and possibly cancer therapy-related conditions. Alterations of chromosome X were associated with increased lymphoid leukemia risk and, mCAs of chromosome Y were linked to potential reduced metabolic disease risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that a wide range of diseases are potential sequelae of mCAs and highlight the critical importance of careful covariate adjustment in mCA disease association studies.","['Lin, Shu-Hong', 'Brown, Derek W', 'Rose, Brandon', 'Day, Felix', 'Lee, Olivia W', 'Khan, Sairah M', 'Hislop, Jada', 'Chanock, Stephen J', 'Perry, John R B', 'Machiela, Mitchell J']","['Lin SH', 'Brown DW', 'Rose B', 'Day F', 'Lee OW', 'Khan SM', 'Hislop J', 'Chanock SJ', 'Perry JRB', 'Machiela MJ']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD, 20892, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD, 20892, USA.', 'University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, 33136, USA.', 'MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge, UK.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD, 20892, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD, 20892, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD, 20892, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD, 20892, USA.', 'MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge, UK.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD, 20892, USA. mitchell.machiela@nih.gov.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6538-9705'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210723,England,Cell Biosci,Cell & bioscience,101561195,,,,PMC8299574,['NOTNLM'],"['Mosaic chromosomal alterations', 'Mosaic loss of Y', 'PheWAS', 'Phenome-wide association study', 'UK Biobank']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/07/25 06:01,['2021/07/24 05:26'],"['2021/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 05:26 [entrez]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13578-021-00651-z [doi]', '10.1186/s13578-021-00651-z [pii]']",epublish,Cell Biosci. 2021 Jul 23;11(1):143. doi: 10.1186/s13578-021-00651-z.,143,['(c) 2021.

Four among them, compounds 4 - 6 and 16, were first confirmed in this study by UV, IR, 1D, 2D NMR and HR-ESI-MS spectra. Compounds 1 - 2 and 11 were isolated from Z. nitidium for the first time. Of the assayed compounds, 1, 2, 9, 10, 14, 15 and 24, exhibited good inhibitory activities in the leukaemia cell line HEL, whereas compound 14 (IC50: 3.59 microM) and compound 24 (IC50: 15.95 microM) exhibited potent inhibitory activities. So, to further investigate the possible mechanisms, cell cycle and apoptosis assays were performed, which indicated that compound 14 causes obvious S-phase arrest in HEL cells and induced apoptosis, whereas compound 24 only induced apoptosis. The present results suggested both compounds 14 and 24 are promising potential anti-leukaemia drug candidates.","['Deng, Ying', 'Ding, Tongtong', 'Deng, Lulu', 'Hao, Xiaojiang', 'Mu, Shuzhen']","['Deng Y', 'Ding T', 'Deng L', 'Hao X', 'Mu S']","['State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550014, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Guizhou University, Guiyang, 550025, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, 550014, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550014, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550014, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, 550014, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550014, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, 550014, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550014, China. muzi0558@126.com.', 'Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guiyang, 550014, China. muzi0558@126.com.']",,['eng'],['No. 31760097/National Natural Science Foundation of China'],['Journal Article'],20210723,Switzerland,BMC Chem,BMC chemistry,101741142,,,,PMC8305521,['NOTNLM'],"['Alkaloids', 'Benzophenanthridine', 'Cell apoptosis', 'Cell cycle', 'HEL cell', 'Leukaemia', 'Zanthoxylum nitidium']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/07/25 06:01,['2021/07/24 05:26'],"['2020/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 05:26 [entrez]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13065-021-00771-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s13065-021-00771-0 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Chem. 2021 Jul 23;15(1):44. doi: 10.1186/s13065-021-00771-0.,44,['(c) 2021.

The objective of this study was to correlate the expression of e14a2 or e13a2 to clinical characteristics, cumulative cytogenetic and molecular responses to IM, acquisition of deep molecular response (DMR) and its duration (sDMR), progression rate (CIP), overall survival (OS), and treatment-free remission (TFR) rate. We studied 202 CML patients, 76 expressing the e13a2 and 126 the e14a2, and correlated the differential transcript expression with the above-mentioned parameters. There were no differences in the cumulative incidence of cytogenetic responses nor in the acquisition of DMR and sDMR between the two groups, but the e14a2 transcript had a positive impact on molecular response during the first 6 months, whereas the e13a2 was associated with improved long-term OS.

The diagnosis is made by typical clinical and hematological findings associated with a compatible mutation. Although this is sufficient for clinical decision-making in most JMML cases, more in-depth analysis can include DNA methylation class and panel sequencing analysis for secondary mutations. NRAS-initiated JMML is heterogeneous and adequate management ranges from watchful waiting to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Upfront azacitidine in KRAS patients can achieve long-term remissions without HSCT; if HSCT is required, a less toxic preparative regimen is recommended. Germline CBL patients often experience spontaneous resolution of the leukemia or exhibit stable mixed chimerism after HSCT. JMML driven by PTPN11 or NF1 is often rapidly progressive, requires swift HSCT and may benefit from pretransplant therapy with azacitidine. Because graft-versus-leukemia alloimmunity is central to cure high risk patients, the immunosuppressive regimen should be discontinued early after HSCT.","['Mayerhofer, Christina', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte M', 'Flotho, Christian']","['Mayerhofer C', 'Niemeyer CM', 'Flotho C']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), 79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), 79106 Freiburg, Germany.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5755-1458', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3856-7937']",['eng'],"['MyPred 01GM1911A/Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung', 'CRC992-C05/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210713,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,PMC8305558,['NOTNLM'],"['5-azacitidine', 'RAS signaling', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia', 'myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorders', 'targeted therapy']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/07/25 06:01,['2021/07/24 01:07'],"['2021/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 01:07 [entrez]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/25 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm10143084 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm10143084 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2021 Jul 13;10(14). pii: jcm10143084. doi: 10.3390/jcm10143084.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate this association using a large nationwide electronic database. METHODS: This study was designed as a retrospective cohort study including GCA patients first diagnosed between 2002-2017 and age, sex and enrollment time-matched controls. Follow-up began at the date of first GCA-diagnosis and continued until first diagnosis of malignancy, death or end of study follow-up. RESULTS: The study enrolled 7213 GCA patients and 32,987 age- and sex-matched controls. The mean age of GCA diagnosis was 72.3 (SD 9.9) years and 69.1% were women. During the follow-up period, 659 (9.1%) of GCA patients were diagnosed with solid malignancies and 144 (2.0%) were diagnosed with hematologic malignancies. In cox-multivariate-analysis the risk of solid- malignancies (HR = 1.12 [95%CI: 1.02-1.22]), specifically renal neoplasms (HR = 1.60 [95%CI: 1.15-2.23]) and sarcomas (HR = 2.14 [95%CI: 1.41-3.24]), and the risk of hematologic malignancies (HR = 2.02 [95%CI: 1.66-2.47]), specifically acute leukemias (HR = 1.81 [95%CI: 1.06-3.07]), chronic leukemias (HR = 1.82 [95%CI: 1.19-2.77]), Hodgkin's lymphomas (HR = 2.42 [95%CI: 1.12-5.20]), non-Hodgkin's-lymphomas (HR = 1.66: [95%CI 1.21-2.29]) and multiple myeloma(HR = 2.40 [95%CI: 1.63-3.53]) were significantly increased in GCA patients compared to controls. Older age at GCA-diagnosis (HR = 1.36 [95%CI: 1.25-1.47]), male-gender (HR = 1.46 [95%CI: 1.24-1.72]), smoking (HR = 1.25 [95%CI: 1.04-1.51]) and medium-high socioeconomic status (HR = 1.27 [95%CI: 1.07-1.50]) were independently associated with solid malignancy while age (HR = 1.47 [95%CI: 1.22-1.77]) and male-gender (HR = 1.61 [95%CI: 1.14-2.29]) alone were independently associated with hematologic- malignancies. CONCLUSION: our study demonstrated higher incidence of hematologic and solid malignancies in GCA patients. Specifically, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, kidney malignancies, and sarcomas. Age and male gender were independent risk factors for hematological malignancies among GCA patients, while for solid malignancies, smoking and SES were risk factors as well.","['Dar, Lior', 'Ben-Shabat, Niv', 'Tiosano, Shmuel', 'Watad, Abdulla', 'McGonagle, Dennis', 'Komaneshter, Doron', 'Cohen, Arnon', 'Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi', 'Amital, Howard']","['Dar L', 'Ben-Shabat N', 'Tiosano S', 'Watad A', 'McGonagle D', 'Komaneshter D', 'Cohen A', 'Bragazzi NL', 'Amital H']","[""Department of Medicine 'B', The Zabludowicz Center for Autoimmune Diseases, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan 5265601, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.', ""Department of Medicine 'B', The Zabludowicz Center for Autoimmune Diseases, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan 5265601, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.', ""Department of Medicine 'B', The Zabludowicz Center for Autoimmune Diseases, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan 5265601, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.', ""Department of Medicine 'B', The Zabludowicz Center for Autoimmune Diseases, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan 5265601, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.', 'Section of Musculoskeletal Diseases, Leeds Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine, University of Leeds and Chapel Allerton Hospital, Chapeltown Road, Leeds LS7 4SA, UK.', 'Section of Musculoskeletal Diseases, Leeds Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine, University of Leeds and Chapel Allerton Hospital, Chapeltown Road, Leeds LS7 4SA, UK.', ""Chief Physician's Office, Clalit Health Services, Tel-Aviv 6209813, Israel."", ""Chief Physician's Office, Clalit Health Services, Tel-Aviv 6209813, Israel."", 'Siaal Research Center for Family Medicine and Primary Care, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva 8410501, Israel.', 'Laboratory for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (LIAM), York University, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.', ""Department of Medicine 'B', The Zabludowicz Center for Autoimmune Diseases, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan 5265601, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4721-2003', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1748-4297', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1404-8027', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8409-868X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5406-7716']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210716,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', '*Giant Cell Arteritis/complications/epidemiology', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",PMC8306706,['NOTNLM'],"['*autoinflammation', '*giant cell arteritis', '*malignancy', '*temporal arteritis', '*vasculitis']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/08/05 06:00,['2021/07/24 01:06'],"['2021/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 01:06 [entrez]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph18147595 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph18147595 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2021 Jul 16;18(14). pii: ijerph18147595. doi: 10.3390/ijerph18147595.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations of JAK2V617F, CALR, and MPL were analyzed in 159 Malaysian patients using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction, including 76 polycythemia vera (PV), 41 essential thrombocythemia (ET), and 42 primary myelofibrosis (PMF) mutations, and the demographics of the patients were retrieved. The result showed that 73.6% JAK2V617F, 5.66% CALR, and 27.7% were triple-negative mutations. No MPL W515L/K mutation was detected. In ET and PMF, the predominance type was the CALR Type 1 mutation. In JAK2V617F mutant patients, serum LDH was significantly higher in PMF compared to PV and ET. PV has a higher risk of evolving to post PV myelofibrosis compared to ET.

Hispanics show marked health disparities in ALL, often absent in clinical trials or cancer research. Thus, it is unknown whether Hispanics would benefit equally from curated data currently guiding precision oncology. Using whole-exome sequencing, nine ALL patients were screened for mutations within genes known to possess diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value. Genes mutated in Hispanic ALL patients from the borderland were mined for potentially pathogenic variants within clinically relevant genes. KRAS G12A was detected in this unique cohort and its frequency in Hispanics from the TARGET-ALL Phase II database was three-fold greater than that of non-Hispanics. STAT5B N642H was also detected with low frequency in Hispanic and non-Hispanic individuals within TARGET. Its detection within this small cohort may reflect a common event in this demographic. Such variants occurring in the MAPK and JAK/STAT pathways may be contributing to Hispanic health disparities in ALL. Notable variants in ROS1, WT1, and NOTCH2 were observed in the ALL borderland cohort, with NOTCH2 C19W occurring most frequently. Further investigations on the pathogenicity of these variants are needed to assess their relevance in ALL.","['Grant, Alice Hernandez', 'Ayala-Marin, Yoshira Marie', 'Mohl, Jonathon Edward', 'Robles-Escajeda, Elisa', 'Rodriguez, Georgialina', 'Dutil, Julie', 'Kirken, Robert Arthur']","['Grant AH', 'Ayala-Marin YM', 'Mohl JE', 'Robles-Escajeda E', 'Rodriguez G', 'Dutil J', 'Kirken RA']","['Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968, USA.', 'Department of Mathematical Sciences, College of Science, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Cancer Biology Division, Ponce Research Institute, Ponce Health Sciences University, Ponce, PR 00716, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1124-5818', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4440-4608', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0104-2857']",['eng'],['5U54MD007592/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20210709,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Genomics', 'Humans', 'Mexico', 'Mutation', 'Precision Medicine', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins']",PMC8307122,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*Hispanic health disparities', '*KRAS', '*NOTCH2', '*ROS1', '*STAT5B', '*WT1', '*precision medicine', '*relapse']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/08/12 06:00,['2021/07/24 01:05'],"['2021/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 01:05 [entrez]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/12 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph18147345 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph18147345 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2021 Jul 9;18(14). pii: ijerph18147345. doi: 10.3390/ijerph18147345.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the exclusive effects of KRIBB11 in preventing the growth of glioblastoma cells and the related mechanisms have not been elucidated yet. Herein, we aimed to examine the potential of KRIBB11 as an anticancer agent for glioblastoma. Using MTT and colony formation assays and Western blotting for c-PARP, we demonstrated that KRIBB11 substantially inhibits the growth of A172 glioma cells by inducing apoptosis. At the molecular level, KRIBB11 decreased anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1 levels, which was attributable to the increase in MULE ubiquitin ligase levels. However, the constitutive activity of HSF1 in A172 cells was not influenced by the exclusive treatment with KRIBB11. Additionally, based on cycloheximide chase assay, we found that KRIBB11 markedly retarded the degradation of MULE. In conclusion, stabilization of MULE upon KRIBB11 treatment is apparently an essential step for degradation of MCL-1 and the subsequent induction of apoptosis in A172 cells. Our results have expanded the knowledge on molecular pathways controlled by KRIBB11 and could be potentially effective for developing an inhibitory therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma.","['Yoo, Kyunghyun', 'Yun, Hye-Hyeon', 'Jung, Soon-Young', 'Lee, Jeong-Hwa']","['Yoo K', 'Yun HH', 'Jung SY', 'Lee JH']","['Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 16591, Korea.', 'Institute for Aging and Metabolic Diseases, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 16591, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedicine & Health Sciences, Graduate School, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 16591, Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 16591, Korea.', 'Institute for Aging and Metabolic Diseases, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 16591, Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 16591, Korea.', 'Institute for Aging and Metabolic Diseases, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 16591, Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 16591, Korea.', 'Institute for Aging and Metabolic Diseases, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 16591, Korea.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5970-194X'],['eng'],['2019R1A2C1086949/National Research Foundation of Korea'],['Journal Article'],20210708,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (N2-(1H-indazole-5-yl)-N6-methyl-3-nitropyridine-2,6-diamine)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (HUWE1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Aminopyridines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Glioblastoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Glioma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indazoles/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/drug effects/metabolism']",PMC8305965,['NOTNLM'],"['KRIBB11', 'MCL-1', 'apoptosis', 'glioblastoma']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/09/21 06:00,['2021/07/24 01:04'],"['2021/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/30 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 01:04 [entrez]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules26144165 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules26144165 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2021 Jul 8;26(14). pii: molecules26144165. doi: 10.3390/molecules26144165.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, retinoids have not yet been translated into effective systemic treatments for most solid tumors. RA signaling is mediated by the following two nuclear retinoic receptor subtypes: the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and the retinoic X receptor (RXR), and their isoforms. The identification of mutations in retinoid receptors and other RA signaling pathway genes in human cancers offers opportunities for target discovery, drug design, and personalized medicine for distinct molecular retinoid subtypes. For example, chromosomal translocation involving RARA occurs in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is a highly effective and even curative therapeutic for APL patients. Thus, retinoid-based target discovery presents an important line of attack toward designing new, more effective strategies for treating other cancer types. Here, we review retinoid signaling, provide an update on retinoid agents and the current clinical research on retinoids in cancer, and discuss how the retinoid pathway genotype affects the ability of retinoid agents to inhibit the growth of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. We also deliberate on why retinoid agents have not shown clinical efficacy against solid tumors and discuss alternative strategies that could overcome the lack of efficacy.","['Hunsu, Victoria O', 'Facey, Caroline O B', 'Fields, Jeremy Z', 'Boman, Bruce M']","['Hunsu VO', 'Facey COB', 'Fields JZ', 'Boman BM']","['Center for Translational Cancer Research, Helen F.

The most common point mutation in FLT3 occurs at the 835th residue (D835A/E/F/G/H/I/N/V/Y), in the activation loop region. The D835 residue is critical in maintaining FLT3 inactive conformation; these mutations might influence the interaction with clinically approved AML inhibitors used to treat the AML. The molecular mechanism of each of these mutations and their interactions with AML inhibitors at the atomic level is still unknown. In this manuscript, we have investigated the structural consequence of native and mutant FLT-3 proteins and their molecular mechanisms at the atomic level, using molecular dynamics simulations (MDS). In addition, we use the molecular docking method to investigate the binding pattern between the FLT-3 protein and AML inhibitors upon mutations. This study apparently elucidates that, due to mutations in the D835, the FLT-3 structure loses its conformation and becomes more flexible compared to the native FLT3 protein. These structural changes are suggested to contribute to the relapse and resistance responses to AML inhibitors. Identifying the effects of FLT3 at the molecular level will aid in developing a personalized therapeutic strategy for treating patients with FLT-3-associated AML.","['Al-Subaie, Abeer M', 'Kamaraj, Balu']","['Al-Subaie AM', 'Kamaraj B']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam 31441, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Neuroscience Technology, College of Applied Medical Sciences in Jubail, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Jubail 35816, Saudi Arabia.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9332-7082', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9747-3984']",['eng'],"['This work was primarily supported by grants from the newly recruited faculty', 'program, Deanship of Scientific Research, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University', '(Grant No. 2019-162-AMSJ), Dammam, Saudi Arabia./Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal', 'University']",['Journal Article'],20210716,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Computer Simulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Docking Simulation/methods', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Mutation/drug effects/genetics', 'Point Mutation/drug effects/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/drug effects/genetics', 'Protein Conformation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC8303888,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'FLT3', 'flexibility', 'inhibitors', 'interaction', 'leukemia', 'mutations']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/08/13 06:00,['2021/07/24 01:02'],"['2021/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/30 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 01:02 [entrez]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22147602 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22147602 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Jul 16;22(14). pii: ijms22147602. doi: 10.3390/ijms22147602.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Functional analysis reveals that RUNX1-JAK2 knock-in cell lines yield fewer hematopoietic progenitors, due to RUNX1 haploinsufficiency. Nevertheless, these progenitors further differentiate toward myeloid lineages to a similar extent as wild-type cells. The expression of the RUNX1-JAK2 fusion protein only elicits subtle effects on myeloid differentiation, and is unable to transform early hematopoietic progenitors. However, phosphoprotein and transcriptome analyses reveal that RUNX1-JAK2 constitutively activates JAK-STAT signaling in differentiating hiPSCs and at the same time upregulates MYC targets-confirming the interaction between these pathways. This proof-of-principle study indicates that conditional expression of oncogenic fusion proteins in combination with hematopoietic differentiation of hiPSCs may be applicable to leukemia-relevant disease modeling.","['Fortschegger, Klaus', 'Husa, Anna-Maria', 'Schinnerl, Dagmar', 'Nebral, Karin', 'Strehl, Sabine']","['Fortschegger K', 'Husa AM', 'Schinnerl D', 'Nebral K', 'Strehl S']","[""St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), 1090 Vienna, Austria."", ""St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), 1090 Vienna, Austria."", ""St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), 1090 Vienna, Austria."", ""St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), 1090 Vienna, Austria."", ""St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), 1090 Vienna, Austria.""]","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1276-0368', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4918-9302', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0179-0628']",['eng'],"['843456/Osterreichische Forschungsforderungsgesellschaft', 'OGKJ scientific prize 2016/Austrian Society for Pediatrics and Adolescent', 'Medicine']",['Journal Article'],20210715,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC8304339,['NOTNLM'],"['CRISPR/Cas9', 'JAK-STAT signaling', 'MYC pathway', 'hematopoiesis', 'hiPSC', 'leukemia', 'oncogenic fusion']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/08/20 06:00,['2021/07/24 01:02'],"['2021/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 01:02 [entrez]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/20 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22147576 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22147576 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Jul 15;22(14). pii: ijms22147576. doi: 10.3390/ijms22147576.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The delineation of the transcriptional pathways that mediate Wnt-induced hPSCs to NSCs differentiation is vital for understanding the global genomic mechanisms of the development of NSCs and, potentially, the creation of new protocols in regenerative medicine. To understand the genomic mechanism of Wnt signaling during NSCs development, we treated hPSCs with Wnt activator (CHIR-99021) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in a chemically defined medium (N2B27) to induce NSCs, referred to as CLNSCs. The CLNSCs were subcultured for more than 40 passages in vitro; were positive for AP staining; expressed neural progenitor markers such as NESTIN, PAX6, SOX2, and SOX1; and were able to differentiate into three neural lineage cells: neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in vitro. Our transcriptome analyses revealed that the Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways regulate hPSCs cell fate decisions for neural lineages and maintain the self-renewal of CLNSCs. One interesting network could be the deregulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in CLNSCs via the downregulation of c-MYC, which may promote exit from pluripotency and neural differentiation. The Wnt-induced spinal markers HOXA1-4, HOXA7, HOXB1-4, and HOXC4 were increased, however, the brain markers FOXG1 and OTX2, were absent in the CLNSCs, indicating that CLNSCs have partial spinal cord properties. Finally, a CLNSC simple culture condition, when applied to hPSCs, supports the generation of NSCs, and provides a new and efficient cell model with which to untangle the mechanisms during neurogenesis.","['Liu, Bing-Chun', 'Liu, Fang-Yuan', 'Gao, Xin-Yue', 'Chen, Yang-Lin', 'Meng, Qiao-Qiao', 'Song, Yong-Li', 'Li, Xi-He', 'Bao, Si-Qin']","['Liu BC', 'Liu FY', 'Gao XY', 'Chen YL', 'Meng QQ', 'Song YL', 'Li XH', 'Bao SQ']","['The State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'Research Center for Animal Genetic Resources of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'Research Center for Animal Genetic Resources of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'Research Center for Animal Genetic Resources of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'Research Center for Animal Genetic Resources of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'Research Center for Animal Genetic Resources of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'Research Center for Animal Genetic Resources of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'Research Center for Animal Genetic Resources of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'Inner Mongolia Saikexing Institute of Breeding and Reproductive Biotechnology in Domestic Animal, Hohhot 011517, China.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'Research Center for Animal Genetic Resources of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210712,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/*analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/administration & dosage', 'Neural Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', '*Neurogenesis', 'Neurons/*cytology/metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', '*Transcriptome', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway']",PMC8308016,['NOTNLM'],"['Wnt signaling', 'human pluripotent stem cells', 'neural stem cells', 'spinal cord']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/07/31 06:00,['2021/07/24 01:02'],"['2021/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 01:02 [entrez]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22147473 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22147473 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Jul 12;22(14). pii: ijms22147473. doi: 10.3390/ijms22147473.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) this can induce chemoresistance, partially through a decrease in cell activity. Here we investigated if the internalization of PMPs protected the monocytic AML cell line, THP-1, from apoptosis by decreasing the initial cellular damage inflicted by treatment with daunorubicin, or via direct modulation of the apoptotic response. We examined whether PMPs could protect against apoptosis after treatment with a selection of inducers, primarily associated with either the intrinsic or the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, and protection was restricted to the agents targeting intrinsic apoptosis. Furthermore, levels of daunorubicin-induced DNA damage, assessed by measuring gH2AX, were reduced in both 2N and 4N cells after PMP co-incubation. Measuring different BCL2-family proteins before and after treatment with daunorubicin revealed that PMPs downregulated the pro-apoptotic PUMA protein. Thus, our findings indicated that PMPs may protect AML cells against apoptosis by reducing DNA damage both dependent and independent of cell cycle phase, and via direct modulation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by downregulating PUMA. These findings further support the clinical relevance of platelets and PMPs in AML.","['Cacic, Daniel', 'Nordgard, Oddmund', 'Meyer, Peter', 'Hervig, Tor']","['Cacic D', 'Nordgard O', 'Meyer P', 'Hervig T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Stavanger University Hospital, 4068 Stavanger, Norway.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Stavanger University Hospital, 4068 Stavanger, Norway.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Stavanger University Hospital, 4068 Stavanger, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Laboratory of Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Haugesund Hospital, 5528 Haugesund, Norway.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3298-2101'],['eng'],"['na/Bergen Stem Cell Consortium', 'na/Helse Vest Regionalt Helseforetak']",['Journal Article'],20210706,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'THP-1 Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology']",PMC8304976,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myelogenous leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'microparticles', 'platelets']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/08/06 06:00,['2021/07/24 01:01'],"['2021/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 01:01 [entrez]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22147264 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22147264 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Jul 6;22(14). pii: ijms22147264. doi: 10.3390/ijms22147264.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we found that if ABCB1 overexpression occurs in myeloid blasts of newly diagnosed MDS patients, latrophilin-1 expression is attenuated. Latrophilin-1 may initiate TIM-3- and galectin-9-mediated immune escape. We demonstrated changes in the expression of both proteins by comparing ABCB1-positive cell variants (MOLM-13/VCR, SKM-1/VCR) with their ABCB1-negative counterparts. Galectin-9 was present in our cell lines in eight protein isoforms for which we identified the respective transcription variants resulting from alternative splicing, and we verified their structure by sequencing. The isoform profile of galectin-9 was different between ABCB1-positive and ABCB1-negative cell variants.

Among its cellular components, tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) represent a component of the innate immune system and play an important role, especially in hematologic malignancies. Depending on the stimuli that trigger their activation, TAM are polarized towards form M1, contributing to antitumor responses, or M2, associated with tumor progression. Many studies demonstrated a correlation between TAM, disease progression and the patient's outcome in lymphoproliferative neoplasms, such as Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), even if with conflicting results. A critical hurdle to overcome is surely represented by the heterogeneity in the choice of the optimal markers and methods used for TAM analysis (gene-expression profile vs. immunohistochemistry, CD163vs. CD68vs. CD163/CD68 double-positive cells). TAM have been recently linked to the development and progression of multiple myeloma and leukemia, with a critical role in the homing of malignant cells, drug resistance, immune suppression and angiogenesis. As such, this review will summarize the role of TAM in different hematologic malignancies, focusing on the complex interplay between TAM and tumor cells, the prognostic value of TAM and the possible TAM-targeted therapeutic strategies.","['Cencini, Emanuele', 'Fabbri, Alberto', 'Sicuranza, Anna', 'Gozzetti, Alessandro', 'Bocchia, Monica']","['Cencini E', 'Fabbri A', 'Sicuranza A', 'Gozzetti A', 'Bocchia M']","['Unit of Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, University of Siena, 53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, University of Siena, 53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, University of Siena, 53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, University of Siena, 53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, University of Siena, 53100 Siena, Italy.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0769-6891', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3538-3913']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210718,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC8304632,['NOTNLM'],"['TAM', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'myeloma', 'prognosis']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/07/25 06:01,['2021/07/24 01:01'],"['2021/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 01:01 [entrez]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/25 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13143597 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13143597 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Jul 18;13(14). pii: cancers13143597. doi: 10.3390/cancers13143597.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) target the BCR-ABL fusion protein, which is considered the major CML driver. TKI use has highlighted the existence of intra-clonal heterogeneity, as indicated by the persistence of a minority subclone for several years despite the presence of the target fusion protein in all cells. Epigenetic modifications could partly explain this heterogeneity. This review summarizes the results of DNA methylation studies in CML. Next-generation sequencing technologies allowed for moving from single-gene to genome-wide analyses showing that methylation abnormalities are much more widespread in CML cells. These data showed that global hypomethylation is associated with hypermethylation of specific sites already at diagnosis in the early phase of CML. The BCR-ABL-independence of some methylation profile alterations and the recent demonstration of the initial intra-clonal DNA methylation heterogeneity suggests that some DNA methylation alterations may be biomarkers of TKI sensitivity/resistance and of disease progression risk. These results also open perspectives for understanding the epigenetic/genetic background of CML predisposition and for developing new therapeutic strategies.","['Lebecque, Benjamin', 'Bourgne, Celine', 'Vidal, Veronique', 'Berger, Marc G']","['Lebecque B', 'Bourgne C', 'Vidal V', 'Berger MG']","['Hematologie Biologique, CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Hopital Estaing, 1 Place Lucie et Raymond Aubrac, CEDEX 1, 63003 Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ""Equipe d'Accueil 7453 CHELTER, Universite Clermont Auvergne, CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Hopital Estaing, 1 place Lucie et Raymond Aubrac, CEDEX 1, 63003 Clermont-Ferrand, France."", 'Hematologie Biologique, CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Hopital Estaing, 1 Place Lucie et Raymond Aubrac, CEDEX 1, 63003 Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ""Equipe d'Accueil 7453 CHELTER, Universite Clermont Auvergne, CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Hopital Estaing, 1 place Lucie et Raymond Aubrac, CEDEX 1, 63003 Clermont-Ferrand, France."", 'Helixio, 63360 Saint-Beauzire, France.', 'Hematologie Biologique, CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Hopital Estaing, 1 Place Lucie et Raymond Aubrac, CEDEX 1, 63003 Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ""Equipe d'Accueil 7453 CHELTER, Universite Clermont Auvergne, CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Hopital Estaing, 1 place Lucie et Raymond Aubrac, CEDEX 1, 63003 Clermont-Ferrand, France.""]",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4890-336X'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210717,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC8307727,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'clonal heterogeneity']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/07/25 06:01,['2021/07/24 01:01'],"['2021/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 01:01 [entrez]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/25 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13143587 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13143587 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Jul 17;13(14). pii: cancers13143587. doi: 10.3390/cancers13143587.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For multiple myeloma (MM), B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeted CAR-T cells have achieved outstanding complete response rates, but unfortunately, patients often relapse within a year of receiving the therapy. Increased persistence and reduced dysfunction are crucial features that enhance the durability of CAR-T cell responses. One of the factors that influence CAR-T cell in vivo longevity and loss of function, but which has not yet been extensively studied for BCMA-directed CAR-T cells, are the cytokines used during their production. We here compared the impact of IL-2, IL-15 and a combination of IL-15/IL-7 on the phenotype and function of ARI2h, an academic BCMA-directed CAR-T cell that is currently being administered to MM patients. For this study, flow cytometry, in vitro cytotoxicity assays and analysis of cytokine release were performed. In addition, ARI2h cells expanded with IL-2, IL-15, or IL-15/IL-7 were injected into MM tumor-bearing mice to assess their in vivo efficacy. We demonstrated that each of the cytokine conditions was suitable for the expansion of ARI2h cells, with clear in vitro activity. Strikingly, however, IL-15-produced ARI2h cells had improved in vivo efficacy and persistence. When explored further, it was found that IL-15 drove a less-differentiated ARI2h phenotype, ameliorated parameters related to CAR-T cell dysfunction, and lowered the release of cytokines potentially involved in cytokine release syndrome and MM progression. Moreover, we observed that IL-15 was less potent in inducing T cell senescence and DNA damage accumulation, both of which may contribute to an unfavorable CAR-T cell phenotype. These findings show the superiority of IL-15 to IL-2 and IL-15/IL-7 in the quality of anti-BCMA CAR-T cells, particularly their efficacy and persistence, and as such, could improve the duration of responses if applied to the clinical production of CAR-T cells for patients.","['Battram, Anthony M', 'Bachiller, Mireia', 'Lopez, Victor', 'Fernandez de Larrea, Carlos', 'Urbano-Ispizua, Alvaro', 'Martin-Antonio, Beatriz']","['Battram AM', 'Bachiller M', 'Lopez V', 'Fernandez de Larrea C', 'Urbano-Ispizua A', 'Martin-Antonio B']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Barcelona, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Barcelona, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, 08036 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, 28040 Madrid, Spain.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9179-0639', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6153-4722', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4930-9255', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0612-2693']",['eng'],"['CP042702/""la Caixa"" Foundation', 'PI17/01043/Instituto de Salud Carlos III', 'PI19/00669/Instituto de Salud Carlos III', 'ICI19/00025/Instituto de Salud Carlos III', 'SGR468/European Regional Development Fund', ""2017-SGR-00792/Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca""]",['Journal Article'],20210714,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC8304527,['NOTNLM'],"['BCMA', 'CAR-T cells', 'IL-15', 'IL-2', 'IL-7', 'multiple myeloma', 'senescence']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/07/25 06:01,['2021/07/24 01:01'],"['2021/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 01:01 [entrez]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/25 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13143534 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13143534 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Jul 14;13(14). pii: cancers13143534. doi: 10.3390/cancers13143534.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have examined the role of the VLA-4 integrin, a major adhesion molecule of the immune system, in the chemoresistance of T-ALL cells. We found that attachment of Jurkat and HSB-2 T-ALL cells to VCAM-1, a VLA-4 ligand, inhibits doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. However, their adhesion to fibronectin, which is mainly mediated via VLA-5, had no effect. Even the presence of the chemoattractant SDF1alpha (Stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha), which enhances the adhesion of T-ALL cells to fibronectin, did not modify the sensitivity of the cells attached on fibronectin towards doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, we found that VLA-4 promoted T-ALL chemoresistance by inducing doxorubicin efflux. Our results showed that cell adhesion to both fibronectin and VCAM-1-induced Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation in T-ALL cells. However, only cell adhesion to VCAM-1 led to PYK2 phosphorylation. Inhibition studies indicated that FAK is not involved in doxorubicin efflux and chemoresistance, whereas PYK2 inhibition abrogated both VLA-4-induced doxorubicin efflux and chemoresistance. Together, these results indicate that the VLA-4/PYK2 pathway could participate in T-ALL chemoresistance and its targeting could be beneficial to limit/avoid chemoresistance and patient relapse.","['Berrazouane, Sofiane', 'Doucet, Alexie', 'Boisvert, Marc', 'Barabe, Frederic', 'Aoudjit, Fawzi']","['Berrazouane S', 'Doucet A', 'Boisvert M', 'Barabe F', 'Aoudjit F']","['Division of Immune and Infectious Diseases, CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval Research Center, Quebec City, QC G1V 4G2, Canada.', 'Division of Immune and Infectious Diseases, CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval Research Center, Quebec City, QC G1V 4G2, Canada.', 'Division of Immune and Infectious Diseases, CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval Research Center, Quebec City, QC G1V 4G2, Canada.', 'Division of Immune and Infectious Diseases, CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval Research Center, Quebec City, QC G1V 4G2, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.', 'Division of Immune and Infectious Diseases, CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval Research Center, Quebec City, QC G1V 4G2, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology-Infectiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.']",,['eng'],['MOP-136819/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada'],['Journal Article'],20210714,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC8307050,['NOTNLM'],"['PYK2', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'VCAM-1', 'VLA-4', 'chemoresistance', 'drug efflux']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/07/25 06:01,['2021/07/24 01:01'],"['2021/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/01 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 01:01 [entrez]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/25 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13143512 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13143512 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Jul 14;13(14). pii: cancers13143512. doi: 10.3390/cancers13143512.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mitochondrial metabolism also affects the immune system and therefore the anti-tumor response. The modulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPHOS) has emerged as a promising approach to improve the therapy outcome for AML patients. However, the effect of mitochondrial inhibitors on the immune compartment in the context of AML is yet to be explored. Immune checkpoints such as ectonucleotidase CD39 and programmed dead ligand 1 (PD-L1) have been reported to be expressed in AML and linked to chemo-resistance and a poor prognosis. In the present study, we first demonstrated that a novel selective electron transfer chain complex (ETC) I inhibitor, EVT-701, decreased the OxPHOS metabolism of murine and human cytarabine (AraC)-resistant leukemic cell lines. Furthermore, we showed that while AraC induced an immune response regulation by increasing CD39 expression and by reinforcing the interferon-gamma/PD-L1 axis, EVT-701 reduced CD39 and PD-L1 expression in vitro in a panel of both murine and human AML cell lines, especially upon AraC treatment. Altogether, this work uncovers a non-canonical function of ETCI in controlling CD39 and PD-L1 immune checkpoints, thereby improving the anti-tumor response in AML.","['Luna-Yolba, Raquel', 'Marmoiton, Justine', 'Gigo, Veronique', 'Marechal, Xavier', 'Boet, Emeline', 'Sahal, Ambrine', 'Alet, Nathalie', 'Abramovich, Ifat', 'Gottlieb, Eyal', 'Visentin, Virgile', 'Paillasse, Michael R', 'Sarry, Jean-Emmanuel']","['Luna-Yolba R', 'Marmoiton J', 'Gigo V', 'Marechal X', 'Boet E', 'Sahal A', 'Alet N', 'Abramovich I', 'Gottlieb E', 'Visentin V', 'Paillasse MR', 'Sarry JE']","['EVOTEC, Campus Curie, 31100 Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, Universite de Toulouse, Inserm, CNRS, 31100 Toulouse, France.', 'LabEx Toucan, 31100 Toulouse, France.', 'Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer 2018, 31100 Toulouse, France.', 'EVOTEC, Campus Curie, 31100 Toulouse, France.', 'EVOTEC, Campus Curie, 31100 Toulouse, France.', 'EVOTEC, Campus Curie, 31100 Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, Universite de Toulouse, Inserm, CNRS, 31100 Toulouse, France.', 'LabEx Toucan, 31100 Toulouse, France.', 'Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer 2018, 31100 Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, Universite de Toulouse, Inserm, CNRS, 31100 Toulouse, France.', 'LabEx Toucan, 31100 Toulouse, France.', 'Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer 2018, 31100 Toulouse, France.', 'EVOTEC, Campus Curie, 31100 Toulouse, France.', 'Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 32000, Israel.', 'Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 32000, Israel.', 'EVOTEC, Campus Curie, 31100 Toulouse, France.', 'EVOTEC, Campus Curie, 31100 Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, Universite de Toulouse, Inserm, CNRS, 31100 Toulouse, France.', 'LabEx Toucan, 31100 Toulouse, France.', 'Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer 2018, 31100 Toulouse, France.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1315-858X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4755-2884', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6704-2032']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210713,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC8306173,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Immune checkpoints', 'OxPHOS']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/07/25 06:01,['2021/07/24 01:01'],"['2021/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 01:01 [entrez]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/25 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13143499 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13143499 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Jul 13;13(14). pii: cancers13143499. doi: 10.3390/cancers13143499.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mechanisms that determine whether cells undergo apoptosis in response to hydroxyurea are ill-defined. We used unbiased proteomics to uncover which pathways control the transition of the hydroxyurea-induced replication stress into an apoptotic program in chronic and acute myeloid leukemia cells. We noted a decrease in the serine/threonine kinase RAF1/c-RAF in cells that undergo apoptosis in response to clinically relevant doses of hydroxyurea. Using the RAF inhibitor LY3009120, we show that RAF activity determines the sensitivity of leukemic cells toward hydroxyurea. We further disclose that pharmacological inhibition of the RAF downstream target BCL-XL with the drug navitoclax and RNAi combine favorably with hydroxyurea against leukemic cells. BCR-ABL1 and hyperactive FLT3 are tyrosine kinases that causally contribute to the development of leukemia and induce RAF1 and BCL-XL. Accordingly, the ABL inhibitor imatinib and the FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib sensitize leukemic cells to pro-apoptotic effects of hydroxyurea. Moreover, hydroxyurea and navitoclax kill leukemic cells with mutant FLT3 that are resistant to quizartinib.

NPM1 localization in the cell is finely tuned by specific signal motifs, with two tryptophan residues (Trp) being essential for the nucleolar localization. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), several NPM1 mutations have been reported, all resulting in cytoplasmic delocalization, but the putative biological and clinical significance of different variants are still debated. We explored HOXA and HOXB gene expression profile in AML patients and found a differential expression between NPM1 mutations inducing the loss of two (A-like) Trp residues and those determining the loss of one Trp residue (non-A-like). We thus expressed NPM1 A-like- or non-A-like-mutated vectors in AML cell lines finding that NPM1 partially remained in the nucleolus in the non-A-like NPM1-mutated cells. As a result, only in A-like-mutated cells we detected HOXA5, HOXA10, and HOXB5 hyper-expression and p14ARF/p21/p53 pathway deregulation, leading to reduced sensitivity to the treatment with either chemotherapy or Venetoclax, as compared to non-A-like cells. Overall, we identified that the NPM1 mutational status mediates crucial biological characteristics of AML cells, providing the basis for further sub-classification and, potentially, management of this subgroup of patients.","['Tregnago, Claudia', 'Benetton, Maddalena', 'Padrin, Davide', 'Polato, Katia', 'Borella, Giulia', 'Da Ros, Ambra', 'Marchetti, Anna', 'Porcu, Elena', 'Del Bufalo, Francesca', 'Mecucci, Cristina', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Pigazzi, Martina']","['Tregnago C', 'Benetton M', 'Padrin D', 'Polato K', 'Borella G', 'Da Ros A', 'Marchetti A', 'Porcu E', 'Del Bufalo F', 'Mecucci C', 'Locatelli F', 'Pigazzi M']","[""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Haematology-Oncology Clinic and Lab, University of Padova, 35128 Padova, Italy."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Haematology-Oncology Clinic and Lab, University of Padova, 35128 Padova, Italy."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Haematology-Oncology Clinic and Lab, University of Padova, 35128 Padova, Italy."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Haematology-Oncology Clinic and Lab, University of Padova, 35128 Padova, Italy."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Haematology-Oncology Clinic and Lab, University of Padova, 35128 Padova, Italy."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Haematology-Oncology Clinic and Lab, University of Padova, 35128 Padova, Italy."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Haematology-Oncology Clinic and Lab, University of Padova, 35128 Padova, Italy."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Haematology-Oncology Clinic and Lab, University of Padova, 35128 Padova, Italy."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, 00165 Roma, Italy."", 'Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, 06123 Perugia, Italy.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, 00165 Roma, Italy."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Sapienza University of Rome, 00185 Roma, Italy.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Haematology-Oncology Clinic and Lab, University of Padova, 35128 Padova, Italy.""]","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8122-0555', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9643-3465', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4793-5263']",['eng'],"['IG 20562/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro', '5xmille-9962/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro', 'RF-2010-2316606/Ministero della Salute', '5xmille MYNERVA/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro', 'CoG/Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica IRP']",['Journal Article'],20210710,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC8304368,['NOTNLM'],"['HOX genes', 'Nucleophosmin, NPM1', 'TP53', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'drug treatment', 'gene expression', 'genetic', 'mutation']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/07/25 06:01,['2021/07/24 01:00'],"['2021/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 01:00 [entrez]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/25 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13143457 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13143457 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Jul 10;13(14). pii: cancers13143457. doi: 10.3390/cancers13143457.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is poor (20-37%), as is the overall survival benefit at five years (9%). The EAC genome is complex and heterogeneous between patients, and it is not yet understood whether specific mutational patterns may result in chemotherapy sensitivity or resistance. To identify associations between genomic events and response to NAC in EAC, a comparative genomic analysis was performed in 65 patients with extensive clinical and pathological annotation using whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We defined response using Mandard Tumor Regression Grade (TRG), with responders classified as TRG1-2 (n = 27) and non-responders classified as TRG4-5 (n =38). We report a higher non-synonymous mutation burden in responders (median 2.08/Mb vs. 1.70/Mb, p = 0.036) and elevated copy number variation in non-responders (282 vs. 136/patient, p < 0.001). We identified copy number variants unique to each group in our cohort, with cell cycle (CDKN2A, CCND1), c-Myc (MYC), RTK/PIK3 (KRAS, EGFR) and gastrointestinal differentiation (GATA6) pathway genes being specifically altered in non-responders. Of note, NAV3 mutations were exclusively present in the non-responder group with a frequency of 22%. Thus, lower mutation burden, higher chromosomal instability and specific copy number alterations are associated with resistance to NAC.","['Izadi, Fereshteh', 'Sharpe, Benjamin P', 'Breininger, Stella P', 'Secrier, Maria', 'Gibson, Jane', 'Walker, Robert C', 'Rahman, Saqib', 'Devonshire, Ginny', 'Lloyd, Megan A', 'Walters, Zoe S', 'Fitzgerald, Rebecca C', 'Rose-Zerilli, Matthew J J', 'Underwood, Tim J', 'On Behalf Of Occams']","['Izadi F', 'Sharpe BP', 'Breininger SP', 'Secrier M', 'Gibson J', 'Walker RC', 'Rahman S', 'Devonshire G', 'Lloyd MA', 'Walters ZS', 'Fitzgerald RC', 'Rose-Zerilli MJJ', 'Underwood TJ', 'On Behalf Of Occams']","['School of Cancer Sciences, Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'Centre for NanoHealth, Swansea University Medical School, Singleton Campus, Swansea SA2 8PP, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'UCL Genetics Institute, Division of Biosciences, University College London, Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0RE, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK.', 'MRC Cancer Unit, Hutchison/MRC Research Centre, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 OXZ, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7594-1601', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2758-1741', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0973-8285', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2101-1318', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9489-0021', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1835-5868', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9455-2188']",['eng'],"['A23924/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', '2016/JGF/0003/Leukaemia UK', 'N/A/Southampton CRUK Centre Development Fund', 'RG66287/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'RG81771/84119/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'RG84369/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'BRC-1215-20014/NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre', '2011 R06/Wessex Medical Research', '2014 U10/Wessex Medical Research']",['Journal Article'],20210706,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC8308111,['NOTNLM'],"['NAV3', 'chemotherapy', 'esophageal adenocarcinoma', 'genomics', 'mutation', 'response']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/07/25 06:01,['2021/07/24 01:00'],"['2021/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 01:00 [entrez]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/25 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13143394 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13143394 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Jul 6;13(14). pii: cancers13143394. doi: 10.3390/cancers13143394.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First-line treatment consists of chemotherapy, which typically includes cytarabine (AraC), either alone or in combination with anthracyclines, but drug resistance can develop and significantly worsen prognosis. Better treatments are needed. We are developing a novel anticancer compound, NEO212, that was created by covalent conjugation of two different molecules with already established anticancer activity, the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) and the natural monoterpene perillyl alcohol (POH). We investigated the anticancer activity of NEO212 in several in vitro and in vivo models of AML. Human HL60 and U937 AML cell lines, as well as different AraC-resistant AML cell lines, were treated with NEO212 and effects on cell proliferation, cell cycle, and cell death were investigated. Mice with implanted AraC-sensitive or AraC-resistant AML cells were dosed with oral NEO212, and animal survival was monitored. Our in vitro experiments show that treatment of cells with NEO212 results in growth inhibition via potent G2 arrest, which is followed by apoptotic cell death. Intriguingly, NEO212 was equally potent in highly AraC-resistant cells. In vivo, NEO212 treatment strikingly extended survival of AML mice and the majority of treated mice continued to thrive and survive without any signs of illness. At the same time, we were unable to detect toxic side effects of NEO212 treatment. All in all, the absence of side effects, combined with striking therapeutic activity even in an AraC-resistant context, suggests that NEO212 should be developed further toward clinical testing.","['Schonthal, Axel H', 'Swenson, Steve', 'Minea, Radu O', 'Kim, Hye Na', 'Cho, Heeyeon', 'Mohseni, Nazleen', 'Kim, Yong-Mi', 'Chen, Thomas C']","['Schonthal AH', 'Swenson S', 'Minea RO', 'Kim HN', 'Cho H', 'Mohseni N', 'Kim YM', 'Chen TC']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology & Immunology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA.', ""Department Pediatrics, Division of Hematology, Oncology, Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA."", 'Department of Neurosurgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology & Immunology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA.', ""Department Pediatrics, Division of Hematology, Oncology, Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA."", 'Department of Neurosurgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0662-5653', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5526-7744', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2183-4667']",['eng'],"['n/a/NeOnc Technologies', 'n/a/Sounder Foundation', 'R01 CA172896/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'n/a/Sharyl and Oscar Garza Fund', 'n/a/Michael Kriegel Foundation', 'n/a/Departmental Funds']",['Journal Article'],20210706,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC8305595,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA alkylation', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cytarabine resistance', 'perillyl alcohol']",2021/07/25 06:00,2021/07/25 06:01,['2021/07/24 01:00'],"['2021/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/01 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 01:00 [entrez]', '2021/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/25 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13143385 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13143385 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Jul 6;13(14). pii: cancers13143385. doi: 10.3390/cancers13143385.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MicroRNA (miRNA) is an endogenous RNA molecule with 22 nucleotides in length. Accumulated evidence suggests that miRNA functions as a key regulator in human cancer. Herein, by in silico analysis, we found that miR-211 was a decreased miRNA in T-LBL in high-throughput sequencing data, which was subsequently verified in our cohort. Low miR-211 was closely correlated with bulky disease, high ann arbor stage, relapse and poor prognosis. miR-211 was regulated by N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modification, specifically, m6A methyltransferase METTL14 methylated primary miR-211 (pri-miR-211), expediting pri-miR-211 processing via recruiting DGCR8. Functionally, miR-211 overexpression significantly reduced T-LBL cell viability, DNA synthesis rate and spheroid formation ability, whereas silencing of miR-211 had the opposite effects. In addition, we established the xenograft tumor model and found that miR-211 remarkably inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Further, TCF12 was the direct target of miR-211, miR-211 bound to TCF12 mRNA 3`-untranslated region (UTR) and increased its decay, overexpression of TCF12 could effectively rescue the weakened malignant behavior of T-LBL cells caused by miR-211 overexpression. Collectively, our data clearly demonstrate that miR-211 is a novel tumor suppressor in T-LBL, targeting of miR-211/TCF12 axis may be a potential treatment for T-LBL patients.","['An, Licai', 'Li, Xijing', 'Yang, Jing']","['An L', 'Li X', 'Yang J']","['Department of Hematology, Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital, Yantai City, Shandong Province, 264001, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Yantaishan Hospital, Yantai City, Shandong Province, 264003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Zaozhuang Municipal Hospital, Zaozhuang City, Shandong Province, 277100, China.

Lessons from MLL-r leukemia.,S0301-472X(21)00248-4 [pii] 10.1016/j.exphem.2021.07.002 [doi],"The clinical success of engineered, CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in relapsed, refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) has generated great enthusiasm for the use of CAR T cells in patients with cytogenetics that portend a poor prognosis with conventional cytotoxic therapies. One such group includes infants and children with mixed lineage leukemia (MLL1, KMT2A) rearrangements (MLL-r), who fare much worse than patients with low- or standard-risk B-ALL. Although early clinical trials using CD19 CAR T cells for MLL-r B-ALL produced complete remission in most patients, relapse with CD19-negative disease was a common mechanism of treatment failure. Whereas CD19(neg) relapse has been observed across a broad spectrum of B-ALL patients treated with CD19-directed therapy, patients with MLL-r have manifested the emergence of AML, often clonally related to the B-ALL, suggesting that the inherent heterogeneity or lineage plasticity of MLL-r B-ALL may predispose patients to a myeloid relapse. Understanding the factors that enable and drive myeloid relapse may be important to devise strategies to improve durability of remissions. In this review, we summarize clinical observations to date with MLL-r B-ALL and generally discuss lineage plasticity as a mechanism of escape from immunotherapy.","['Liao, Wenjuan', 'Kohler, M Eric', 'Fry, Terry', 'Ernst, Patricia']","['Liao W', 'Kohler ME', 'Fry T', 'Ernst P']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology/Oncology/BMT, Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Children's Hospital Colorado, University of Colorado, Denver/Anschutz Medical Campus.

Recent advances in BM imaging and conditional gene knockout mice have revealed that niches are a complex network of cells of mesenchymal, endothelial, neuronal, and hematopoietic origins, together with local physicochemical parameters. Within these complex structures, phagocytes, such as neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells, all of which are of hematopoietic origin, have been found to be important in regulating several niches in the BM, including hematopoietic stem cell niches, erythropoietic niches, and niches involved in endosteal bone formation. There is also increasing evidence that these macrophages have an important role in adapting hematopoiesis, erythropoiesis, and bone formation in response to inflammatory stressors and play a key part in maintaining the integrity and function of these. Likewise, there is also accumulating evidence that subsets of monocytes, macrophages, and other phagocytes contribute to the progression and response to treatment of several lymphoid malignancies such as multiple myeloma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, as well as lymphoblastic leukemia, and may also play a role in myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloproliferative neoplasms associated with Noonan syndrome and aplastic anemia. In this review, the potential functions of macrophages and other phagocytes in normal and pathologic niches are discussed, as are the challenges in studying BM and other tissue-resident macrophages at the molecular level.","['Levesque, Jean-Pierre', 'Summers, Kim M', 'Millard, Susan M', 'Bisht, Kavita', 'Winkler, Ingrid G', 'Pettit, Allison R']","['Levesque JP', 'Summers KM', 'Millard SM', 'Bisht K', 'Winkler IG', 'Pettit AR']","['Mater Research Institute, University of Queensland, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia.

For many retroviruses, Gag-PM interaction is dependent on phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). However, it has been shown that for human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), Gag binding to membranes is less dependent on PI(4,5)P2 than HIV-1, suggesting that other factors may modulate Gag assembly. To elucidate the mechanism by which HTLV-1 Gag binds to the PM, we employed NMR techniques to determine the structure of unmyristoylated MA (myr(-)MA) and to characterize its interactions with lipids and liposomes. The MA structure consists of four alpha-helices and unstructured N- and C-termini. We show that myr(-)MA binds to PI(4,5)P2 via the polar head and that binding to inositol phosphates (IPs) is significantly enhanced by increasing the number of phosphate groups on the inositol ring, indicating that the MA-IP binding is governed by charge-charge interactions. The IP binding site was mapped to a well-defined basic patch formed by lysine and arginine residues. Using an NMR-based liposome binding assay, we show that PI(4,5)P2and phosphatidylserine enhance myr(-)MA binding in a synergistic fashion. Confocal microscopy data revealed formation of puncta on the PM of Gag expressing cells. However, G2A-Gag mutant, lacking myristoylation, is diffuse and cytoplasmic. These results suggest that although myr(-)MA binds to membranes, myristoylation appears to be key for formation of HTLV-1 Gag puncta on the PM. Altogether, these findings advance our understanding of a key mechanism in retroviral assembly.","['Herrmann, Dominik', 'Zhou, Lynne W', 'Hanson, Heather M', 'Willkomm, Nora A', 'Mansky, Louis M', 'Saad, Jamil S']","['Herrmann D', 'Zhou LW', 'Hanson HM', 'Willkomm NA', 'Mansky LM', 'Saad JS']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.

CHIP is associated with a 0.5-1.0% risk per year of leukemia. Remarkably, it confers a two-fold increase in cardiovascular risk independent of traditional risk factors. Roughly 80% of patients with CHIP have mutations in epigenetic regulators DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, DNA damage repair genes PPM1D, TP53, the regulatory tyrosine kinase JAK2, or mRNA spliceosome components SF3B1, and SRSF2. CHIP is associated with a pro-inflammatory state that has been linked to coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and venous thromboembolic disease, as well as prognosis among those with aortic stenosis and heart failure. Heritable and acquired risk factors are associated with increased CHIP prevalence, including germline variation, age, unhealthy lifestyle behaviors (i.e. smoking, obesity), inflammatory conditions, premature menopause, HIV and exposure to cancer therapies. This review aims to summarize emerging research on CHIP, the mechanisms underlying its important role in propagating inflammation and accelerating cardiovascular disease, and new studies detailing the role of associated risk factors and co-morbidities that increase CHIP prevalence.","['Marnell, Christopher S', 'Bick, Alexander', 'Natarajan, Pradeep']","['Marnell CS', 'Bick A', 'Natarajan P']","['Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States of America; Cardiovascular Research Center and Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States of America; Program in Medical and Population Genetics and the Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, United States of America.', 'Division of Genetic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States of America; Cardiovascular Research Center and Center for Genomic Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States of America; Program in Medical and Population Genetics and the Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, United States of America.

The use of bone marrow (BM) smears as a source of DNA and RNA for next-generation sequencing (NGS) enables molecular diagnosis to be done with small amounts of bone marrow and is especially useful for patients without stocked cells, DNA or RNA. The present study aimed to analyze the quality of DNA and RNA derived from smear samples and the utility of NGS for diagnosing myeloid neoplasms. Targeted DNA sequencing using paired BM cells and smears yielded sequencing data of adequate quality for variant calling. The detected variants were analyzed using the bioinformatics approach to detect mutations reliably and increase sensitivity. Noise deriving from variants with extremely low variant allele frequency (VAF) was detected in smear sample data and removed by filtering. Consequently, various driver gene mutations were detected across a wide range of allele frequencies in patients with myeloid neoplasms. Moreover, targeted RNA sequencing successfully detected fusion genes using smear-derived, very low-quality RNA, even in a patient with a normal karyotype. These findings demonstrated that smear samples can be used for clinical molecular diagnosis with adequate noise-reduction methods even if the DNA and RNA quality is inferior.","['Sadato, Daichi', 'Hirama, Chizuko', 'Kaiho-Soma, Ai', 'Yamaguchi, Ayaka', 'Kogure, Hiroko', 'Takakuwa, Sonomi', 'Ogawa, Mina', 'Doki, Noriko', 'Ohashi, Kazuteru', 'Harada, Hironori', 'Oboki, Keisuke', 'Harada, Yuka']","['Sadato D', 'Hirama C', 'Kaiho-Soma A', 'Yamaguchi A', 'Kogure H', 'Takakuwa S', 'Ogawa M', 'Doki N', 'Ohashi K', 'Harada H', 'Oboki K', 'Harada Y']","['Clinical Research Center, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Center for Medical Research Cooperation, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Center for Medical Research Cooperation, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Center for Medical Research Cooperation, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Center for Medical Research Cooperation, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Oncology, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Center for Medical Research Cooperation, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3873-8268'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210723,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Biopsy/methods/standards', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Testing/*methods/standards', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tissue Preservation/*methods/standards']",PMC8301613,,,2021/07/24 06:00,2021/11/09 06:00,['2021/07/23 17:19'],"['2021/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/23 17:19 [entrez]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0255257 [doi]', 'PONE-D-21-08886 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2021 Jul 23;16(7):e0255257. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0255257. eCollection 2021.,e0255257,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MRD was evaluated on marrow samples using multicolor flow cytometry and assessment of WT1 gene expression. Both methods showed a strong prognostic value and their combination allowed the identification of three groups of patients with different risk of relapse. In multivariate analysis, combined MRD was the only predictor of cumulative incidence of relapse, regardless of donor type, conditioning regimen, first or second CR at HSCT, HSCT year, and ELN risk group. Multivariate regression model showed that only negative combined MRD status (P < .001) and myeloablative conditioning (P = .004) were independently associated with better OS. Among MRD-positive patients, a reduced incidence of relapse was observed in patients receiving haplo transplant (P < .05) and in patients who showed grade II-IV aGVHD (P < .03). In patients with negative combined MRD, the intensity of conditioning regimen did not affect the overall favorable outcome. We suggest that pretransplant MRD evaluation combined with transplant-related factors can identify AML patients at higher risk for relapse and might help in defining the overall transplant strategy.","['Guolo, Fabio', 'Di Grazia, Carmen', 'Minetto, Paola', 'Raiola, Anna Maria', 'Clavio, Marino', 'Miglino, Maurizio', 'Tedone, Elisabetta', 'Contini, Paola', 'Mangerini, Rosa', 'Kunkl, Annalisa', 'Colombo, Nicoletta', 'Pugliese, Girolamo', 'Carminati, Enrico', 'Marcolin, Riccardo', 'Passannante, Monica', 'Bagnasco, Samuele', 'Galaverna, Federica', 'Lamparelli, Teresa', 'Ballerini, Filippo', 'Cagnetta, Antonia', 'Cea, Michele', 'Gobbi, Marco', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea', 'Lemoli, Roberto Massimo', 'Angelucci, Emanuele']","['Guolo F', 'Di Grazia C', 'Minetto P', 'Raiola AM', 'Clavio M', 'Miglino M', 'Tedone E', 'Contini P', 'Mangerini R', 'Kunkl A', 'Colombo N', 'Pugliese G', 'Carminati E', 'Marcolin R', 'Passannante M', 'Bagnasco S', 'Galaverna F', 'Lamparelli T', 'Ballerini F', 'Cagnetta A', 'Cea M', 'Gobbi M', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Lemoli RM', 'Angelucci E']","['IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3166-6078', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6094-4351', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8362-5588']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210812,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'minimal residual disease', 'multicolor flow cytometry', 'transplantation']",2021/07/24 06:00,2021/07/24 06:00,['2021/07/23 12:36'],"['2021/07/18 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/23 12:36 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13694 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2021 Nov;107(5):573-582. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13694.

METHODS: A partitioned survival model was developed to compare the cost effectiveness of nilotinib versus dasatinib. The model was developed from the Italian healthcare payer perspective and included the following health states: on second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), off second-line TKI, accelerated phase/blastic crisis, TFR, and death. Progression-free and overall survival curves were derived from patient-level data that compared nilotinib and dasatinib as second-line therapy in CML-CP patients who were resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Drug costs, healthcare costs, and adverse event costs were based on real-world evidence and publicly available databases. Cost effectiveness was estimated over a 40-year time horizon. Scenario analyses were performed by adjusting time horizon, TFR parameters, costs, and utilities. RESULTS: Second-line nilotinib resulted in greater time spent in TFR (0.91 life-years), increased quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (1.89), increased life-years (2.16), and decreased per-patient costs (- 38,760 euro). Therefore, nilotinib was strongly dominant compared with dasatinib in the base-case analysis. Nilotinib remained strongly dominant in most scenario analyses including shorter time horizon, exclusion of TFR, and varying TKI drug costs. CONCLUSIONS: While the model showed that nilotinib treatment of imatinib-intolerant or resistant CML-CP patients was more effective and less costly than dasatinib treatment, there is considerable uncertainty in the findings.","['Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Maheshwari, Vikalp', 'Tran, Diana', 'Agostoni, Gianluca', 'Filioussi, Kalitsa', 'Viana, Ricardo']","['Bonifacio M', 'Maheshwari V', 'Tran D', 'Agostoni G', 'Filioussi K', 'Viana R']","['Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Novartis Healthcare Pvt.

Intensive treatment protocols of those high-risk patients should consider allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in first complete remission (CR). Despite allo-HSCT, relapse rate remains high. Induction chemotherapy with liposomal cytarabine and daunorubicin (CPX-351) has been approved for patients with AML with myeloid-related changes (AML-MRC) or t-AML based on improved survival and remission rates compared to standard 7 + 3 induction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 110 patients with newly diagnosed s-AML or t-AML at a university hospital were analyzed retrospectively. Median age was 62 years (24-77 years). A total of 65 patients with s-AML after MDS (59%) and 23 patients (20.9%) with t-AML were included. Induction chemotherapy consisted of intermediate-dosed cytarabine (ID-AraC) in combination with idarubicin (patients up to 60 years) or mitoxantrone (patients over 60 years). In patients subsequently undergoing allo-HSCT, reduced conditioning regimens (RIC) were applied prior to transplantation in 47 of 62 patients (76%). RESULTS: Induction chemotherapy with ID-AraC resulted in an overall response rate of 83% including complete remission (CR/CRi) in 69 patients (63%) with a low rate of early death (2.7%). Most relevant non-hematologic toxicity consisted of infectious complications including sepsis with need of intensive care treatment in five patients (4.5%) and proven or probable invasive fungal disease in eight patients (7.2%). Relapse-free survival (RFS), event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of the whole cohort were 19 months (0-167), 10 months (0-234) and 15 months (0-234), respectively (p < 0.0001). A significant improvement of OS was observed in patients who underwent allo-HSCT compared to those without subsequent allo-HSCT: 9 vs. 46 months, p < 0.0001. Rate of transplantation-related mortality (TRM) in the early phase post allo-HSCT was low (0.9% at day 30 and 1.8% at day 90, respectively). RIC conditioning results in OS rate of 60% after 60 months post allo-HSCT (median OS not reached). CONCLUSION: S-AML and t-AML patients receiving induction chemotherapy with intermediate-dosed cytarabine showed satisfactory response rate and consolidation therapy with allo-HSCT after full or reduced-intensity conditioning further improved survival in these patients with similar outcome as reported for CPX-351.","['Fleischmann, Maximilian', 'Schnetzke, Ulf', 'Frietsch, Jochen J', 'Sayer, Herbert G', 'Schrenk, Karin', 'Hammersen, Jakob', 'Glaser, Anita', 'Hilgendorf, Inken', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Scholl, Sebastian']","['Fleischmann M', 'Schnetzke U', 'Frietsch JJ', 'Sayer HG', 'Schrenk K', 'Hammersen J', 'Glaser A', 'Hilgendorf I', 'Hochhaus A', 'Scholl S']","['Klinik Fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung Hamatologie Und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747, Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik Fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung Hamatologie Und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747, Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik Fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung Hamatologie Und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747, Jena, Germany.', '4.

This chemokine receptor is overexpressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and orchestrates the homing of CLL cells into the lymph node. Previous studies, on a very limited number of samples, hypothesized that the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) ibrutinib might induce loss of surface CCR7 levels in CLL cells. CAP-100 will be evaluated in clinical trials as a therapy for relapse/refractory CLL patients, who have received at least two systemic therapies (NCT04704323). As nowadays many relapse/refractory CLL patients will have received ibrutinib as a prior therapy, we aimed to investigate in a large cohort of CLL patients the impact of this BTKi on CCR7 expression and functionality as well as on the therapeutic activity of CAP-100. Our data confirm that ibrutinib moderately down-regulates the very high expression of CCR7 in CLL cells but has no apparent effect on CCR7-induced chemotaxis. Moreover, CLL cells are perfectly targetable by CAP-100 which led to a complete inhibition of CCR7-mediated migration and induced strong target cell killing through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, irrespective of previous or contemporary ibrutinib administration. Together, these results validate the therapeutic utility of CAP-100 as a next-line single-agent therapy for CLL patients who failed to ibrutinib and confirm that CAP-100 and ibrutinib have complementary non-overlapping mechanisms of action, potentially allowing for combination therapy.","['Mateu-Albero, Tamara', 'Juarez-Sanchez, Raquel', 'Loscertales, Javier', 'Mol, Wim', 'Terron, Fernando', 'Munoz-Calleja, Cecilia', 'Cuesta-Mateos, Carlos']","['Mateu-Albero T', 'Juarez-Sanchez R', 'Loscertales J', 'Mol W', 'Terron F', 'Munoz-Calleja C', 'Cuesta-Mateos C']","['Immunology Department, Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, IIS-IP, Diego de Leon 62, 28006, Madrid, Spain.', 'Immunology Department, Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, IIS-IP, Diego de Leon 62, 28006, Madrid, Spain.', 'IMMED S.L., Immunological and Medicinal Products, C/ Velazquez 57, 6 masculine derecha, 28001, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, IIS-IP, Diego de Leon 62, 28006, Madrid, Spain.', 'Catapult Therapeutics, Lelystad, The Netherlands.', 'IMMED S.L., Immunological and Medicinal Products, C/ Velazquez 57, 6 masculine derecha, 28001, Madrid, Spain.', 'Catapult Therapeutics, Lelystad, The Netherlands.', 'Immunology Department, Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, IIS-IP, Diego de Leon 62, 28006, Madrid, Spain.', 'Medicine Faculty, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', 'Immunology Department, Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, IIS-IP, Diego de Leon 62, 28006, Madrid, Spain. carlos.cuesta@salud.madrid.org.', 'IMMED S.L., Immunological and Medicinal Products, C/ Velazquez 57, 6 masculine derecha, 28001, Madrid, Spain. carlos.cuesta@salud.madrid.org.', 'Catapult Therapeutics, Lelystad, The Netherlands. carlos.cuesta@salud.madrid.org.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1576-9790'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210723,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAP-100', '*CCR7', '*CLL', '*Ibrutinib', '*Immunotherapy', '*Lymph node']",2021/07/24 06:00,2021/07/24 06:00,['2021/07/23 12:25'],"['2021/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/23 12:25 [entrez]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00262-021-03014-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00262-021-03014-2 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2021 Jul 23. pii: 10.1007/s00262-021-03014-2. doi: 10.1007/s00262-021-03014-2.,,"['(c) 2021.

CLL-RT patients have a grave prognosis, and their outcomes after HSCT are uncertain. We conducted a retrospective analysis of all 58 CLL patients, including 23 CLL-RT patients, who underwent reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) HSCT at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY) between September 2006 and April 2017. With a median follow-up of 68 months (range, 24-147 months), 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 40% (95% confidence interval [CI], 28%-56%), and overall survival (OS) was 58% (95% CI, 48%-74%). The 1-year graft-versus-host disease/relapse-free survival (GRFS) was 38% (95% CI, 25%-50%). Patients with CLL-RT and CLL patients without RT had comparable outcomes. In both cohorts, treatment-sensitive response and </=3 previous lines of therapy produced superior PFS and OS. Outcomes were agnostic to adverse cytogenetic and molecular features. Novel agents did not have a negative impact on HSCT outcomes. Total body irradiation (TBI)-containing RIC yielded inferior PFS, OS, and GRFS. CLL-RT patients older than age 55 years who had an HSCT Comorbidity Index score of >/=2 demonstrated inferior OS. This study, which is the largest series of RIC-HSCT for patients with CLL-RT, provides evidence supporting RIC-HSCT in early remission courses for patients with CLL-RT and poor-risk CLL patients.

Seventeen patients received HSCT; 14 (82%) were leukemia-free at a median follow-up of 23.8 months (range, 7.0-39.3 months) after HSCT. Azacitidine was well tolerated and plasma concentration--time profiles were similar to observed profiles in adults. In conclusion, azacitidine monotherapy is a suitable option for children with newly diagnosed JMML. Although long-term safety and efficacy remain to be fully elucidated in this population, these data demonstrate that azacitidine provides valuable clinical benefit to JMML patients prior to HSCT. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02447666.","['Niemeyer, Charlotte M', 'Flotho, Christian', 'Lipka, Daniel B', 'Stary, Jan', 'Rossig, Claudia', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Micalizzi, Concetta', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Nysom, Karsten', 'Rives, Susana', 'Schmugge Liner, Markus', 'Zecca, Marco', 'Schonung, Maximilian', 'Baumann, Irith', 'Nollke, Peter', 'Benettaib, Bouchra', 'Biserna, Noha', 'Poon, Jennifer', 'Simcock, Mathew', 'Patturajan, Meera', 'Menezes, Daniel', 'Gaudy, Allison', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'Locatelli, Franco']","['Niemeyer CM', 'Flotho C', 'Lipka DB', 'Stary J', 'Rossig C', 'Baruchel A', 'Klingebiel T', 'Micalizzi C', 'Michel G', 'Nysom K', 'Rives S', 'Schmugge Liner M', 'Zecca M', 'Schonung M', 'Baumann I', 'Nollke P', 'Benettaib B', 'Biserna N', 'Poon J', 'Simcock M', 'Patturajan M', 'Menezes D', 'Gaudy A', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Locatelli F']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Translational Cancer Epigenomics Section, Division of Translational Medical Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Paediatric Hematology and Oncology, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Munster University Children's Hospital, Munster, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Immunology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Paris-Hopital Universitaire Robert-Debre (Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris [AP-HP]), Paris, France.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universitatsklinikum Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Site Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Sciences, Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Genoa, Italy.', 'Pediatrics and Pediatric Oncology, Hopital de la Timone, Marseilles, France.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Institut de Recerca, Hospital Sant Joan de Deu de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Division of Haematology, Kinderspital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Translational Cancer Epigenomics Section, Division of Translational Medical Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biosciences, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Boblingen Hospital, Sindelfingen, Germany.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Formerly Bristol Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ.', 'Formerly Bristol Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ.', 'Bristol Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ.', 'Celgene Corporation, a Bristol Myers Squibb company, Uxbridge, United Kingdom.', 'Bristol Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ.', 'Bristol Myers Squibb, San Francisco, CA.', 'Bristol Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ.', 'Hematology-Oncology, Prinses Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, IRCCS Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome, Italy;

Binding of these drugs to the DNA minor groove in a sequence-specific fashion eventually causes double-stranded cleavage that results in cell death. Use of calicheamicin epsilon, an unreactive analogue of calicheamicin gamma1I, has demonstrated that these structurally sophisticated molecules inflict bending on certain DNA oligonucleotides of defined sequence to the extent that they increase their circularization ratio upon ligation into multimers. By modelling and simulating several linear and circular DNA constructs containing high-affinity 5'-TCCT-3' and low-affinity 5'-TTGT-3' target sites in the presence and absence of calicheamicin epsilon, we have shed light into the structural distortions introduced by the drug upon binding to DNA. This new insight not only informs about the direction and magnitude of the DNA curvature but also provides a rationale for an improved understanding of the preferred structural and dynamic features associated with DNA target selection by calicheamicins.","['Mills, Alberto', 'Gago, Federico']","['Mills A', 'Gago F']","['Departamento de Ciencias Biomedicas y ""Unidad Asociada IQM-CSIC"", Universidad de Alcala, E-28805 Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain. federico.gago@uah.es.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Biomedicas y ""Unidad Asociada IQM-CSIC"", Universidad de Alcala, E-28805 Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain. federico.gago@uah.es.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4819-1638', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3071-4878']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Org Biomol Chem,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,101154995,,IM,,,,,2021/07/24 06:00,2021/07/24 06:00,['2021/07/23 12:20'],"['2021/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/23 12:20 [entrez]']",['10.1039/d1ob01077h [doi]'],ppublish,Org Biomol Chem. 2021 Aug 5;19(30):6707-6717. doi: 10.1039/d1ob01077h.,6707-6717,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) was performed before autopsy. As the baby had a severe subdural hematoma, retinal hemorrhage, and encephalopathy on PMCT, abusive head trauma (AHT) was tentatively diagnosed. At autopsy, no scalp hemorrhages or skull fractures were found; however, the classic triad of AHT was present, mainly on the right side. Additionally, there was dark red discoloration around the heart, and the liver, spleen, and pancreas were enlarged. Peripheral blood was macroscopically cloudy with marked leukocytosis. After careful histological examination, B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was diagnosed. All the macroscopic lesions could be attributed to ALL. The manner of death was natural. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of infantile ALL mimicking AHT on PMCT images. This case demonstrates the importance of a comprehensive systematic approach to considering differential diagnosis when PMCT shows multiple intracranial hemorrhages suggestive of AHT in an infant.","['Unuma, Kana', 'Makino, Yohsuke', 'Yamamoto, Kouhei', 'Hattori, Shinya', 'Arai, Nobutaka', 'Sakai, Kentaro', 'Kitagawa, Masanobu', 'Uemura, Koichi', 'Kanegane, Hirokazu']","['Unuma K', 'Makino Y', 'Yamamoto K', 'Hattori S', 'Arai N', 'Sakai K', 'Kitagawa M', 'Uemura K', 'Kanegane H']","['Department of Forensic Medicine, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Forensic Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Radiology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Neuropathology, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Tokyo Medical Examiner's Office, Tokyo Metropolitan Government, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Forensic Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Forensic Medicine, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Child Health and Development, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1241-5217'],['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210723,United States,J Forensic Sci,Journal of forensic sciences,0375370,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Child Abuse/diagnosis', 'Craniocerebral Trauma/diagnosis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Hematoma, Subdural/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages/*pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Retinal Hemorrhage/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,['NOTNLM'],"['abusive head trauma', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute subdural hematoma', 'forensic radiology', 'postmortem computed tomography', 'shaken baby syndrome']",2021/07/24 06:00,2021/11/19 06:00,['2021/07/23 08:52'],"['2021/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/19 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/23 08:52 [entrez]']",['10.1111/1556-4029.14815 [doi]'],ppublish,J Forensic Sci. 2021 Nov;66(6):2504-2510. doi: 10.1111/1556-4029.14815.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the efficacy and safety of induction with idarubicin (IDA) or liposoma daunorubicin (L-DNR) in treatment of adults with high-risk ALL (HR-ALL) (presence of mixed lineage leukemia gene [MLL] rearrangements, t[1;19], or prednisone poor response). METHODS: Among 58 enrolled patients, 29 cases were defined as the IDA group and the other 29 patients were put into the L-DNR group. Both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated and overall response rate (ORR) was compared between the groups. RESULTS: The L-DNR group's OS and PFS were insignificantly higher than in the IDA group (P=0.261 and P=0.247). Although not significantly different, the ORR of adults with HR-ALL receiving L-DNR regimens was also higher than in the IDA group (P=0.085). Comprehensive cytogenetic analysis revealed that patients harboring MLL rearrangement, E2A-PBX1, and P53 mutation had poorer prognosis than others. All 58 patients experienced hematologic response in this study; however, the length of hematologic response in the IDA group was significantly longer than in the L-DNR group (P=0.005). The incidence of bleeding and infection was without significant difference between the groups (both P>0.05). CONCLUSION: L-DNR proved to be an effective drug within a multiagent approach, which shows a favorable overall profile, as well as similar adverse events when compared with IDA in HR-ALL. Patients with E2A-PBX1 are much more sensitive to L-DNR than IDA. Despite some progress made, outcomes in MLL rearrangement or P53 mutation carriers remain unsatisfactory, and intensive treatment will be critical.","['Zhang, Qi', 'Zhang, Chun-Hong', 'Wang, Zhen-Dong', 'Wang, Dong']","['Zhang Q', 'Zhang CH', 'Wang ZD', 'Wang D']","['Publicity Section, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Mudanjiang University, Mudanjiang, China.', 'Department of Urology Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Mudanjiang University, Mudanjiang, China.', 'Department of ENT surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Mudanjiang University, Mudanjiang, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Mudanjiang University, Mudanjiang, China.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7461-8661'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210723,United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'adult', 'daunorubicin', 'idarubicin']",2021/07/24 06:00,2021/07/24 06:00,['2021/07/23 08:39'],"['2021/07/23 08:39 [entrez]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/03008916211032724 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Tumori. 2021 Jul 23:3008916211032724. doi: 10.1177/03008916211032724.,3008916211032724,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, in approximately 60% of OS, telomere length is maintained by alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway. Whether the ALT pathway can be exploited for OS therapeutic treatment and how the OS inflammatory microenvironment influences the anti-cancer drug effect remains unknown. Here, we examined the biological effects of TMPyP4 and cisplatin in the inflammatory microenvironment of OS cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunofluorescence in situ hybridization (IF-FISH) and C-circle experiments were used to detect the G-quadruplex and ALT activity. The redox potential of single guanine, G-quadruplex and G-quadruplex/TMPyP4 was evaluated by the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy (LUMO), zeta potential and cyclic voltammetry. Cell viability, flow cytometry and apoptosis, Western blot, comet assay, adhesion, transwell and scratch experiments were performed to compare the anti-tumour proliferation and migration effects of TMPyP4 and cisplatin in the inflammatory microenvironment. RESULTS: This study indicated that compared with cisplatin, TMPyP4 could induce the formation of human telomeres and FAK G-quadruplex in vitro and in vivo, and TMPyP4-treated OS cells showed fewer extrachromosomal C-circles and fewer ALT-associated promyelocytic leukaemia bodies. Consequently, the ALT activity and FAK-related cell migration were suppressed by TMPyP4. Mechanistically, the formation of G-quadruplex resulted in both lower redox potential than G within the genome and FAK transcription inhibition, and TMPyP4 could enhance this phenomenon, especially in the inflammatory microenvironment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal that TMPyP4 is more suitable for OS treatment than cisplatin.","['Chen, Jianqiang', 'Jin, Xiangxiang', 'Mei, Yanan', 'Shen, Zhe', 'Zhu, Jufan', 'Shi, Hongyi', 'Wang, Minshan', 'Zheng, Xiaohui', 'Liang, Guang']","['Chen J', 'Jin X', 'Mei Y', 'Shen Z', 'Zhu J', 'Shi H', 'Wang M', 'Zheng X', 'Liang G']","['Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'The Affiliated Xiangshan Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Ningbo, China.', 'Hospital of Chinese Medicine of Haishu District, Ningbo, China.', 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8278-849X'],['eng'],"['2018ZY009/Wenzhou Science and Technology Key Project', '2019KY646/Research Grant from Health Commission of Zhejiang Province', 'Y20180177/Wenzhou Basic Medical and Health Technology Project', '2018C03068/Zhejiang Provincial Key Scientific Project', '2021C03041/Zhejiang Provincial Key Scientific Project', '21701194/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81930108/National Natural Science Foundation of China']",['Journal Article'],20210723,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '38673-65-3 (tetra(4-N-methylpyridyl)porphine)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'G-Quadruplexes/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Osteosarcoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Porphyrins/*pharmacology', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Telomere/drug effects', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*drug effects']",PMC8450119,['NOTNLM'],"['G-quadruplex', 'TMPyP4', 'cisplatin', 'inflammatory microenvironment', 'osteosarcoma']",2021/07/24 06:00,2021/09/29 06:00,['2021/07/23 07:12'],"['2021/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/23 07:12 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cpr.13101 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2021 Sep;54(9):e13101. doi: 10.1111/cpr.13101.

We studied 153 patients with MDS and del(20q) to assess the incidence, prognostic value and impact on response to azacitidine (AZA) of ASXL1 chromosomal alterations and genetic mutations. Additionally, in vitro assay of the response to AZA in HAP1 (HAP1(WT) ) and HAP1 ASXL1 knockout (HAP1(KN) ) cells was performed. ASXL1 chromosomal alterations were detected in 44 patients (28.5%): 34 patients (22%) with a gene deletion (ASXL1(DEL) ) and 10 patients (6.5%) with additional gene copies. ASXL1(DEL) was associated with a lower platelet count. The most frequently mutated genes were U2AF1 (16%), ASXL1 (14%), SF3B1 (11%), TP53 (7%) and SRSF2 (6%). ASXL1 alteration due to chromosomal deletion or genetic mutation (ASXL1(DEL) /ASXL1(MUT) ) was linked by multivariable analysis with shorter overall survival [hazard ratio, (HR) 1.84; 95% confidence interval, (CI): 1.11-3.04; P = 0.018] and a higher rate for acute myeloid leukaemia progression (HR 2.47; 95% CI: 1.07-5.70, P = 0.034). ASXL1(DEL) /ASXL1(MUT) patients were correlated by univariable analysis with a worse response to AZA. HAP1(KN) cells showed more resistance to AZA compared to HAP1(WT) cells. In conclusion, ASXL1 alteration exerts a negative impact on MDS with del(20q) and could become useful for prognostic risk stratification and treatment decisions.","['Martin, Ivan', 'Villamon, Eva',

By casting dose finding as a Bayesian model selection problem, we propose an adaptive design by simultaneously incorporating the toxicity and efficacy outcomes to select the optimal biological dose (OBD) in phase I/II clinical trials. Without imposing any parametric assumption or shape constraint on the underlying dose-response curves, we specify curve-free models for both the toxicity and efficacy endpoints to determine the OBD. By integrating the observed data across all dose levels, the proposed design is coherent in dose assignment and thus greatly enhances efficiency and accuracy in pinning down the right dose. Not only does our design possess a completely new yet flexible dose-finding framework, but it also has satisfactory and robust performance as demonstrated by extensive simulation studies. In addition, we show that our design enjoys desirable coherence properties, while most of existing phase I/II designs do not. We further extend the design to accommodate late-onset outcomes which are common in immunotherapy. The proposed design is exemplified with a phase I/II clinical trial in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Lin, Ruitao', 'Yin, Guosheng', 'Shi, Haolun']","['Lin R', 'Yin G', 'Shi H']","['Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science, Simon Fraser University, 8888 University Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2244-131X'],['eng'],"['CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '17308420/Research Grants Council of Hong Kong']",['Journal Article'],20210723,England,Biostatistics,"Biostatistics (Oxford, England)",100897327,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bayesian adaptive design', 'Bayesian model selection', 'Delayed response', 'Optimal biological dose', 'Phase I/II trial']",2021/07/24 06:00,2021/07/24 06:00,['2021/07/23 06:58'],"['2020/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/26 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/23 06:58 [entrez]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['6326402 [pii]', '10.1093/biostatistics/kxab028 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Biostatistics. 2021 Jul 23. pii: 6326402. doi: 10.1093/biostatistics/kxab028.,,"['(c) Published by Oxford University Press Biostatistics 2021.

Moreover, it has been proposed that polymorphisms in benzene metabolizing genes influence the outcomes of benzene exposure in the human body. This systematic review aims to elucidate the existent relationship between genetic polymorphisms and the risk of developing adverse health effects in benzene-exposed workers. Methods: Three databases were systematically searched until April 2020. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses method was used to select articles published between 2005 and 2020. Quality assessment and risk of bias were evaluated by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Results: After full-text evaluation, 36 articles remained out of 645 initially screened. The most studied health effects within the reviewed papers were chronic benzene poisoning, hematotoxicity, altered urinary biomarkers of exposure, micronucleus/chromosomal aberrations, and gene methylation. Furthermore, some polymorphisms on NQO1, GSTT1, GSTM1, MPO, and CYP2E1, among other genes, showed a statistically significant relationship with an increased risk of developing at least one of these effects on benzene-exposed workers. However, there was no consensus among the reviewed papers on which specific polymorphisms were the ones associated with the adverse health-related outcomes, except for the NQO1 rs1800566 and the GSTT1 null genotypes. Additionally, the smoking habit was identified as a confounder, demonstrating worse health outcomes in exposed workers that smoked. Conclusion: Though there is a positive relationship between genetic polymorphisms and detrimental health outcomes for benzene-exposed workers, broader benzene-exposed cohorts that take into account the genetic diversity of the population are needed in order to determine which specific polymorphisms incur in health risks.","['Ramirez-Lopera, Veronica', 'Uribe-Castro, Daniel', 'Bautista-Amorocho, Henry', 'Silva-Sayago, Jorge Alexander', 'Mateus-Sanchez, Enrique', 'Ardila-Barbosa, Wilman Yesid', 'Perez-Cala, Tania Liseth']","['Ramirez-Lopera V', 'Uribe-Castro D', 'Bautista-Amorocho H', 'Silva-Sayago JA', 'Mateus-Sanchez E', 'Ardila-Barbosa WY', 'Perez-Cala TL']","['Bacterias & Cancer Group, Microbiology and Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine Universidad de Antioquia Medellin Colombia.', 'Bacterias & Cancer Group, Microbiology and Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine Universidad de Antioquia Medellin Colombia.', 'Bacterias & Cancer Group, Microbiology and Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine Universidad de Antioquia Medellin Colombia.', 'Grupo de Investigacion en Desarrollo Humano, Tejido Social e Innovaciones Tecnologicas-GIDTI, Programa Administracion en Salud Ocupacional Centro Regional Bucaramanga, Corporacion Universitaria Minuto de Dios Bucaramanga Colombia.', 'Grupo de Investigacion en Desarrollo Humano, Tejido Social e Innovaciones Tecnologicas-GIDTI, Programa Administracion en Salud Ocupacional Centro Regional Bucaramanga, Corporacion Universitaria Minuto de Dios Bucaramanga Colombia.', 'Grupo de Investigacion en Desarrollo Humano, Tejido Social e Innovaciones Tecnologicas-GIDTI, Programa de Psicologia Centro Regional Bucaramanga, Corporacion Universitaria Minuto de Dios Bucaramanga Colombia.', 'Grupo de Investigacion en Desarrollo Humano, Tejido Social e Innovaciones Tecnologicas-GIDTI, Programa Administracion en Salud Ocupacional Centro Regional Bucaramanga, Corporacion Universitaria Minuto de Dios Bucaramanga Colombia.', 'Bacterias & Cancer Group, Microbiology and Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine Universidad de Antioquia Medellin Colombia.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3609-8025', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9222-5703', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8147-6374', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5095-3289']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210716,United States,Health Sci Rep,Health science reports,101728855,,,,PMC8284097,['NOTNLM'],"['benzene', 'chronic benzene poisoning', 'genetic polymorphisms', 'hematotoxicity', 'occupational health']",2021/07/24 06:00,2021/07/24 06:01,['2021/07/23 06:53'],"['2021/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/23 06:53 [entrez]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1002/hsr2.327 [doi]', 'HSR2327 [pii]']",epublish,Health Sci Rep. 2021 Jul 16;4(3):e327. doi: 10.1002/hsr2.327. eCollection 2021 Sep.,e327,['(c) 2021 The Authors.

AML relapse is partially driven by the chemoresistant nature of leukemia stem cells (LSCs), which remains poorly understood, and our study aimed at elucidating the underlying mechanism. Accumulating evidences show that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in AML development. Herein, the lncRNA, LINC00152, was identified to be highly expressed in CD34(+) LSCs and found to regulate the self-renewal of LSCs derived from AML patients. Importantly, LINC00152 upregulation was correlated with the expression of 16 genes within a 17-gene LSC biomarker panel, which contributed to the accurate prediction of initial therapy resistance in AML. Knockdown of LINC00152 markedly increased the drug sensitivity of leukemia cells. Furthermore, LINC00152 expression was found to be correlated with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) expression in AML, whereas LINC00152 knockdown significantly decreased the expression of PARP1. Upregulation of LINC00152 or PARP1 was associated with poor prognosis in AML patients. Collectively, these data highlight the importance and contribution of LINC00152 in the regulation of self-renewal and chemoresistance of LSCs in AML.","['Cui, Chunhong', 'Wang, Yan', 'Gong, Wenjie', 'He, Haiju', 'Zhang, Hao', 'Shi, Wei', 'Wang, Hui']","['Cui C', 'Wang Y', 'Gong W', 'He H', 'Zhang H', 'Shi W', 'Wang H']","['Shanghai University of Medicine and Health Sciences Affiliated Zhoupu Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai University of Medicine and Health Sciences Affiliated Zhoupu Hospital, Shanghai, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210706,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC8290167,['NOTNLM'],"['LINC00152', 'chemo-resistance', 'leukemia', 'leukemia stem cells', 'poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1']",2021/07/24 06:00,2021/07/24 06:01,['2021/07/23 06:51'],"['2021/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/23 06:51 [entrez]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.694021 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Jul 6;11:694021. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.694021. eCollection 2021.,694021,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Cui, Wang, Gong, He, Zhang, Shi and Wang.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (HNRNPH1), as a key member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins family, is frequently upregulated in multiple cancer cells and involved in tumorigenesis. However, the function of HNRNPH1 in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) remains unclear. In the present study, we revealed that HNRNPH1 expression level was upregulated in CML patients and cell lines. Moreover, the higher level of HNRNPH1 was correlated with disease progression of CML. In vivo and in vitro experiments showed that knockdown of HNRNPH1 inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis in CML cells. Importantly, knockdown of HNRNPH1 in CML cells enhanced sensitivity to imatinib. Mechanically, HNRNPH1 could bind to the mRNA of PTPN6 and negatively regulated its expression. PTPN6 mediated the regulation between HNRNPH1 and PI3K/AKT activation. Furthermore, the HNRNPH1-PTPN6-PI3K/AKT axis played a critical role in CML tumorigenesis and development. The present study first investigated the deregulated HNRNPH1-PTPN6-PI3K/AKT axis moderated cell growth and apoptosis in CML cells, whereby targeting this pathway may be a therapeutic CML treatment.","['Liu, Menghan', 'Yang, Lin', 'Liu, Xiaojun', 'Nie, Ziyuan', 'Zhang, Xiaoyan', 'Lu, Yaqiong', 'Pan, Yuxia', 'Wang, Xingzhe', 'Luo, Jianmin']","['Liu M', 'Yang L', 'Liu X', 'Nie Z', 'Zhang X', 'Lu Y', 'Pan Y', 'Wang X', 'Luo J']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210706,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC8290130,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'HNRNPH1', 'PI3K/AKT', 'PTPN6', 'apoptosis', 'proliferation']",2021/07/24 06:00,2021/07/24 06:01,['2021/07/23 06:51'],"['2021/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/23 06:51 [entrez]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.682859 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Jul 6;11:682859. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.682859. eCollection 2021.,682859,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Liu, Yang, Liu, Nie, Zhang, Lu, Pan, Wang and Luo.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this review was to outline the details of the management of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Patients with CLL often exhibit inadequate humoral and cellular immune responses to various infections and vaccinations. Patients under the 'watch and wait' strategy have a lower risk of infections, including with SARS-CoV-2, compared with those undergoing therapeutic interventions, but they still have a higher risk than age-matched controls. Patients with CLL have a high risk of developing severe forms of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), particularly if they are undergoing chemo-immunotherapy. The total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer demonstrates a slower increase in patients with CLL infected with the virus, and the antibody levels tend to decrease after reaching a maximum level sooner than in healthy individuals. This leads to a late negativation of the PCR tests and a longer duration of hospitalization. In total, ~1/3 of patients with CLL do not develop a persistent titer of antiviral antibodies, and this is associated with the presence of hypogammaglobulinemia. It appears that patients with CLL have the worst outcomes amongst patients with malignant hemopathies and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors reduce the hyperinflammatory status of patients with CLL with COVID-19, which is accompanied by decreased levels of serum inflammatory markers, ferritin and D-dimer, and serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but they increase the risk of infections and impaired humoral immunity. An abrupt discontinuation of these may promote the rapid decompensation of CLL, which may even mimic the clinical manifestations of COVID-I9, including a significant increase in cytokine release. In conclusion, therapeutic decisions must be personalized to each patient with CLL and each at risk patient must be quarantined during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to reduce their risk of contraction.","['Mihaila, Romeo Gabriel']",['Mihaila RG'],"['Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu, 550169 Sibiu, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Emergency County Clinical Hospital, 550245 Sibiu, Romania.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210703,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,,PMC8273855,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'coronavirus disease-2019', 'ibrutinib', 'monoclonal antibodies', 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2', 'venetoclax']",2021/07/24 06:00,2021/07/24 06:01,['2021/07/23 06:47'],"['2021/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/23 06:47 [entrez]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2021.12897 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-12897 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2021 Aug;22(2):636. doi: 10.3892/ol.2021.12897.

This study aimed to explore potential signatures and their functions for ALL. Methods: Differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) and differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (DElncRNAs) were identified for ALL from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and normal control from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx). DElncRNA-microRNA (miRNA) and miRNA-DEmRNA pairs were predicted using online databases. Then, a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was constructed. Functional enrichment analysis of DEmRNAs in the ceRNA network was performed. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was then constructed. Hub genes were identified. DElncRNAs in the ceRNA network were validated using Real-time qPCR. Results: A total of 2,903 up- and 3,228 downregulated mRNAs and 469 up- and 286 downregulated lncRNAs were identified for ALL. A ceRNA network was constructed for ALL, consisting of 845 lncRNA-miRNA and 395 miRNA-mRNA pairs. These DEmRNAs in the ceRNA network were mainly enriched in ALL-related biological processes and pathways. Ten hub genes were identified, including SMAD3, SMAD7, SMAD5, ZFYVE9, FKBP1A, FZD6, FZD7, LRP6, WNT1, and SFRP1. According to Real-time qPCR, eight lncRNAs including ATP11A-AS1, ITPK1-AS1, ANO1-AS2, CRNDE, MALAT1, CACNA1C-IT3, PWRN1, and WT1-AS were significantly upregulated in ALL bone marrow samples compared to normal samples. Conclusion: Our results showed the lncRNA expression profiles and constructed ceRNA network in ALL.

We used SNP-array data from the DISCOVeRY-BMT study to detect chromosomal aberrations in pre-HCT peripheral blood (collected 2-4 weeks before the administration of conditioning regimen) from 1974 AML patients who received HCT between 2000 and 2011. All aberrations detected in >/= 10 patients were tested for their association with overall survival (OS), separately by remission status, using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Cox regression models were used for multivariable analyses. Follow-up was through January 2019. We identified 701 unique chromosomal aberrations in 285 patients (7% of 1438 in complete remission (CR) and 36% of 536 not in CR). Copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (CNLOH) in chr17p in CR patients (3-year OS = 20% vs. 50%, with and without chr17p CNLOH, p = 0.0002), and chr13q in patients not in CR (3-year OS = 4% vs. 26%, with and without chr13q CNLOH, p < 0.0001) are risk factors for poor survival. Models adjusted for clinical factors showed approximately three-fold excess risk of post-HCT mortality with chr17p CNLOH in CR patients (hazard ratio, HR = 3.39, 95% confidence interval CI 1.74-6.60, p = 0.0003), or chr13q CNLOH in patients not in CR (HR = 2.68, 95% CI 1.75-4.09, p < 0.0001). The observed mortality was mostly driven by post-HCT relapse (HR = 2.47, 95% CI 1.01-6.02, p = 0.047 for chr17p CNLOH in CR patients, and HR = 2.58, 95% CI 1.63-4.08, p < 0.0001 for chr13q CNLOH in patients not in CR. Pre-transplant CNLOH in chr13q or chr17p predicts risk of poor outcomes after unrelated donor HCT in AML patients. A large prospective study is warranted to validate the results and evaluate novel strategies to improve survival in those patients.","['Wang, Youjin', 'Zhou, Weiyin', 'McReynolds, Lisa J', 'Katki,

This study included 31 pediatric B-ALL patients and 27 healthy controls. All patients were treated according to the protocols of the modified St. Jude Children's Research Hospital total therapy study XIIIB for ALL. Levels of MDSCs and Tregs were analyzed using flow cytometry. We observed a reduction in the levels of CD4 + T-cells and an increase in both the polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) and Tregs. The frequencies of PMN-MDSCs and Tregs were directly related to the levels of peripheral and bone marrow blast cells and CD34 + cells. Complete postinduction remission was associated with reduced percentages of PMN-MDSCs and Tregs, with the level of PMN-MDCs in this subpopulation approaching that of healthy controls. PMN-MDSCs and Tregs jointly play a critical role in maintaining an immune-suppressive state suitable for B-ALL tumor progression. Thereby, they could be independent predictors of B-ALL progress, and finely targeting both PMN-MDSCs and Tregs may be a promising approach for the treatment of B-ALL.","['Zahran, Asmaa M', 'Shibl, Azza', 'Rayan, Amal', 'Mohamed, Mohamed Alaa Eldeen Hassan', 'Osman, Amira M M', 'Saad, Khaled', 'Mahmoud, Khaled Hashim', 'Ghandour, Aliaa M A', 'Elsayh, Khalid I', 'El-Badawy, Omnia']","['Zahran AM', 'Shibl A', 'Rayan A', 'Mohamed MAEH', 'Osman AMM', 'Saad K', 'Mahmoud KH', 'Ghandour AMA', 'Elsayh KI', 'El-Badawy O']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Oncology Department, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Clinical Oncology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, 71516, Egypt.', 'Clinical Oncology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, 71516, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Oncology Department, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt. khaled.ali@med.au.edu.eg.', 'Pediatric Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Medical Microbiology and Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Medical Microbiology and Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8473-6116'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210722,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Biomarkers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC8298505,,,2021/07/24 06:00,2021/11/06 06:00,['2021/07/23 06:24'],"['2021/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/23 06:24 [entrez]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-021-94469-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-021-94469-x [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2021 Jul 22;11(1):15039. doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-94469-x.,15039,['(c) 2021.

Compared to Th17 cells and ILC3s, gammadeltaT17 cell metabolism and its role in tissue homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here, we report that the tissue milieu shapes splenic and intestinal gammadeltaT17 cell gene signatures. Conditional deletion of mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) in RORgammat(+) lymphocytes significantly affects systemic gammadeltaT17 cell maintenance and reduces ILC3s without affecting Th17 cells in the gut. In vivo deletion of Tfam in RORgammat(+) lymphocytes, especially in gammadeltaT17 cells, results in small intestine tissue remodeling and increases small intestine length by enhancing the type 2 immune responses in mice. Moreover, these mice show dysregulation of the small intestine transcriptome and metabolism with less body weight but enhanced anti-helminth immunity. IL-22, a cytokine produced by RORgammat(+) lymphocytes inhibits IL-13-induced tuft cell differentiation in vitro, and suppresses the tuft cell-type 2 immune circuit and small intestine lengthening in vivo, highlighting its key role in gut tissue remodeling.","['Fu, Zheng', 'Dean, Joseph W', 'Xiong, Lifeng', 'Dougherty, Michael W', 'Oliff, Kristen N', 'Chen, Zong-Ming E', 'Jobin, Christian', 'Garrett, Timothy J', 'Zhou, Liang']","['Fu Z', 'Dean JW', 'Xiong L', 'Dougherty MW', 'Oliff KN', 'Chen ZE', 'Jobin C', 'Garrett TJ', 'Zhou L']","['Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32608, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA. liangzhou497@ufl.edu.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5216-9236', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3774-7912', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3733-1001', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4644-7903']",['eng'],"['R01 AI132391/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK105562/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 OD021676/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007110/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210722,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (High Mobility Group Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Tfam protein, mouse)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'High Mobility Group Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Homeostasis/immunology', 'Intestinal Mucosa/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Intestine, Small/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Metabolome', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3/*metabolism', 'Organoids', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Th17 Cells/cytology/immunology/metabolism']",PMC8298438,,,2021/07/24 06:00,2021/08/04 06:00,['2021/07/23 05:57'],"['2020/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/23 05:57 [entrez]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-021-24755-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-021-24755-9 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2021 Jul 22;12(1):4462. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-24755-9.,4462,['(c) 2021.

Emerging evidence suggests that GBPs are also implicated in tumorigenesis; however, their underlying molecular mechanism is still unknown. In this study, we identified that GBP1 and GBP2 interact with MCL-1, the key prosurvival member of the BCL-2 family, via its BH3 domain. GBPs induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, where the proapoptotic BCL-2 member, BAK, is an indispensable mediator. In particular, GBP2 completely inhibited the MCL-1-mediated promotion of the survival of CML cells through competitive inhibition, resulting in BAK liberation from MCL-1. Concurrently, GBP2 dramatically upregulates BAK expression via its inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Moreover, paclitaxel upregulates GBP2 expression, and paclitaxel-induced apoptotic activity was distinctively compromised by knockout of GBP2 in CML cells. Bioinformatics analyses of leukemia databases revealed that transcripts of GBPs were generally downregulated in leukemia patients and that GBPs were favorable prognosis markers. Thus, these findings provide molecular evidence of GBPs as apoptosis-inducing proteins of leukemia cells and suggest that GBPs are attractive targets for the development of chemotherapeutics.","['Luo, Yongyang', 'Jin, Hanyong', 'Kim, Je Hyeong', 'Bae, Jeehyeon']","['Luo Y', 'Jin H', 'Kim JH', 'Bae J']","['School of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, 06974, Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, 06974, Korea.', 'Division of Pulmonology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Ansan, 15355, Korea. chepraxis@korea.ac.kr.', 'School of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, 06974, Korea. jeehyeon@cau.ac.kr.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5850-0791', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8995-7460', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1995-1378']",['eng'],['2019R1F1A1059528/National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)'],['Journal Article'],20210722,United States,Oncogenesis,Oncogenesis,101580004,,,,PMC8298518,,,2021/07/24 06:00,2021/07/24 06:01,['2021/07/23 05:52'],"['2020/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/23 05:52 [entrez]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41389-021-00341-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41389-021-00341-y [pii]']",epublish,Oncogenesis. 2021 Jul 22;10(7):54. doi: 10.1038/s41389-021-00341-y.,54,['(c) 2021.

However, data available on the role of PGRN in hematological malignancies are limited. METHODS: Measurement of the PGRN level in serum of adult de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed. RESULTS: The mean serum PGRN level in AML patients was higher than that in controls (346.08 pg/ml +/- 64.46 vs 155 pg/ml +/- 63 respectively; p=0.001). After a mean duration of follow-up equaling 140 days, patients with high serum PGRN (i.e., higher than 370.5 pg/ml) had inferior overall survival (OS) in comparison to patients with low serum PGRN (i.e., lower than 370.5 pg/ml) (OS=25% vs 60.7%, mean survival=107 days vs 256.5 days, p=0.007). On the other hand, remitted patients on day 28 with high serum PGRN (i.e., higher than 307.5 pg/ml) did not differ from those with low serum PGRN (i.e., lower than 307.5 pg/ml) regarding disease-free survival (DFS) (DFS=78.6% vs. 87.5%, mean survival=301.3 days vs. 283.5 days, p=0.789).

AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily are highly expressed in cancer cells and are believed to be involved in drug resistance. The aim of this study was to understand how TKI treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells changes their glucose metabolism and if inhibition of AKRs can sensitize CML cells to TKIs. K562 cells were treated with the TKIs imatinib, nilotinib, or bosutinib, and the effects on glucose metabolism, cell death, glutathione levels, and AKR levels were assessed. To assess glucose dependence, cells were cultured in normal and low-glucose media. Pretreatment with AKR inhibitors, including epalrestat, were used to determine AKR-dependence. Treatment with TKIs increased intracellular glucose, AKR1B1/10 levels, glutathione oxidation, and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, but with minimal cell death. These effects were dependent on intracellular glucose accumulation. Pretreatment with epalrestat, or a selective inhibitor of AKR1B10, exacerbated TKI-induced cell death, suggesting that especially AKR1B10 was involved in protection against TKIs. Thus, by disrupting cell protective mechanisms, AKR inhibitors may render CML more susceptible to TKI treatments.","['Kikuya, Megumi', 'Furuichi, Kenta', 'Hirao, Takuya', 'Endo, Satoshi', 'Toyooka, Naoki', 'Ito, Kousei', 'Aoki, Shigeki']","['Kikuya M', 'Furuichi K', 'Hirao T', 'Endo S', 'Toyooka N', 'Ito K', 'Aoki S']","['Laboratory of Biopharmaceutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Chiba 260-8675, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Biopharmaceutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Chiba 260-8675, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Biopharmaceutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Chiba 260-8675, Japan; Divisions of Clinical Pharmacokinetics, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, International University of Health and Welfare, Tochigi 324-8501, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Biochemistry, Gifu Pharmaceutical University, Gifu 501-1196, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Science and Engineering, University of Toyama, Toyama 930-8555, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Biopharmaceutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Chiba 260-8675, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Biopharmaceutics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Chiba 260-8675, Japan.

In this event, macrophage pyroptosis, a process of cell death following the activation of NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasomes, is believed to partially account for inflammatory reactions. However, the role of macrophage pyroptosis in the process of hucMSC-derived exosomes alleviating colitis remains unknown. This study aimed at exploring the therapeutic effect and mechanism of hucMSC-derived exosomes on colitis repair. METHODS: In vivo, we used BALB/c mice to establish a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model and administrated hucMSC-derived exosomes intravenously to estimate its curative effect. Human myeloid leukemia mononuclear (THP-1) cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and Nigericin to activate NLRP3 inflammasomes, which simulated an inflammation environment in vitro. A microRNA mimic was used to verify the role of miR-378a-5p/NLRP3 axis in the colitis repair. RESULTS: hucMSC-derived exosomes inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in the mouse colon. The secretion of interleukin (IL)-18, IL-1beta, and Caspase-1 cleavage was suppressed, resulting in reduced cell pyroptosis. The same outcome was observed in the in vitro cell experiments, where the co-culture of THP-1 cells and MPMs with hucMSC-derived exosomes caused decreased expression of NLRP3 inflammasomes and increased cell survival. Furthermore, miR-378a-5p was highly expressed in hucMSC-derived exosomes and played a vital function in colitis repair. CONCLUSION: hucMSC-derived exosomes carrying miR-378a-5p inhibited NLRP3 inflammasomes and abrogated cell pyroptosis to protect against DSS-induced colitis.","['Cai, Xiu', 'Zhang, Zhi-Yu', 'Yuan, Jin-Tao', 'Ocansey, Dickson Kofi Wiredu', 'Tu, Qiang', 'Zhang, Xu', 'Qian, Hui', 'Xu, Wen-Rong', 'Qiu, Wei', 'Mao, Fei']","['Cai X', 'Zhang ZY', 'Yuan JT', 'Ocansey DKW', 'Tu Q', 'Zhang X', 'Qian H', 'Xu WR', 'Qiu W', 'Mao F']","[""Key Laboratory of Medical Science and Laboratory Medicine of Jiangsu Province, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The People's Hospital of Danyang, Affiliated Danyang Hospital of Nantong University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, 212300, People's Republic of China."", ""The People's Hospital of Danyang, Affiliated Danyang Hospital of Nantong University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, 212300, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Medical Science and Laboratory Medicine of Jiangsu Province, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", 'Directorate of University Health Services, University of Cape Coast, Cape Coast, Ghana.', ""Nanjing Jiangning Hospital, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 211100, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Medical Science and Laboratory Medicine of Jiangsu Province, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Medical Science and Laboratory Medicine of Jiangsu Province, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Medical Science and Laboratory Medicine of Jiangsu Province, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Nanjing Jiangning Hospital, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 211100, People's Republic of China. 308012119@qq.com."", ""Key Laboratory of Medical Science and Laboratory Medicine of Jiangsu Province, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China. maofei2003@ujs.edu.cn.""]",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5840-4436'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210722,England,Stem Cell Res Ther,Stem cell research & therapy,101527581,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein)', '0 (Nlrp3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Colitis/chemically induced/genetics/therapy', '*Exosomes', 'Macrophages', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*MicroRNAs/genetics', 'NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein/genetics', 'Pyroptosis', 'Umbilical Cord']",PMC8296541,['NOTNLM'],"['*IBD', '*Macrophage', '*NLRP3', '*Pyroptosis', '*hucMSC-derived exosomes', '*miR-378a-5p']",2021/07/24 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2021/07/23 05:38'],"['2021/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/23 05:38 [entrez]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13287-021-02492-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s13287-021-02492-6 [pii]']",epublish,Stem Cell Res Ther. 2021 Jul 22;12(1):416. doi: 10.1186/s13287-021-02492-6.,416,['(c) 2021.

The precise molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon are not well established. To uncover the molecular events underlying this event, we have performed a bioinformatics analysis of 650 single-cell transcriptomes. METHODS: Single-cell transcriptome analyses of expression heterogeneity, cell cycle, and cell trajectory in human cell compartment enriched in hematopoietic stem cell compartment were investigated in the bone marrow according to the age of the donors. Identification of aging-related nodules was identified by weighted correlation network analysis in this primitive compartment. RESULTS: The analysis of single-cell transcriptomes allowed to uncover a major upregulation of EGR1 in human-aged lineage-CD34+CD38- cells which present cell cycle dysregulation with reduction of G2/M phase according to less expression of CCND2 during S phase. EGR1 upregulation in aging hematopoietic stem cells was found to be independent of cell cycle phases and gender. EGR1 expression trajectory in aged HSC highlighted a signature enriched in hematopoietic and immune disorders with the best induction of AP-1 complex and quiescence regulators such as EGR1, BTG2, JUNB, and NR41A. Sonic Hedgehog-related TMEM107 transmembrane molecule followed also EGR1 cell trajectory. EGR1-dependent gene weighted network analysis in human HSC-associated IER2 target protein-specific regulators of PP2A activity, IL1B, TNFSF10 ligands, and CD69, SELP membrane molecules in old HSC module with immune and leukemogenic signature. In contrast, for young HSC which were found with different cell cycle phase progression, its specific module highlighted upregulation of HIF1A hypoxic factor, PDE4B immune marker, DRAK2 (STK17B) T cell apoptosis regulator, and MYADM myeloid-associated marker. CONCLUSION: EGR1 was found to be connected to the aging of human HSC and highlighted a specific cell trajectory contributing to the dysregulation of an inflammatory and leukemia-related transcriptional program in aged human HSCs. EGR1 and its program were found to be connected to the aging of human HSC with dissociation of quiescence property and cell cycle phase progression in this primitive hematopoietic compartment.","['Desterke, Christophe', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli, Annelise', 'Turhan, Ali G']","['Desterke C', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli A', 'Turhan AG']","['INSERM UA9, University Paris-Saclay, 94800, Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM UA9, University Paris-Saclay, 94800, Villejuif, France.', 'ESTeam Paris Sud, INGESTEM National IPSC Infrastructure, University Paris-Saclay, 94800, Villejuif, France.', 'Division of Hematology, APHP-Paris Saclay University Hospitals, Le Kremlin Bicetre 94275, 94800, Villejuif, France.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University Paris Saclay, 94275, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France.', 'INSERM UA9, University Paris-Saclay, 94800, Villejuif, France. turviv33@gmail.com.', 'ESTeam Paris Sud, INGESTEM National IPSC Infrastructure, University Paris-Saclay, 94800, Villejuif, France. turviv33@gmail.com.', 'Division of Hematology, APHP-Paris Saclay University Hospitals, Le Kremlin Bicetre 94275, 94800, Villejuif, France. turviv33@gmail.com.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University Paris Saclay, 94275, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France. turviv33@gmail.com.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4861-0137'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210722,England,Stem Cell Res Ther,Stem cell research & therapy,101527581,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '141490-22-4 (BTG2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (STK17B protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1/genetics', '*Hedgehog Proteins', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', '*Immediate-Early Proteins', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",PMC8296523,['NOTNLM'],"['*Aging', '*EGR1', '*Hematopoietic stem cell', '*Inflammation', '*Leukemia', '*Single cell']",2021/07/24 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2021/07/23 05:37'],"['2021/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/23 05:37 [entrez]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13287-021-02498-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s13287-021-02498-0 [pii]']",epublish,Stem Cell Res Ther. 2021 Jul 22;12(1):419. doi: 10.1186/s13287-021-02498-0.,419,['(c) 2021.

This was the sole presentation of a relapse in T/Myeloid mixed-phenotype acute leukemia after 5 months of remission. METHODS: Case report with clinical photography. RESULTS: A 56-year-old man reported to be in complete remission of T/Myeloid mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) presented with sudden painless loss of vision in his left eye. Fundoscopy showed unilateral severe optic disc swelling with characteristic findings of a central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), namely, intra- and preretinal haemorrhages and cotton-wool spots, as well as the features of a central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) resulting in a pale, edematous retina and a characteristic cherry-red spot. Blood, cerebrospinal fluid evaluation and bone marrow analysis were performed in combination with medical imaging. No evidence of leukemic relapse was found. An optic nerve biopsy was indicated, due to decompensation of the contralateral eye, and ultimately confirmed leukemic infiltration. DISCUSSION: Regardless of no hematological and non-specific imaging findings, optic nerve biopsy may be crucial for clinical decision making in a patient with acute complete vision loss and a history of leukemia.","['De La Porte, Vincent M', 'Lammens, Martin', 'Dekeyzer, Sven', 'Van Lint, Michel']","['De La Porte VM', 'Lammens M', 'Dekeyzer S', 'Van Lint M']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium Department of Pathology, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium Department of Radiology, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Antwerp, Edegem, Belgium Name and address for correspondence: Vincent M.

However, the diagnosis of B-PLL has presented several challenges since its conception, and over the past decades investigations of B-PLL have revealed substantial biologic and molecular heterogeneity. These data have shown that many B-PLL cases present many similarities with other types of small B-cell lymphomas, and that small B-cell lymphomas can undergo prolymphocytoid transformation. As a result, the frequency of B-PLL has markedly decreased, and currently B-PLL is a very rare entity. Most recent studies focused on B-PLL cases have been conducted on limited cohorts, precluding robust conclusions. In this article, we provide a concise historical review of B-PLL and describe the diagnostic and clinical challenges associated with establishing this diagnosis. We also argue that cases currently classified as B-PLL are unlikely to be a unique biologic entity, but rather represent a state of morphologic transformation characterized by many prolymphocytes that is shared by various types of small B-cell lymphoma.","['El Hussein, Siba', 'Khoury, Joseph D', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey']","['El Hussein S', 'Khoury JD', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States of America.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States of America.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States of America.

The current study aimed to characterize the functions of the basic transcription factor 3 (BTF3) gene and its regulation of the intestinal stem cell marker B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (BMI1) gene in colorectal cancer (CRC). Stem cell-like traits and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cultured human CRC cell line HCT116 were evaluated by CD133+ subpopulation counting, colony formation, tumorosphere generation, and expression of EMT-specific markers and stem cell markers. The interaction of BTF3 with BMI1 was analyzed. BTF3 was overexpressed in CRC tissues, which was associated with poor patient survival. BTF3 knockdown impaired the retention of stem cell-like traits of HCT116 and inhibited the EMT of HCT116 cells. BMI1 expression changed in a BTF3-dependent manner, and its overexpression could partially restore stem cell-like traits and EMT of cultured HCT116 cells after BTF3 knockdown. In parallel, treatment with the BMI1 inhibitor PTC-209 mimicked the effects of BTF3 knockdown on stem cell-like traits and EMT of cultured HCT116 cells. Together, these results support the notion that BTF3 and BMI1 are potential therapeutic targets to limit CRC metastasis.","['Zhou, Wenli', 'Yun, Zhennan', 'Wang, Ting', 'Li, Chao', 'Zhang, Jiantao']","['Zhou W', 'Yun Z', 'Wang T', 'Li C', 'Zhang J']","['Department of Neonatology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130000, PR China.', 'Department of Colorectal and Anal Surgery, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130000, PR China.', 'Department of Colorectal and Anal Surgery, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130000, PR China.', 'Department of Colorectal and Anal Surgery, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130000, PR China.', 'Department of Colorectal and Anal Surgery, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130000, PR China.

Here, we performed a metabolic drug screen to identify LSC-specific vulnerabilities and found that nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibitors selectively killed LSCs, while sparing normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Treatment with KPT-9274, a NAMPT inhibitor, suppressed the conversion of saturated fatty acids to monounsaturated fatty acids, a reaction catalyzed by the stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) enzyme, resulting in apoptosis of AML cells. Transcriptomic analysis of LSCs treated with KPT-9274 revealed an upregulation of sterol regulatory-element binding protein (SREBP)-regulated genes, including SCD, which conferred partial protection against NAMPT inhibitors. Inhibition of SREBP signaling with dipyridamole enhanced the cytotoxicity of KPT-9274 on LSCs in vivo. Our work demonstrates that altered lipid homeostasis plays a key role in NAMPT inhibitor-induced apoptosis and identifies NAMPT inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for targeting LSCs in AML.","['Subedi, Amit', 'Liu, Qiang', 'Ayyathan, Dhanoop M', 'Sharon, David', 'Cathelin, Severine', 'Hosseini, Mohsen', 'Xu, Changjiang', 'Voisin, Veronique', 'Bader, Gary D', ""D'Alessandro, Angelo"", 'Lechman, Eric R', 'Dick, John E', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Wang, Jean C Y', 'Chan, Steven M']","['Subedi A', 'Liu Q', 'Ayyathan DM', 'Sharon D', 'Cathelin S', 'Hosseini M', 'Xu C', 'Voisin V', 'Bader GD', ""D'Alessandro A"", 'Lechman ER', 'Dick JE', 'Minden MD', 'Wang JCY', 'Chan SM']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, ON, Canada; Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, ON, Canada; Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, ON, Canada; Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.

To date, few risk factors related to predisposition have been identified; therefore, new hypotheses should be considered. OBJECTIVE: To explore the possible relationship of residential proximity to urban green spaces on childhood leukemia. METHODS: We conducted a population-based case control study in the metropolitan area of Madrid from 2000 to 2015. It included 383 incident cases and 1935 controls, individually matched by birth year, sex and area of residence. Using the geographical coordinates of the participants' home residences, we built a proxy for exposure with four distances (250 m, 500 m, 750 m and 1 km) to urban parks (UPs) and urban wooded areas (UWAs). We employed logistic regression models to determinate the effect of them on childhood leukemia adjusting for environmental and socio-demographic covariates. RESULTS: we found a reduction in childhood leukemia incidence at a distance of 250 m from UPs (OR = 0.78; 95%CI = 0.62-0.98), as well as a reduction of the incidence in the Q3 and Q4 quintiles for exposure to UWAs, in the 250 m and 500 m buffers respectively (Q3 (250 m): OR = 0.69; 95%CI = 0.48-1.00; and, Q4 (500 m): OR = 0.69; 95%CI = 0.48-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a possible association between lower incidence of childhood leukemia and proximity to different forms of urban green space. This study is a first approach to the possible urban green space effects on childhood leukemia so is necessary to continue studying this spaces taking into account more individual data and other environmental risk factors.","['Ojeda Sanchez, C', 'Segu-Tell, J', 'Gomez-Barroso, D', 'Pardo Romaguera, E', 'Ortega-Garcia, J A', 'Ramis, R']","['Ojeda Sanchez C', 'Segu-Tell J', 'Gomez-Barroso D', 'Pardo Romaguera E', 'Ortega-Garcia JA', 'Ramis R']","['Albacete University Hospital, Albacete, Spain.

Included are a survey of therapy outcomes of ALL in Chinese children nationwide, comparison of these data with global ALL therapy outcomes, analyses of obstacles to improving outcomes, and suggestions of how progress can be achieved. Therapy outcomes at many Chinese pediatric cancer centers are approaching those of resource-rich countries. However, nationwide outcomes still need improvement. Obstacles include suboptimal clinical trials participation, children without adequate health care funding, human resource shortages, especially physicians expert in pediatric hematology and oncology, and social-economic disparities.

The most common mechanism of resistance is the acquisition of a point mutation in the BCR-ABL kinase domain. Few studies have reported African patients with CML in regard to such mutations. We here report the types of BCR-ABL mutations in Ethiopian imatinib-resistant patients with CML and their outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with CML with a diagnosis of imatinib resistance who were tested for BCR-ABL mutation between 2014 and September 2019 were included. RESULTS: A total of 962 cases of CML on imatinib therapy were reviewed and 164 cases of failure were found. Of these, only 31 cases (19%) had mutation analysis performed. Most cases (94%) were secondary failures. At the time of CML diagnosis, the median age was 33 years and the majority presented with features of advanced-phase disease. Of the 31 patients, 22 mutations were found (65%). The types of mutations detected were as follows: non-P-loop mutations 36% (11), P-loop mutations 13% (four), and alternatively spliced BCR-ABL variants 23% (seven). The splice variant frequently detected was BCR-ABL(35INS) (20%). Twenty-six of the 31 patients (84%) were switched to second-line TKIs, whereas in four patients (13%), imatinib dose escalation was done. Overall, the outcome revealed that 16 patients (52%) were alive with complete hematologic response, whereas 12 patients (39%) had died. All patients who expressed BCR-ABL1(35INS) were treated with second-line TKIs, and two of them (33%) had died because of disease progression. CONCLUSION: In Ethiopia, CML affects the young and point mutations were frequently detected in imatinib-resistant patients. BCR-ABL1 (35INS) was also prevalent and associated with disease progression.","['Tadesse, Fisihatsion', 'Asres, Getahun', 'Abubeker, Abdulaziz', 'Gebremedhin, Amha', 'Radich, Jerald']","['Tadesse F', 'Asres G', 'Abubeker A', 'Gebremedhin A', 'Radich J']","['Addis Ababa University College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.', 'University of Gondar, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Gondar, Ethiopia.', 'Addis Ababa University College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.', 'Addis Ababa University College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4270-9424'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,JCO Glob Oncol,JCO global oncology,101760170,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Ethiopia', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC8457809,,,2021/07/23 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2021/07/22 17:15'],"['2021/07/22 17:15 [entrez]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/GO.21.00058 [doi]'],ppublish,JCO Glob Oncol. 2021 Jul;7:1187-1193. doi: 10.1200/GO.21.00058.,1187-1193,,,,,"['Jerald RadichConsulting or Advisory Role: Novartis, Bfs, Amgen, Takeda Science', 'Foundation, Bio-RadNo other potential conflicts of interest were reported.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While they carry the promise of improved disease control and survival and are currently investigated in first-line treatment protocols for patients with poor prognostic markers, they are associated with a considerable incidence of specific toxicities, including cytokine-release syndrome, neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, endocrine adverse events, and infectious complications. Iatrogenic or secondary dysgammaglobulinemia is a main consequence of targeted therapies using monoclonal antibodies and other antibody-derived treatments that target specific antigens on lymphoid cells (blinatumomab, inotuzumab ozogamicin, rituximab), chimeric antigen receptor T cells, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib) and, to a lesser extent, checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab).

However, the rapid growth and metabolism required for survival can also highlight vulnerabilities specific to these malignant cells. One such vulnerability exhibited by cancer is an increased demand for amino acids (AAs), which often results in a dependency on exogenous sources of AAs or requires upregulation of de novo synthesis. These metabolic alterations can be exploited by therapy, which aims to improve treatment outcome and decrease relapse and reoccurrence. One clinically utilised strategy targeting AA dependency is the use of asparaginase in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), which results in a depletion of exogenous asparagine and subsequent cancer cell death. Examples of other successful strategies include the exploitation of arginine deiminase and methioninase, nutrient restriction of methionine and the inhibition of glutaminase. In this review, we summarise these treatment strategies into three promising avenues: AA restriction, enzymatic depletion and inhibition of metabolism. This review provides an insight into the complexity of metabolism in cancer, whilst highlighting these three current research avenues that have support in both preclinical and clinical settings.","['Endicott, Molly', 'Jones, Michael', 'Hull, Jonathon']","['Endicott M', 'Jones M', 'Hull J']","['Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, University of the West of England, Coldharbour Lane, Bristol, BS16 1QY, UK.', 'Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, University of the West of England, Coldharbour Lane, Bristol, BS16 1QY, UK.', 'Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, University of the West of England, Coldharbour Lane, Bristol, BS16 1QY, UK. jonathon2.hull@uwe.ac.uk.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8097-0987', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3013-1071', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0611-612X']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210722,Austria,Amino Acids,Amino acids,9200312,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Dietary Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'Asparaginase/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Dietary Proteins/administration & dosage', 'Electron Transport', 'Glycolysis', 'Humans', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology']",PMC8325646,['NOTNLM'],"['Amino acids', 'Asparaginase', 'Cancer', 'Metabolism', 'Oncology']",2021/07/23 06:00,2021/12/31 06:00,['2021/07/22 12:29'],"['2021/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/22 12:29 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00726-021-03052-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00726-021-03052-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Amino Acids. 2021 Aug;53(8):1169-1179. doi: 10.1007/s00726-021-03052-1.

Objective: To compare the relative risk (RR) of hepatotoxicity of new-generation BCR-ABL TKIs with that of imatinib, and to provide an overall assessment of the clinical benefit. Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library databases, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for clinical trials published between January 2000 and April 2020. Study Selection: Study selection was conducted independently by 2 investigators according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria published previously in the protocol: only randomized phase 2 or phase 3 clinical trials that compared bosutinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, or ponatinib with imatinib were included. Among the 2666 records identified, 9 studies finally fulfilled the established criteria. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two investigators extracted study characteristics and data independently using a standardized data extraction form. Data were extracted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. When substantial heterogeneity was observed, pooled estimates were calculated based on the random-effect model; otherwise, the fixed-effect model was used. Main Outcomes and Measures: Data extracted included study characteristics, baseline patient information, interventions and data on all-grade and high-grade (grades 3 and 4) elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, overall survival, and major molecular response (MMR). The RRs and 95% CIs were calculated using the inverse variance method. Results: Nine trials involving 3475 patients were analyzed; the median (range) age was 49 (18-91) years; 2059 (59.2%) were male patients. Increased risks were observed for each new-generation TKI except for dasatinib. Patients receiving new-generation TKIs were more likely to experience all grades of ALT elevation (pooled RR, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.78-4.69; P < .001) and grades 3 and 4 ALT elevation (pooled RR, 4.36; 95% CI, 2.00-9.50; P < .001) compared with those receiving imatinib. Patients receiving new-generation TKIs were also more likely to experience all grades of AST elevation (pooled RR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.63-2.98; P < .001) and grades 3 and 4 AST elevation (pooled RR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.59-4.42; P < .001) compared with those receiving imatinib. New-generation TKIs were associated with a significantly higher rate of MMR at 1 year compared with imatinib (pooled RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.44-1.75; P < .001). No statistical difference in overall survival at 1 year was found between new-generation TKIs and imatinib (pooled RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 1.00-1.01; P = .33). Conclusions and Relevance: When compared to imatinib, bosutinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib had higher relative risks of hepatotoxicity. Treatment with new-generation TKIs was associated with a higher MMR rate at 1 year but not with 1-year overall survival.","['Wang, Zhe', 'Wang, Xiaoyu', 'Wang, Zhen', 'Feng, Yuyi', 'Jia, Yaqin', 'Jiang, Lili', 'Xia, Yangliu', 'Cao, Jun', 'Liu, Yong']","['Wang Z', 'Wang X', 'Wang Z', 'Feng Y', 'Jia Y', 'Jiang L', 'Xia Y', 'Cao J', 'Liu Y']","['School of Life and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China.', 'School of Life and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China.', 'School of Life and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China.', 'School of Life and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China.', 'School of Life and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China.', 'School of Life and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China.', 'School of Life and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China.', 'Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'School of Life and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Dalian University of Technology, Panjin, China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20210701,United States,JAMA Netw Open,JAMA network open,101729235,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Aniline Compounds/adverse effects', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/*etiology', 'Dasatinib/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/adverse effects', 'Imidazoles/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitriles/adverse effects', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/drug effects', 'Pyridazines/adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects', 'Quinolines/adverse effects', 'Risk', 'Young Adult']",PMC8299317,,,2021/07/23 06:00,2022/01/04 06:00,['2021/07/22 12:26'],"['2021/07/22 12:26 [entrez]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['2782167 [pii]', '10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.20165 [doi]']",epublish,JAMA Netw Open. 2021 Jul 1;4(7):e2120165. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.20165.,e2120165,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relative value of transplantation with MUD vs Haplo donors when both groups receive PTCy/calcineurin inhibitor/mycophenolate GVHD prophylaxis is not known. We compared outcomes after 2036 Haplo and 284 MUD transplantations with PTCy GVHD prophylaxis for acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome in adults from 2011 through 2018. Cox regression models were built to compare outcomes between donor types. Recipients of myeloablative and reduced-intensity regimens were analyzed separately. Among recipients of reduced-intensity regimens, 2-year graft failure (3% vs 11%), acute grades 2 to 4 GVHD (hazards ratio [HR], 0.70; P = .022), acute grades 3 and 4 GVHD (HR, 0.41; P = .016), and nonrelapse mortality (HR, 0.43; P = .0008) were lower after MUD than with Haplo donor transplantation. Consequently, disease-free (HR, 0.74; P = .008; 55% vs 41%) and overall (HR, 0.65; P = .001; 67% vs 54%) survival were higher with MUD than with Haplo transplants. Among recipients of myeloablative regimens, day-100 platelet recovery (95% vs 88%) was higher and grades 3 and 4 acute (HR, 0.39; P = .07) and chronic GVHD (HR, 0.66; P = .05) were lower after MUD than with Haplo donor transplantation.

However, the mechanism of action of this drug combination is not fully understood. We discovered that venetoclax directly activated T cells to increase their cytotoxicity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in vitro and in vivo. Venetoclax enhanced T-cell effector function by increasing reactive oxygen species generation through inhibition of respiratory chain supercomplexes formation. In addition, azacytidine induced a viral mimicry response in AML cells by activating the STING/cGAS pathway, thereby rendering the AML cells more susceptible to T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Similar findings were seen in patients treated with venetoclax, as this treatment increased reactive oxygen species generation and activated T cells. Collectively, this study presents a new immune-mediated mechanism of action for venetoclax and azacytidine in the treatment of AML and highlights a potential combination of venetoclax and adoptive cell therapy for patients with AML.","['Lee, Jong Bok', 'Khan, Dilshad H', 'Hurren, Rose', 'Xu, Mingjing', 'Na, Yoosu', 'Kang, Hyeonjeong', 'Mirali, Sara', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Gronda, Marcela', 'Jitkova, Yulia', 'MacLean, Neil', 'Arruda, Andrea', 'Alaniz, Zoe', 'Konopleva, Marina Y', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Zhang, Li', 'Schimmer, Aaron D']","['Lee JB', 'Khan DH', 'Hurren R', 'Xu M', 'Na Y', 'Kang H', 'Mirali S', 'Wang X', 'Gronda M', 'Jitkova Y', 'MacLean N', 'Arruda A', 'Alaniz Z', 'Konopleva MY', 'Andreeff M', 'Minden MD', 'Zhang L', 'Schimmer AD']","['Toronto General Hospital Research Institute and.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Toronto General Hospital Research Institute and.', 'Toronto General Hospital Research Institute and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Department of Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, and.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center; Houston, TX; and.', 'Department of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, and.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Toronto General Hospital Research Institute and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Department of Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6233-9067', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9424-5417', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9347-2212', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1144-1958', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9089-8816', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4649-0757', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4023-3899']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '419699/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/immunology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC8310428,,,2021/07/23 06:00,2021/09/03 06:00,['2021/07/22 12:26'],"['2020/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/22 12:26 [entrez]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(21)00643-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020009081 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2021 Jul 22;138(3):234-245. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020009081.,234-245,['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a disease that exemplifies this process and is a model for neoplasms in general, we created transgenic mice overexpressing the enzyme activation-induced deaminase (AID), which has a normal function of inducing DNA mutations in B lymphocytes. AID not only allows normal B lymphocytes to develop more effective immunoglobulin-mediated immunity, but is also able to mutate nonimmunoglobulin genes, predisposing to cancer. In CLL, AID expression correlates with poor prognosis, suggesting a role for this enzyme in disease progression. Nevertheless, direct experimental evidence identifying the specific genes that are mutated by AID and indicating that those genes are associated with disease progression is not available. To address this point, we overexpressed Aicda in a murine model of CLL (Emu-TCL1). Analyses of TCL1/AID mice demonstrate a role for AID in disease kinetics, CLL cell proliferation, and the development of cancer-related target mutations with canonical AID signatures in nonimmunoglobulin genes. Notably, our mouse models can accumulate mutations in the same genes that are mutated in human cancers. Moreover, some of these mutations occur at homologous positions, leading to identical or chemically similar amino acid substitutions as in human CLL and lymphoma. Together, these findings support a direct link between aberrant AID activity and CLL driver mutations that are then selected for their oncogenic effects, whereby AID promotes aggressiveness in CLL and other B-cell neoplasms.","['Morande, Pablo Elias', 'Yan, Xiao-Jie', 'Sepulveda, Julieta', 'Seija, Noe', 'Marquez, Maria Elena', 'Sotelo, Natalia', 'Abreu, Cecilia', 'Crispo, Martina', 'Fernandez-Grana, Gabriel', 'Rego, Natalia', 'Bois, Therence', 'Methot, Stephen P', 'Palacios, Florencia', 'Remedi, Victoria', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Buschiazzo, Alejandro', 'Di Noia, Javier M', 'Navarrete, Marcelo A', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Oppezzo, Pablo']","['Morande PE', 'Yan XJ', 'Sepulveda J', 'Seija N', 'Marquez ME', 'Sotelo N', 'Abreu C', 'Crispo M', 'Fernandez-Grana G', 'Rego N', 'Bois T', 'Methot SP', 'Palacios F', 'Remedi V', 'Rai KR', 'Buschiazzo A', 'Di Noia JM', 'Navarrete MA', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Oppezzo P']","['Research Laboratory on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Laboratorio de Inmunologia Oncologica, Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX-CONICET), Academia Nacional de Medicina de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Tumor-Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Strassen, Luxembourg.', 'The Karches Center for Oncology Research, The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Centro Asistencial Docente e Investigacion de la Universidad de Magallanes (CADI-UMAG), School of Medicine, University of Magallanes, Punta Arenas, Chile.', 'Research Laboratory on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Research Laboratory on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Research Laboratory on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Research Laboratory on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Transgenic and Experimental Animal Unit and.', 'Transgenic and Experimental Animal Unit and.', 'Bioinformatics Unit, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'The Karches Center for Oncology Research, The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY.', 'Hospital Maciel, Administracion de los Servicios de Salud del Estado (ASSE), Ministerio de Salud, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'The Karches Center for Oncology Research, The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Structural Microbiology, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay; and.', 'Integrative Microbiology of Zoonotic Agents-International Joint Unit, Department of Microbiology, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.', 'Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Centro Asistencial Docente e Investigacion de la Universidad de Magallanes (CADI-UMAG), School of Medicine, University of Magallanes, Punta Arenas, Chile.', 'The Karches Center for Oncology Research, The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY.', 'Research Laboratory on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Institut Pasteur de Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3717-5803', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6354-3609', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1475-2572', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4906-8367', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2854-2226', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2509-6526', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2896-0321', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2044-9548', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1023-6650', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4194-246X']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', '*Up-Regulation']",,,,2021/07/23 06:00,2021/09/03 06:00,['2021/07/22 12:26'],"['2020/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/22 12:26 [entrez]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(21)00513-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020008654 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2021 Jul 22;138(3):246-258. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020008654.,246-258,['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A population based cohort of 122 pre B-ALL, 22 T-ALL and 45 AML patients was formed from the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology leukemia registries (years 2005-2017). Hepatomegaly, elevated alanine aminotransferase, high INR, hypoalbuminemia and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia at diagnosis were used as markers for liver involvement. Minimal residual disease (MRD), time to relapse and overall survival (OS) were correlated with liver involvements. RESULTS: The pattern of liver involvement was significantly different between leukemia subtypes (P = 0.025). The proportion of patients without liver abnormalities was 50.0% in AML and 44.8% in pre B-ALL and 23.5% in T-ALL patients. Hepatomegaly characterized lymphatic leukemia being present in 41.8% and 58.8% of pre B- and T-ALL patients. Liver dysfunction was most common in AML (29.5%) and least frequent in pre B-ALL (7.4%,) (P = 0.001). Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia was present in less than 5% of patients. Hepatomegaly correlated positively with age in pre B-ALL (P = 0.036) and white blood cell count (WBC) in AML (P = 0.010). Hepatic dysfunction was related with high WBC in pre B-ALL (P = 0.037) and AML (P = 0.001). Liver involvement in patients with ALL was not associated with toxicity or outcome. Patients with AML without liver involvement demonstrated superior OS. CONCLUSIONS: Liver involvement is frequent at diagnosis in pediatric leukemia and its prevalence is related with leukemia subtype, age and WBC. In AML, but not in ALL, it associates with suboptimal prognosis.","['Sandart, Amelie', 'Harila-Saari, Arja', 'Arnell, Henrik', 'Fischler, Bjorn', 'Vakkila, Jukka']","['Sandart A', 'Harila-Saari A', 'Arnell H', 'Fischler B', 'Vakkila J']","['Department of Pediatrics, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, Uppsala."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Karolinska University Hospital and Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Karolinska University Hospital and CLINTEC Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,8211545,,IM,"['Child', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Liver', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis']",,,,2021/07/23 06:00,2021/11/04 06:00,['2021/07/22 12:23'],"['2021/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/04 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/22 12:23 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MPG.0000000000003243 [doi]', '00005176-900000000-95594 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 2021 Nov 1;73(5):630-635. doi: 10.1097/MPG.0000000000003243.,630-635,"['Copyright (c) 2021 by European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology,', 'Hepatology, and Nutrition and North American Society for Pediatric', 'Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition.']",,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Akirin do not have catalytic or DNA-binding capability and exert its regulatory function primarily through interacting proteins such as transcription factors, chromatin remodelers, and RNA-associated proteins. In the present study, we focused on the human Akirin2 regulome and interactome in neutrophil-like model human Caucasian promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells. Our hypothesis is that metazoan evolved to have Akirin2 functional complements and different Akirin2-mediated mechanisms for the regulation of gene expression. To address this hypothesis, experiments were conducted using transcriptomics, proteomics and systems biology approaches in akirin2 knockdown and wildtype (WT) HL60 cells to characterize Akirin2 gene/protein targets, functional complements and to provide evidence of different mechanisms that may be involved in Akirin2-mediated regulation of gene expression. The results revealed Akirin2 gene/protein targets in multiple BPs with higher representation of immunity and identified immune response genes as candidate Akirin2 functional complements. In addition to linking chromatin remodelers with transcriptional activation, Akirin2 also interacts with histone H3.1 for regulation of gene expression.","['Artigas-Jeronimo, Sara', 'Villar, Margarita', 'Estrada-Pena, Agustin', 'Velazquez-Campoy, Adrian', 'Alberdi, Pilar', 'de la Fuente, Jose']","['Artigas-Jeronimo S', 'Villar M', 'Estrada-Pena A', 'Velazquez-Campoy A', 'Alberdi P', 'de la Fuente J']","['SaBio, Instituto de Investigacion en Recursos Cinegeticos IREC-CSIC-UCLM-JCCM, Ronda de Toledo s/n, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain.', 'SaBio, Instituto de Investigacion en Recursos Cinegeticos IREC-CSIC-UCLM-JCCM, Ronda de Toledo s/n, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain.', 'Biochemistry Section, Faculty of Science and Chemical Technologies, and Regional Centre for Biomedical Research (CRIB), University of Castilla-La Mancha, Ciudad Real 13071, Spain.', 'Department of Animal Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Zaragoza 50013, Spain.', 'Institute of Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems (BIFI), Joint Units IQFR-CSIC-BIFI, and GBsC-CSIC-BIFI, Universidad de Zaragoza, Zaragoza 50018, Spain.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular y Celular, Universidad de Zaragoza 50009, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Aragon (IIS Aragon), Zaragoza 50009, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red en el Area Tematica de Enfermedades Hepaticas y Digestivas (CIBERehd), Madrid 28029, Spain.', 'Fundacion ARAID, Gobierno de Aragon, Zaragoza 50009, Spain.', 'SaBio, Instituto de Investigacion en Recursos Cinegeticos IREC-CSIC-UCLM-JCCM, Ronda de Toledo s/n, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain.', 'SaBio, Instituto de Investigacion en Recursos Cinegeticos IREC-CSIC-UCLM-JCCM, Ronda de Toledo s/n, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain.', 'Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Center for Veterinary Health Sciences, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK 74078, U.S.A.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7383-9649'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,,IM,,PMC8298264,['NOTNLM'],"['*Akirin', '*Subolesin', '*epigenetics', '*gene regulatory networks', '*histones', '*interactome']",2021/07/23 06:00,2021/07/23 06:00,['2021/07/22 08:44'],"['2021/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/01 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/22 08:44 [entrez]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['229302 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20211120 [doi]']",ppublish,Biosci Rep. 2021 Jul 30;41(7). pii: 229302. doi: 10.1042/BSR20211120.,,['(c) 2021 The Author(s).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we examined the role of the cellular energy sensor AMP kinase (AMPK) in alloreactive T cells during GVHD development. Early posttransplant, AMPK activity increased more than 15-fold in allogeneic T cells, and transplantation of T cells deficient in both AMPKalpha1 and AMPKalpha2 decreased GVHD severity in multiple disease models. Importantly, a lack of AMPK lessened GVHD without compromising antileukemia responses or impairing lymphopenia-driven immune reconstitution. Mechanistically, absence of AMPK decreased both CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cell numbers as early as day 3 posttransplant, while simultaneously increasing regulatory T cell (Treg) percentages. Improvements in GVHD resulted from cell-intrinsic perturbations in conventional effector T cells as depletion of donor Tregs had minimal impact on AMPK-related improvements. Together, these results highlight a specific role for AMPK in allogeneic effector T cells early posttransplant and suggest that AMPK inhibition may be an innovative approach to mitigate GVHD while preserving graft-versus-leukemia responses and maintaining robust immune reconstitution.","['Monlish, Darlene A', 'Beezhold, Kevin J', 'Chiaranunt, Pailin', 'Paz, Katelyn', 'Moore, Nathan J', 'Dobbs, Andrea K', 'Brown, Rebecca A', 'Ozolek, John A', 'Blazar, Bruce R', 'Byersdorfer, Craig A']","['Monlish DA', 'Beezhold KJ', 'Chiaranunt P', 'Paz K', 'Moore NJ', 'Dobbs AK', 'Brown RA', 'Ozolek JA', 'Blazar BR', 'Byersdorfer CA']","['Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapies, Department of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapies, Department of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapies, Department of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapies, Department of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapies, Department of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapies, Department of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Anatomy and Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapies, Department of Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.']",,['eng'],"['R01 HL144556/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI056299/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA065493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL155114/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL123631/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL056067/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA142106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20210722,United States,JCI Insight,JCI insight,101676073,,IM,,PMC8410053,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bone marrow transplantation', '*Fatty acid oxidation', '*Immunotherapy', '*Metabolism', '*Transplantation']",2021/07/23 06:00,2021/07/23 06:00,['2021/07/22 08:41'],"['2020/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/22 08:41 [entrez]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['e143811 [pii]', '10.1172/jci.insight.143811 [doi]']",epublish,JCI Insight. 2021 Jul 22;6(14). pii: e143811. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.143811.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current treatments are still limited. Venetoclax, a selective inhibitor of BCL2, is a small molecule that can cross the blood-brain barrier and shows a potential efficacy in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia with central nervous system involvement. Although venetoclax has also been used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia in recent years, there are no reports of its use in the treatment of central nervous system relapse in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Here, we report a case of central nervous system relapse in acute promyelocytic leukemia that achieved complete remission after oral treatment with venetoclax. The presence of venetoclax in the patient's CSF was confirmed by testing CSF and plasma by mass spectrometry. The concentration of venetoclax in CSF was approximately 1/300 of that in plasma trough concentration. The treatment experience in this case demonstrates the potential ability of venetoclax to treat of central nervous system relapse/involvement in acute promyelocytic leukemia, thus providing a new treatment option for this kind of patient.","['Zhang, Xuzhao', 'Chen, Jinliang', 'Wang, Weiqin', 'Li, Xian', 'Tan, Yanbin', 'Zhang, Xiaohong', 'Qian, Wenbin']","['Zhang X', 'Chen J', 'Wang W', 'Li X', 'Tan Y', 'Zhang X', 'Qian W']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Center of Clinical Pharmacology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Radiology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.']",,['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210705,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC8287827,['NOTNLM'],"['CSF concentration', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'central nervous system', 'relapse', 'venetoclax']",2021/07/23 06:00,2021/07/23 06:01,['2021/07/22 06:35'],"['2021/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/22 06:35 [entrez]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.693670 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Jul 5;11:693670. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.693670. eCollection 2021.,693670,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhang, Chen, Wang, Li, Tan, Zhang and Qian.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Defects in cell growth and apoptotic pathways lead to the pathogenesis of the disease as well as its resistance to therapy; therefore, it is a good model for examining pro-apoptotic agents. The present study compared the molecular mechanism induced by kaempferol and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) as well as all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), in HL-60 leukemia cells during five days. Materials and Methods: Cell viability was determined by resazurin assay following treatment with ATRA (10 microM), EGCG, and kaempferol (12.5-100 microM), and apoptosis was detected by the ANX V/PI kit. Moreover, the levels of genes involved in apoptosis (PI3K, AKT, BCL2, BAX, P21, PTEN, CASP3, CASP8, and CASP9) and multi-drug resistance (MDR, ABCB1 and ABCC1) were assessed by using real-time PCR test. Results: Based on the findings, kaempferol decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis in HL60 cells more than EGCG. Apoptosis was induced via extrinsic and intrinsic pathways in HL60 cells by kaempferol and EGCG. In addition, kaempferol and EGCG increased apoptosis and inhibited MDR in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Conclusion: Kaempferol at high concentrations can be taken into consideration for treating patients with APL as compared with EGCG.","['Jokar, Mohammad Hassan', 'Sedighi, Sima', 'Moradzadeh, Maliheh']","['Jokar MH', 'Sedighi S', 'Moradzadeh M']","['Golestan Rheumatology Research Center, Sayad Shirazi Hospital, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Equal first author.', 'Golestan Rheumatology Research Center, Sayad Shirazi Hospital, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.', 'Equal first author.', 'Golestan Rheumatology Research Center, Sayad Shirazi Hospital, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Iran,Avicenna J Phytomed,Avicenna journal of phytomedicine,101586220,,,,PMC8264220,['NOTNLM'],"['APL', 'Apoptosis', 'EGCG', 'Kaempferol', 'MDR']",2021/07/23 06:00,2021/07/23 06:01,['2021/07/22 06:35'],"['2020/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/22 06:35 [entrez]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.22038/AJP.2021.17604 [doi]'],ppublish,Avicenna J Phytomed. 2021 Jul-Aug;11(4):314-323. doi: 10.22038/AJP.2021.17604.,314-323,,,,,['The authors have declared that there is no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, implementation of CAR-T in other indications remains challenging due to the lack of truly tumor-specific antigens as well as control of CAR-T activity in patients. CD123 is highly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts including leukemia-initiating cells making it an attractive immunotherapeutic target. However, CD123 expression in normal hematopoietic progenitor cells and endothelia bears the risk of severe toxicities and may limit CAR-T applications lacking fine-tuned control mechanisms. Therefore, we recently developed a rapidly switchable universal CAR-T platform (UniCAR), in which CAR-T activity depends on the presence of a soluble adapter called targeting module (TM), and confirmed clinical proof-of-concept for targeting CD123 in AML with improved safety. As costimulation via 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL) can enhance CAR-T expansion, persistence, and effector functions, a novel CD123-specific TM variant (TM123-4-1BBL) comprising trimeric single-chain 4-1BBL was developed for transient costimulation of UniCAR-T cells (UniCAR-T) at the leukemic site in trans. TM123-4-1BBL-directed UniCAR-T efficiently eradicated CD123-positive AML cells in vitro and in a CDX in vivo model. Moreover, additional costimulation via TM123-4-1BBL enabled enhanced expansion and persistence with a modulated UniCAR-T phenotype. In addition, the increased hydrodynamic volume of TM123-4-1BBL prolonged terminal plasma half-life and ensured a high total drug exposure in vivo. In conclusion, expanding the soluble adapter optionality for CD123-directed UniCAR-T maintains the platforms high anti-leukemic efficacy and immediate control mechanism for a flexible, safe, and individualized CAR-T therapy of AML patients.","['Meyer, Jan-Erik', 'Loff, Simon', 'Dietrich, Josephine', 'Spehr, Johannes', 'Jurado Jimenez, Gabriel', 'von Bonin, Malte', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Cartellieri, Marc', 'Ehninger, Armin']","['Meyer JE', 'Loff S', 'Dietrich J', 'Spehr J', 'Jurado Jimenez G', 'von Bonin M', 'Ehninger G', 'Cartellieri M', 'Ehninger A']","['GEMoaB GmbH, Dresden, Germany.', 'GEMoaB GmbH, Dresden, Germany.', 'GEMoaB GmbH, Dresden, Germany.', 'GEMoaB GmbH, Dresden, Germany.', 'GEMoaB GmbH, Dresden, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Medical Clinic I, Department of Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'GEMoaB GmbH, Dresden, Germany.', 'GEMoaB GmbH, Dresden, Germany.', 'GEMoaB GmbH, Dresden, Germany.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210708,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', '*Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes']",PMC8274446,['NOTNLM'],"['*4-1BB', '*CD123', '*Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)', '*acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*costimulation in trans', '*switchable CAR platform']",2021/07/23 06:00,2021/08/03 06:00,['2021/07/22 06:35'],"['2021/07/22 06:35 [entrez]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2021.1945804 [doi]', '1945804 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2021 Jul 8;10(1):1945804. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2021.1945804. eCollection 2021.,1945804,"['(c) 2021 The Author(s).

There is reduced information published regarding HN mortality in Ecuador. This study aims to present the crude and age-specific mortality rates for HN in the Ecuadorian population. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study through the national database of defunctions published by the Ecuadorian National Institute of Statistics and Census, 2019. We used the ICD-10 codes to classify the HN. Results: During 2019, 1462 deaths were reported, 53.83% were males, 87.96% of mestizo ethnicity, and 78.32% residents in urban areas. The median age was 62 years, with an interquartile range of 34.The crude mortality rate obtained was 8.49 per 100000 inhabitants, and the higher age-specific mortality rates was 43.29 per 100000 inhabitants aged >/= 60 years, contrasting with the 2.63 per 100000 inhabitants in people aged < 20 years. Considering each ICD-10 group, we found the following rates by 100000 inhabitants; C85 2.04, C91 1.92, C92 1.46, C90 1.11, C83 0.70, C95 0.48, C81 0.38, C84 0.16, C82 0.10, C96 0.05, C93 0.04, C86 and C94 0.02, and C88 0.01. Conclusion: In Ecuador, during 2019, approximately eight people died due to HN by 100000 inhabitants, affecting mainly people aged >/= 60 years. The most frequent neoplasms were Non-Hodgkin lymphomas, similar to other reports globally. These results should be analyzed considering some deficiencies in the Ecuadorian health system and the national registry. Therefore, we suggest conducting more studies regarding HN.","['Garrido, David', 'Orquera, Andres', 'Rojas, Johanna', 'Granja, Manuel']","['Garrido D', 'Orquera A', 'Rojas J', 'Granja M']","['Posgrado de Hematologia, Hospital de Clinicas ""Dr. Manuel Quintela"", Universidad de la Republica, Av Italia, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Carlos Andrade Marin, Av.

Virus challenging studies suggested that a breeding strain of common carp developed resistance to CyHV-3 infection. This study illustrates the immune mechanisms involved in both sensitivity and anti-virus ability for CyHV3 infection in fish. An integrative analysis of the protein-coding genes and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) using transcriptomic data was performed. Tissues from the head kidney of common carp were extracted at days 0 (the healthy control) and 7 after CyHV-3 infection (the survivors) and used to analyze the transcriptome through both Illumina and PacBio sequencing. Following analysis of the GO terms and KEGG pathways involved, the immune-related terms and pathways were merged. To dig out details on the immune aspect, the DEGs were filtered using the current common carp immune gene library. Immune gene categories and their corresponding genes in different comparison groups were revealed. Also, the immunological Gene Ontology terms for lncRNA modulation were retained. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to reveal the regulation of immune genes by lncRNA. The results demonstrated that the breeding carp strain develops a marked resistance to CyHV-3 infection through a specific innate immune mechanism. The featured biological processes were autophagy, phagocytosis, cytotoxicity, and virus blockage by lectins and MUC3. Moreover, the immune-suppressive signals, such as suppression of IL21R on STAT3, PI3K mediated inhibition of inflammation by dopamine upon infection, as well as the inhibition of NLRC3 on STING during a steady state. Possible susceptible factors for CyHV-3, such as ITGB1, TLR18, and CCL4, were also revealed from the non-breeding strain. The results of this study also suggested that Nramp and PAI regulated by LncRNA could facilitate virus infection and proliferation for infected cells respectively, while T cell leukemia homeobox 3 (TLX3), as well as galectin 3 function by lncRNA, may play a role in the resistance mechanism. Therefore, immune factors that are immunogenetically insensitive or susceptible to CyHV-3 infection have been revealed.","['Jia, Zhiying', 'Wu, Nan', 'Jiang, Xiaona', 'Li, Heng', 'Sun, Jiaxin', 'Shi, Mijuan', 'Li, Chitao', 'Ge, Yanlong', 'Hu, Xuesong', 'Ye, Weidong', 'Tang, Ying', 'Shan, Junwei', 'Cheng, Yingyin', 'Xia, Xiao-Qin', 'Shi, Lianyu']","['Jia Z', 'Wu N', 'Jiang X', 'Li H', 'Sun J', 'Shi M', 'Li C', 'Ge Y', 'Hu X', 'Ye W', 'Tang Y', 'Shan J', 'Cheng Y', 'Xia XQ', 'Shi L']","['Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'National and Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for Freshwater Fish Breeding, Harbin, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Aquatic Genomics, Ministry of Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.', 'College of Advanced Agricultural Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'National and Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for Freshwater Fish Breeding, Harbin, China.', 'Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.', 'College of Advanced Agricultural Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'National and Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for Freshwater Fish Breeding, Harbin, China.', 'Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.', 'Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'National and Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for Freshwater Fish Breeding, Harbin, China.', 'Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'National and Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for Freshwater Fish Breeding, Harbin, China.', 'Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'National and Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for Freshwater Fish Breeding, Harbin, China.', 'Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.', 'College of Advanced Agricultural Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.', 'College of Fisheries and Life Science, Dalian Ocean University, Dalian, China.', 'Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.', 'College of Advanced Agricultural Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'The Innovative Academy of Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'National and Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for Freshwater Fish Breeding, Harbin, China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210705,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,['Cyprinid herpesvirus 3'],IM,"['Animals', 'Carps/*genetics/*immunology/virology', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Fish Diseases/*genetics/*immunology/virology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Head Kidney/pathology', 'Herpesviridae/immunology/physiology', 'Herpesviridae Infections/immunology/*veterinary/virology', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Immunity, Innate/*genetics']",PMC8287582,['NOTNLM'],"['*CyHV-3', '*common carp', '*lncRNA', '*resistant immune mechanism', '*transcriptome']",2021/07/23 06:00,2021/10/29 06:00,['2021/07/22 06:32'],"['2021/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/22 06:32 [entrez]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.687151 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Jul 5;12:687151. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.687151. eCollection 2021.,687151,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Jia, Wu, Jiang, Li, Sun, Shi, Li, Ge, Hu, Ye, Tang, Shan,', 'Cheng, Xia and Shi.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has drastically improved survival, but there are significant concerns about cardiovascular toxicity. Cardiovascular risk can be lowered with appropriate baseline evaluation, accurate choice of TKI therapy, improvement of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors through lifestyle modifications, and prescription of drugs for primary or secondary prevention. Which examinations are necessary, and when do they have to be scheduled? How often should a TKI-treated patient undergo which cardiology test or exam? Is there an accurate way to estimate the risk that each TKI may determine a cardiovascular adverse event in a CML patient? In a few words, how can we optimize the cardiovascular risk management in CML patients before and during TKI treatment? The aim of this review is to describe cardiac and vascular toxicity of TKIs used for CML treatment according to the most recent literature and to identify unmet clinical needs in cardiovascular risk management and complications in these patients. Regarding the TKI-induced cardiovascular toxicity, the full mechanism is still unclear, but it is accepted that different factors may play different roles: endothelial damage and atherosclerosis, metabolic impairment, hypertensive effect, glomerular impairment, and mast-cell disruption. Preventive strategies are aimed at minimizing cardiovascular risk when CML is diagnosed. Cardio-oncology units in specialized hematology centers may afford a personalized and multidisciplinary approach to the patient, optimizing the balance between treatment of the neoplasm and management of cardiovascular risk.","['Santoro, Marco', 'Mancuso, Salvatrice', 'Accurso, Vincenzo', 'Di Lisi, Daniela', 'Novo, Giuseppina', 'Siragusa, Sergio']","['Santoro M', 'Mancuso S', 'Accurso V', 'Di Lisi D', 'Novo G', 'Siragusa S']","['Department of Surgical, Oncological and Stomatological Disciplines, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Health Promotion, Mother and Child Care, Internal Medicine and Medical Specialties, PROMISE, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Health Promotion, Mother and Child Care, Internal Medicine and Medical Specialties, PROMISE, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, University Hospital ""Paolo Giaccone"", Palermo, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, University Hospital ""Paolo Giaccone"", Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Cardiology, University Hospital Policlinico ""Paolo Giaccone"", Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Health Promotion, Mother and Child Care, Internal Medicine and Medical Specialties, PROMISE, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Cardiology, University Hospital Policlinico ""Paolo Giaccone"", Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Health Promotion, Mother and Child Care, Internal Medicine and Medical Specialties, PROMISE, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210705,Switzerland,Front Physiol,Frontiers in physiology,101549006,,,,PMC8287514,['NOTNLM'],"['cardio-oncology', 'cardiovascular events', 'cardiovascular risk', 'chronic myelocytic leukemia', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitions therapy']",2021/07/23 06:00,2021/07/23 06:01,['2021/07/22 06:31'],"['2021/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/22 06:31 [entrez]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphys.2021.675811 [doi]'],epublish,Front Physiol. 2021 Jul 5;12:675811. doi: 10.3389/fphys.2021.675811. eCollection 2021.,675811,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Santoro, Mancuso, Accurso, Di Lisi, Novo and Siragusa.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the therapies that can be used for leukostasis in acute myeloid leukemia is leukapheresis. However, whether leukapheresis can provide better survival benefit when compared with patients not receiving leukapheresis is still unclear. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the effect of chemotherapy plus leukapheresis combination versus chemotherapy only on 28-day survival of acute myeloid leukemia patients with leukostasis. Methods: This study was a dual-center retrospective cohort using secondary data from medical records collected from November 2018 to March 2019. Inclusion criteria were adult patients aged 18 years old or above, diagnosed with acute leukemia with hyperleukocytosis status defined by WBC count greater than 100,000/uL, and with symptoms of leukostasis. One-month survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier curve method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were then conducted using Cox proportional hazards model to obtain value of hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: A total of 38 patients were obtained for analysis. The median overall survival was 25 days (95% CI: 17.001-32.999 days) in the chemotherapy only group and 20 days (95% CI: 1.497-38.503) in the chemotherapy with leukapheresis group. The use of leukapheresis did not affect 28-day survival (HR: 1.140; 95% CI: 0.396-3.283; p value: 0.809) and 7-day survival (HR: 1.073; 95% CI: 0.277-4.152; p value: 0.919). In the multivariate analysis, age >/=60 years, blast percentage >/=90%, creatinine >/=1.4 mg/dL, and presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation were associated with worse 28-day survival. Conclusion: AML patients with leukostasis who received both chemotherapy and leukapheresis did not have better 28-day survival and 7-day survival when compared with patients receiving chemotherapy only. Old age, high blast percentage, high creatinine, and presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation were prognostic factors for worse 28-day survival.","['Rinaldi, Ikhwan', 'Sari, Resti Mulya', 'Tedhy, Vanya Utami', 'Winston, Kevin']","['Rinaldi I', 'Sari RM', 'Tedhy VU', 'Winston K']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Cipto Mangunkusumo National General Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Dharmais National Cancer Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2667-1999'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210714,New Zealand,J Blood Med,Journal of blood medicine,101550884,,,,PMC8286962,['NOTNLM'],"['chemotherapy', 'hyperleukocytosis', 'leukapheresis', 'leukemia', 'leukostasis', 'survival']",2021/07/23 06:00,2021/07/23 06:01,['2021/07/22 06:30'],"['2021/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/22 06:30 [entrez]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/JBM.S312140 [doi]', '312140 [pii]']",epublish,J Blood Med. 2021 Jul 14;12:623-633. doi: 10.2147/JBM.S312140. eCollection 2021.,623-633,['(c) 2021 Rinaldi et al.'],,,,['All authors declare that they have no conflict of interests for this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mouse showed progressive anemia and rough respiratory movement. Macroscopically, the spleen was discolored and enlarged. Histologically, the bone marrow of the sternum and femur was highly cellular and almost exclusively filled with neoplastic cells. The nuclei of neoplastic cells were large, oval to slightly irregular in shape, and a small number of cells had kidney- or ring-shaped nuclei. Neoplastic cells extensively infiltrated the organs, and the spleen and liver were prominently involved. Immunohistochemically, a large population of neoplastic cells in the red pulp of the spleen and sinusoid of the liver was positive for myeloperoxidase. Based on the histological features, this case was diagnosed with granulocytic leukemia. This novel information on spontaneous tumors may be helpful for the appropriate use of this mouse strain in further research.","['Akane, Hirotoshi', 'Okuda, Sumiko', 'Oishi, Yasuaki', 'Ichikawa, Atsuko', 'Tabata, Hajime']","['Akane H', 'Okuda S', 'Oishi Y', 'Ichikawa A', 'Tabata H']","['CMIC Pharma Science Co., Ltd., 10221 Kobuchisawa-cho, Hokuto-shi, Yamanashi 408-0044, Japan.', 'CMIC Pharma Science Co., Ltd., 10221 Kobuchisawa-cho, Hokuto-shi, Yamanashi 408-0044, Japan.', 'CMIC Pharma Science Co., Ltd., 10221 Kobuchisawa-cho, Hokuto-shi, Yamanashi 408-0044, Japan.', 'CMIC Pharma Science Co., Ltd., 10221 Kobuchisawa-cho, Hokuto-shi, Yamanashi 408-0044, Japan.', 'CMIC Pharma Science Co., Ltd., 10221 Kobuchisawa-cho, Hokuto-shi, Yamanashi 408-0044, Japan.']",,['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210418,Japan,J Toxicol Pathol,Journal of toxicologic pathology,9306408,,,,PMC8280305,['NOTNLM'],"['NOG mouse', 'granulocytic leukemia', 'spontaneous tumor']",2021/07/23 06:00,2021/07/23 06:01,['2021/07/22 06:29'],"['2021/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/22 06:29 [entrez]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1293/tox.2020-0092 [doi]', '2020-0092 [pii]']",ppublish,J Toxicol Pathol. 2021 Jul;34(3):241-244. doi: 10.1293/tox.2020-0092.

Here, we demonstrate decreased CD4(+) Th cells, increased Treg and G-type MDSC, and upregulation of immune checkpoints on effector/regulatory and CD138(+) cells in MM patients, compared MGUS/SMM patients or healthy individuals. Among the checkpoints profiled, LAG3 was most highly expressed on proliferating CD4(+) Th and CD8(+) Tc cells in MM patients BMMC and PBMC. Treatment with antibody targeting LAG3 significantly enhanced T cells proliferation and activities against MM. XBP1/CD138/CS1-specific CTL generated in vitro displayed anti-MM activity, which was further enhanced following anti-LAG3 treatment, within the antigen-specific memory T cells. Treg and G-type MDSC weakly express LAG3 and were minimally impacted by anti-LAG3. CD138(+) MM cells express GAL-3, a ligand for LAG3, and anti-GAL-3 treatment increased MM-specific responses, as observed for anti-LAG3. Finally, we demonstrate checkpoint inhibitor treatment evokes non-targeted checkpoints as a cause of resistance and propose combination therapeutic strategies to overcome this resistance. These studies identify and validate blockade of LAG3/GAL-3, alone or in combination with immune strategies including XBP1/CD138/CS1 multipeptide vaccination, to enhance anti-tumor responses and improve patient outcome in MM.","['Bae, Jooeun', 'Accardi, Fabrizio', 'Hideshima, Teru', 'Tai, Yu-Tzu', 'Prabhala, Rao', 'Shambley, Aaron', 'Wen, Kenneth', 'Rowell, Sean', 'Richardson, Paul G', 'Munshi, Nikhil C', 'Anderson, Kenneth C']","['Bae J', 'Accardi F', 'Hideshima T', 'Tai YT', 'Prabhala R', 'Shambley A', 'Wen K', 'Rowell S', 'Richardson PG', 'Munshi NC', 'Anderson KC']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA. jooeun_bae@dfci.harvard.edu.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. jooeun_bae@dfci.harvard.edu.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8922-9703', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6199-3569', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7426-8865', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7344-9795', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6418-0886']",['eng'],['R01 CA050947/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20210721,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,,,,,2021/07/23 06:00,2021/07/23 06:00,['2021/07/22 06:20'],"['2020/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/22 06:20 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-021-01301-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-021-01301-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2022 Jan;36(1):138-154. doi: 10.1038/s41375-021-01301-6.

Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade therapy, drives immune-mediated cell death and has greatly improved treatment outcomes for some patients with cancer, but it often fails clinically. Its success relies on the cytokines and cytotoxic functions of effector immune cells to bypass the resistance to cell death and eliminate cancer cells. However, the specific cytokines capable of inducing cell death in tumors and the mechanisms that connect cytokines to cell death across cancer cell types remain unknown. In this study, we analyzed expression of several cytokines that are modulated in tumors and found correlations between cytokine expression and mortality. Of several cytokines tested for their ability to kill cancer cells, only TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma together were able to induce cell death in 13 distinct human cancer cell lines derived from colon and lung cancer, melanoma, and leukemia. Further evaluation of the specific programmed cell death pathways activated by TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in these cancer lines identified PANoptosis, a form of inflammatory cell death that was previously shown to be activated by contemporaneous engagement of components from pyroptosis, apoptosis, and/or necroptosis. Specifically, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma triggered activation of gasdermin D, gasdermin E, caspase-8, caspase-3, caspase-7, and MLKL. Furthermore, the intratumoral administration of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma suppressed the growth of transplanted xenograft tumors in an NSG mouse model. Overall, this study shows that PANoptosis, induced by synergism of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, is an important mechanism to kill cancer cells and suppress tumor growth that could be therapeutically targeted.","['Malireddi, R K Subbarao', 'Karki, Rajendra', 'Sundaram, Balamurugan', 'Kancharana, Balabhaskararao', 'Lee, SangJoon', 'Samir, Parimal', 'Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi']","['Malireddi RKS', 'Karki R', 'Sundaram B', 'Kancharana B', 'Lee S', 'Samir P', 'Kanneganti TD']","[""Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN Thirumala-Devi.Kanneganti@stjude.org.""]","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7655-5713', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6395-6443']",['eng'],"['R35 CA253095/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI101935/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI124346/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AI101935/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI160179/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR056296/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20210721,United States,Immunohorizons,ImmunoHorizons,101708159,,IM,,PMC8522052,,,2021/07/23 06:00,2021/07/23 06:00,['2021/07/22 05:44'],"['2021/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/01/21 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/07/22 05:44 [entrez]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['immunohorizons.2100059 [pii]', '10.4049/immunohorizons.2100059 [doi]']",epublish,Immunohorizons. 2021 Jul 21;5(7):568-580. doi: 10.4049/immunohorizons.2100059.,568-580,['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.'],,['2022/01/21 00:00'],,,,['NIHMS1739624'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate that NAD(+) metabolism enables acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to evade apoptosis, another hallmark of cancer stem cells. We integrated whole-genome CRISPR screening and pan-cancer genetic dependency mapping to identify NAMPT and NMNAT1 as AML dependencies governing NAD(+) biosynthesis. While both NAMPT and NMNAT1 were required for AML, the presence of NAD(+) precursors bypassed the dependence of AML on NAMPT but not NMNAT1, pointing to NMNAT1 as a gatekeeper of NAD(+) biosynthesis. Deletion of NMNAT1 reduced nuclear NAD(+), activated p53, and increased venetoclax sensitivity. Conversely, increased NAD(+) biosynthesis promoted venetoclax resistance. Unlike leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in both murine and human AML xenograft models, NMNAT1 was dispensable for hematopoietic stem cells and hematopoiesis. Our findings identify NMNAT1 as a previously unidentified therapeutic target that maintains NAD(+) for AML progression and chemoresistance.","['Shi, Xiangguo', 'Jiang, Yajian', 'Kitano, Ayumi', 'Hu, Tianyuan', 'Murdaugh, Rebecca L', 'Li, Yuan', 'Hoegenauer, Kevin A', 'Chen, Rui', 'Takahashi, Koichi', 'Nakada, Daisuke']","['Shi X', 'Jiang Y', 'Kitano A', 'Hu T', 'Murdaugh RL', 'Li Y', 'Hoegenauer KA', 'Chen R', 'Takahashi K', 'Nakada D']","['Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Program in Developmental Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Program in Developmental Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'School of Public Health, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA. nakada@bcm.edu.', 'Program in Developmental Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8334-5706', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9950-8634', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9640-6130', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4387-9735', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8027-9659', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6010-7094']",['eng'],"['R01 DK107413/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA193235/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI036211/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR024574/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 DK112542/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK060445/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20210721,United States,Sci Adv,Science advances,101653440,,IM,,PMC8294764,,,2021/07/23 06:00,2021/07/23 06:00,['2021/07/22 05:43'],"['2020/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/22 05:43 [entrez]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['7/30/eabf3895 [pii]', '10.1126/sciadv.abf3895 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Adv. 2021 Jul 21;7(30). pii: 7/30/eabf3895. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.abf3895.

Sustained tonic signaling or strong activation drives CART cell differentiation and exhaustion, which limit the therapeutic efficacy and persistence of CART cells. Here, we identified dasatinib as the optimal candidate to prevent or reverse both CD28/CART and 4-1BB/CART cell differentiation and exhaustion during ex vivo expansion, which profoundly enhanced the therapeutic efficacy and in vivo persistence. Moreover, strong activation-induced CART cells differentiation, exhaustion and apoptosis driven by CD3/CD28 stimulation or antigen exposure were dramatically prevented or reversed by dasatinib treatment. Mechanistically, dasatinib markedly reduced the phosphorylation of Src and Lck, and downregulated the expression of genes involved in CAR signaling pathways, which resulted in the optimization of cell differentiation, exhaustion and apoptosis-related gene expression. Our study proposes a promising pharmacological approach for optimizing CART cells manufacture, and provides an experimental basis for reinvigorating CART cells in clinical application.","['Zhang,

SM can be indolent (ISM), smoldering (SSM) and advanced (AdvSM), the latter characterized by organ damage resulting from infiltrating neoplastic mast cells. The vast majority of cases are indolent, with near-normal life expectancy, although symptoms can be severe. AdvSM, comprising aggressive SM, SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm and mast cell leukemia, however, carries a poor prognosis. Avapritinib is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of mutant KIT. AREAS COVERED: We provide an overview of SM, including the current therapeutic landscape, and discuss avapritinib in detail: its chemistry and discovery, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data, current approval status and safety and efficacy profiles in both advanced and non-advanced SM. EXPERT OPINION: With a response rate of 75% amongst evaluable patients with AdvSM and marked reductions observed in measures of mast cell and disease burden, avapritinib stands out as a highly effective targeted therapy for this mutant KIT-driven disease. Cognitive impairment may occur, and intracranial hemorrhage has been reported, particularly in association with severe thrombocytopenia. Early results in patients with ISM/SSM are encouraging. Avapritinib is now approved in the US for AdvSM.","['Bose, Prithviraj', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Bose P', 'Verstovsek S']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4343-5712', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6912-8569']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210806,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Avapritinib', 'advanced sm', 'aggressive sm (asm)', 'c-findings', 'indolent sm', 'kit d816v', 'mast cell leukemia (mcl)', 'midostaurin', 'sm with an associated hematologic neoplasm (sm-ahn)', 'systemic mastocytosis (sm)']",2021/07/23 06:00,2021/07/23 06:00,['2021/07/22 05:31'],"['2021/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/22 05:31 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2021.1959315 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2021 Aug;14(8):687-696. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2021.1959315.

We recently reported that tyrosine phosphorylation activates IDH1 R132H mutant in AML cells. Here, we show that mutant IDH2 (mIDH2) R140Q commonly has K413 acetylation, which negatively regulates mIDH2 activity in human AML cells by attenuating dimerization and blocking binding of substrate (alpha-ketoglutarate) and cofactor (NADPH). Mechanistically, K413 acetylation of mitochondrial mIDH2 is achieved through a series of hierarchical phosphorylation events mediated by tyrosine kinase FLT3, which phosphorylates mIDH2 to recruit upstream mitochondrial acetyltransferase ACAT1 and simultaneously activates ACAT1 and inhibits upstream mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 through tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, we found that the intrinsic enzyme activity of mIDH2 is much higher than mIDH1, thus the inhibitory K413 acetylation optimizes leukemogenic ability of mIDH2 in AML cells by both producing sufficient 2-HG for transformation and avoiding cytotoxic accumulation of intracellular 2-HG.","['Chen, Dong', 'Xia, Siyuan', 'Zhang, Rukang', 'Li, Yuancheng', 'Famulare, Christopher A', 'Fan, Hao', 'Wu, Rong', 'Wang, Mei', 'Zhu, Allen C', 'Elf, Shannon E', 'Su, Rui', 'Dong, Lei', 'Arellano, Martha', 'Blum, William G', 'Mao, Hui', 'Lonial, Sagar', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Odenike, Olatoyosi', 'Le Beau, Michelle', 'Boggon, Titus J', 'He, Chuan', 'Chen, Jianjun', 'Gao, Xue', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Chen, Jing']","['Chen D', 'Xia S', 'Zhang R', 'Li Y', 'Famulare CA', 'Fan H', 'Wu R', 'Wang M', 'Zhu AC', 'Elf SE', 'Su R', 'Dong L', 'Arellano M', 'Blum WG', 'Mao H', 'Lonial S', 'Stock W', 'Odenike O', 'Le Beau M', 'Boggon TJ', 'He C', 'Chen J', 'Gao X', 'Levine RL', 'Chen J']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA; Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA; Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA; Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA; Section of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA; Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA; Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA; Section of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA; Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA; Section of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA; Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'The Ben May Department for Cancer Research, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA; Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA; Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA; Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA; Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Section of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Section of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Section of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA; Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA; Section of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.

We evaluated real-world treatment patterns and outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML receiving HSCT after complete remission with first-line chemotherapy. METHODS: A global, retrospective chart review to evaluate maintenance therapy and outcomes in patients with FLT3-mutated AML after HSCT. RESULTS: Data from 1208 charts from eight countries showed that most patients (n = 765 [63.3%]) received no maintenance therapy after HSCT, 219 (18.1%) received FLT3 inhibitor maintenance therapy, and 224 (18.5%) received other types of maintenance therapy. No systematic differences were observed in healthcare resource utilization across the three groups. Clinical benefit was observed with FLT3 inhibitor maintenance over no maintenance therapy with relapse-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.57 [95% CI 0.34-0.94], P < .05). FLT3 inhibitor and other maintenance also demonstrated overall survival benefit over no maintenance (adjusted HR 0.50 [95% CI 0.28-0.89] and 0.46 [95% CI 0.23-0.91], respectively; both P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Real-world maintenance therapies after HSCT in patients with FLT3-mutated AML were heterogeneous. While overall use of healthcare resources was not significantly increased in patients receiving maintenance therapy versus those who did not, clinical outcomes were improved.","['Griffin, James D', 'Song, Yan', 'Yang, Hongbo', 'Freimark, Jonathan', 'Shah, Manasee V']","['Griffin JD', 'Song Y', 'Yang H', 'Freimark J', 'Shah MV']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Analysis Group, Inc., Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Analysis Group, Inc., Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Analysis Group, Inc., Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Astellas Pharma, Inc., Northbrook, Illinois, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Astellas Pharma, Inc.']",['Journal Article'],20210811,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute', 'health care', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'leukemia', 'myeloid', 'outcome assessment']",2021/07/22 06:00,2021/07/22 06:00,['2021/07/21 17:38'],"['2021/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/21 17:38 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13692 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2021 Nov;107(5):553-565. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13692.

Mutations in this splicing factor mediate abnormal splicing associated with exon skipping events, including EZH2 as a crucial target. While SRSF2 mutations are enriched in secondary AML and associated with worse outcomes following chemotherapy consolidation, very little is known about the associated biological and clinical implications in AML patients consolidated with allogeneic hematopoietic stemcell transplantation (HSCT). Here we retrospectively analyzed 263 adult AML patients who received an allogeneic HSCT regarding the biological and clinical implications of the SRSF2 mutation status at diagnosis and in morphologic remission at HSCT. We found 12.5% of the patients to be SRSF2 mutated at diagnosis. Mutated patients had increased EZH2 missplicing events with P95H likely driving this pathobiology most effectively. However, the amount of EZH2 missplicing events, as a functional surrogate marker did not associate with relevant biological or clinical characteristics. We observed a persistence of mutations in remission before HSCT in the majority (93%) of SRSF2 mutated AML patients. Importantly, the variant allele frequency (VAF) levels of SRSF2 mutations in remission at HSCT did not correlate with outcomes following HSCT consolidation, limiting the applicability of SRSF2 mutations as a marker for residual AML disease. Following allogeneic HSCT SRSF2 mutated AML patients experienced a 2-year overall survival of 77%, indicating that SRSF2 mutated AML patients may benefit from HSCT consolidation.","['Grimm, Juliane', 'Jentzsch, Madlen', 'Bill, Marius', 'Backhaus, Donata', 'Brauer, Dominic', 'Kupper, Johannes', 'Schulz, Julia', 'Franke, Georg-Nikolaus', 'Vucinic, Vladan', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Schwind, Sebastian']","['Grimm J', 'Jentzsch M', 'Bill M', 'Backhaus D', 'Brauer D', 'Kupper J', 'Schulz J', 'Franke GN', 'Vucinic V', 'Niederwieser D', 'Platzbecker U', 'Schwind S']","['Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology, Cellular Therapy, and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology, Cellular Therapy, and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology, Cellular Therapy, and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology, Cellular Therapy, and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology, Cellular Therapy, and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology, Cellular Therapy, and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology, Cellular Therapy, and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology, Cellular Therapy, and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology, Cellular Therapy, and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology, Cellular Therapy, and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology, Cellular Therapy, and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology, Cellular Therapy, and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2270-0804', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1315-2332']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210806,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['147153-65-9 (SRSF2 protein, human)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors/*genetics', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,2021/07/22 06:00,2021/09/28 06:00,['2021/07/21 17:37'],"['2021/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/21 17:37 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.26298 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2021 Oct 1;96(10):1287-1294. doi: 10.1002/ajh.26298.

Here, we introduce sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 6 (Siglec-6) as a novel target for CAR T cells in AML. We designed a Siglec-6-specific CAR with a targeting domain derived from the human monoclonal antibody JML-1. We found that Siglec-6 is commonly expressed on AML cell lines and primary AML blasts, including the subpopulation of AML stem cells. Treatment with Siglec-6 CAR T cells confers specific antileukemia reactivity that correlates with Siglec-6 expression in preclinical models, including induction of complete remission in a xenograft AML model in immunodeficient mice (NSG/U937). In addition, we confirmed Siglec-6 expression on transformed B cells in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and specific anti-CLL reactivity of Siglec-6 CAR T cells in vitro. Of particular interest, we found that Siglec-6 is not detectable on normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and that treatment with Siglec-6 CAR T cells does not affect their viability and lineage differentiation in colony-formation assays. These data suggest that Siglec-6 CAR T-cell therapy may be used to effectively treat AML without the need for subsequent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In mature normal hematopoietic cells, we detected Siglec-6 in a proportion of memory (and naive) B cells and basophilic granulocytes, suggesting the potential for limited on-target/off-tumor reactivity. The lack of expression of Siglec-6 on normal HSPCs is a key to differentiating it from other Siglec family members (eg, Siglec-3 [CD33]) and other CAR target antigens (eg, CD123) that are under investigation in AML, and it warrants the clinical investigation of Siglec-6 CAR T-cell therapy.","['Jetani, Hardikkumar', 'Navarro-Bailon, Almudena', 'Maucher, Marius', 'Frenz, Silke', 'Verbruggen, Christina', 'Yeguas, Ana', 'Vidriales, Maria Belen', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'Rial Saborido, Judit', 'Kraus, Sabrina', 'Mestermann, Katrin', 'Thomas, Simone', 'Bonig, Halvard', 'Luu, Maik', 'Monjezi, Razieh', 'Mougiakakos, Dimitrios', 'Sauer, Markus', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Hudecek, Michael']","['Jetani H', 'Navarro-Bailon A', 'Maucher M', 'Frenz S', 'Verbruggen C', 'Yeguas A', 'Vidriales MB', 'Gonzalez M', 'Rial Saborido J', 'Kraus S', 'Mestermann K', 'Thomas S', 'Bonig H', 'Luu M', 'Monjezi R', 'Mougiakakos D', 'Sauer M', 'Einsele H', 'Hudecek M']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca-Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CB16/12/00233), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Universidad de Salamanca-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Lehrstuhl fur Biotechnologie und Biophysik, Biozentrum, Universitat Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca-Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CB16/12/00233), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Universidad de Salamanca-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca-Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CB16/12/00233), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Universidad de Salamanca-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca-Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CB16/12/00233), Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Universidad de Salamanca-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Medizinische Klinik 5, Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Klinik und Poliklinik fur Innere Medizin III, Universitatsklinikum Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Regensburger Centrum fur Interventionelle Immunologie, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institut fur Transfusionsmedizin und Immunhamatologie, Goethe Universitat Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany;

Here, six data mining algorithms including Decision Tree, Random Forrest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, W-Bayes Net, and Gradient Boosted Tree (GBT) are employed for the detection model and implemented using the common data mining tool RapidMiner and open-source R package. To improve the predictive ability of our model, a set of features were selected by employing multiple feature selection methods. The accuracy of classification was obtained using 10-fold cross-validation for the various combinations of the feature selection methods and machine learning algorithms.

The molecular mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we report that p53, served as a tumor suppressor, plays a critical role in regulating the function of WT1 in AML. For details, we performed a meta-analysis on 1131 AML cases, showing that WT1 gene mutation and TP53 gene exhibited a mutually exclusive predisposition in AML. p53 can be recruited to the promoter region of WT1's target genes to modulate their expression by physically interacting with WT1. The AML-derived p53 mutation (p53(R248Q)) can disrupt the interaction between WT1 and p53, resulting in the loss of modulation of WT1's target genes. Furthermore, wild-type p53 maintained the anti-proliferation activity of WT1 in AML cells. In contrast, WT1 promoted AML cell proliferation in the absence of p53 (or mutated p53). In conclusion, we demonstrated a novel explanation of the controversial function of WT1 in AML. These results provided a mechanism by which WT1 inhibited AML cell proliferation in a p53-dependent manner.","['Yao, Yiyun', 'Chai, Xingxing', 'Gong, Chen', 'Zou, Lifang']","['Yao Y', 'Chai X', 'Gong C', 'Zou L']","[""Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200011, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second People's Hospital of Lianyungang City, Jiangsu 222000, China."", ""Department of Geriatric Medicine, The Second People's Hospital of Lianyungang City, Jiangsu 222000, China."", ""Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200011, China.""]",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210721,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,,IM,,PMC8409780,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*WT1', '*p53', '*proliferation']",2021/07/22 06:00,2021/07/22 06:00,['2021/07/21 17:20'],"['2022/07/21 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/21 17:20 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15384101.2021.1951938 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2021 Aug;20(16):1552-1560. doi: 10.1080/15384101.2021.1951938.

Herein, various 3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]quinoline-containing compounds were rapidly assembled via the Doebner-Povarov multicomponent reaction from the readily available 5-aminoindazole, ketones, and heteroaromatic aldehydes in good yields. The most active compounds potently inhibit the recombinant FLT3 kinase and its mutant forms with nanomolar IC50 values. Docking studies with the FLT3 kinase showed a type I binding mode, where the 3H-pyrazolo group interacts with Cys694 in the hinge region. The compounds blocked the proliferation of AML cell lines harboring oncogenic FLT3-ITD mutations with remarkable IC50 values, which were comparable to the approved FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib. The compounds also inhibited the growth of leukemia in a mouse-disseminated AML model, and hence, the novel 3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]quinoline-containing kinase inhibitors are potential lead compounds to develop into anticancer agents, especially for kinase-driven cancers.","['Dayal, Neetu', 'Reznickova, Eva', 'Hernandez, Delmis E', 'Perina, Miroslav', 'Torregrosa-Allen, Sandra', 'Elzey, Bennett D', 'Skerlova, Jana', 'Ajani, Haresh', 'Djukic, Stefan', 'Vojackova, Veronika', 'Lepsik, Martin', 'Rezacova, Pavlina', 'Krystof, Vladimir', 'Jorda, Radek', 'Sintim, Herman O']","['Dayal N', 'Reznickova E', 'Hernandez DE', 'Perina M', 'Torregrosa-Allen S', 'Elzey BD', 'Skerlova J', 'Ajani H', 'Djukic S', 'Vojackova V', 'Lepsik M', 'Rezacova P', 'Krystof V', 'Jorda R', 'Sintim HO']","['Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, United States.', 'Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Palacky University Olomouc, Slechtitelu 27, Olomouc 78371, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, United States.', 'Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Palacky University Olomouc, Slechtitelu 27, Olomouc 78371, Czech Republic.', 'Purdue University Center for Cancer Research, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, United States.', 'Purdue University Center for Cancer Research, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, United States.', 'Department of Comparative Pathobiology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, United States.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Flemingovo Nam. 2, Prague 16610, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Videnska 1083, Prague 14220, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Flemingovo Nam. 2, Prague 16610, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Flemingovo Nam. 2, Prague 16610, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Palacky University Olomouc, Slechtitelu 27, Olomouc 78371, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Flemingovo Nam. 2, Prague 16610, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Flemingovo Nam. 2, Prague 16610, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Videnska 1083, Prague 14220, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Palacky University Olomouc, Slechtitelu 27, Olomouc 78371, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Palacky University Olomouc, Slechtitelu 27, Olomouc 78371, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, United States.', 'Institute for Drug Discovery, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, United States.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1223-3819', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5838-2118', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4905-7126']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20210721,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,,,2021/07/22 06:00,2021/07/22 06:00,['2021/07/21 17:16'],"['2021/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/21 17:16 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00330 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2021 Aug 12;64(15):10981-10996. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00330.

34288585,NLM,In-Process,,20211124,2052-1707 (Electronic) 2052-1707 (Linking),9,4,2021 Aug,Testicular disposition of clofarabine in rats is dependent on equilibrative nucleoside transporters.,10.1002/prp2.831 [doi],"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children and adolescents. Although the 5-year survival rate is high, some patients respond poorly to chemotherapy or have recurrence in locations such as the testis. The blood-testis barrier (BTB) can prevent complete eradication by limiting chemotherapeutic access and lead to testicular relapse unless a chemotherapeutic is a substrate of drug transporters present at this barrier. Equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) 1 and ENT2 facilitate the movement of substrates across the BTB. Clofarabine is a nucleoside analog used to treat relapsed or refractory ALL. This study investigated the role of ENTs in the testicular disposition of clofarabine. Pharmacological inhibition of the ENTs by 6-nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) was used to determine ENT contribution to clofarabine transport in primary rat Sertoli cells, in human Sertoli cells, and across the rat BTB. The presence of NBMPR decreased clofarabine uptake by 40% in primary rat Sertoli cells (p = .0329) and by 53% in a human Sertoli cell line (p = .0899). Rats treated with 10 mg/kg intraperitoneal (IP) injection of the NBMPR prodrug, 6-nitrobenzylthioinosine 5'-monophosphate (NBMPR-P), or vehicle, followed by an intravenous (IV) bolus 10 mg/kg dose of clofarabine, showed a trend toward a lower testis concentration of clofarabine than vehicle (1.81 +/- 0.59 vs. 2.65 +/- 0.92 ng/mg tissue; p = .1160). This suggests that ENTs could be important for clofarabine disposition. Clofarabine may be capable of crossing the human BTB, and its potential use as a first-line treatment to avoid testicular relapse should be considered.","['Miller, Siennah R', 'Jilek, Joseph L', 'McGrath, Meghan E', 'Hau, Raymond K', 'Jennings, Erin Q', 'Galligan, James J', 'Wright, Stephen H', 'Cherrington, Nathan J']","['Miller SR', 'Jilek JL', 'McGrath ME', 'Hau RK', 'Jennings EQ', 'Galligan JJ', 'Wright SH', 'Cherrington NJ']","['College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'College of Medicine, Department of Physiology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2575-8059', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4215-9434', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6991-6098', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9840-8140']",['eng'],"['P30 ES006694/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 ES007091/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM123643/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 GM137910/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pharmacol Res Perspect,Pharmacology research & perspectives,101626369,,IM,,PMC8292784,['NOTNLM'],"['*Sertoli cells', '*blood-testis barrier', '*clofarabine', '*nucleoside transporter', '*nucleosides']",2021/07/22 06:00,2021/07/22 06:00,['2021/07/21 13:54'],"['2021/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/21 13:54 [entrez]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/prp2.831 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacol Res Perspect. 2021 Aug;9(4):e00831. doi: 10.1002/prp2.831.,e00831,"['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Here we propose a rapid process for detecting gene fusions whereby FusionPlex RNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) and DNA chromosome genomic array testing (CGAT) are combined for a more efficient approach in the management of patients with B-ALL. METHODS: We performed RNA NGS and CGAT on 28 B-ALL samples and, in four patients, compared fixed cell pellets to paired cryo-preserved samples as a starting material to further assess the utility of cytogenetic fixed pellets for gene expression analysis. RESULTS: Among the fixed specimens, when using alternative techniques as references, including karyotype, fluorescence in situ hybridization, CGAT, and RT-qPCR, fusions were detected by RNA NGS with 100% sensitivity and specificity. In the four paired fixed versus fresh cryopreserved samples, fusions were also 100% concordant. Four of the 28 patients showed mutations that were detected by RNA sequencing and three of four of these mutations had well-known drug resistance implications. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that FusionPlex is a robust and reliable anchored multiplex RNA sequencing platform for use in the detection of fusions in both fresh cryopreserved and cytogenetic fixed pellets. Gene expression data could only be obtained from fresh samples and although limited variant data are available, critical hotspot variants can be determined in conjunction with the fusions.","['Yeung, Cecilia', 'Qu, Xiaoyu', 'Sala-Torra, Olga', 'Woolston, David', 'Radich, Jerry', 'Fang, Min']","['Yeung C', 'Qu X', 'Sala-Torra O', 'Woolston D', 'Radich J', 'Fang M']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6799-2022'],['eng'],['Archer Challenge Grant'],['Journal Article'],20210720,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,,IM,,PMC8366081,['NOTNLM'],"['*RT-qPCR', '*leukemia', '*molecular pathology', '*next-generation sequencing']",2021/07/22 06:00,2021/07/22 06:00,['2021/07/21 13:51'],"['2021/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/21 13:51 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.4101 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2021 Aug;10(16):5629-5642. doi: 10.1002/cam4.4101.

CEBPA-mutant AML may occur with monoallelic (moCEBPA) or biallelic (biCEBPA) mutations, which can be somatic or germline, with each entity impacting prognosis in unique ways. BiCEBPA AML is broadly associated with a favorable prognosis, but differences in the type and location of CEBPA mutations as well as the presence of additional leukemogenic mutations can lead to heterogeneity in survival. Concurrent FLT3-ITD mutations have a well-documented negative effect on survival in adult biCEBPA AML, whereas support for a negative prognostic effect of mutations in TET2, DNMT3A, WT1, CSF3R, ASXL1, and KIT is mixed. NPM1 and GATA2 mutations may have a positive prognostic impact. MoCEBPA AML has similar survival outcomes compared to AML with wild-type CEBPA, and risk stratification is determined by other cytogenetic and molecular findings. Germline CEBPA mutations may lead to familial biCEBPA AML after acquisition of second somatic CEBPA mutation, with variable penetrance and age. BiCEBPA AML in children is likely a favorable-risk diagnosis as it is in adults, but the role of a single CEBPA mutation and the impact of concurrent leukemogenic mutations are not clear in this population. Laboratory evaluation of the CEBPA gene includes PCR-based fragment-length analysis, Sanger sequencing, and next-generation sequencing. Phenotypic analysis using multiparameter flow cytometry can also provide additional data in evaluating CEBPA, helping to assess for the likelihood of mutation presence.","['Mendoza, Hadrian', 'Podoltsev, Nikolai A', 'Siddon, Alexa J']","['Mendoza H', 'Podoltsev NA', 'Siddon AJ']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2372-3653'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Alleles', 'Biomarkers', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Child', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CEBPA', 'flow cytometry', 'molecular diagnosis', 'sequencing']",2021/07/22 06:00,2021/08/10 06:00,['2021/07/21 13:48'],"['2021/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/21 13:48 [entrez]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13517 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2021 Jul;43 Suppl 1:86-95. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13517.,86-95,['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While MPNs-BP typically lack genetic mutations seen in de novo AML, they commonly harbor IDH1/2, SRSF2, ASXL1, and TP53 mutations, similar to the genetic profiles of acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC).","['Chen, Dong', 'Fuda, Franklin', 'Weinberg, Olga']","['Chen D', 'Fuda F', 'Weinberg O']","['Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4250-3891'],['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease Progression', '*Disease Susceptibility', 'Erythrocyte Indices', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*diagnosis/*etiology/metabolism/therapy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL (Philadelphia)-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm', 'Myeloproliferative neoplasm blast phase (MPN-BP)', 'TP53', 'leukemic transformation']",2021/07/22 06:00,2021/08/10 06:00,['2021/07/21 13:48'],"['2021/03/24 00:00 [revised]', '2021/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/21 13:48 [entrez]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13565 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2021 Jul;43 Suppl 1:78-81. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13565.,78-81,['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In order to incorporate novel biomarkers to refine current risk stratification strategies for patients with this subtype, we investigated pretreatment telomere length (TL), which is essential for maintaining genomic stability, in 204 adults with de novo AML (non-acute promyelocytic leukemia). RESULTS: We found that TL measured at diagnosis did not decrease with advancing age in 204 patients with AML (R(2) = 0.001, P = .695). A multivariate analysis demonstrated that short TL was independently associated with an inferior relapse-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 3.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.48-6.41, P = .003); event-free survival (HR 2.14, 95% CI 1.12-4.08, P = .021); and overall survival (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.09-4.67, P = .028) in IRC-AML patients. In addition, IRC-AML patients with short TL also exhibited an increased cumulative incidence of hematologic relapse (HR 2.32, 95% CI 1.08-5.26, P = .032). CONCLUSION: Short TL is an independent prognostic factor for poor prognosis in patients with IRC-AML and may represent a novel mechanism that links genomic stability and disease progression.","['Gu, Runxia', 'Cao, Jingjing', 'Wei, Shuning', 'Gong, Xiaoyuan', 'Wang, Ying', 'Mi, Yingchang', 'Zhang, Junping', 'Qiu, Shaowei', 'Rao, Qing', 'Wang, Min', 'Wei, Hui', 'Wang, Jianxiang']","['Gu R', 'Cao J', 'Wei S', 'Gong X', 'Wang Y', 'Mi Y', 'Zhang J', 'Qiu S', 'Rao Q', 'Wang M', 'Wei H', 'Wang J']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9437-9151'],['eng'],"['81830005/State Key Program of National Natural Science of China', '82000131/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81770181/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81800173/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2019YFC0840605/National Key Research and Development Program of China', '18JCZDJC45000/Tianjin Natural Science Foundation', '2020-I2M-C&T-B-084/CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences']",['Journal Article'],20210721,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Telomere/*genetics', 'Telomere Shortening', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'genomic stability', 'prognosis', 'risk factor', 'telomere']",2021/07/22 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/07/21 13:47'],"['2021/06/20 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/21 13:47 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13665 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2021 Dec;43(6):1510-1515. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13665.

Few studies have addressed the impact of COVID-19 on pediatric patients with cancer in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: Multicenter observational cohort study with prospective records and retrospective analyses starting in April 2020 in 21 pediatric oncology centers distributed throughout Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Patients under 18 years of age who are infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (confirmed diagnosis through reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) while under treatment at pediatric oncology centers. The variables of interest included clinical symptoms, diagnostic and therapeutic measures. The repercussions of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cancer treatment and general prognosis were monitored. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-nine patients were included (median age 6 [4-13] years, 58% male). Of these, 55.9% had acute leukemia and 34.1% had solid tumors. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was diagnosed by RT-PCR. Various laboratory markers were analyzed, but showed no correlation with outcome. Children with low or high BMI for age had lower overall survival (71.4% and 82.6%, respectively) than those with age-appropriate BMI (92.7%) (p = .007). The severity of presentation at diagnosis was significantly associated with outcome (p < .001). Overall mortality in the presence of infection was 12.3% (n = 22). CONCLUSION: In children with cancer and COVID-19, lower BMI was associated with worse prognosis. The mortality in this group of patients (12.3%) was significantly higher than that described in the pediatric population overall ( approximately 1%).","['Corso, Mariana Cristina M', 'Soares, Victor J', 'Amorim, Anna Maria P', 'Cipolotti, Rosana', 'Magalhaes, Isis Maria Q', 'Lins, Mecneide M', 'Forsait, Silvana', 'Silva, Luciana N', 'de Sousa, Ana Virginia L', 'Alves, Nadia G', 'do Prado, Seila I', 'Silva, Klerize Anecely S', 'Carbone, Edna K', 'Brumatti, Melina', 'Santiago, Pablo', 'Pereira, Kaline Maria M O', 'Carlesse, Fabianne A M C', 'Aguiar, Marina G', 'Marques, Rebeca F', 'Rechenmacher, Ciliana', 'Daudt, Liane E', 'Michalowski, Mariana B']","['Corso MCM', 'Soares VJ', 'Amorim AMP', 'Cipolotti R', 'Magalhaes IMQ', 'Lins MM', 'Forsait S', 'Silva LN', 'de Sousa AVL', 'Alves NG', 'do Prado SI', 'Silva KAS', 'Carbone EK', 'Brumatti M', 'Santiago P', 'Pereira KMMO', 'Carlesse FAMC', 'Aguiar MG', 'Marques RF', 'Rechenmacher C', 'Daudt LE', 'Michalowski MB']","['Departamento de Pediatria, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Hospital Oncologico Infantil Octavio Lobo, Belem, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Sergipe, Sao Cristovao, Brazil.', 'Centro de Oncologia de Sergipe Dr. Oswaldo Leite, Aracaju, Brazil.', 'Hospital da Crianca de Brasilia Jose Alencar, Brasilia, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Medicina Integral Professor Fernando Figueira, Recife, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Tratamento do Cancer Infantil - ITACI, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hospital Martagao Gesteira, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo/Instituto de Oncologia Pediatrica - GRAACC, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hospital Infantil Albert Sabin, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Hospital de Cancer de Barretos - Fundacao Pio XII, Barretos, Brazil.', 'Hospital Crianca Conceicao, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Hospital Pequeno Principe, Curitiba, Brazil.', 'Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Associacao Hospitalar Beneficente Sao Vicente de Paulo, Passo Fundo, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Medicina Integral Professor Fernando Figueira, Recife, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo/Instituto de Oncologia Pediatrica - GRAACC, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hospital Infantil Albert Sabin, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Pediatria Translacional, Servico de Pesquisa Experimental, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Pediatria, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Pediatria Translacional, Servico de Pesquisa Experimental, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Pediatria, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Pediatria Translacional, Servico de Pesquisa Experimental, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Unidade de Hematologia e Transplante de Medula Ossea Pediatrica, Servico de Hematologia Clinica, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Pediatria, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Pediatria Translacional, Servico de Pesquisa Experimental, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Servico de Oncologia Pediatrica, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, Brazil.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2178-820X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4022-5952', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9070-2302', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9155-5030', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1321-5807', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9495-6932', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9482-0776']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study']",20210720,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Mass Index', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'COVID-19/*complications/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications/epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2/isolation & purification', 'Survival Analysis']",PMC8441618,['NOTNLM'],"['*BMI', '*COVID-19', '*SARS-CoV-2', '*cancer', '*pediatric oncology']",2021/07/22 06:00,2021/11/04 06:00,['2021/07/21 13:45'],"['2021/05/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/04 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/21 13:45 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.29223 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Dec;68(12):e29223. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29223.

This study was designed to explore CLL B-cells' proteomic profile in order to identify biologic processes affected at an early stage and during disease evolution as stable or progressive. Purified B cells from 11 untreated CLL patients were tested at two time points by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Patients included in the study evolved to either progressive (n = 6) or stable disease (n = 5). First, at an early stage of the disease (Binet stage A), based on the relative abundance levels of 389 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), samples were separated into stable and progressive clusters with the main differentiating factor being the RNA splicing pathway. Next, in order to test how the DEPs affect RNA splicing, a RNA-Seq study was conducted showing 4217 differentially spliced genes between the two clusters. Distinct longitudinal evolutions were observed with predominantly proteomic modifications in the stable CLL group and spliced genes in the progressive CLL group. Splicing events were shown to be six times more frequent in the progressive CLL group. The main aberrant biologic processes controlled by DEPs and spliced genes in the progressive group were cytoskeletal organization, Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, and mitochondrial and inositol phosphate metabolism with a downstream impact on CLL B-cell survival and migration. This study suggests that proteomic profiles at the early stage of CLL can discriminate progressive from stable disease and that RNA splicing dysregulation underlies CLL evolution, which opens new perspectives in terms of biomarkers and therapy.","['Bagacean, Cristina', 'Iuga, Cristina Adela', 'Bordron, Anne', 'Tempescul, Adrian', 'Pralea, Ioana-Ecaterina', 'Bernard, Delphine', 'Cornen, Melanie', 'Bergot, Tiffany', 'Le Dantec, Christelle', 'Brooks, Wesley', 'Saad, Hussam', 'Ianotto, Jean-Christophe', 'Pers, Jacques-Olivier', 'Zdrenghea, Mihnea', 'Berthou, Christian', 'Renaudineau, Yves']","['Bagacean C', 'Iuga CA', 'Bordron A', 'Tempescul A', 'Pralea IE', 'Bernard D', 'Cornen M', 'Bergot T', 'Le Dantec C', 'Brooks W', 'Saad H', 'Ianotto JC', 'Pers JO', 'Zdrenghea M', 'Berthou C', 'Renaudineau Y']","['Univ Brest, INSERM, UMR1227, B Lymphocytes and Autoimmunity, Brest, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Brest, Brest, France.', 'Department of Drug Analysis, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Proteomics and Metabolomics, MedFuture Research Center for Advanced Medicine-MedFUTURE, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Univ Brest, INSERM, UMR1227, B Lymphocytes and Autoimmunity, Brest, France.', 'Univ Brest, INSERM, UMR1227, B Lymphocytes and Autoimmunity, Brest, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Brest, Brest, France.', 'Department of Proteomics and Metabolomics, MedFuture Research Center for Advanced Medicine-MedFUTURE, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Inserm, Univ Brest, EFS, UMR 1078, GGB, Brest, France.', 'Univ Brest, INSERM, UMR1227, B Lymphocytes and Autoimmunity, Brest, France.', 'Inserm, Univ Brest, EFS, UMR 1078, GGB, Brest, France.', 'Univ Brest, INSERM, UMR1227, B Lymphocytes and Autoimmunity, Brest, France.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Brest, Brest, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Brest, Brest, France.', 'Univ Brest, INSERM, UMR1227, B Lymphocytes and Autoimmunity, Brest, France.', '""Iuliu Hatieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Univ Brest, INSERM, UMR1227, B Lymphocytes and Autoimmunity, Brest, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Brest, Brest, France.', 'Univ Brest, INSERM, UMR1227, B Lymphocytes and Autoimmunity, Brest, France.', 'Laboratory of Immunology and Immunotherapy, University Hospital of Brest, Brest, France.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210720,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['cell cycle', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry', 'splicing']",2021/07/22 06:00,2021/07/22 06:00,['2021/07/21 13:22'],"['2021/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/21 13:22 [entrez]']",['10.1002/JLB.4HI0620-392R [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Leukoc Biol. 2021 Jul 20. doi: 10.1002/JLB.4HI0620-392R.,,['(c)2021 Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib is one of the first-in-class molecules for the treatment of B-CLL patients; however, the emerging mechanisms of resistance to ibrutinib call for new therapeutic strategies. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the ability of ibrutinib plus the MDM2-inhibitor nutlin-3 to counteract the tumor microenvironment protective effect. We observed that primary B-CLL cells cultivated in microenvironment mimicking conditions were protected from apoptosis by the up-regulation of c-MYC and of p53. In the same setting, combined treatments with ibrutinib plus nutlin-3 led to significantly higher levels of apoptosis compared to the single treatments, counteracting the c-MYC up-regulation. Moreover, the combination induced high p53 levels and a significant dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, together with BAX cleavage in the more active p18 form and phospho-BAD down-regulation, that are key components of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, enhancing the apoptosis level. Our findings propose a new therapeutic strategy to overcome the tumor microenvironment protection involved in B-CLL resistance to drugs, with possible clinical implications also for other hematologic and solid tumors for which ibrutinib is considered a therapeutic option.","['Rimondi, Erika', 'Melloni, Elisabetta', 'Romani, Arianna', 'Tisato, Veronica', 'Casciano, Fabio', 'Rigolin, Gian Matteo', 'Milani, Daniela', 'Celeghini, Claudio', 'Zauli, Giorgio', 'Secchiero, Paola', 'Voltan, Rebecca']","['Rimondi E', 'Melloni E', 'Romani A', 'Tisato V', 'Casciano F', 'Rigolin GM', 'Milani D', 'Celeghini C', 'Zauli G', 'Secchiero P', 'Voltan R']","['Department of Translational Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Ferrara, 44122 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medicine, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medicine, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medicine, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7829-0824', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8000-6178', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8448-066X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6431-3335', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9540-7801', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6747-3465']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210701,Switzerland,Curr Oncol,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",9502503,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC8293193,['NOTNLM'],"['*BTK inhibitor', '*MDM2 inhibitor', '*apoptosis', '*leukemia', '*p53']",2021/07/22 06:00,2021/09/25 06:00,['2021/07/21 12:47'],"['2021/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/21 12:47 [entrez]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['curroncol28040223 [pii]', '10.3390/curroncol28040223 [doi]']",epublish,Curr Oncol. 2021 Jul 1;28(4):2439-2451. doi: 10.3390/curroncol28040223.,2439-2451,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As recent studies have demonstrated that deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is associated with drug resistance in cancers, correcting the deregulation of miRNAs represents a promising strategy to reverse acquired resistance in NSCLC. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the functional role of miR-15b in cisplatin resistance in NSCLC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cisplatin-resistant PC9 and A549 NSCLC cell lines (PC9-R and A549-R) were established through long-term exposure to cisplatin. Differences in miR-15b expression between cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cell lines and their parental cell lines were identified through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The effect of anti-miR-15b on the sensitivity of PC9-R and A549-R to cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity was evaluated using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays. Regulation of GSK-3beta by miR-15b was confirmed with luciferase reporter assays. Cell apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were measured using flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: In PC9-R and A549-R cells, miR-15b was significantly overexpressed. However, knockdown of miR-15b clearly reduced cisplatin resistance in PC9-R and A549-R cells. Researching the mechanism, we proved that GSK-3beta was the target of miR-15b. Knockdown of miR-15b significantly increased the expression GSK-3beta and thus promoted the degradation of MCL-1, which is a key anti-apoptosis protein. As a result, anti-miR-15b expanded the cisplatin-induced apoptosis in cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cells. CONCLUSIONS: Knockdown of miR-15b partially reversed cisplatin resistance in NSCLC cells through the GSK-3beta/MCL-1 pathway.","['Lu, Tianjian', 'Lu, Weiping', 'Jia, Chunyi', 'Lou, Shanguang', 'Zhang, Yan']","['Lu T', 'Lu W', 'Jia C', 'Lou S', 'Zhang Y']","['Department of Thoracic Surgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Changchun Tumor Hospital, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Jilin Tumor Hospital, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Changchun Tumor Hospital, China.', 'Department of Anesthesia, Nanhua University, Hengyang, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Poland,Adv Clin Exp Med,Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,101138582,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', '*Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics', '*MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['GSK-3beta', 'MCL-1', 'NSCLC', 'cisplatin', 'miR-15b']",2021/07/22 06:00,2021/09/01 06:00,['2021/07/21 06:47'],"['2021/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/21 06:47 [entrez]']",['10.17219/acem/135701 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Clin Exp Med. 2021 Aug;30(8):849-857. doi: 10.17219/acem/135701.,849-857,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the frequency of childhood leukemias might be partially attributable to some diseases (accounting for a small fraction of cases) or ionizing radiation, the role of heavy metals has not been assessed. The objective of our study was to assess the potential association between levels of cadmium (Cd) and lead (PB) in soil and childhood leukemias incidence. We conducted a population-based case-control study of childhood leukaemia in Spain, covering 2897 incident cases gathered from the Spanish Registry of Childhood Tumours and including 14 Spanish Regions with a total population of 5,307,433 children (period 1996-2015). Cd and Pb bioavailable levels at every children's home address were estimated using data from the Geochemical Atlas of Spain. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs); we included as covariates: sex, rurality, employment rate and socioeconomic status. Metal levels were analysed according to two definitions: as continuous variable assuming linearity and as categorical variables to explore a potentially nonlinear association (quantiles). Increases in both Cd and Pb topsoil levels were associated with increased probability of childhood leukemias incidence. The results for the models with the continuous variables showed that a unit increase on the topsoil level was associated with an OR of 1.11 for Cd (95%CI 1.00-1.24) and an OR of 1.10 for Pb (95%CI 0.99-1.21). Our study may point towards a possible link between residential Cd and Pb topsoil levels and the probability of childhood leukemias incidence. Residing in a location with the highest concentrations of these heavy metals compared to those locations with the lowest could increase the risk around a 20%, for both Cd and Pb.","['Asenjo, Santiago', 'Nunez, Olivier', 'Segu-Tell, Jordi', 'Pardo Romaguera, Elena', 'Canete Nieto, Adela', 'Martin-Mendez, Ivan', 'Bel-Lan, Alejandro', 'Garcia-Perez, Javier', 'Carceles-Alvarez, Alberto', 'Ortega-Garcia, Juan Antonio', 'Ramis, Rebeca']","['Asenjo S', 'Nunez O', 'Segu-Tell J', 'Pardo Romaguera E', 'Canete Nieto A', 'Martin-Mendez I', 'Bel-Lan A', 'Garcia-Perez J', 'Carceles-Alvarez A', 'Ortega-Garcia JA', 'Ramis R']","['C.H.U.

Generally, the biological activities of compounds are highly involved in the interaction between protein and compounds in blood plasma. The objective was to investigate the interaction of 4-HBA or VA with human serum albumin (HSA) and their anti-proliferation properties on doxorubicin-sensitive K562 and doxorubicin-resistant K562/Dox leukemia cells. The protein binding of 4-HBA or VA to HSA was investigated using fluorescence quenching at temperatures of 298 and 310 Kelvin (K) under the pH of 6.0, 7.4, and 8.0 conditions. The effect of 4-HBA and VA on anti-proliferation was also studied on doxorubicin-sensitive K562 and doxorubicin-resistant K562/Dox leukemia cells using resazurin assay. The results showed that 4-HBA and VA could interact with HSA. The fluorescence quenching process in HSA-4-HBA system might be attributed to static quenching mechanism. In contrast, a dynamic quenching mechanism might be mainly involved in the fluorescence quenching process in the HSA-VA system. Thermodynamic data suggested that the spontaneous interaction between HSA and 4-HBA or VA had occurred in the system and it also indicated that hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals forces contributed to the binding of HSA to 4-HBA or VA. In addition, 4-HBA and VA decreased K562 and K562/Dox cells viability in a dose- and time-dependence manner. In conclusions, the 4-HBA and VA could interact with HSA. In addition, the 4-HBA and VA decreased in cell viability for both doxorubicin-sensitive K562 and doxorubicin-resistant K562/Dox leukemia cells in a dose- and time-dependence manner. Therefore, these current studies could provide useful information about the nature of 4-HBA or VA binding to protein HSA and their anticancer activities in both of these types of leukemia cells. The cell death mechanisms should be investigated through future study.","['Myint, Ohnmar', 'Wattanapongpitak, Sakornniya', 'Supawat, Benjamaporn', 'Kothan, Suchart', 'Udomtanakunchai, Chatchanok', 'Tima, Singkome', 'Tungjai, Montree']","['Myint O', 'Wattanapongpitak S', 'Supawat B', 'Kothan S', 'Udomtanakunchai C', 'Tima S', 'Tungjai M']","['Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Center of Radiation Research and Medical Imaging, Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Ph.D. Degree Program in Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Under the CMU Presidential Scholarship, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Center of Radiation Research and Medical Imaging, Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Center of Radiation Research and Medical Imaging, Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Center of Radiation Research and Medical Imaging, Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Center of Radiation Research and Medical Imaging, Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Center of Radiation Research and Medical Imaging, Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210708,Ireland,Toxicol Rep,Toxicology reports,101630272,,,,PMC8278208,['NOTNLM'],"['4-Hydroxybenzoic acid', 'Cancer', 'Fluorescence quenching', 'Phenolic acid', 'Vanillic acid']",2021/07/22 06:00,2021/07/22 06:01,['2021/07/21 06:36'],"['2021/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/26 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/21 06:36 [entrez]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.toxrep.2021.07.001 [doi]', 'S2214-7500(21)00128-1 [pii]']",epublish,Toxicol Rep. 2021 Jul 8;8:1381-1388. doi: 10.1016/j.toxrep.2021.07.001. eCollection 2021.,1381-1388,['(c) 2021 The Author(s).'],,,,['The authors report no declarations of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objectives of the current study were: (1) to translate and adapt the pediatric-adolescent version 16D and 17D from English into French (Canada), (2) to demonstrate their feasibility in pediatric conditions. Methods: The translation methodology combined forward and back translations, and cognitive debriefing with eight adolescents and eight children. Four bilingual translators were involved in the process. We administered the translated versions to two clinical samples, being treated for Primary immunodeficiency (PID, n = 48, aged 14.1 years, 20 girls), and having recovered from pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL, n = 153, aged 14.7 years, 77 girls). Results: Cognitive debriefing indicated that that the instructions, items, and response options were clear, easy to understand, and easy to answer. Adjustments were made for clarity. Translated versions were highly usable (measurement completion >90%). HRQoL levels were high for both samples (range 0.85-0.96). Participants reported lower levels if they were adolescents, particularly if they were girls. Older boys with PID reported a lower HRQoL than their counterparts with a history of ALL. PID and ALL patients mainly reported issues with discomfort and pain, concentration/learning, physical appearance, and psychological distress and sleeping, although to a different degree. Conclusion: The French-language versions of the 16D and 17D are easy to administer and may be used to identify problematic domains. Greater availability of translated versions of short evaluation tools may facilitate broader uptake of screening practices in pediatric care.","['Rondeau, Emelie', 'Desjardins, Leandra', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Haddad, Elie', 'Sultan, Serge']","['Rondeau E', 'Desjardins L', 'Laverdiere C', 'Sinnett D', 'Haddad E', 'Sultan S']","['Sainte-Justine UHC Research Centre, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Centre, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Centre, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Centre, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Centre, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Centre, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7520-1734'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210706,England,Health Psychol Behav Med,Health psychology and behavioral medicine,101624393,,,,PMC8266233,['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood leukemia', 'Quality of Life', 'health status', 'pediatrics', 'primary immunodeficiency']",2021/07/22 06:00,2021/07/22 06:01,['2021/07/21 06:35'],"['2021/07/21 06:35 [entrez]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/21642850.2021.1948416 [doi]', '1948416 [pii]']",epublish,Health Psychol Behav Med. 2021 Jul 6;9(1):619-635. doi: 10.1080/21642850.2021.1948416. eCollection 2021.,619-635,"['(c) 2021 The Author(s).

Myeloid neoplasms with prominent eosinophilia often have rearrangements in the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) or beta (PDGFRB) or are associated with core-binding factor AML. In this report, we describe a 35-year-old male presenting with chest discomfort and altered mental status, found to have marked leukocytosis with eosinophilic predominance and an elevated blast count. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy findings were morphologically consistent with AEL. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and standard karyotype analysis did not reveal any abnormalities, and mutation analysis using next generation sequencing (NGS) revealed a pathogenic mutation in PHF6. Cardiac work-up revealed findings suggestive of eosinophilic myocarditis. High-dose glucocorticoid therapy was initiated followed by standard intensive induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and idarubicin. He experienced a rapid reduction in peripheral blood eosinophil and blast count and was found to be in a complete remission at the time of his postinduction bone marrow examination. He underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation with a matched sibling donor after consolidative high-dose cytarabine and remains in remission at the time of this report, 6 months following his initial diagnosis. The rarity of this condition has resulted in a paucity of data to guide management. Additional studies are needed to better characterize this entity and inform optimal management strategies to attain a long-term sustained remission in these patients.","['Lipof, J J', 'Huselton, E J', 'Zent, C S', 'Evans, A', 'Zhang, B', 'Rothberg, P G', 'Bennett, J M']","['Lipof JJ', 'Huselton EJ', 'Zent CS', 'Evans A', 'Zhang B', 'Rothberg PG', 'Bennett JM']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Rochester Medical Center, James P.

This risk is three times higher for all cancers and eight times higher for skin cancer. The coexistence of CLL and adenocarcinoma of the prostate is rare. Case presentation: We report a case of a66-year-old man who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate carcinoma. The final histopathological diagnosis of Gleason 7 adenocarcinoma of the prostate with incidental Rai stage I chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was made. No further investigations or treatment was offered due to the age and low disease stage. At the last follow-up of 12 months, the patient is alive, without disease progression for both lymphoma and prostate, with a PSA value of 0.03 ng/ml. Conclusion: Early detection of lymphoma after radical prostatectomy will allow optimal management. The analysis of this link requires, therefore, additional investigations.","['Tlili, Ghassen', 'Ammar, Houssem', 'Majdoub, Wiem', 'Dziri, Sonia', 'Farhat, Waad', 'Acacha, Emir', 'Rguez, Arib', 'Ben Ahmed, Khaled', 'Azzabi, Awatef', 'Jaidane, Mehdi']","['Tlili G', 'Ammar H', 'Majdoub W', 'Dziri S', 'Farhat W', 'Acacha E', 'Rguez A', 'Ben Ahmed K', 'Azzabi A', 'Jaidane M']","['Department of Urology, Sahloul Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Sahloul Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia.', 'Department of Anatomopathology, Sahloul Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia.', 'Department of Nephrology, Sahloul Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Sahloul Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia.', 'Department of Urology, Sahloul Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Sahloul Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia.', 'Department of Urology, Sahloul Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia.', 'Department of Nephrology, Sahloul Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia.', 'Department of Urology, Sahloul Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia.']",,['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210625,England,Ann Med Surg (Lond),Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),101616869,,,,PMC8274301,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Prostate carcinoma', 'Radical prostatectomy']",2021/07/22 06:00,2021/07/22 06:01,['2021/07/21 06:34'],"['2021/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/21 06:34 [entrez]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102516 [doi]', 'S2049-0801(21)00466-0 [pii]']",epublish,Ann Med Surg (Lond). 2021 Jun 25;68:102516. doi: 10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102516. eCollection 2021 Aug.,102516,['(c) 2021 The Authors.'],,,,['The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the features of patients with HMs whose QFT-GIT results were indeterminate. Methods: This study enrolled patients with HMs for the analysis of QFT-GIT tests and additional 2-year follow-up. The characteristics and predictors of QFT-GIT indeterminate results were identified. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) incidence rate (IR) and incidence rate ratio (IRR) were also investigated. Results: Of 89 participants, 27 (30.3%) had QFT-GIT indeterminate results. The QFT-GIT indeterminate patients were characterized with the diagnosis of leukaemia (63.0% versus 32.3%, p = 0.044), abnormal white blood count (WBC) (88.9% versus 14.5%, p = 0.001), abnormal lymphocyte percentage (81.5% versus 14.5%, p = 0.001) and lower lymphocyte count (x10(9)/l) (0.5 versus 2.2, p = 0.000) when compared with those with determinate results. Meanwhile, abnormal WBC [odds ratios (OR): 15.18, p = 0.003] and lymphocyte percentage (OR: 6.90, p = 0.033) were predictors of indeterminate results. One patient with the QFT-GIT indeterminate status and high interferon-gamma level of negative control result developed active TB with a TB IR of 18.5 per 1000 person-years and an IRR of 0.1 (95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.71) when compared with positive QFT-GIT patients without prophylaxis treatment. Conclusion: Abnormal ranges of WBC and lymphocyte differential count percentage were independent predictors useful to determine the optimal timing of implementing QFT-GIT test in patients with HMs.","['Huang, Chen-Cheng', 'Jerry Teng, Chieh-Lin', 'Wu, Ming-Feng', 'Lee, Ching-Hsiao', 'Chen, Hui-Chen', 'Huang, Wei-Chang']","['Huang CC', 'Jerry Teng CL', 'Wu MF', 'Lee CH', 'Chen HC', 'Huang WC']","['Institute of Molecular Biology, College of Life Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung.', 'Division of Haematology/Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital.', 'Division of Chest Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung.', 'Department of Medical Technology, Jen-Teh Junior College of Medicine, Nursing and Management, Miaoli.', 'Division of Chest Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung.', 'School of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9744-0368', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9733-5899']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210706,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,PMC8264733,['NOTNLM'],"['QuantiFERON-TB Gold in-Tube', 'haematological malignancy', 'indeterminate']",2021/07/22 06:00,2021/07/22 06:01,['2021/07/21 06:34'],"['2021/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/21 06:34 [entrez]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/20406207211028437 [doi]', '10.1177_20406207211028437 [pii]']",epublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2021 Jul 6;12:20406207211028437. doi: 10.1177/20406207211028437. eCollection 2021.,20406207211028437,"['(c) The Author(s), 2021.']",,,,"['Conflict of interest statement: The authors declare that there is no conflict of', 'interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Invasive fungal disease (IFD) is suspected when fever persists >4-7 days after empirical antibiotics. Its clinical characteristics and predictive factors associated with IFD among pediatric oncology patients with FN were thus explored. Methods: Pediatric oncology patients with FN between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2016 were enrolled in this study. Clinical characteristics, including laboratory investigations, treatment modalities, and final outcomes of IFD were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Results: In all, 73 patients with 180 episodes of confirmed diagnosis of FN were studied. Median age at diagnosis was 6.2 years, with equal sex distribution. The most common diagnosis was acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=91, 51%), followed by acute myeloid leukemia (n=47, 26%), Burkitt's lymphoma (n=7, 4%) and neuroblastoma (n=7, 4%). Median absolute neutrophil count at FN diagnosis was 0 (0-806) cells/mm(3). IFD was diagnosed for 25 (14%) episodes. Mortality rates for FN and IFD were 4% and 20%, respectively. Respiratory compromise, oxygen requirement, hypotension, prolonged hospitalization, duration of fever and neutropenia, bacteremia, bacteriuria, funguria, abnormal liver-function results, and prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotic administration were factors associated with IFD (P<0.05). Prolonged duration between initiation of fever and antifungal administration for nearly 10 days was an independent factor in prediction of IFD occurrence (P=0.014). Conclusion: Respiratory compromise, oxygen requirement, hypotension, prolonged hospitalization, duration of fever and neutropenia, bacteremia, bacteriuria, funguria, abnormal liver-function results and prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotic administration were factors associated with IFD. Duration between initiation of fever and antifungal administration of nearly 10 days were considered a risk factors of IFD among patients with FN.

Patients and Methods: There were 22 patients in this study and the median age was 47.5 (12-84) years old, including 11 males and 11 females. Among them, 8 patients were relapsed AML including 2 patients relapsed after HSCT and 14 patients with primary refractory AML including 4 secondary AML. The median number of cycles of previous chemotherapy was 4 (range, 2-10). Results: After a course of venetoclax plus decitabine-based treatment, 9 patients achieved complete remission (CR) and 1 patient achieved complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery (CRi). The overall response rate (ORR) was 45.5% and the CR rate was 40.9%, and the median time to reach CR/CRi was 21 (13-46) days. Four of the 10 CR/CRi patients relapsed again, and the median time of relapse was 5 (1.0-24) months. The one-year overall survival rate was 31.8%, and the median survival time was 6 months (95% CI, 1-9 months). The one-year overall survival rate of 10 CR/CRi patients was 59.1%, and the 12 NR patients was 10.4% (p=0.001). Nausea and vomiting occurred in 11 patients (50.0%). All patients had grade IV neutropenia and IV thrombocytopenia (100%). Pneumonia occurred in 14 patients (63.6%) and septicaemia occurred in 2 patients (9.0%). The cause of death in all patients was primary disease progression, and no patients died due to the side effects. Conclusion: The efficacy of venetoclax plus decitabine-based treatment in the real-world treatment of heavily pre-treated RR-AML is similar to that in clinical trials, and the side effects are controllable.","['Tong, Juan', 'Zhao, Na', 'Hu, Xing', 'Yao, Wen', 'Cheng, Yaxin', 'Zhou, Li', 'Liu, Huilan', 'Geng, Liangquan', 'Sun, Zimin', 'Zheng, Changcheng']","['Tong J', 'Zhao N', 'Hu X', 'Yao W', 'Cheng Y', 'Zhou L', 'Liu H', 'Geng L', 'Sun Z', 'Zheng C']","[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, People's Republic of China.""]","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1567-3625', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3668-3558']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210712,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,PMC8285225,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukaemia', 'hypomethylating agents', 'venetoclax']",2021/07/22 06:00,2021/07/22 06:01,['2021/07/21 06:31'],"['2021/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/21 06:31 [entrez]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S316561 [doi]', '316561 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2021 Jul 12;13:5613-5621. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S316561. eCollection 2021.,5613-5621,['(c) 2021 Tong et al.'],,,,['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our previous work we demonstrated that eATP activates the P2X7 ion channel receptor in HSPCs and that its deficiency impairs stem cell trafficking. To learn more about the role of the P2X purinergic receptor family in hematopoiesis, we phenotyped murine and human HSPCs with respect to the seven P2X receptors and observed that, these cells also highly express P2X4 receptors, which shows ~50% sequence similarity to P2X7 subtypes, but that P2X4 cells are more sensitive to eATP and signal much more rapidly. Using the selective P2X4 receptor antagonist PSB12054 as well as P2X4-KO mice, we found that the P2X4 receptor, similar to P2X7 receptor, promotes trafficking of HSPCs in that its deficiency leads to impaired chemotaxis of HSPCs in response to a stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) gradient, less effective pharmacological mobilization, and defective homing and engraftment of HSPCs after transplantation into myeloablated hosts. This correlated with a decrease in SDF-1 expression in the BM microenvironment. Overall, our results confirm the proposed cooperative dependence of both receptors in response to eATP signaling. In G-CSF-induced mobilization, a lack of one receptor is not compensated by the presence of the other one, which supports their mutual dependence in regulating HSPC trafficking.","['Adamiak, Mateusz', 'Bujko, Kamila', 'Thapa, Arjun', 'Pensato, Valentina', 'Brzezniakiewicz-Janus, Katarzyna', 'Ratajczak, Janina', 'Davies, Daryl L', 'Ulrich, Henning', 'Kucia, Magda', 'Ratajczak, Mariusz Z']","['Adamiak M', 'Bujko K', 'Thapa A', 'Pensato V', 'Brzezniakiewicz-Janus K', 'Ratajczak J', 'Davies DL', 'Ulrich H', 'Kucia M', 'Ratajczak MZ']","['Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Department of Regenerative Medicine Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Department of Regenerative Medicine Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Zielona Gora, Hospital Gorzow Wlkp., Zielona Gora, Poland.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Titus Family Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University of Southern California School of Pharmacy, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Chemistry, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA. mjkuci01@louisville.edu.', 'Department of Regenerative Medicine Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland. mjkuci01@louisville.edu.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA. mzrata01@louisville.edu.', 'Department of Regenerative Medicine Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland. mzrata01@louisville.edu.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Zielona Gora, Hospital Gorzow Wlkp., Zielona Gora, Poland. mzrata01@louisville.edu.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3228-9588', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4143-5778', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9110-5048', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0071-0198']",['eng'],"['2R01 DK074720/U.S. Department of Health & Human Services | NIH | National', 'Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (National Institute of', 'Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases)']",['Journal Article'],20210720,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,,,,,2021/07/22 06:00,2021/07/22 06:00,['2021/07/21 06:23'],"['2021/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/21 06:23 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-021-01352-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-021-01352-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2022 Jan;36(1):248-256. doi: 10.1038/s41375-021-01352-9.

Other than age, sex, and CLL family-history, little is known about factors associated with MBL risk. A polygenic-risk-score (PRS) of 41 CLL-susceptibility variants has been found to be associated with CLL risk among individuals of European-ancestry(EA). Here, we evaluate these variants, the PRS, and environmental factors for MBL risk. We also evaluate these variants and the CLL-PRS among African-American (AA) and EA-CLL cases and controls. Our study included 560 EA MBLs, 869 CLLs (696 EA/173 AA), and 2866 controls (2631 EA/235 AA). We used logistic regression, adjusting for age and sex, to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals within each race. We found significant associations with MBL risk among 21 of 41 variants and with the CLL-PRS (OR = 1.86, P = 1.9 x 10(-29), c-statistic = 0.72). Little evidence of any association between MBL risk and environmental factors was observed. We observed significant associations of the CLL-PRS with EA-CLL risk (OR = 2.53, P = 4.0 x 10(-63), c-statistic = 0.77) and AA-CLL risk (OR = 1.76, P = 5.1 x 10(-5), c-statistic = 0.62). Inherited genetic factors and not environmental are associated with MBL risk. In particular, the CLL-PRS is a strong predictor for both risk of MBL and EA-CLL, but less so for AA-CLL supporting the need for further work in this population.","['Kleinstern, Geffen', 'Weinberg, J Brice', 'Parikh, Sameer A', 'Braggio, Esteban', 'Achenbach, Sara J', 'Robinson, Dennis P', 'Norman, Aaron D', 'Rabe, Kari G', 'Boddicker, Nicholas J', 'Vachon, Celine M', 'Lesnick, Connie E', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Brander, Danielle M', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Olson, Janet E', 'Cerhan, James R', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Furman, Richard R', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Slager, Susan L']","['Kleinstern G', 'Weinberg JB', 'Parikh SA', 'Braggio E', 'Achenbach SJ', 'Robinson DP', 'Norman AD', 'Rabe KG', 'Boddicker NJ', 'Vachon CM', 'Lesnick CE', 'Call TG', 'Brander DM', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Kipps TJ', 'Olson JE', 'Cerhan JR', 'Kay NE', 'Furman RR', 'Hanson CA', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Slager SL']","['School of Public Health, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Duke University, Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Weill Cornell Medical College/New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. slager@mayo.edu.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. slager@mayo.edu.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3221-7314', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1962-9322', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0064-4549', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4944-7789', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7482-178X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5951-5055', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5173-4712']",['eng'],"['R25 CA092049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG058266/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA235026/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA097274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA200703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA197120/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20210720,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,,PMC8727288,,,2021/07/22 06:00,2021/07/22 06:00,['2021/07/21 06:23'],"['2021/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2022/01/20 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/21 06:23 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-021-01344-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-021-01344-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2022 Jan;36(1):119-125. doi: 10.1038/s41375-021-01344-9.

Nevertheless, the clinical impact of subclonal TP53 mutations below 10% to 15% variant allele frequency (VAF) remains unclear. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using a training/validation approach, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical and biological features of TP53 mutations above (high-VAF) or below (low-VAF) the previously reported 10.0% VAF threshold, as determined by deep next-generation sequencing. Clinical impact of low-VAF TP53 mutations was also confirmed in a cohort (n = 251) of CLL treated with fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab (FCR) or FCR-like regimens from two UK trials. RESULTS: In the training cohort, 97 of 684 patients bore 152 TP53 mutations, while in the validation cohort, 71 of 536 patients had 109 TP53 mutations. In both cohorts, patients with the TP53 mutation experienced significantly shorter overall survival (OS) than TP53 wild-type patients, regardless of the TP53 mutation VAF. By combining TP53 mutation and 17p13.1 deletion (del17p) data in the total cohort (n = 1,220), 113 cases were TP53 mutated only (73/113 with low-VAF mutations), 55 del17p/TP53 mutated (3/55 with low-VAF mutations), 20 del17p only, and 1,032 (84.6%) TP53 wild-type. A model including low-VAF cases outperformed the canonical model, which considered only high-VAF cases (c-indices 0.643 vs. 0.603, P < 0.0001), and improved the prognostic risk stratification of CLL International Prognostic Index. Clinical results were confirmed in CIT-treated cases (n = 552) from the retrospective cohort, and the UK trials cohort. CONCLUSIONS: TP53 mutations affected OS regardless of VAF.

The secondary aims included determining if treatment or initial response to treatment affected the overall survival of patients, and understanding if disease characteristics such as immunophenotype, cell size or the presence of epitheliotropism influenced response to treatment. METHODS: Veterinary medical oncologists at four academic veterinary teaching hospitals submitted cases of feline patients with cutaneous lymphoma diagnosed by histopathology or cytology. Signalment, feline leukemia virus (FeLV)/feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) status, physical examination findings, clinical signs, diagnostic tests, therapy, response and outcome, and necropsy findings, when available, were recorded. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were identified and described. The majority of patients were domestic shorthair cats (n = 29). The median age at diagnosis was 12.3 years. Males were over-represented in the population (n = 30). In the majority of patients (n = 33), the FIV/FeLV status was unknown. Twenty patients were fully staged. Thirty-four patients were treated with a variety of modalities, including surgery, radiation, single-agent or combination chemotherapy, or prednisolone only. In multiple patients, surgery or radiation was combined with a systemic therapy. Of 34 patients treated with some form of therapy, 20 responded (achieving either a partial response or complete remission). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Clinical signs and physical examination findings varied among patients. Response to therapy appeared to be associated with survival (P = 0.0025); however, this population was highly censored. Immunophenotype, cell size and the presence of epitheliotropism did not influence treatment response. Results were limited by small numbers of patients, heterogeneous disease manifestations and treatment protocols. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the effect of specific treatment modalities and disease subtype on prognosis.","['Siewert, Jacob', 'Pellin, MacKenzie A', 'Husbands, Brian D', 'Curran, Kaitlin M', 'Scavelli, Diane', 'Sampene, Emmanuel']","['Siewert J', 'Pellin MA', 'Husbands BD', 'Curran KM', 'Scavelli D', 'Sampene E']","['College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA.', 'School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.', 'University of Minnesota, Minnesota, MN, USA.', 'Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA.', 'School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1094-8909'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210721,England,J Feline Med Surg,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,100897329,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Lymphoma', 'cancer', 'chemotherapy', 'dermatology']",2021/07/22 06:00,2021/07/22 06:00,['2021/07/21 05:26'],"['2021/07/21 05:26 [entrez]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1098612X211028837 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Feline Med Surg. 2021 Jul 21:1098612X211028837. doi: 10.1177/1098612X211028837.,1098612X211028837,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High proliferative activity inevitably promotes oncogenesis, the risk of which is further elevated in B lymphocytes by endogenous gene rearrangement and somatic mutations. However, B-cell-derived cancers are rare, perhaps owing to putative intrinsic tumor-suppressive mechanisms. We show that c-MYC facilitates B-cell proliferation as a protumorigenic driver and unexpectedly coengages counteracting tumor suppression through its downstream factor TFAP4. TFAP4 is mutated in human lymphoid malignancies, particularly in >10% of Burkitt lymphomas, and reduced TFAP4 expression was associated with poor survival of patients with MYC-high B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In mice, insufficient TFAP4 expression accelerated c-MYC-driven transformation of B cells. Mechanistically, c-MYC suppresses the stemness of developing B cells by inducing TFAP4 and restricting self-renewal of proliferating B cells. Thus, the pursuant transcription factor cascade functions as a tumor suppressor module that safeguards against the transformation of developing B cells.","['Tonc, Elena', 'Takeuchi, Yoshiko', 'Chou, Chun', 'Xia, Yu', 'Holmgren, Melanie', 'Fujii, Chika', 'Raju, Saravanan', 'Chang, Gue Su', 'Iwamoto, Masahiro', 'Egawa, Takeshi']","['Tonc E', 'Takeuchi Y', 'Chou C', 'Xia Y', 'Holmgren M', 'Fujii C', 'Raju S', 'Chang GS', 'Iwamoto M', 'Egawa T']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology and.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology and.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology and.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology and.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology and.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology and.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology and.', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO; and.', 'Department of Orthopaedics, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology and.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6604-6496', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2637-7696', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7147-4236', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6397-1205', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3216-5574', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7489-1051']",['eng'],"['P30 AR073752/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR046000/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI114593/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA091842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000448/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR002345/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI130152/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC8678995,,,2021/07/21 06:00,2022/01/04 06:00,['2021/07/20 17:26'],"['2021/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/12/16 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/20 17:26 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(21)01373-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2021011711 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2021 Dec 16;138(24):2526-2538. doi: 10.1182/blood.2021011711.,2526-2538,['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,['2022/12/16 00:00'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In previous studies, various proportion of patients was found to carry CD11b+ or CD11c+ B cells whose presence was an unfavourable prognostic factor. The exact mechanism however, how these receptors contribute to the pathogenesis of CLL has not been revealed so far. Here we analysed the role of CD11b and CD11c on B cells of CLL patients in the adhesion to fibrinogen and in the migration towards stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and studied the role of CR4 in the adherence of the CD11c+ B cell line BJAB. We observed that both CR3 and CR4 mediate adhesion of the malignant B cells. Moreover, we found, that CR4 was strongly involved in the migration of the leukemic cells towards the chemoattractant SDF-1. Our data suggest that CR3 and CR4 are not only passive markers on CLL B cells, but they might contribute to the progression of the disease. Since the role of SDF-1 is prominent in the migration of CLL cells into the bone marrow where their survival is supported, our findings help to understand how the presence of CD11c on leukemic B cells can worsen the prognosis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.","['Nagy-Balo, Zsuzsa', 'Kiss, Richard', 'Demeter, Judit', 'Bodor, Csaba', 'Bajtay, Zsuzsa', 'Erdei, Anna']","['Nagy-Balo Z', 'Kiss R', 'Demeter J', 'Bodor C', 'Bajtay Z', 'Erdei A']","['Department of Immunology, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-ELTE Immunology Research Group, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE Momentum Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, First Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Oncology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE Momentum Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, First Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Immunology, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-ELTE Immunology Research Group, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Immunology, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-ELTE Immunology Research Group, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1814-2026'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210720,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (CD11c Antigen)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (ITGAM protein, human)', '0 (Integrin alphaXbeta2)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)']",IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'CD11b Antigen/immunology/*metabolism', 'CD11c Antigen/immunology/*metabolism', 'CD18 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/immunology', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin alphaXbeta2', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phagocytosis']",PMC8291664,,,2021/07/21 06:00,2021/11/09 06:00,['2021/07/20 17:25'],"['2021/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/20 17:25 [entrez]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0254853 [doi]', 'PONE-D-21-13031 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2021 Jul 20;16(7):e0254853. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0254853. eCollection 2021.,e0254853,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aim of this study was to investigate whether the presence of thyroid alterations may affect the clinical outcome of chronic myeloid leukemia on tyrosine kinase inhibitors. METHODS: We evaluated thyroid function and autoimmunity in 69 chronic myeloid leukemia patients on long-term therapy looking at the association between thyroid abnormalities and disease molecular response. RESULTS: Overall, 24 of 69 (34.8%) had one or more thyroid abnormalities during therapy. A high percentage of patients (21/69, 30.4%) showed thyroid autoimmunity (positive thyroid autoantibodies with ultrasound hypoechogenicity), while clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism were, respectively, found in 4 of 69 (5.8%) and 3 of 69 (4.3%) of cases. Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors resulted significantly associated (14/32, 43.7%) with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, compared to first generation (7/37, 18.9%; p = 0.03). Interestingly, we also found a significant association between euthyroid (14/26, 53.8%) and hypothyroid Hashimoto's thyroiditis (4/26, 15.4%) in patients with deep molecular response, as compared to euthyroid (3/43, 7%; p = 0.0001) and hypothyroid (0/43, 0%; p = 0.02) Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients with major molecular response. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms and extends our knowledge on the tyrosine kinase inhibitors effects on thyroid, showing that thyroid autoimmunity is frequently observed in chronic myeloid leukemia patients on long-term therapy and is associated with a better oncological response.","['Rodia, R', 'Pani, F', 'Caocci, G', 'La Nasa, G', 'Simula, M P', 'Mulas, O', 'Velluzzi, F', 'Loviselli, A', 'Mariotti, S', 'Boi, F']","['Rodia R', 'Pani F', 'Caocci G', 'La Nasa G', 'Simula MP', 'Mulas O', 'Velluzzi F', 'Loviselli A', 'Mariotti S', 'Boi F']","['Endocrinology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Cagliari, SS 554, Bivio per Sestu, Monserrato, 09042, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Division of Immunology, Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Ematology and CTMO, Businco Hospital, Azienda Ospedaliera Brotzu, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Ematology and CTMO, Businco Hospital, Azienda Ospedaliera Brotzu, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Ematology and CTMO, Businco Hospital, Azienda Ospedaliera Brotzu, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Ematology and CTMO, Businco Hospital, Azienda Ospedaliera Brotzu, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Endocrinology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Cagliari, SS 554, Bivio per Sestu, Monserrato, 09042, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Endocrinology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Cagliari, SS 554, Bivio per Sestu, Monserrato, 09042, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Endocrinology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Cagliari, SS 554, Bivio per Sestu, Monserrato, 09042, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Endocrinology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Cagliari, SS 554, Bivio per Sestu, Monserrato, 09042, Cagliari, Italy. francesco.boi@unica.it.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9924-5192'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210720,Italy,J Endocrinol Invest,Journal of endocrinological investigation,7806594,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Molecular response', 'Thyroid abnormalities', 'Thyroid autoimmunity', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2021/07/21 06:00,2021/07/21 06:00,['2021/07/20 12:30'],"['2021/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/20 12:30 [entrez]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s40618-021-01613-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s40618-021-01613-5 [pii]']",aheadofprint,J Endocrinol Invest. 2021 Jul 20. pii: 10.1007/s40618-021-01613-5. doi: 10.1007/s40618-021-01613-5.,,['(c) 2021.

We investigated the development of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM), Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). After the first dose of the vaccine, on D22, WM/CLL/NHL patients had lower NAb titers compared to controls: the median NAb inhibition titer was 17% (range 0-91%, IQR 8-27%) for WM/CLL/NHL patients versus 32% (range 2-98%, IQR 19-48%) for controls (P < 0.001). Only 8 (14%) patients versus 114 (54%) controls developed NAb titers >/= 30% on D22 (p < 0.001). Our data indicate that the first dose of both BNT162b2 and AZD1222 leads to lower production of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with WM/CLL/NHL compared to controls of similar age and gender and without malignant disease. Even though the response rates were not optimal, vaccination is still considered essential and if possible should be performed before treatment initiation. These patients with suboptimal responses should be considered to be prioritized for booster doses.","['Gavriatopoulou, Maria', 'Terpos, Evangelos', 'Kastritis, Efstathios', 'Briasoulis, Alexandros', 'Gumeni, Sentiljana', 'Ntanasis-Stathopoulos, Ioannis', 'Sklirou, Aimilia D', 'Malandrakis, Panagiotis', 'Eleutherakis-Papaiakovou, Evangelos', 'Migkou, Magdalini', 'Trougakos, Ioannis P', 'Dimopoulos, Meletios A']","['Gavriatopoulou M', 'Terpos E', 'Kastritis E', 'Briasoulis A', 'Gumeni S', 'Ntanasis-Stathopoulos I', 'Sklirou AD', 'Malandrakis P', 'Eleutherakis-Papaiakovou E', 'Migkou M', 'Trougakos IP', 'Dimopoulos MA']","['Department of Clinical Therapeutics, School of Medicine, Alexandra General Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 80 Vas.

The objective of this research was to generate supportive quantitative evidence for modular physical functioning and fatigue measures based on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 items (QLQ-C30) and a customized selection of 10 supplemental items from the EORTC Item Library. METHODS: The 40 items were completed online cross-sectionally by 51 patients (higher risk [HR] MDS: 53%; CMML: 26%; AML: 10%). Psychometric analyses based on Rasch measurement theory (RMT) were conducted on the QLQ-C30 physical functioning and fatigue domains as well as measures combining QLQ-C30 and supplemental items. A measure of anemia-related symptoms composed of QLQ-C30 and supplemental items covering fatigue, dyspnea, and dizziness was also investigated. RESULTS: The QLQ-C30 physical functioning and fatigue domains showed good targeting to the sample and adequate reliability, with few conceptual gaps identified. Combining the QLQ-C30 and supplemental physical functioning and fatigue items improved the conceptual coverage and the reliability of the measures. The patient-reported anemia-related symptom measure showed good measurement performance, underpinned by a clinically meaningful characterization of severity of these symptoms over a spectrum, starting with fatigue, then dyspnea, and finally dizziness (most severe). CONCLUSION: The modular measurement approach of combining EORTC QLQ-C30 and Item Library offers a promising pragmatic solution to the measurement of physical functioning and fatigue, as well as anemia-related symptoms in clinical trials conducted in HR MDS, CMML, and AML.","['Regnault, Antoine', 'Pompilus, Farrah', 'Ciesluk, Anna', 'Mazerolle, Flora', 'Bejar, Rafael', 'Fram, Robert J', 'Faller, Douglas V', 'Marquis, Patrick', 'Bell, Jill A']","['Regnault A', 'Pompilus F', 'Ciesluk A', 'Mazerolle F', 'Bejar R', 'Fram RJ', 'Faller DV', 'Marquis P', 'Bell JA']","['Modus Outcomes, 4 Place Amedee Bonnet, 69002, Lyon, France. antoine.regnault@modusoutcomes.com.', 'Modus Outcomes, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Modus Outcomes, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Modus Outcomes, 4 Place Amedee Bonnet, 69002, Lyon, France.', 'Moores Cancer Center, UC San Diego - MDS Center of Excellence, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Modus Outcomes, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Cambridge, MA, USA.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8234-2896'],['eng'],"['Not applicable/Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA, a wholly owned', 'subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited']",['Journal Article'],20210720,Germany,J Patient Rep Outcomes,Journal of patient-reported outcomes,101722688,,,,PMC8292469,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', 'EORTC item library', 'Fatigue', 'Modular measurement approach', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes', 'Patient-reported outcomes', 'Physical functioning']",2021/07/21 06:00,2021/07/21 06:01,['2021/07/20 12:27'],"['2020/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/20 12:27 [entrez]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s41687-021-00334-w [doi]', '10.1186/s41687-021-00334-w [pii]']",epublish,J Patient Rep Outcomes. 2021 Jul 20;5(1):60. doi: 10.1186/s41687-021-00334-w.,60,['(c) 2021.

In this paper, we examined whether congenital Rlip deficiency could prevent genetically-driven breast cancer in two transgenic mouse models: the MMTV-PyVT model, which expresses the polyomavirus middle T antigen (PyVT) under control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (MMTV) and the MMTV-Erbb2 model which expresses MMTV-driven erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (Erbb2, HER2/Neu) and frequently acquires p53 mutations. We found that loss of either one or two Rlip alleles had a suppressive effect on carcinogenesis in Erbb2 over-expressing mice. Interestingly, Rlip deficiency did not affect tumor growth but significantly reduced the lung metastatic burden of breast cancer in the viral PyVT model, which does not depend on either Ras or loss of p53. Furthermore, spontaneous tumors of MMTV-PyVT/Rlip+/+ mice showed no regression following Rlip knockdown. Finally, mice lacking one or both Rlip alleles differentially expressed markers for apoptotic signaling, proliferation, angiogenesis, and cell cycling in PyVT and Erbb2 breast tumors. Our results support the efficacy of Rlip depletion in suppressing p53 inactivated cancers, and our findings may yield novel methods for prevention or treatment of cancer in patients with HER2 mutations or tumor HER2 expression.","['Singh, Sharda P', 'Lee, Jihyun', 'Bose, Chhanda', 'Li, Hongzhi', 'Yuan, Yate-Ching', 'Hindle, Ashly', 'Singhal, Sharad S', 'Kopel, Jonathan', 'Palade, Philip T', 'Jones, Catherine', 'Rahman, Rakhshanda L', 'Awasthi, Sanjay']","['Singh SP', 'Lee J', 'Bose C', 'Li H', 'Yuan YC', 'Hindle A', 'Singhal SS', 'Kopel J', 'Palade PT', 'Jones C', 'Rahman RL', 'Awasthi S']","['Division of Hematology & Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.', 'Bioinformatics Core Facility, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Bioinformatics Core Facility, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.', 'Bioinformatics Core Facility, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'UMC Health System, UMC Cancer Center, Lubbock, TX 79415, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.', 'UMC Health System, UMC Cancer Center, Lubbock, TX 79415, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX 79430, USA.', 'UMC Health System, UMC Cancer Center, Lubbock, TX 79415, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4361-4558', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3698-9784', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5214-5717']",['eng'],"['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'W81XWH-18-1-0534/U.S. Department of Defense']",['Journal Article'],20210702,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC8268413,['NOTNLM'],"['Erbb2', 'PyVT', 'RalBP1', 'breast cancer', 'metastasis']",2021/07/21 06:00,2021/07/21 06:01,['2021/07/20 12:17'],"['2021/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/22 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/20 12:17 [entrez]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/21 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13133329 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13133329 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Jul 2;13(13). pii: cancers13133329. doi: 10.3390/cancers13133329.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD27 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRS) that regulates lymphocyte function4. Expression of CD27 protein and mRNA has been reported in B-cell lymphomas5 and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma6. In this study, we examined the expression of CD27 in the skin of MF patients by real time PCR. The amount of CD27 was measured in MF patients and healthy controls. METHODS: A total of 98 skin biopsies were analyzed: 12 obtained from healthy donors and 86 obtained Cryostatic sections OCT-embedded affected by MF. Relative quantification of mRNA CD27 expression was achieved by means of TaqMan amplification and normalization to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). RESULTS: Housekeeping gene was detectable in all Skin samples and there isn't difference between healthy control and MF p value 0.1564. CD27 mRNA sequences were found in 3 of 12 (25%) of skin obtained from healthy donors and in 59 of 86 (68%) of skin obtained from Cryostatic sections OCT-embedded affected by MF. The chi-square statistic with Yates correction is 6.8413 and the p-value is 0.0089. When we compared the CD27 expression in MF and controls the RQ analysis show a value of 9.12+/-14.13. A RQ of 9.12 means that this gene is 9.12 times more expressed in MF skin samples then in the healthy skin samples. No difference were observed in the MF clustered by stages. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicates that CD27 can be used as diagnostic/prognostic markers, and whether anti-CD27 antibodies can be used in therapy.","['Galliano, Ilaria', 'Dapra, Valentina', 'Ponti, Renata', 'Alliaudi, Carla', 'Fierro, Maria T', 'Quaglino, Pietro', 'Bergallo, Massimiliano']","['Galliano I', 'Dapra V', 'Ponti R', 'Alliaudi C', 'Fierro MT', 'Quaglino P', 'Bergallo M']","[""Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Regina Margherita Children's Hospital, University of Turin, Turin, Italy."", ""Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Regina Margherita Children's Hospital, University of Turin, Turin, Italy."", 'Dermatology Section, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', ""Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Regina Margherita Children's Hospital, University of Turin, Turin, Italy."", 'Dermatology Section, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Dermatology Section, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', ""Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Regina Margherita Children's Hospital, University of Turin, Turin, Italy - massimiliano.bergallo@unito.it.""]",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210720,Italy,Ital J Dermatol Venerol,Italian journal of dermatology and venereology,101778002,,IM,,,,,2021/07/21 06:00,2021/07/21 06:00,['2021/07/20 10:28'],"['2021/07/20 10:28 [entrez]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S2784-8671.21.06953-X [pii]', '10.23736/S2784-8671.21.06953-X [doi]']",aheadofprint,Ital J Dermatol Venerol. 2021 Jul 20. pii: S2784-8671.21.06953-X. doi: 10.23736/S2784-8671.21.06953-X.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, epigenetic drugs such as histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) targeting epigenetic alterations in AML have obtained only limited clinical efficiency without clear mechanism. Fortunately, we screened out a novel epigenetic agent named Apigenin-Vorinostat-Conjugate (AVC), which provides us a possibility to handle the heterogeneous malignancy. Its inhibition on HDACs was presented by HDACs expression, enzyme activity, and histone acetylation level. Its efficacy against AML was detected by cell viability assay and tumor progression of AML mouse model. Apoptosis is the major way causing cell death. We found that AVC efficiently suppresses leukemogenesis while sparing the normal human cells. Kasumi-1 cells are at least 20-fold higher sensitive to AVC (IC50 = 0.024 muM) than vorinostat (IC50 = 0.513 muM) and Ara-C (IC50 = 0.4366 muM). Furthermore, it can efficiently regress the tumorigenesis in AML mouse model while keeping the pivotal organs safe, demonstrating a feasibility and favorable safety profile in treatment of AML. Collectively, these preclinical data suggest a promising potential utilizing flavonoid-HDACi-conjugate as a next-generation epigenetic drug for clinical therapy against AML.","['Zhang, Juan', 'Gao, Xuefeng', 'Wei, Mingming', 'Li, Yonghui', 'Yang, Guang', 'Yang, Cheng', 'Yu, Li']","['Zhang J', 'Gao X', 'Wei M', 'Li Y', 'Yang G', 'Yang C', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Precision Medicine for Hematological Malignancies, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Clinical Medical Academy, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Xueyuan AVE 1098, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518000, P.R.

Most people are asymptomatic, while some may develop a wide range of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD). Among them, EBV-positive T/NK LPD are uncommon diseases defined by the proliferation of T- or NK-cells infected by EBV. The 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) classification recognizes the following entities characterized by different outcomes: chronic active EBV infection of T- or NK-cell types (cutaneous and systemic forms), systemic EBV-positive T-cell lymphoma of childhood, EBV-positive aggressive NK-cell leukemia, extra nodal NK/T-cell lymphoma nasal type, and the new provisional entity known as primary EBV-positive nodal T/NK-cell lymphoma. In addition, EBV associated-hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is part of EBV-positive T/NK LPD, but has not been included in the WHO classification due to its reactive nature. Despite novel insights from high-throughput molecular studies, EBV-positive NK/T-cell LPD diagnoses remain challenging, especially because of their rarity and overlap. Until now, an accurate EBV-positive NK/T LPD diagnosis has been based on its clinical presentation and course correlated with its histological features. This review aims to summarize clinical, pathological and molecular features of EBV-positive T/NK LPD subtypes and to provide an overview of new understandings regarding these rare disorders.","['Syrykh, Charlotte', 'Pericart, Sarah', 'Lamaison, Claire', 'Escudie, Frederic', 'Brousset, Pierre', 'Laurent, Camille']","['Syrykh C', 'Pericart S', 'Lamaison C', 'Escudie F', 'Brousset P', 'Laurent C']","['Department of Pathology, Cancer Institute University of Toulouse-Oncopole, CEDEX 9, 31059 Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Pathology, Cancer Institute University of Toulouse-Oncopole, CEDEX 9, 31059 Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Pathology, CHU Pontchaillou, 35000 Rennes, France.', 'Department of Pathology, Cancer Institute University of Toulouse-Oncopole, CEDEX 9, 31059 Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Pathology, Cancer Institute University of Toulouse-Oncopole, CEDEX 9, 31059 Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), INSERM UMR1037, CEDEX 1, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'ERL 5294 National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), 31100 Toulouse, France.', 'University of Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, CEDEX 9, 31062 Toulouse, France.', 'Institut Carnot Lymphome CALYM, 69495 Pierre-Benite, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Excellence 'TOUCAN', CEDEX 1, 31037 Toulouse, France."", 'Department of Pathology, Cancer Institute University of Toulouse-Oncopole, CEDEX 9, 31059 Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), INSERM UMR1037, CEDEX 1, 31037 Toulouse, France.', 'ERL 5294 National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), 31100 Toulouse, France.', 'University of Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, CEDEX 9, 31062 Toulouse, France.', 'Institut Carnot Lymphome CALYM, 69495 Pierre-Benite, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Excellence 'TOUCAN', CEDEX 1, 31037 Toulouse, France.""]","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3201-6109', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8629-3291']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210701,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC8268319,['NOTNLM'],"['EBV', 'EBV-associated T/NK-cell lymphoproliferative disorders', 'EBV-positive aggressive NK-cell leukemia', 'Epstein-Barr virus', 'chronic active EBV infection', 'extra nodal NK/T-cell lymphoma nasal type', 'primary EBV-positive nodal T/NK-cell lymphoma', 'systemic EBV-positive T-cell lymphoma of childhood']",2021/07/21 06:00,2021/07/21 06:01,['2021/07/20 08:40'],"['2021/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/23 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/20 08:40 [entrez]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/21 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13133315 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13133315 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Jul 1;13(13). pii: cancers13133315. doi: 10.3390/cancers13133315.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-two consecutive patients with CML, who received nilotinib and/or imatinib in a single haemato-oncological Slovak center between years 2002-2018 were evaluated in a retrospective study. The mean age was 55.8 years (range 22-77 years). Median of follow-up was 61.3 months. RESULTS: A significantly higher incidence of dyslipidemia, significantly higher levels of potential risk markers of cardiovascular disease small dense LDL cholesterol (sdLDL-CH) and a significant increase in total cholesterol were found in the patients during treatment with nilotinib in comparison to imatinib. Dyslipidemia led to drug therapy in 22 % of the patients in the nilotinib group. Fourteen percent of the patients in the nilotinib group had one or more cardiovascular events, including peripheral artery disease (10 %), myocardial infarction (4 %) and stroke (4 %). CONCLUSION: A higher risk of cardiovascular events and atherogenic dyslipidemia were associated with nilotinib therapy. Patients treated with TKI, especially nilotinib, require an early modification of cardiovascular risk factors and a careful cardiologic surveillance so that antileukemic therapy with this highly effective agent could continue (Tab. 4, Fig. 3, Ref. 32).

We retrospectively analyzed survival, long-term toxicity, and secondary malignancies in a pooled cohort of pediatric patients (pts.) treated with the same TBI regimen. METHODS: Analyzed were 109 pts. treated between September 1996 and November 2015. Conditioning treatment according to EBMT guidelines and the ALL SCTped 2012 FORUM trial consisted of chemotherapy (CT) and TBI with 2Gy b.i.d. on 3 consecutive days to a total dose of 12Gy. Median follow-up was 97.9 months (2-228 months). RESULTS: Overall survival (OS) in our cohort at 2, 5, and 10 years was 86.1, 75.5, and 63.0%, respectively. Median survival was not reached. Long-term toxicity developed in 47 pts. After chronically abnormal liver and kidney parameters in 31 and 7 pts., respectively, growth retardation was the most frequent finding as seen in 13 pts. Secondary malignancies were rare (n= 3). CONCLUSION: TBI-containing conditioning regimens in pediatric stem cell transplantation (SCT) are highly effective. Efforts to replace TBI- with CT-containing regimens have only been successful in subgroups of pts. Although we could show long-term toxicity in 43% of pts., overall survival was 63% at 10 years. Still, long-term effects such as growth retardation can permanently impact the pts.' quality of life and functioning. Along with new substances, efforts should be undertaken to optimize TBI techniques and accompany the treatment by systematic follow-up programs beyond 5 years to improve detection of rare events.","['Gruen, Arne', 'Exner, Sebastian', 'Kuhl, Jorn-Sven', 'von Stackelberg, Arend', 'Budach, Volker', 'Stromberger, Carmen', 'Boehmer, Dirk']","['Gruen A', 'Exner S', 'Kuhl JS', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Budach V', 'Stromberger C', 'Boehmer D']","['Department for Radiation Oncology and Radiotherapy, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Campus Virchow-Clinic, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353, Berlin, Germany. arne.gruen@charite.de.', 'Strahlenzentrum Hamburg MVZ, Langenhorner Chaussee 369, 22419, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department for Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Hemostaseology, University Clinic Leipzig, Liebigstrasse 22, Haus 7, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department for Radiation Oncology and Radiotherapy, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Campus Virchow-Clinic, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department for Radiation Oncology and Radiotherapy, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Campus Virchow-Clinic, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department for Radiation Oncology and Radiotherapy, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Campus Virchow-Clinic, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353, Berlin, Germany.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210719,Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

Curcumin exerts cancer suppressive effects and increases sensitivity to chemotherapy in several diseases. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which curcumin affects the resistance of AML to Adriamycin by regulating HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) expression. Cell viability, colony-formation, flow cytometry, and Transwell assays were used to assess cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the interaction between microRNA (miR)-20a-5p and HOTAIR or Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1). RT-qPCR and Western blotting assays were performed to detect gene and protein expression. The results showed that curcumin suppressed the resistance to Adriamycin, inhibited the expression of HOTAIR and WT1, and promoted the expression of miR-20a-5p in human acute leukemia cells (HL-60) or Adriamycin-resistant HL-60 cells (HL-60/ADR). Furthermore, curcumin suppressed proliferation and promoted apoptosis of HL-60/ADR cells. Overexpression of HOTAIR reversed the regulatory effect of curcumin on apoptosis and migration and restored the effect of curcumin on inducing the expression of cleaved caspase3, Bax, and P27. In addition, HOTAIR upregulated WT1 expression by targeting miR-20a-5p, and inhibition of miR-20a-5p reversed the regulation of Adriamycin resistance by curcumin in AML cells. Finally, curcumin inhibited Adriamycin resistance by suppressing the HOTAIR/miR-20a-5p/WT1 pathway in vivo. In short, curcumin suppressed the proliferation and migration, blocked the cell cycle progression of AML cells, and sensitized AML cells to Adriamycin by regulating the HOTAIR/miR-20a-5p/WT1 axis.

The longevity increase has been accompanied by a higher incidence of cardiovascular events (CVE) that can be explained due to the sum of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) together with the secondary effects of the TKI. The effect of the TKI over the blood pressure control is still unknown. An observational cross-sectional study of patients with CML under treatment with TKI (imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib) was conducted. Blood pressure was analyzed through sphygmomanometer and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). A total of 73 patients were included, 57 treated with a single line of treatment. 32.9% of the total of individuals under this study showed uncontrolled blood pressure according to the ABPM. The factors related to uncontrolled BP were overweight, dyslipidemia, alcohol use, pulse wave velocity a high/very high cardiovascular risk. The subjects who received treatment with nilotinib did present worse control of their blood pressure in ABPM than those treated with imatinib and dasatinib (p = 0.041). This finding could indicate that an uncontrolled blood pressure is implied in the pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic mechanism underlying the development of the cardiovascular disease in those patients under treatment with nilotinib. The ABPM is a useful tool in the diagnosis and treatment of HT, being the reason why it should be included in the assessment of patients with CML whose HT diagnosis proves uncertain.","['Roa-Chamorro, Ricardo', 'Jaen-Aguila, Fernando', 'Puerta-Puerta, Jose Manuel', 'Torres-Quintero, Lucia', 'Gonzalez-Bustos, Pablo', 'Mediavilla-Garcia, Juan Diego']","['Roa-Chamorro R', 'Jaen-Aguila F', 'Puerta-Puerta JM', 'Torres-Quintero L', 'Gonzalez-Bustos P', 'Mediavilla-Garcia JD']","['Vascular Risk Unit, Internal Medicine, Virgen de las Nieves Hospital, Granada, Spain. ricardoroa@gmail.com.', 'Vascular Risk Unit, Internal Medicine, Virgen de las Nieves Hospital, Granada, Spain.', 'Hematology, Virgen de las Nieves Hospital, Granada, Spain.', 'Cardiology, Virgen de las Nieves Hospital, Granada, Spain.', 'Vascular Risk Unit, Internal Medicine, Virgen de las Nieves Hospital, Granada, Spain.', 'Vascular Risk Unit, Internal Medicine, Virgen de las Nieves Hospital, Granada, Spain.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20210719,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Heart Disease Risk Factors', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/chemically induced/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Spain/epidemiology']",PMC8289992,,,2021/07/21 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/07/20 06:38'],"['2021/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/20 06:38 [entrez]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-021-94127-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-021-94127-2 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2021 Jul 19;11(1):14637. doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-94127-2.,14637,['(c) 2021.

Patients with AML often have poor clinical prognoses. Hypoxia can activate a series of immunosuppressive processes in tumors, resulting in diseases and poor clinical prognoses. However, how to evaluate the severity of hypoxia in tumor immune microenvironment remains unknown. In this study, we downloaded the profiles of RNA sequence and clinicopathological data of pediatric AML patients from Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) database, as well as those of AML patients from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). In order to explore the immune microenvironment in AML, we established a risk signature to predict clinical prognosis. Our data showed that patients with high hypoxia risk score had shorter overall survival, indicating that higher hypoxia risk scores was significantly linked to immunosuppressive microenvironment in AML. Further analysis showed that the hypoxia could be used to serve as an independent prognostic indicator for AML patients. Moreover, we found gene sets enriched in high-risk AML group participated in the carcinogenesis. In summary, the established hypoxia-related risk model could act as an independent predictor for the clinical prognosis of AML, and also reflect the response intensity of the immune microenvironment in AML.","['Jiang, Feng', 'Mao, Yan', 'Lu, Binbin', 'Zhou, Guoping', 'Wang, Jimei']","['Jiang F', 'Mao Y', 'Lu B', 'Zhou G', 'Wang J']","['Department of Neonatology, Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Fudan University, No. 419, Fangxie Road, Shanghai, 200011, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Neonatology, Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Fudan University, No. 419, Fangxie Road, Shanghai, 200011, China. wjm821920@163.com.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210719,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/genetics/immunology', 'Child', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'RNA-Seq', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transcriptome/immunology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*genetics/immunology']",PMC8289869,,,2021/07/21 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/07/20 06:33'],"['2021/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/20 06:33 [entrez]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-021-94128-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-021-94128-1 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2021 Jul 19;11(1):14657. doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-94128-1.,14657,['(c) 2021.

Its repressor function regulates specific transcriptional programs. During the development of invariant NKT cells, PLZF is expressed and directs their effector program, but the detailed mechanisms underlying PLZF regulation of multistage NKT cell developmental program are not well understood. This study investigated the role of acetylation-induced PLZF activation on NKT cell development by analyzing mice expressing a mutant form of PLZF mimicking constitutive acetylation (PLZF(ON)) mice. NKT populations in PLZF(ON) mice were reduced in proportion and numbers of cells, and the cells present were blocked at the transition from developmental stage 1 to stage 2. NKT cell subset differentiation was also altered, with T-bet(+) NKT1 and RORgammat(+) NKT17 subsets dramatically reduced and the emergence of a T-bet(-)RORgammat(-) NKT cell subset with features of cells in early developmental stages rather than mature NKT2 cells. Preliminary analysis of DNA methylation patterns suggested that activated PLZF acts on the DNA methylation signature to regulate NKT cells' entry into the early stages of development while repressing maturation. In wild-type NKT cells, deacetylation of PLZF is possible, allowing subsequent NKT cell differentiation. Interestingly, development of other innate lymphoid and myeloid cells that are dependent on PLZF for their generation is not altered in PLZF(ON) mice, highlighting lineage-specific regulation. Overall, we propose that specific epigenetic control of PLZF through acetylation levels is required to regulate normal NKT cell differentiation.","['Klibi, Jihene', 'Joseph, Claudine', 'Delord, Marc', 'Teissandier, Aurelie', 'Lucas, Bruno', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Toubert, Antoine', ""Bourc'his, Deborah"", 'Guidez, Fabien', 'Benlagha, Kamel']","['Klibi J', 'Joseph C', 'Delord M', 'Teissandier A', 'Lucas B', 'Chomienne C', 'Toubert A', ""Bourc'his D"", 'Guidez F', 'Benlagha K']","['Institut de Recherche Saint-Louis, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, INSERM U1160, Paris, France; kamel.benlagha@inserm.fr jihene.klibi@aphp.fr fabien.guidez@inserm.fr.', 'Institut de Recherche Saint-Louis, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, INSERM U1160, Paris, France.', 'Plateforme de Bioinformatique et Biostatistique, Institut de Recherche Saint-Louis, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Genetique et Biologie du Developpement, Institut Curie, CNRS UMR 3215/INSERM U934, Paris, Cedex 05, France.', 'Institut Cochin, Universite Paris Descartes, CNRS UMR 8104, INSERM U1016, Paris, France; and.', 'Institut de Recherche Saint-Louis, Universite de Paris, UMRS 1131, INSERM, Paris, France.', 'Institut de Recherche Saint-Louis, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, INSERM U1160, Paris, France.', 'Genetique et Biologie du Developpement, Institut Curie, CNRS UMR 3215/INSERM U934, Paris, Cedex 05, France.', 'Institut de Recherche Saint-Louis, Universite de Paris, UMRS 1131, INSERM, Paris, France kamel.benlagha@inserm.fr jihene.klibi@aphp.fr fabien.guidez@inserm.fr.', 'Institut de Recherche Saint-Louis, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, INSERM U1160, Paris, France; kamel.benlagha@inserm.fr jihene.klibi@aphp.fr fabien.guidez@inserm.fr.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0455-6749', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9836-9089', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0322-3977', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7308-7317', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1380-4473']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Comment']",20210719,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Immunity, Innate', '*Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Natural Killer T-Cells/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein']",,,,2021/07/21 06:00,2021/08/03 06:00,['2021/07/20 06:11'],"['2020/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/20 06:11 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.2001444 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.2001444 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2021 Aug 1;207(3):809-823. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.2001444.

Recently, a membrane-bound 82kDa variant of proMMP-9 identified on myeloid blasts was shown to be associated with prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To investigate the role of 82kDa proMMP-9 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL), we performed flow-cytometry analysis of expression on ALL blasts (n=18) and CLL lymphocytes (n=21) from blood and correlated data with clinical parameters. RESULTS: In ALL, mature B-linear blasts expressed higher levels of 82kDa proMMP-9 compared to T-linear blasts. Elevated levels of 82kDa proMMP-9 were found in elderly patients and at patients with relapse. No correlation was observed on blood cells and extramedullary disease. In CLL, the 82kDa proMMP-9 expression did not correlate with any of the clinical parameters. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that higher levels of 82kDa proMMP-9 expression on blast cells may correlate with a more unfavorable ALL-subtype. Further studies are required to clarify the prognostic role of the 82kDa pro-MMP-9 expression.","['Schmohl, Joerg', 'Moebius, Sabine', 'Guenther, Thomas', 'Pepeldjyika, Elena', 'Seidel, Corinna L', 'Sutanto, Wishnu', 'Schuster, Friedhelm', 'Kraemer, Doris', 'Salih, Helmut', 'Hartmann, Amely', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Ries, Christian', 'Schmetzer, Helga']","['Schmohl J', 'Moebius S', 'Guenther T', 'Pepeldjyika E', 'Seidel CL', 'Sutanto W', 'Schuster F', 'Kraemer D', 'Salih H', 'Hartmann A', 'Tischer J', 'Ries C', 'Schmetzer H']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Diakonie Hospital Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Department for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Medical Department 3, University Hospital of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Medical Department 3, University Hospital of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Medical Department 3, University Hospital of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Orthodontics and Orofacial Orthopedics, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen and Friedrich-Alexander Universitat (FAU) Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Medical Department 3, University Hospital of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department for Paediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, Oncology and Palliative Care, Kath.

DATA SOURCES: These include published articles (PubMed) and national and international guideline documents. CONCLUSION: BTK inhibitors have revolutionized the therapy of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and have become the most frequently used therapy today. Despite the many advantages of BTK inhibitors, adverse events remain a leading cause of treatment discontinuation, particularly for the first-in-class BTK inhibitor. Second-generation BTK inhibitors appear to have a better tolerability profile but still require adverse event management given their prolonged duration of therapy. Awareness and management of side effects by the oncology care team is essential for ensuring both compliance and safety with ongoing treatment. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a chronic illness with a long-life expectancy. For the patients who require therapy, BTK inhibitor therapy is a frequently applied treatment with impressive efficacy. BTK inhibitors are continued indefinitely until disease progression or significant toxicity; therefore, the overall principles of careful assessment for side effects, diligent management for these, and individualized patient support provided by oncology nurses is vital in this patient population.","['Randhawa, Baljit', 'Lewis, Ellen', 'Owen, Carolyn']","['Randhawa B', 'Lewis E', 'Owen C']","['Alberta Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinic, Tom Baker Cancer Center, Alberta Health Services, Calgary, Alb, Canada.', 'Alberta Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinic, Tom Baker Cancer Center, Alberta Health Services, Calgary, Alb, Canada.', 'Associate Professor, Division of Hematology & Hematological Malignancies, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alb, Canada.

In this single-center study from Turkey, the diagnostic intervals and survival status of 138 children with solid tumors and lymphoma (excluding leukemia) were prospectively evaluated. The median total interval (from the beginning of the first cancer-related symptom to the first day of the cancer-specific therapy), the median patient interval (the time interval from the notification of the first cancer-related symptom to the first admission to a healthcare facility), and the median physician interval (the time interval between the first healthcare admission to the first pediatric oncology visit) were 65, 26, and 24 days, respectively. The estimated 5-year overall survival and event-free survival rates were 80.7% and 69.1%, respectively. The longer time intervals were correlated with age, paternal education, localization, and tumor type. Interestingly, none of the time parameters were found to be associated with survival on regression analysis. In conclusion, the diagnostic delay in children with cancer is multifactorial, and the patient- and disease-related factors are as important as the time intervals on survival.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/08880018.2021.1951903.","['Ocak, Suheyla', 'Sen, Hilal Susam', 'Turkkan, Emine']","['Ocak S', 'Sen HS', 'Turkkan E']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Ministry of Health Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Ministry of Health Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Afyonkarahisar University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Ministry of Health Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7479-7444'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210720,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,,,,,2021/07/21 06:00,2021/07/21 06:00,['2021/07/20 05:30'],"['2021/07/20 05:30 [entrez]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/08880018.2021.1951903 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2021 Jul 20:1-11. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2021.1951903.,1-11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of miRNA in leukemia pathogenesis is still emerging, but several studies have suggested using miRNA expression profiles as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and response to therapy in leukemia. In this review, the role of miRNAs most frequently involved in leukemia pathogenesis is discussed, focusing on the class of circulating miRNAs, consisting of cell-free RNA molecules detected in several body fluids. Circulating miRNAs could represent new potential non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of leukemia that are easy to isolate and characterize. The dysregulation of some miRNAs involved in both myeloid and lymphoid leukemia, such as miR-155, miR-29, let-7, and miR-15a/miR-16-1 clusters is discussed, showing their possible employment as therapeutic targets.","['Anelli, Luisa', 'Zagaria, Antonella', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Musto, Pellegrino', 'Albano, Francesco']","['Anelli L', 'Zagaria A', 'Specchia G', 'Musto P', 'Albano F']","['Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70100 Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70100 Bari, Italy.', ""School of Medicine, University of Bari 'Aldo Moro', 70100 Bari, Italy."", 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70100 Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70100 Bari, Italy.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3277-6594', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7926-6052']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210702,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Circular)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/*blood', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/therapy', 'MicroRNAs/*blood', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'RNA, Circular/metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/metabolism']",PMC8269043,['NOTNLM'],"['biomarkers', 'circulating miRNAs', 'dysregulated expression', 'epigenetic miRNAs']",2021/07/21 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2021/07/20 01:03'],"['2021/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/20 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22137156 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22137156 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Jul 2;22(13). pii: ijms22137156. doi: 10.3390/ijms22137156.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Systemic chemotherapy is considered the primary treatment strategy; unfortunately, healthy cells are also affected to a large extent, leading to severe side effects of this treatment. Targeted drug therapies are becoming increasingly popular in modern medicine, as they bypass normal tissues and cells. Two-dimensional MoS2-based nanomaterials have attracted attention in the biomedical field as promising agents for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Cancer cells typically (over)express distinctive cytoplasmic membrane-anchored or -spanning protein-based structures (e.g., receptors, enzymes) that distinguish them from healthy, non-cancerous cells. Targeting cancer cells via tumor-specific markers using MoS2-based nanocarriers loaded with labels or drugs can significantly improve specificity and reduce side effects of such treatment. SKM-1 is an established AML cell line that has been employed in various bio-research applications. However, to date, it has not been used as the subject of studies on selective cancer targeting by inorganic nanomaterials. Here, we demonstrate an efficient targeting of AML cells using MoS2nanoflakes prepared by a facile exfoliation route and functionalized with anti-CD33 antibody that binds to CD33 receptors expressed by SKM-1 cells. Microscopic analyses by confocal laser scanning microscopy supplemented by label-free confocal Raman microscopy proved that (anti-CD33)-MoS2conjugates were present on the cell surface and within SKM-1 cells, presumably having been internalized via CD33-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, the cellular uptake of SKM-1 specific (anti-CD33)-MoS2conjugates assessed by flow cytometry analysis was significantly higher compared with the cellular uptake of SKM-1 nonspecific (anti-GPC3)-MoS2conjugates. Our results indicate the importance of appropriate functionalization of MoS2nanomaterials by tumor-recognizing elements that significantly increase their specificity and hence suggest the utilization of MoS2-based nanomaterials in the diagnosis and therapy of AML.","['Stefik, Pavol', 'Annusova, Adriana', 'Lakatos, Boris', 'Elefantova, Katarina', 'Cepcova, Lucia', 'Hofbauerova, Monika', 'Kalosi, Anna', 'Jergel, Matej', 'Majkova, Eva', 'Siffalovic, Peter']","['Stefik P', 'Annusova A', 'Lakatos B', 'Elefantova K', 'Cepcova L', 'Hofbauerova M', 'Kalosi A', 'Jergel M', 'Majkova E', 'Siffalovic P']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Faculty of Chemical and Food Technology, Slovak University of Technology, Radlinskeho 9, 81237 Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Institute of Physics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 84511 Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Centre for Advanced Materials Application, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 84511 Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Faculty of Chemical and Food Technology, Slovak University of Technology, Radlinskeho 9, 81237 Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Faculty of Chemical and Food Technology, Slovak University of Technology, Radlinskeho 9, 81237 Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Faculty of Chemical and Food Technology, Slovak University of Technology, Radlinskeho 9, 81237 Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Institute of Physics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 84511 Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Centre for Advanced Materials Application, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 84511 Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Institute of Physics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 84511 Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Centre for Advanced Materials Application, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 84511 Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Institute of Physics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 84511 Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Centre for Advanced Materials Application, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 84511 Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Institute of Physics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 84511 Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Centre for Advanced Materials Application, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 84511 Bratislava, Slovakia.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4644-5657', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3769-9287', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0107-9999', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8567-3794', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3309-128X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6329-3782', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4482-7881', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9597-9247', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9807-0810']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210804,England,Biomed Mater,"Biomedical materials (Bristol, England)",101285195,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*MoS2 nanoflake conjugate', '*SKM-1', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*biotin-avidin', '*label-free Raman imaging', '*receptor-specific targeting']",2021/07/20 06:00,2021/07/20 06:00,['2021/07/19 20:30'],"['2021/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/19 20:30 [entrez]']",['10.1088/1748-605X/ac15b1 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Mater. 2021 Aug 4;16(5). doi: 10.1088/1748-605X/ac15b1.,,['(c) 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heme synthesis in eukaryotes is tightly regulated by the mitochondrial AAA+ unfoldase CLPX (caseinolytic mitochondrial matrix peptidase chaperone subunit X), which promotes heme synthesis by activation of delta-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS/Hem1) in yeast and regulates turnover of ALAS1 in human cells. However, the specific mechanisms by which CLPX regulates heme synthesis are unclear. In this study, we interrogated the mechanisms by which CLPX regulates heme synthesis in erythroid cells. Quantitation of enzyme activity and protein degradation showed that ALAS2 stability and activity were both increased in the absence of CLPX, suggesting that CLPX primarily regulates ALAS2 by control of its turnover, rather than its activation. However, we also showed that CLPX is required for PPOX (protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase) activity and maintenance of FECH (ferrochelatase) levels, which are the terminal enzymes in heme synthesis, likely accounting for the heme deficiency and porphyrin accumulation observed in Clpx(-/-) cells. Lastly, CLPX is required for iron utilization for hemoglobin synthesis during erythroid differentiation. Collectively, our data show that the role of CLPX in yeast ALAS/Hem1 activation is not conserved in vertebrates as vertebrates rely on CLPX to regulate ALAS turnover as well as PPOX and FECH activity. Our studies reveal that CLPX mutations may cause anemia and porphyria via dysregulation of ALAS, FECH, and PPOX activities, as well as of iron metabolism.","['Rondelli, Catherine M', 'Perfetto, Mark', 'Danoff, Aidan', 'Bergonia, Hector', 'Gillis, Samantha', ""O'Neill, Leah"", 'Jackson, Laurie', 'Nicolas, Gael', 'Puy, Herve', 'West, Richard', 'Phillips, John D', 'Yien, Yvette Y']","['Rondelli CM', 'Perfetto M', 'Danoff A', 'Bergonia H', 'Gillis S', ""O'Neill L"", 'Jackson L', 'Nicolas G', 'Puy H', 'West R', 'Phillips JD', 'Yien YY']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA; Pittsburgh Heart, Lung and Blood Vascular Medicine Institute and Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', ""Centre de Recherche sur l'inflammation, Universite Paris Diderot, Site Bichat, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France."", ""Centre de Recherche sur l'inflammation, Universite Paris Diderot, Site Bichat, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; Centre Francais des Porphyries, Hopital Louis Mourier, APHP, Colombes, France."", 'Delaware Biotechnology Institute, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA; Pittsburgh Heart, Lung and Blood Vascular Medicine Institute and Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.

To improve the efficacy of ASNase treatment, we used a CRISPR/Cas9-based screen to identify actionable signaling intermediates that improve the response to ASNase. Both genetic inactivation of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and pharmacological inhibition by the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib strongly synergize with ASNase by inhibiting the amino acid response pathway, a mechanism involving c-Myc-mediated suppression of GCN2 activity. This synthetic lethal interaction was observed in 90% of patient-derived xenografts, regardless of the genomic subtype. Moreover, ibrutinib substantially improved ASNase treatment response in a murine PDX model. Hence, ibrutinib may be used to enhance the clinical efficacy of ASNase in ALL.

However, classical antibody-based approaches are restricted to targeting lineage-specific cell surface antigens. By targeting intracellular antigens, a large number of other leukemia-associated targets would become accessible. In this study, we evaluated a novel T-cell bispecific (TCB) antibody, generated by using CrossMAb and knob-into-holes technology, containing a bivalent T-cell receptor-like binding domain that recognizes the RMFPNAPYL peptide derived from the intracellular tumor antigen Wilms tumor protein (WT1) in the context of HLA-A*02. Binding to CD3epsilon recruits T cells irrespective of their T-cell receptor specificity. WT1-TCB elicited antibody-mediated T-cell cytotoxicity against AML cell lines in a WT1- and HLA-restricted manner. Specific lysis of primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells was mediated in ex vivo long-term cocultures by using allogeneic (mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM] specific lysis, 67 +/- 6% after 13-14 days; n = 18) or autologous, patient-derived T cells (mean +/- SEM specific lysis, 54 +/- 12% after 11-14 days; n = 8). WT1-TCB-treated T cells exhibited higher cytotoxicity against primary AML cells than an HLA-A*02 RMF-specific T-cell clone. Combining WT1-TCB with the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide further enhanced antibody-mediated T-cell cytotoxicity against primary AML cells (mean +/- SEM specific lysis on days 3-4, 45.4 +/- 9.0% vs 70.8 +/- 8.3%; P = .015; n = 9-10). In vivo, WT1-TCB-treated humanized mice bearing SKM-1 tumors exhibited a significant and dose-dependent reduction in tumor growth. In summary, we show that WT1-TCB facilitates potent in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo killing of AML cell lines and primary AML cells; these results led to the initiation of a phase 1 trial in patients with relapsed/refractory AML (#NCT04580121).","['Augsberger, Christian', 'Hanel, Gerulf', 'Xu, Wei', 'Pulko, Vesna', 'Hanisch, Lydia Jasmin', 'Augustin, Angelique', 'Challier, John', 'Hunt,

The outcome of a second allo-HSCT (HSCT2) for relapse post-HSCT has shown promising results in some previous studies. However, little is known about the efficacy of HSCT2 in patients with relapsed/refractory acute leukemia (AL) post-chemotherapy plus modified donor lymphocyte infusion (post-Chemo + m-DLI) after the first allo-HSCT (HSCT1). Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the efficacy of HSCT2 in 28 patients with relapsed/refractory AL post-Chemo + m-DLI in our center. With a median follow-up of 918 (457-1732) days, 26 patients (92.9%) achieved complete remission, and 2 patients exhibited persistent disease. The probabilities of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) 1 year after HSCT2 were 25.0% and 21.4%, respectively. The cumulative incidences of nonrelapse mortality on day 100 and at 1 year post-HSCT2 were 7.1% +/- 4.9% and 25.0% +/- 8.4%. The cumulative incidences of relapse were 50.0% +/- 9.8% and 53.5% +/- 9.9% at 1 and 2 years post-HSCT2, respectively. Risk stratification prior to HSCT1 and percentage of blasts before HSCT2 were independent risk factors for OS post-HSCT2, and relapse within 6 months post-HSCT1 was an independent risk factor for DFS and relapse post-HSCT2.

Data were extracted for patients 15 years or older with a primary diagnosis of CLL. A period analysis was performed to estimate 5- and 10-year relative survival rates for patients diagnosed during different calendar periods from 1985 to 2015. A mixture cure model was used to examine long-term survivors' proportions among patients diagnosed in 1985-2015 and for two cohorts diagnosed in 2000-2003, followed up to 2012 and 2004-2007, and followed up to 2015. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used for the two cohorts to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of death adjusted for gender and age. The 5-year and 10-year age-adjusted relative survival rate ranged between 73.7 and 89.4% and from 51.6% to ""not reached,"" respectively, for calendar periods of 1985-1989 to 2010-2014. The long-term survivor proportions varied by age and gender from 0 to 59%. The HRs (95%CI) for the 2004-2007 cohort in comparison to the 2000-2003 cohort were 0.58 (0.43-0.78), 0.58 (0.48-0.70), 0.57 (0.49-0.0.67), 0.68 (0.54-0.85), and 0.83 (0.68-1.02) for the age categories of 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, and >/= 85 years, respectively.

The rarity of this entity poses many challenges in understanding its biology and outcomes seen and the optimal treatment approach. We utilized the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) database to identify patients diagnosed with CLL/SLL between 2000 and 2016 and subsequently had a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), thus capturing those who experienced an RT event. We compared the outcomes of those patients to those of patients in the database diagnosed with DLBCL without a preceding CLL/SLL diagnosis. We identified 530 patients who developed RT out of 74,116 patients diagnosed with CLL/SLL in the specified period. The median age at RT diagnosis was 66 years, and the median time from CLL/SLL diagnosis to RT development was roughly 4 years. Patients with RT had a dismal outcome with median overall survival of 10 months. We identified advanced Ann Arbor stage (III/IV) and prior treatment for CLL as predictors of worse outcome in patients with RT. Our study represents the largest dataset of patients with CLL/SLL and RT and adds to the existing literature indicating the poor outcomes for those patients.","['Elnair, Radowan', 'Ellithi, Moataz', 'Kallam, Avyakta', 'Shostrom, Valerie', 'Bociek, Robert G']","['Elnair R', 'Ellithi M', 'Kallam A', 'Shostrom V', 'Bociek RG']","['Division of Oncology and Hematology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, 68198, USA. radowan.elnair@unmc.edu.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Sanford School of Medicine, University of South Dakota, Vermillion, SD, USA.', 'Division of Oncology and Hematology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, 68198, USA.', 'College of Public Health, Department of Biostatistics, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Division of Oncology and Hematology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, 68198, USA.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6159-3768'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210719,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', ""Richter's syndrome"", ""Richter's transformation""]",2021/07/20 06:00,2021/09/25 06:00,['2021/07/19 12:59'],"['2021/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/19 12:59 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-021-04603-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-021-04603-y [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2021 Oct;100(10):2513-2519. doi: 10.1007/s00277-021-04603-y.

Therefore, these assays represent an essential tool that mimics the in vivo degranulation process, which occurs upon allergen exposure in sensitized patients or in skin prick tests. Additionally, these assays are usually employed to investigate the allergenic potential of proteins and the reactivity of patients' sera's reactivity. Herein, we describe a simple 2-day protocol using an immortalized rat basophil leukemia cell line transfected and humanized with the human high-affinity IgE plasma-membrane receptor (FcepsilonRI). This variant of the mediator release assay is a robust, sensitive, and reproducible in vitro cell-based system without the need to immobilize the antigen to solid matrices. The protocol consists of the following steps: (1) complement inactivation of human sera, (2) harvesting, seeding, and passive sensitization of the cells, (3) stimulation with antigen to cause mediator release, and (4) measuring of beta-hexosaminidase activity as a surrogate for the released inflammatory mediators, such as histamine. The assay represents a useful tool to assess the capacity of the allergen-IgE cross-linking to trigger cell degranulation and can be implemented to standardize allergen extracts, to compare patients' reactivity to minor or major allergens and to allergenic extracts (pollen, cat dander, etc.), to investigate the potency of allergen homologs, isoforms, and fold-variants (e.g., hypoallergenicity), as well as the effects of ligands on the allergenic activity. A more recent application includes the use of the assay to monitor the treatment efficacy in the course of allergen immunotherapy.","['Wenger, Mario', 'Bethanis, Athanasios', 'Johnson, Litty', 'Aglas, Lorenz']","['Wenger M', 'Bethanis A', 'Johnson L', 'Aglas L']","['Department of Biosciences, University of Salzburg.', 'Department of Biosciences, University of Salzburg.', 'Department of Biosciences, University of Salzburg.', 'Department of Biosciences, University of Salzburg; lorenz.aglas@sbg.ac.at.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",20210629,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (Allergens)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['*Allergens', 'Animals', 'Basophils', 'Cats', 'Cell Degranulation', 'Humans', '*Immunoglobulin E', 'Pollen', 'Rats']",,,,2021/07/20 06:00,2021/10/16 06:00,['2021/07/19 12:53'],"['2021/07/19 12:53 [entrez]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/62702 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2021 Jun 29;(172). doi: 10.3791/62702.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined asparagine, aspartate, glutamine and glutamate in stool samples from patients over pegaspargase treatment. Microbial gene-products, which interact with these AAs were identified. Stool asparagine declined significantly, and 31 microbial genes changed over treatment. Changes were complex, and included genes involved in AA metabolism, nutrient sensing, and pathways increased in cancers. While we identified changes in a gene (iaaA) with limited asparaginase activity, it lacked significance after correction leaving open other mechanisms for asparagine decline, possibly including loss from gut to blood. Understanding pathways that change AA availability, including by microbes in the gut, could be useful in optimizing pegaspargase therapy.","['Dunn, Katherine A', 'Forbrigger, Zara', 'Connors, Jessica', 'Rahman, Mushfiqur', 'Cohen, Alejandro', 'Van Limbergen, Johan', 'Langille, Morgan G I', 'Stadnyk, Andrew W', 'Bielawski, Joseph P', 'Penny, Susanne L', 'MacDonald, Tamara', 'Kulkarni, Ketan']","['Dunn KA', 'Forbrigger Z', 'Connors J', 'Rahman M', 'Cohen A', 'Van Limbergen J', 'Langille MGI', 'Stadnyk AW', 'Bielawski JP', 'Penny SL', 'MacDonald T', 'Kulkarni K']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Dalhousie University/IWK Health Centre, Halifax, Canada.', 'Department of Biology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Dalhousie University/IWK Health Centre, Halifax, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada.', 'Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Core Facility.

We recently reported that post-TKI discontinuation of IFN-alpha therapy could prevent molecular relapse (MR, BCR-ABL1(IS) > 0.1%). Here, we evaluated whether NK cells are associated with MR and investigated the effects of post-TKI discontinuation IFN-alpha therapy on lymphocyte subsets. A total of 34 patients measuring blood lymphocyte subclasses were included. In the 22 patients who did not receive IFN-alpha therapy, at 1 month after TKI discontinuation, the nonrelapsed patients showed a significantly higher proportion and count of NK cells than the relapsed patients. In particular, the proportion and count of CD56dim NK cells were significantly higher in the nonrelapsed patients than in the relapsed patients. In the 12 patients who received IFN-alpha therapy, the level of CD56bright NK cells increased significantly after 3 and 6 months of IFN-alpha therapy. In summary, NK cells, in particular CD56dim NK cells, were associated with MR after TKI discontinuation in patients with CML. Additionally, IFN-alpha therapy gradually increased the level of CD56bright NK cells in patients with CML.","['Kong, Jun', 'Qin, Ya-Zhen', 'Zhao, Xiao-Su', 'Hou, Yue', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun', 'Jiang, Hao']","['Kong J', 'Qin YZ', 'Zhao XS', 'Hou Y', 'Liu KY', 'Huang XJ', 'Jiang H']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Centre for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, No. 11, Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Centre for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, No. 11, Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Centre for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, No. 11, Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Centre for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, No. 11, Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Centre for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, No. 11, Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Centre for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, No. 11, Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Centre for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, No. 11, Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China. 2516735116@qq.com.""]",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9398-8526'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210719,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/prevention & control', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Interferon', 'Natural killer cell', 'Treatment-free remission', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2021/07/20 06:00,2021/09/25 06:00,['2021/07/19 06:13'],"['2021/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/19 06:13 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-021-04606-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-021-04606-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2021 Oct;100(10):2557-2566. doi: 10.1007/s00277-021-04606-9.

First, the authors wish to revise the wording of the third and fourth paragraphs of the Discussion, as featured on pp. 1101-1102, to the following (changed text is indicated in bold): 'We showed that CRT exerts anti-AD effect through inhibition of the mast cell degranulation in mast cells. Upon IgE/antigen stimulation, the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) region of FcepsilonRI receptor which is on the mast cell surface is phosphorylated and the initial signalling protein kinases Lyn and Syk are recruited to the ITAM (28,29). Then, the activated Lyn and Syk leads to phosphorylation of the transmembrane adaptor linker for activation of T cells (LAT). Phosphorylated LAT which is a scaffold for multimolecular signalling complexes and activates PLCgamma through phosphorylation. The activated PLCgamma hydrolyses phosphatidylinositol biphosphate (PIP2) to generate second signalling molecules IP3 and DAG, which activate PKCs including PKCdelta to induce the mast cell degranulation (30,31). On the other hand, cross-linking of FcepsilonRI also activates IKKbeta, which moves to the lipid raft fractions and phosphorylates synaptosomal-associated protein 23 (SNAP-23) leading to degranulation (7). Since PKCdelta phosphorylates IKKalpha, but not IKKbeta (32), it is not likely that two signalling pathways are directly connected. In this study, novel function of CRT on phosphorylations of Lyn/Syk kinases in mast cells is elucidated for the first time. Furthermore, it is likely that this inhibitory effect of CRT on Lyn/Syk kinases negatively affected activities of their downstream signalling molecules including PLCgamma, PKCdelta, and IKKbeta, which leads to decrease in mast cell degranulation by CRT treatment. Besides the inhibitory effect of CRT on mast cell degranulation, here we provide additional evidence that CRT exerts anti-AD effects through inactivation of MAPK and NFkappaB. It has been reported that CRT regulates the activities of MAPK and NFkappaB in various cell types. In rhabdomyosarcoma, hepatoma, and breast carcinoma, CRT activates MAPK p38/JNK and suppresses ERK1/2, followed by caspase-independent apoptosis (10,33,34). In chronic myeloid leukaemia cells, CRT enhances TNFalpha-induced apoptosis through the activation of MAPK p38 (35). In smooth muscle cells, CRT exerts anti-migration/invasion effect as it inhibits TNFalpha/NFkappaB signalling pathway (36).' Secondly, the authors wish to make the following changes to the Reference list: New references 30-32 have been inserted to the list, as follows: 30. Ozawa K, Szallasi Z, Kazanietz MG, Blumberg PM, Mischak H, Mushinski JF and Beaven MA: Ca(2+)-dependent and Ca(2+)-independent isozymes of protein kinase C mediate exocytosis in antigen-stimulated rat basophilic RBL-2H3 cell.

The addition of these new references means that the former references 30-33 have been accordingly renumbered to references 33-36.

Genetic and epigenetic abnormalities, as well as microenvironmental factors, including cytokines, serve critical roles in leukaemogenesis. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has been presented as one of the key regulators in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. This article focuses on the functional role of MIF and its pathway in cancer, particularly in leukemia. MIF/CD74 interaction serves prominent roles in tumor cell survival, such as upregulating BCL2 and CD84 expression, and activating receptortype tyrosine phosphatase zeta. Furthermore, MIF upregulation forms a protumor microenvironment in response to hypoxiainduced factors and promotes proinflammatory cytokine production. Additionally, polymorphisms of the MIF promoter sequence are associated with leukemia development. MIF signaltargeted early clinical trials show positive results. Overall, these efforts provide a promising means for intervention in leukemia.","['Luo, Yaosheng', 'Wang, Xiao', 'Shen, Jie', 'Yao, Jie']","['Luo Y', 'Wang X', 'Shen J', 'Yao J']","[""Department of Laboratory and Medical Research Center, Shunde Hospital, Southern Medical University (The First People's Hospital of Shunde Foshan), Foshan, Guangdong 528308, P.R.

Here, we generated a fully functional epitope-tagged Nanos2 mouse allele and applied the highly stringent cross-linking and analysis of cDNAs to define NANOS2 RNA occupancy in SSC lines. NANOS2 recognizes the AUKAAWU consensus motif, mostly found in the 3' untranslated region of defined messenger RNAs (mRNAs). We find that NANOS2 is a regulator of key signaling and metabolic pathways whose dosage or activity are known to be critical for SSC maintenance. NANOS2 interacts with components of CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex in SSC lines, and consequently, NANOS2 binding reduces the half-lives of target transcripts.

Inactivation of the DLEU7 gene is frequently observed in patients with CLL. Furthermore, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been observed to have a critical role in the pathogenesis of several cancers, including leukemia. Considering the tumor-suppressive role of DLEU7, as well as the tumor suppressor or oncogenic role of microRNAs (miRNAs), the aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential miRNAs targeting the DLEU7 gene in B-cells and explore expression changes these genes in the plasma of B-CLL patients. Methods: The miRNAs interacting with the DLEU7 gene were predicted and selected using bioinformatics tools. A total of 80 plasma samples were collected from 40 patients with B-cells and 40 healthy individuals, then subjected to RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. The expression profiles of the predicted miRNAs and the DLEU7 gene in the plasma of B-CLL patients and healthy individuals were determined by RT-qPCR analysis. Results: The bioinformatics prediction indicated that miR-15b and miR-195 target the DLEU7 gene. The expression levels of miR-15b and miR-195 were significantly higher in the plasma of patients with B-CLL compared to the healthy individuals (91.6, p= 0.001) (169, p= 0.001). However, the expression level of the DLEU7 gene was found to be significantly lower in the patient group compared to healthy controls (0.304, p= 0.001). Conclusion: Both miR-15b and miR-195, have the potential to function as novel and non-invasive biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with B-CLL.","['Bagheri, Malihe', 'Khansarinejad, Behzad', 'Mosayebi, Ghasem', 'Moradabadi, Alireza', 'Mondanizadeh, Mahdieh']","['Bagheri M', 'Khansarinejad B', 'Mosayebi G', 'Moradabadi A', 'Mondanizadeh M']","['Department of Biotechnology and Molecular Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Department of hematology and blood banking, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Molecular Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Molecular and Medicine Research Center, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Iran,Rep Biochem Mol Biol,Reports of biochemistry & molecular biology,101637937,,,,PMC8279715,['NOTNLM'],"['B-CLL', 'Biomarker', 'DLEU7', 'RT-QPCR', 'miRNA']",2021/07/20 06:00,2021/07/20 06:01,['2021/07/19 06:01'],"['2020/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/19 06:01 [entrez]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.52547/rbmb.10.1.20 [doi]', 'rbmb-10-020 [pii]']",ppublish,Rep Biochem Mol Biol. 2021 Apr;10(1):20-29. doi: 10.52547/rbmb.10.1.20.,20-29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ever since its first approval for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in 2017, CAR T-cell therapy has been found to be efficacious in various other lymphoid malignancies, with recent approvals in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Although CAR T-cell therapeutics offer a novel immunotherapeutic approach to treat otherwise refractory malignancies, the plethora of studies/products and complexities in manufacturing and administration have led to several challenges for clinicians and the healthcare system as a whole. Some of the areas of unmet need include manufacturing delays, short persistence of CAR T-cells in circulation, lack of predictive biomarkers for efficacy and toxicity, and high cost of therapy. In this review, we evaluate the existing data on the efficacy and safety of CAR T-cell therapies in mature lymphoid malignancies [lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and multiple myeloma]. We also provide an in-depth review of the challenges posed by CAR T-cell therapeutics and potential strategies to overcome them. With newer CAR T-cell products and incorporation of measures to mitigate toxicities pertaining to cytokine release and neurological syndromes, there is a potential to overcome several of these challenges in the near future. Finally, as CAR T-cell therapy gains regulatory approval for more indications, there is a need to tackle the financial toxicity posed by this modality to sustain patient access.","['Narkhede, Mayur', 'Mehta, Amitkumar', 'Ansell, Stephen M', 'Goyal, Gaurav']","['Narkhede M', 'Mehta A', 'Ansell SM', 'Goyal G']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,China,Ann Transl Med,Annals of translational medicine,101617978,,,,PMC8267254,['NOTNLM'],"['Hodgkin', 'Lymphoma', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', 'cost', 'mantle', 'myeloma', 'toxicities']",2021/07/20 06:00,2021/07/20 06:01,['2021/07/19 06:01'],"['2020/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/19 06:01 [entrez]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/atm-20-5546 [doi]', 'atm-09-12-1036 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Transl Med. 2021 Jun;9(12):1036. doi: 10.21037/atm-20-5546.,1036,['2021 Annals of Translational Medicine.

In the present study, we set out to determine the cytotoxic effects of NCTD on the proliferation and apoptosis on A549 cells and their underlying mechanisms. Methods: NSCLC cell line A549 cells were cultured. A549 cells were treated with different concentrations of NCTD. Cell proliferation was detected by MTT and cell clone formation assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. After A549 cells were treated with NCTD for 24 hours, the mitochondrial membrane potential was measured. The protein expression of Bcl-2, Bax, light chain 3 (LC3), et al. was tested by western blot. The expression of LC3 and Tom20 protein was detected by immunofluorescence. Results: NCTD suppressed the proliferation of NSCLC cells while decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential and inducing G2/M phase arrest. NCTD induced apoptosis, as demonstrated by increased B-cell lymphoma 2/Bcl-2-associated X protein and Bcl-2-associated X protein/myeloid cell leukemia 1 ratios. Aside from autophagy, NCTD induced mitophagy, with an increase in LC3 expression and a decrease in sequestosome 1 (p62) expression in the cytoplasm, accompanied by increased levels of Phospho-adenosine 5'-monophosphate -activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), Phospho-c-Jun NH2-Terminal Kinase (p-JNK), and Phospho-c-jun (p-c-jun) and a decreased level of Phospho-protein kinase B (p-AKT). Conclusions: This study has elucidated that NCTD restrains NSCLC cell progression via regulation of AMPK/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/uncoordinated 51-like kinase 1 (ULK1)/JNK pathways. This evidence provides insight into a novel treatment for NSCLC.","['Liu, Zhilong', 'Li, Baoxia', 'Cao, Mingrong', 'Jiang, Jianwei']","['Liu Z', 'Li B', 'Cao M', 'Jiang J']","['Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Ann Transl Med,Annals of translational medicine,101617978,,,,PMC8267262,['NOTNLM'],"['Norcantharidin (NCTD)', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)']",2021/07/20 06:00,2021/07/20 06:01,['2021/07/19 06:01'],"['2021/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/19 06:01 [entrez]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/atm-21-2360 [doi]', 'atm-09-12-971 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Transl Med. 2021 Jun;9(12):971. doi: 10.21037/atm-21-2360.,971,['2021 Annals of Translational Medicine.

Altered cell metabolism is a hallmark of cancer, and changes in nutrient pools and fluxes are important components of the bidirectional communication between MSCs and hematological cancer cells. Among nutrients, amino acids play a significant role in cancer progression and chemo-resistance. Moreover, selected types of cancer cells are extremely greedy for glutamine, and significantly deplete the extracellular pool of the amino acid. As a consequence, this influences the behavior of MSCs in terms of either cytokine/chemokine secretion or differentiation potential. Additionally, a direct nutritional interaction exists between MSCs and immune cells. In particular, selected subpopulations of lymphocytes are dependent upon selected amino acids, such as arginine and tryptophan, for full differentiation and competence. This review describes and discusses the nutritional interactions existing in the neoplastic bone marrow niche between MSCs and other cell types, with a particular emphasis on cancer cells and immune cells. These relationships are discussed in the perspective of potential novel therapeutic strategies based on the interference on amino acid metabolism or intercellular fluxes.","['Chiu, Martina', 'Taurino, Giuseppe', 'Bianchi, Massimiliano G', 'Bussolati, Ovidio']","['Chiu M', 'Taurino G', 'Bianchi MG', 'Bussolati O']","['Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210630,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,PMC8278102,['NOTNLM'],"['amino acid transport system', 'arginine', 'asparagine', 'bone marrow', 'glutamine', 'leukemia', 'mesenchymal stromal cell', 'tryptophan']",2021/07/20 06:00,2021/07/20 06:01,['2021/07/19 06:00'],"['2021/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.714755 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Jun 30;9:714755. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.714755. eCollection 2021.,714755,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Chiu, Taurino, Bianchi and Bussolati.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After phosphorylation, it is involved in GTPase and integrin activation, and in BCR, TCR, and CXCR4 downstream signaling. In normal and leukemic B cells, HS1 is a central cytoskeletal interactor and its phosphorylation and expression are prognostic factors in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. We here introduce for the first time a super-resolution imaging study based on single-cell 3D-STED microscopy optimized for revealing and comparing the nanoscale distribution of endogenous HS1 in healthy B and CLL primary cells. Our study reveals that the endogenous HS1 forms heterogeneous nanoclusters, similar to those of YFP-HS1 overexpressed in the leukemic MEC1 cell line. HS1 nanoclusters in healthy and leukemic B cells form bulky assemblies at the basal sides, suggesting the recruitment of HS1 for cell adhesion. This observation agrees with a phasor-FLIM-FRET and STED colocalization analyses of the endogenous MEC1-HS1, indicating an increased interaction with Vimentin at the cell adhesion sites. In CLL cells isolated from patients with poor prognosis, we observed a larger accumulation of HS1 at the basal region and a higher density of HS1 nanoclusters in the central regions of the cells if compared to good-prognosis CLL and healthy B cells, suggesting a different role for the protein in the cell types analyzed. Our 3D-STED approach lays the ground for revealing tiny differences of HS1 distribution, its functionally active forms, and colocalization with protein partners.","['Sampietro, Marta', 'Zamai, Moreno', 'Diaz Torres, Alfonsa', 'Labrador Cantarero, Veronica', 'Barbaglio, Federica', 'Scarfo, Lydia', 'Scielzo, Cristina', 'Caiolfa, Valeria R']","['Sampietro M', 'Zamai M', 'Diaz Torres A', 'Labrador Cantarero V', 'Barbaglio F', 'Scarfo L', 'Scielzo C', 'Caiolfa VR']","['Malignant B Cells Biology and 3D Modeling Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Nanomedicine Center NANOMIB, School of Medicine and Surgery, Universita di Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of Microscopy and Dynamic Imaging, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Unit of Microscopy and Dynamic Imaging, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Unit of Microscopy and Dynamic Imaging, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Unit of Microscopy and Dynamic Imaging, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Malignant B Cells Biology and 3D Modeling Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'B-Cell Neoplasia Unit and Strategic Research Program on CLL, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'School of Medicine, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Malignant B Cells Biology and 3D Modeling Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of Microscopy and Dynamic Imaging, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Experimental Imaging Center, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210630,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,PMC8278786,['NOTNLM'],"['B cells', 'CLL', 'FRET', 'HS1', 'STED', 'phasor-FLIM', 'super-resolution']",2021/07/20 06:00,2021/07/20 06:01,['2021/07/19 06:00'],"['2021/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.655773 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Jun 30;9:655773. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.655773. eCollection 2021.,655773,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Sampietro, Zamai, Diaz Torres, Labrador Cantarero, Barbaglio,', 'Scarfo, Scielzo and Caiolfa.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That's It.""-A Qualitative Analysis of the Experiences and Needs of Allogenic Hematopoietic Stem Cells Transplantation Survivors in Germany.",10.3389/fpubh.2021.687675 [doi],"Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) is the only curative treatment modality for many patients affected by hematologic malignancies. However, it can cause debilitating long-term effects. Understanding the impact of alloHSCT on all aspects of the patients' life is required for optimal survivorship management. Aim: To explore in-depth HSCT-survivors' experiences and needs post-transplant. Partners were included to provide further information on survivors' needs and how care could be improved in this area. Methods: We conducted semi-structured face-to-face and phone interviews with alloHSCT-survivors and their partners referred to a survivorship clinic in Germany. Theoretical sampling was used to recruit participants. Data were analyzed using framework analysis. Results: Thirty-two survivors (consent rate: 100%, response rate: 100%) and eighteen partners (consent rate: 84%, response rate: 72%) participated. Survivors were aged between 25 and 68 years (Median: 48, IQR: 25.3) and partners were aged between 26 and 64 years (Median: 54, IQR: 16, SD: 12.8). The themes emerging from the data involved survivors' needs included (i) the diversity of long-term treatment side-effects; and (ii) time post discharge as a dynamic process with individual peaks of burden. Survivors and their partners also suggested strategies for mitigating these unmet needs, i.e., (iii) transparent communication and patient empowerment; and (iv) improvement in continuity of care system and help with claiming social benefits as cornerstones of optimal survivorship care. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is one of the first qualitative studies focused on the views of German alloHSCT-survivors on the long-term effects of alloHSCT and the first study integrating the view of their partners. Healthcare providers could better support survivors with managing their symptoms and adhering to their prescribed care by ensuring comprehensive, transparent communication that helps increase survivors' understanding and involvement in their care. Further efforts should be made to provide patient-centered, continuous survivorship care that involves additional support with navigating the healthcare and social service system. Intervention studies are required to test the effectiveness of the suggested strategies.","['Parisek, Mira', 'Loss, Julika', 'Holler, Ernst', 'Barata, Anna', 'Weber, Daniela', 'Edinger, Matthias', 'Wolff, Daniel', 'Schoemans, Helene', 'Herrmann, Anne']","['Parisek M', 'Loss J', 'Holler E', 'Barata A', 'Weber D', 'Edinger M', 'Wolff D', 'Schoemans H', 'Herrmann A']","['Faculty of Medicine, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department for Health Behaviour, Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Internal Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Health Outcomes and Behavior, Tampa, FL, United States.', 'Department of Hematology and Internal Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Internal Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Internal Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Universitaire Ziekenhuizen Leuven, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department for Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Division of Medical Sociology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, NSW, Australia.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210701,Switzerland,Front Public Health,Frontiers in public health,101616579,,IM,"['Adult', '*Aftercare', 'Aged', 'Germany', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Discharge', 'Quality of Life', 'Survivors']",PMC8280766,['NOTNLM'],"['*GvHD', '*allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells transplantation', '*framework analysis', '*patients view', '*qualitative research', '*survivorship']",2021/07/20 06:00,2021/08/05 06:00,['2021/07/19 06:00'],"['2021/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fpubh.2021.687675 [doi]'],epublish,Front Public Health. 2021 Jul 1;9:687675. doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2021.687675. eCollection 2021.,687675,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Parisek, Loss, Holler, Barata, Weber, Edinger, Wolff,', 'Schoemans and Herrmann.']",,,,"['HS has received financial compensation for advisory boards (Incyte, Janssen, and', ""Novartis), speaker's fees [Novartis, Incyte, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, the Belgian"", 'Hematological Society (BHS) and Takeda], travel grants (AbbVie, Celgene, CIBMTR,', 'EBMT, Gilead, and Incyte), and research funding (Novartis and the BHS).

We present data from children with hematologic/oncologic diseases who developed PRES after treatment of the primary disease with chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) at 3 medical centers in Changsha, China from 2015 to 2020, and review all previously reported cases with the aim of determining whether this neurologic manifestation affects the disease prognosis. In the clinical cohort of 58 PRES patients, hypertension [pooled odds ratio (OR) = 4.941, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.390, 17.570; P = 0.001] and blood transfusion (OR = 14.259, 95% CI: 3.273, 62.131; P = 0.001) were significantly associated with PRES. Elevated platelet (OR = 0.988, 95% CI: 0.982, 0.995; P < 0.001), hemoglobin (OR = 0.924, 95% CI: 0.890, 0.995; P < 0.001), and blood sodium (OR = 0.905, 95% CI: 0.860, 0.953; P < 0.001), potassium (OR = 0.599, 95% CI: 0.360, 0.995; P = 0.048), and magnesium (OR = 0.093, 95% CI: 0.016, 0.539; P = 0.008) were protective factors against PRES. Data for 440 pediatric PRES patients with hematologic/oncologic diseases in 21 articles retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases and the 20 PRES patients from our study were analyzed. The median age at presentation was 7.9 years. The most common primary diagnosis was leukemia (62.3%), followed by solid tumor (7.7%) and lymphoma (7.5%). Most patients (65.0%) received chemotherapy, including non-induction (55.2%) and induction (44.8%) regimens; and 86.5% used corticosteroids before the onset of PRES. Although 21.0% of patients died during follow-up, in most cases (93.2%) this was not attributable to PRES but to severe infection (27.3%), underlying disease (26.1%), graft-vs.-host disease (14.8%), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (8.0%), and respiratory failure (3.4%). PRES was more common with HSCT compared to chemotherapy and had a nearly 2 times higher mortality rate in patients with oncologic/hematologic diseases than in those with other types of disease. Monitoring neurologic signs and symptoms in the former group is therefore critical for ensuring good clinical outcomes following treatment of the primary malignancy.","['Hun, Marady', 'Xie, Min', 'She, Zhou', 'Abdirahman, Amin S', 'Li, Cuifang', 'Wu, Feifeng', 'Luo, Senlin', 'Han, Phanna', 'Phorn, Rithea', 'Wu, Pan', 'Luo, Haiyan', 'Chen, Keke', 'Tian, Jidong', 'Wan, Wuqing', 'Wen, Chuan']","['Hun M', 'Xie M', 'She Z', 'Abdirahman AS', 'Li C', 'Wu F', 'Luo S', 'Han P', 'Phorn R', 'Wu P', 'Luo H', 'Chen K', 'Tian J', 'Wan W', 'Wen C']","[""Division of Hematology and Tumor, Children's Medical Center, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China."", ""Division of Hematology and Tumor, Children's Medical Center, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China."", ""Division of Hematology and Tumor, Children's Medical Center, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China."", ""Division of Hematology and Tumor, Children's Medical Center, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China."", ""Division of Hematology and Tumor, Children's Medical Center, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China."", ""Division of Hematology and Tumor, Children's Medical Center, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China."", ""Division of Hematology and Tumor, Children's Medical Center, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China."", 'Department of Ophthalmology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Hunan Children's Hospital, University of South China, Changsha, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Hunan Children's Hospital, University of South China, Changsha, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Children's Medical Center, Hunan Provincial People's Hospital, Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China."", ""Division of Hematology and Tumor, Children's Medical Center, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China."", ""Division of Hematology and Tumor, Children's Medical Center, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China."", ""Division of Hematology and Tumor, Children's Medical Center, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.""]",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210701,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,,,PMC8280768,['NOTNLM'],"['chemotherapy', 'children', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'management', 'neurotoxicity', 'oncologic/hematologic diseases', 'posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome']",2021/07/20 06:00,2021/07/20 06:01,['2021/07/19 06:00'],"['2021/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2021.678890 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2021 Jul 1;9:678890. doi: 10.3389/fped.2021.678890. eCollection 2021.,678890,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Hun, Xie, She, Abdirahman, Li, Wu, Luo, Han, Phorn, Wu, Luo,', 'Chen, Tian, Wan and Wen.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The importance of integrating clinico-morphological and immunophenotypic findings in distinguishing chronic lymphoproliferative diseases with circulating phase.,10.4322/acr.2020.196 [doi],"B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL) is an extremely rare disease, accounting for approximately 1% of the lymphocytic leukemias. B-PLL generally occurs in older people. It is characterized by the presence of more than 55% prolymphocytes in the peripheral blood (PB), no or minimal lymphadenopathy, massive splenomegaly, and very high white blood cell counts. The prognosis of B-PLL patients is generally poor, with a median survival of 3 years, although a subset of patients may show a prolonged survival. Herein, we report a case of a 70-year-old male with weakness, generalized lymphadenopathy, and moderate splenomegaly at the initial presentation. Hematologic examination revealed lymphocytic leukocytosis, favoring a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder (CLPD). The key to decoding the precise CLPD was a combination of the clinical profile, morphologic findings on the peripheral blood and the bone marrow, immunophenotypic analysis, and cytogenetic study. The best diagnosis proffered was a de novo chronic lymphocytic leukemia/prolymphocytic leukemia. There was no prior history of lymphoproliferative disorder or lymphocytic leukocytosis. Discriminating this entity from other lymphoproliferative disorders is crucial as the treatment and prognosis are varied compared to the other lymphoproliferative disorders. The diagnostic conundrum encountered and the incredible utility of ancillary studies in such a scenario are highlighted in this study.","['Chowdhury, Zachariah', 'Khonglah, Yookarin', 'Sarma, Susmita', 'Kalita, Pranjal']","['Chowdhury Z', 'Khonglah Y', 'Sarma S', 'Kalita P']","['Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital/MPMMCC (Tata Memorial Hospital), Department of Pathology, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India.', 'North Eastern Indira Gandhi Regional Institute of Health & Medical Sciences, Department of Pathology, Shillong, Meghalaya, India.', 'North Eastern Indira Gandhi Regional Institute of Health & Medical Sciences, Department of Pathology, Shillong, Meghalaya, India.', 'North Eastern Indira Gandhi Regional Institute of Health & Medical Sciences, Department of Pathology, Shillong, Meghalaya, India.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1766-5012', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7665-3372', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4559-8320', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5721-6142']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20201208,Brazil,Autops Case Rep,Autopsy & case reports,101640070,,,,PMC8101659,['NOTNLM'],"['Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Lymphadenopathy: Rare Diseases']",2021/07/20 06:00,2021/07/20 06:01,['2021/07/19 05:59'],"['2020/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/19 05:59 [entrez]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4322/acr.2020.196 [doi]', 'autopsy069020 [pii]']",epublish,Autops Case Rep. 2020 Dec 8;11:e2020196. doi: 10.4322/acr.2020.196. eCollection 2021.,e2020196,['Copyright: (c) 2020 The Authors.'],,,,['Conflict of interest: None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This retrospective study assessed the characteristics and risk factors of new-onset severe cytopenia following CAR-T cell infusion in 76 patients with r/r acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The rates of new-onset severe cytopenia were high, including severe neutropenia (SN) (39/56, 70%), severe anemia (SA) (35/66, 53%), and severe thrombocytopenia (ST) (31/64, 48%). Comparatively, cohorts with higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) grades had higher incidence of severe cytopenia with prolonged duration. Multivariable analyses showed that elevated maximum (max) lg D-dimer and delayed peak time of CRS are independent risk factors for SN recovery; increased max lg IL-10 and delayed CRS recovery are risk factors for SA; high max lg ferritin is a risk factor for ST; and longer period to CRS onset or CRS recovery and higher grade of CRS are risk factors for prolonged hematological toxicities. These observations led to the conclusion that profiles of CRS, including its duration, severity and serum markers are correlated to the incidence and recovery of new-onset severe cytopenia, prompting clinical intervention for post-CAR-T severe cytopenia.","['Wang, Linqin', 'Hong, Ruimin', 'Zhou, Linghui', 'Ni, Fang', 'Zhang, Mingming', 'Zhao, Houli', 'Wu, Wenjun', 'Wang, Yiyun', 'Ding, Shuyi',

Apolipoprotein A (ApoA), the major protein of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), plays a crucial role in lipid transportation and protecting against cardiovascular disease, and takes effect on anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation. It is correlated with the prognosis of some solid tumors. Yet, there is no investigation involving the role of ApoA plays in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Our retrospective study focuses on the prognostic value of ApoA in CLL and its therapeutic potential for CLL patients. Herein, ApoA is a favorable independent prognostic factor for both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of CLL patients. ApoA is negatively associated with beta2-microglobulin (beta2-MG) and advanced stage, which are poor prognostic factors in CLL. Age, Rai stage, ApoA, and adenosine deaminase (ADA) are included in a new risk scoring system named ARAA-score. It is capable of assessing OS and PFS of CLL patients. Furthermore, cell proliferation assays show that the ApoA-I mimetic L-4F can inhibit the proliferation of CLL cell lines and primary cells. In conclusion, ApoA is of prognostic value in CLL, and is a potential therapy for CLL patients. The ARAA-score may optimize the risk stratification of CLL patients.","['Yun, Xiaoya', 'Sun, Xiang', 'Hu, Xinting', 'Zhang, Huimin', 'Yin, Zixun', 'Zhang, Xin', 'Liu, Ming', 'Zhang, Ya', 'Wang,

We present one such case and delve into its risk factors and associated complications. Exposure to increased lines of treatment appears to be a contributing factor in transformation, such that those with fewer than two lines of treatment are considered to have a lower risk of transformation. Fever, rapid lymph node involvement and drastic increases in lactate dehydrogenase, as seen in our patient, are concerning for transformation and treatment options include chemotherapy versus novel agent therapy. However, patients receiving therapy are at risk for adverse outcomes such as invasive infections, particularly in those receiving consolidation chemotherapy. Fungal infections such as Aspergillus and Candida are gaining prominence in the setting of neutropenia which adversely impact survival, but are underreported. Efforts to improve outcomes may include consideration of growth factor therapy in neutropenic patients and continuing to be vigilant for early signs of infection.","['Baral, Binav', 'Ahuja, Kriti', 'Chhabra, Navika', 'Tariq, Muhammad J', 'Zia, Maryam']","['Baral B', 'Ahuja K', 'Chhabra N', 'Tariq MJ', 'Zia M']","['Internal Medicine, John H.

DeltaRex-G inhibits the CCNG1 function of promoting cell competence and survival through the commanding CCNG1/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)/Myc/mouse double minute 2 homolog (Mdm2)/p53 axis. In 2009, DeltaRex-G was granted Fast Track designation from the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In 2019, the results of a phase 1/2 study that used DeltaRex-G as monotherapy for stage 4 chemotherapy-resistant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) were published. A unique participant of the aforementioned phase 1/2 study is now an 84-year-old Caucasian woman with chemoresistant PDAC who was treated with DeltaRex-G, 3x10(11) colony forming units (cfu)/dose, 3 times/week for 4 weeks with a 2-week rest period, for 1.5 years. During the treatment period, the patient's tumors in the liver, lymph node and peritoneum exhibited progressive decreases in size, which were accompanied by a reduction and normalization of serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels, and the patient achieved complete remission after 8 months of DeltaRex-G therapy with minimal side effects (grade 2 fatigue). Henceforth, the patient has been in remission for 12 years with no evidence of disease, no late therapy-related adverse events, and no further cancer therapy following DeltaRex-G treatment. The present study reports a mutation of tumor protein p53 (TP53) (G199V) found retrospectively in the patient's archived tumor samples. TP53 is a well-characterized tumor suppressor gene, and a critical regulatory component of the executive CCNG1/CDK/Myc/Mdm2/p53 axis, which regulates proliferative cell competence, DNA fidelity and survival. Studies are underway to determine whether TP53 mutations in pancreatic cancer can help identify a subset of patients with advanced metastatic cancer with an otherwise poor prognosis who would respond favorably to DeltaRex-G, which would broaden the treatment options for patients with otherwise lethal PDAC.","['Morse, Michael A', 'Chawla, Sant P', 'Wong, Terence Z', 'Bruckner, Howard W', 'Hall, Frederick L', 'Gordon, Erlinda M']","['Morse MA', 'Chawla SP', 'Wong TZ', 'Bruckner HW', 'Hall FL', 'Gordon EM']","['Medical Oncology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Cancer Center of Southern California, Santa Monica, CA 90403, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Bruckner Oncology, Bronx, NY 10469, USA.', 'Delta Next-Gene, LLC, Santa Monica, CA 90405, USA.', 'Cancer Center of Southern California, Santa Monica, CA 90403, USA.', 'Delta Next-Gene, LLC, Santa Monica, CA 90405, USA.', 'Aveni Foundation, Santa Monica, CA 90405, USA.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210708,England,Mol Clin Oncol,Molecular and clinical oncology,101613422,,,,PMC8278409,['NOTNLM'],"['CCNG1 inhibitor', 'TP53', 'cancer gene therapy', 'case report', 'pancreatic adenocarcinoma']",2021/07/20 06:00,2021/07/20 06:01,['2021/07/19 05:55'],"['2020/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/19 05:55 [entrez]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/mco.2021.2348 [doi]', 'MCO-0-0-02348 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Clin Oncol. 2021 Sep;15(3):186. doi: 10.3892/mco.2021.2348.

The overall IFD prevalence was 10.7%, with a breakdown in the ALL, AML, relapsed leukemia, and SAA patients of 8%, 11.4%, 19.3%, and 16%, respectively. Pulmonary IFD caused by invasive aspergillosis was the most common, accounting for 38.5% of all infection sites.

Several autophagy related lncRNA signatures have been shown to affect the survival of patients in some other cancers. However, the role of autophagy related lncRNA in AML has not been explored yet. Hence, this study aims to find an autophagy related lncRNA signature that can affect survival for AML patients. Method: A Pearson correlation analysis, a Kaplan-Meier survival curve, a univariate cox regression, and a multivariate cox regression were performed to establish an autophagy related lncRNA signature. A univariate cox regression, a multivariate cox regression, a Kaplan-Meier survival curve, and a ROC curve were applied to confirm if the signature is an independent prognosis for AML patients. The relationship between the signature and the clinical features was explored by using a T test. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to investigate the potential tumor related pathways. Results: A four-autophagy related lncRNA (MIR133A1HG, AL359715.1, MIRLET7BHG, and AL356752.1) signature was established. The high risk score based on signature was related to the short survival time of AML patients. The signature was an independent factor for the prognosis for AML patients (HR = 1.684, 95% CI = 1.324-2.142, P < 0.001). The signature was correlated with age, leukocyte numbers, and FAB (M3 or non-M3). The P53, IL6/JAK/STAT3, TNF-alpha, INF-gamma, and IL2/STAT5 pathways might contribute to the differences between the risk groups based on signature in AML. Conclusion: The four autophagy related lncRNAs and their signature might be novel biomarkers for predicting the survival of AML patients. Some biological pathways might be the potential mechanisms of the signature for the survival of AML patients.","['Zhao, Chunxia', 'Wang, Yulu', 'Tu, Famei', 'Zhao, Shuai', 'Ye, Xiaoying', 'Liu, Jing', 'Zhang, Juan', 'Wang, Zifeng']","['Zhao C', 'Wang Y', 'Tu F', 'Zhao S', 'Ye X', 'Liu J', 'Zhang J', 'Wang Z']","['School of Nursing, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Integrated Oncology, Center for Integrated Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Department of Nursing, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', ""Department of Hematology, Shangrao People's Hospital, Shangrao, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shangrao People's Hospital, Shangrao, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shangrao People's Hospital, Shangrao, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Shangrao People's Hospital, Shangrao, China.""]",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210630,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,,,PMC8278057,['NOTNLM'],"['Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'autophagy', 'cancer genome atlas', 'lncRNAs', 'prognosis', 'signature']",2021/07/20 06:00,2021/07/20 06:01,['2021/07/19 05:53'],"['2021/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/19 05:53 [entrez]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2021.681867 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2021 Jun 30;12:681867. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2021.681867. eCollection 2021.,681867,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhao, Wang, Tu, Zhao, Ye, Liu, Zhang and Wang.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lack of IL-7-IL-7 receptor(R)-mediated signaling compromises lymphoid development, whereas increased signaling activity contributes to the development of chronic inflammation, cancer and autoimmunity. Gain-of-function alterations of the IL-7R and the signaling through Janus kinases (JAKs) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are enriched in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and autocrine production of IL-7 by T-ALL cells is involved in the phenotypes of leukemic initiation and oncogenic spreading. Several IL-7-associated pathologies are also characterized by increased presence of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), due to neutrophil degranulation and its regulated production by other cell types. Since proteases secreted by neutrophils are known to modulate the activity of many cytokines, we investigated the interactions between IL-7, MMP-9 and several other neutrophil-derived proteases. We demonstrated that MMP-9 efficiently cleaved human IL-7 in the exposed loop between the alpha-helices C and D and that this process is delayed by IL-7 N-linked glycosylation. Functionally, the proteolytic cleavage of IL-7 did not influence IL-7Ralpha binding and internalization nor the direct pro-proliferative effects of IL-7 on a T-ALL cell line (HPB-ALL) or in primary CD8(+) human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A comparable effect was observed for the neutrophil serine proteases neutrophil elastase, proteinase 3 and combinations of neutrophil proteases. Hence, glycosylation and disulfide bonding as two posttranslational modifications influence IL-7 bioavailability in the human species: glycosylation protects against proteolysis, whereas internal cysteine bridging under physiological redox state keeps the IL-7 conformations as active proteoforms. Finally, we showed that mouse IL-7 does not contain the protease-sensitive loop and, consequently, was not cleaved by MMP-9. With the latter finding we discovered differences in IL-7 biology between the human and mouse species.","['Vandooren, Jennifer', 'Pereira, Rafaela Vaz Sousa', 'Ugarte-Berzal, Estefania', 'Rybakin, Vasily', 'Noppen, Sam', 'Stas, Melissa R', 'Bernaerts, Eline', 'Ganseman, Eva', 'Metzemaekers, Mieke', 'Schols, Dominique', 'Proost, Paul', 'Opdenakker, Ghislain']","['Vandooren J', 'Pereira RVS', 'Ugarte-Berzal E', 'Rybakin V', 'Noppen S', 'Stas MR', 'Bernaerts E', 'Ganseman E', 'Metzemaekers M', 'Schols D', 'Proost P', 'Opdenakker G']","['Laboratory of Immunobiology, Rega Institute for Medical Research/KU Leuven, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, Rega Institute for Medical Research/KU Leuven, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, Rega Institute for Medical Research/KU Leuven, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, Rega Institute for Medical Research/KU Leuven, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, Rega Institute for Medical Research/KU Leuven, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, Rega Institute for Medical Research/KU Leuven, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, Rega Institute for Medical Research/KU Leuven, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, Rega Institute for Medical Research/KU Leuven, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, Rega Institute for Medical Research/KU Leuven, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy, Rega Institute for Medical Research/KU Leuven, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, Rega Institute for Medical Research/KU Leuven, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Immunobiology, Rega Institute for Medical Research/KU Leuven, Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Transplantation, Leuven, Belgium.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210630,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IL7 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', 'EC 3.4.- (Serine Proteases)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/metabolism', 'Interleukin-7/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*metabolism', 'Neutrophil Activation/physiology', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Proteolysis', 'Serine Proteases/*metabolism']",PMC8278288,['NOTNLM'],"['*IL-7', '*matrix metalloproteinase-9', '*neutrophils', '*proliferation', '*proteolysis', '*signal transduction']",2021/07/20 06:00,2021/12/22 06:00,['2021/07/19 05:52'],"['2021/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/19 05:52 [entrez]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.701739 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Jun 30;12:701739. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.701739. eCollection 2021.,701739,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Vandooren, Pereira, Ugarte-Berzal, Rybakin, Noppen, Stas,', 'Bernaerts, Ganseman, Metzemaekers, Schols, Proost and Opdenakker.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the past decade, the clinical use of BTKis for the treatment of B-cell malignancies has exponentially grown, changing the treatment landscape for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in particular. At present, three different covalent BTKis, ibrutinib, acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib, are FDA-approved and many new inhibitors are under development. Despite having remarkable selectivity for BTK, the first-in-class BTKi ibrutinib can also bind, with various affinities, to other kinases. The combined inhibition of BTK (""on-target"" effect) and other kinases (""off-target"" effect) can have additive or synergistic anti-tumor effects but also induce undesired side effects which might be treatment-limiting. Such ""off-target"" effects are expected to be more limited for second-generation BTKis. Moreover, the blockade of BCR signaling also indirectly affects the tumor microenvironment in CLL. Treatment with BTKis potentially impacts on both innate and adaptive immunity. Whether this affects infection susceptibility and vaccination efficacy requires further investigation. Here, we summarize the available knowledge on the impact of BTKis on the immune system and discuss the possible clinical implications. Indeed, a deeper knowledge on this topic could guide clinicians in the management and prevention of infections in patients with CLL treated with BTKis.","['Palma, Marzia', 'Mulder, Tom A', 'Osterborg, Anders']","['Palma M', 'Mulder TA', 'Osterborg A']","['Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20210701,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'AG9MHG098Z (zanubrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'I42748ELQW (acalabrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Benzamides', 'Humans', 'Infection Control', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Pyrazines', 'Pyrazoles', 'Pyrimidines']",PMC8282344,['NOTNLM'],"['*BTK inhibitors', '*ibrutinib', '*immune cells', '*infections', '*leukemia', '*off-target effects', '*vaccination']",2021/07/20 06:00,2021/10/29 06:00,['2021/07/19 05:52'],"['2021/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/19 05:52 [entrez]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.686768 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Jul 1;12:686768. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.686768. eCollection 2021.,686768,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Palma, Mulder and Osterborg.']",,,,"['MP: Takeda, research support.

The ensuing BCR-ABL1 chimeric oncogene is characterized by a breakpoint region that generally involves exons 1, 13 or 14 in BCR and exon 2 in ABL1. Additional breakpoint regions, generating uncommon BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts, have been detected in various CML patients. However, to date, the impact of these infrequent transcripts on BCR-ABL1-dependent leukemogenesis and sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) remain unclear. We analyzed the transforming potential and TKIs responsiveness of three atypical BCR-ABL1 fusions identified in CML patients, and of two additional BCR-ABL1 constructs with lab-engineered breakpoints. We observed that modifications in the DC2 domain of BCR and SH3 region of ABL1 affect BCR-ABL1 catalytic efficiency and leukemogenic ability. Moreover, employing immortalized cell lines and primary CD34-positive progenitors, we demonstrate that these modifications lead to reduced BCR-ABL1 sensitivity to imatinib, dasatinib and ponatinib but not nilotinib. We conclude that BCR-ABL1 oncoproteins displaying uncommon breakpoints involving the DC2 and SH3 domains are successfully inhibited by nilotinib treatment.","['Massimino, Michele', 'Tirro, Elena', 'Stella, Stefania', 'Manzella, Livia', 'Pennisi, Maria Stella', 'Romano, Chiara', 'Vitale, Silvia Rita', 'Puma, Adriana', 'Tomarchio, Cristina', 'Di Gregorio, Sandra', 'Antolino, Agostino', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Vigneri, Paolo']","['Massimino M', 'Tirro E', 'Stella S', 'Manzella L', 'Pennisi MS', 'Romano C', 'Vitale SR', 'Puma A', 'Tomarchio C', 'Di Gregorio S', 'Antolino A', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Vigneri P']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Center of Experimental Oncology and Hematology, A.O.U.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively examined biological characteristics and survival of 90 patients with ALL. RESULTS: At median follow-up 17 months, 52 men and 38 women were eligible for the analysis with median age 43 years (18-74). As for the risk stratification, 25.6% of patients were in standard risk, 46.7% in high risk and 27.8% in very high-risk group. Complete remission achieved 88.9% of patients. We observed 5.6% of induction deaths and 4.5% of resistant disease. 47.8% of the patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT), 59% in the young adults (YA; < 40 years) and 40% in adult group (>/= 40 years). We noticed 32.6% relapses overall with median survival of relapsed patients 3.9 months. YA patients had longer survival than adults: 3-year overall survival (OS) 65.0% vs 30.2%; (HR = 0.36; 95% CI 0.2-0.64; P = .001) and event free survival (EFS) 51.5% vs 21.9%; (HR = 0.45; 95% CI 0.26-0.78; P = .005). There was significant difference in 3-year EFS between risk groups in YA patients 90.9%, 48.0%, 11.4%; (P = .001). OS after alloSCT individually for the YA was 62.6% and for adults 39.1%, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.49 (95% CI 0.20-1.21); (P = .095). We observed 14% early deaths, 25.6% late deaths and 3 relapses (7%) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data proved that even in a low population country similar result can be achieved as in larger ones while using well designed adapted protocols from leukemic study groups.","['Oravcova, Iveta', 'Lukas, Jozef', 'Cingelova, Silvia', 'Demitrovicova, Ludmila', 'Mikuskova, Eva', 'Drgona, Lubos', 'Sopko, Ladislav', 'Galffy, Balazs', 'Batorova, Angelika', 'Mistrik, Martin']","['Oravcova I', 'Lukas J', 'Cingelova S', 'Demitrovicova L', 'Mikuskova E', 'Drgona L', 'Sopko L', 'Galffy B', 'Batorova A', 'Mistrik M']","['Department of Oncohematology, Faculty of Medicine Comenius University and National Cancer Institute, Bratislava, Slovakia.

Most patients can be retreated with the same or a different purine analog however a subset of patients will become resistant or develop cumulative toxicities. Novel agents such as Vemurafenib (BRAF kinase inhibitor), Bendamustine/Rituximab (BR), Moxetumomab pasudotox (anti CD-22 recombinant immunotoxin) and Ibrutinib have emerging roles in patients with relapsed HCL. METHODS: Five databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched using the following search terms: ""hairy cell leukemia"" or ""leukemia, hairy cell"" AND ""relapse"" or ""recurrence"". We included only prospective clinical trials with outcome data. RESULTS: Vemurafenib monotherapy was evaluated in two separate arms of a phase 2 trial. In the US arm (n=24), the ORR was 100% (CR 42%; PR 58%). In the Italian arm (n=26), the ORR was 96% (CR 35%; PR 62%). In a phase 2 study (n=25), the combination of vemurafenib and rituximab showed CR of 100%. The combination of BR achieved an ORR of 100% whereas CR was 50% and 67% at a bendamustine dose of 70mg/m(2) (n=6) and 90 mg/m(2) (n=6) respectively. In a phase 3 trial, moxetumomab pasudotox (n=80) had an ORR of 75% (CR 41%). Single agent Ibrutinib (n=37) had an ORR of 54%. Therapies were generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Novel agents have good efficacy in HCL in patients with multiple relapses.","['Siddiqui, Raheel', 'Sardar, Muhammad', 'Shahzad, Moazzam', 'Jose, Jemin', 'Selene, Insija', 'Shah, Zunaira', 'Qureshi, Anum', 'Shafqat, Madeeha', 'Kashif, Rimsha', 'Ahmad, Maheen', 'Mejia-Garcia, Alex', 'Anwer, Faiz']","['Siddiqui R', 'Sardar M', 'Shahzad M', 'Jose J', 'Selene I', 'Shah Z', 'Qureshi A', 'Shafqat M', 'Kashif R', 'Ahmad M', 'Mejia-Garcia A', 'Anwer F']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City Health and Hospitals/Queens, Jamaica, NY.

METHODS: A total of 98 CML cases (un-treated cases, IM non-responders and IM responders) were enrolled in the study. Total sialic acid (TSA) and total protein (TP) levels were estimated spectrophotometrically, the expression profiles of BCR-ABL1, ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2 were evaluated using qRT-PCR assays and BCR-ABL1 transcript variants were identified through subjecting PCR products to agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: The results manifested increase in e14a2 transcript and decrease in co-expression of both transcripts (e13a2 and e14a2) in IM non-responders than un-treated CML cases. Notably, TSA/TP ratio was higher, whereas ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2 expressions were lower in un-treated CML cases and IM non-responders as against IM responders. Further, ST3GAL2 expression was lower in un-treated CML cases than IM non-responders. Receiver operating characteristic curves also proved their discriminatory efficiencies. Decisively, the rise in TSA levels and the fall in ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2 levels were evidently related to CML progression and clinical indicators of treatment failure (high BCR-ABL1 ratio, high WBC count, high platelet count and low Hb levels). The alterations in TSA, ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2 levels were remarkably associated with each other. CONCLUSIONS: The altered levels of TSA, ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2 are, to a significant extent, associated with IM resistance in CML, which have clinical relevance in treatment monitoring and IM resistance treatment.","['Patel, Kinjal D', 'De, Maitri', 'Jethva, Disha D', 'Rathod, Bharati S', 'Patel, Prabhudas S']","['Patel KD', 'De M', 'Jethva DD', 'Rathod BS', 'Patel PS']","['Cancer Biology Department, The Gujarat Cancer & Research Institute, Civil Hospital Campus, Asarwa, Ahmedabad 380 016, Gujarat, India.', 'Cancer Biology Department, The Gujarat Cancer & Research Institute, Civil Hospital Campus, Asarwa, Ahmedabad 380 016, Gujarat, India.', 'Cancer Biology Department, The Gujarat Cancer & Research Institute, Civil Hospital Campus, Asarwa, Ahmedabad 380 016, Gujarat, India.', 'Cancer Biology Department, The Gujarat Cancer & Research Institute, Civil Hospital Campus, Asarwa, Ahmedabad 380 016, Gujarat, India.', 'Cancer Biology Department, The Gujarat Cancer & Research Institute, Civil Hospital Campus, Asarwa, Ahmedabad 380 016, Gujarat, India.

The next-generation BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib is more selective and may have less off-target toxicities as compared to ibrutinib. Acalabrutinib has demonstrated safety and efficacy in CLL and has been approved to treat CLL. AREAS COVERED: Current clinical trials investigated acalabrutinib monotherapy or acalabrutinib-based combination therapies in relapsed/refractory and treatment-naive CLL. Data on the efficacy and safety of acalabrutinib in clinical trials were summarized in this review. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data of acalabrutinib were also discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Acalabrutinib selectively inhibits BTK by covalent binding and shows rapid absorption and elimination. Acalabrutinib does not inhibit EGFR, TEC, or ITK and shows fewer off-target toxicities. Completed phase 3 trials have demonstrated that acalabrutinib improves the outcomes of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL and patients with treatment-naive CLL. The phase 3 trial that evaluates acalabrutinib versus ibrutinib has met its primary endpoint.

While distant organs and large parts of nearby ones receive doses in the mGy-Gy range, small parts of the heart, lung and bone marrow often receive doses as high as 50 Gy. Contemporary treatment planning allows for considerable flexibility in the distribution of this exposure. To optimise treatment with regards to long-term health risks, evidence-based risk estimates are required for the entire broad range of exposures. Here, we thus propose an approach that combines data from medical and epidemiological studies with different exposure conditions. Approximating cancer induction as a local process, we estimate organ cancer risks by integrating organ-specific dose-response relationships over the organ dose distributions. For highly exposed organ parts, specific high-dose risk models based on studies with medical exposure are applied. For organs or their parts receiving relatively low doses, established dose-response models based on radiation-epidemiological data are used. Joining the models in the intermediate dose range leads to a combined, in general non-linear, dose response supported by data over the whole relevant dose range. For heart diseases, a linear model consistent with high- and low-dose studies is presented. The resulting estimates of long-term health risks are largely compatible with rate ratios observed in randomised breast cancer radiotherapy trials. The risk models have been implemented in a software tool PASSOS that estimates long-term risks for individual breast cancer patients.","['Simonetto, Cristoforo', 'Wollschlager, Daniel', 'Kundrat, Pavel', 'Ulanowski, Alexander', 'Becker, Janine', 'Castelletti, Noemi', 'Guthlin, Denise', 'Shemiakina, Elena', 'Eidemuller, Markus']","['Simonetto C', 'Wollschlager D', 'Kundrat P', 'Ulanowski A', 'Becker J', 'Castelletti N', 'Guthlin D', 'Shemiakina E', 'Eidemuller M']","['Institute of Radiation Medicine, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Ingolstadter Landstrasse 1, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University Medical Center Mainz, Obere Zahlbacher Str. 69, 55131, Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Ingolstadter Landstrasse 1, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Dosimetry, Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Na Truhlarce 39/64, 180 00, Prague 8, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Ingolstadter Landstrasse 1, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'IAEA Environment Laboratories, International Atomic Energy Agency, 2444, Seibersdorf, Austria.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Ingolstadter Landstrasse 1, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Ingolstadter Landstrasse 1, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat (LMU) Munich, 80802, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Ingolstadter Landstrasse 1, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Protection and Health, Federal Office for Radiation Protection, Ingolstadter Landstrasse 1, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Ingolstadter Landstrasse 1, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Ingolstadter Landstrasse 1, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany. markus.eidemueller@helmholtz-muenchen.de.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4816-3514', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1009-259X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9295-6509', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4863-4128', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9409-4869', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6598-5352', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2283-9494', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0249-3710']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210717,Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lung Neoplasms', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Risk Assessment', 'Smoking', 'Software']",PMC8310522,['NOTNLM'],"['*Breast cancer radiotherapy', '*Heart disease', '*Radiation risk', '*Risk models', '*Second primary cancer']",2021/07/19 06:00,2021/09/23 06:00,['2021/07/18 21:00'],"['2021/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/23 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/18 21:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00411-021-00924-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00411-021-00924-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2021 Aug;60(3):459-474. doi: 10.1007/s00411-021-00924-8.

The overall response rate (CR + CRp + MLFS) of ACTIVE was 75% (15/20) in comparison to 66% (19/29) in the FLAG-Ida group (p = 0.542). The cumulative CR + CRp rate was significantly higher in the ACTIVE group compared to FLAG-Ida (70% (14/20) vs. 34% (10/29), respectively, p = 0.02).

We introduce the AE burden score (AEsc) to compare AEs, calculated for each patient by summing over products of reporting period length and grade for each all-cause grade 1-4 AE and dividing by the length of time over which AEs are assessed. A total of 176 patients received BR and 361 ibrutinib alone or with six cycles of rituximab. At 38 months median follow-up, 64% remained on ibrutinib. Median AEsc was higher with BR versus ibrutinib in the first six cycles (7.2 versus 4.9, p < 0.0001). Within ibrutinib arms, median AEsc decreased significantly to 3.7 after six cycles (p < 0.0001). 10% and 14% of BR and ibrutinib patients discontinued treatment for AEs. In ibrutinib arms, cumulative incidence of grade 3 or higher atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and infection (AEs of clinical interest) at 12 months was 4.5%, 17.5%, and 12.8%, respectively, and increased more slowly thereafter to 7.7%, 25.4%, and 20.5% at 36 months.

In this study, we conducted a multicenter analysis on the outcomes of patients aged > 15 years with Ph+ ALL, aiming to get to know an overview of the Brazilian experience as well as to explore baseline factors associated with relapse and mortality in our setting. Over these 10 years, patients were treated with diverse protocols, all of them always combined with a frontline tyrosine-kinase inhibitor. A total of 123 Ph+ ALL patients was included. Imatinib was the first line TKI in 97 %. The complete response rate was 79 %. The early death rate was 15 %, being associated with increasing age at diagnosis (p = 0.06). The use of intensive versus attenuated induction regimen was not associated with higher induction mortality (p = 0.99). Overall, 29 % of patients aged </= 60 years underwent allogeneic transplantation, 87 % in first CR. 4-year overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival were 25 % and 24 %, respectively. The incidence of relapse (death as a competitor) was 29 %, while the non-relapse mortality was 42 %. Only age was independently associated with OS, and lactate dehydrogenase level and central nervous disease at diagnosis were related to relapse in our cohort. This is the first historical cohort multicenter study on Ph+ ALL from Brazil. Reporting these outcomes is essential to encourage public policies to expand access to new drugs and transplantation in middle-income countries.","['Silva, Wellington F', 'Silverio, Alexandre', 'Duarte, Bruno Kosa Lino', 'Aguiar, Thais Ferraz', 'Bendlin, Rodrigo Miguel', 'Massaut, Ires Hamyra Bezerra', 'Pagnano, Katia Borgia Barbosa', 'Velloso, Elvira D R P', 'Rocha, Vanderson', 'Rego, Eduardo Magalhaes']","['Silva WF', 'Silverio A', 'Duarte BKL', 'Aguiar TF', 'Bendlin RM', 'Massaut IHB', 'Pagnano KBB', 'Velloso EDRP', 'Rocha V', 'Rego EM']","['Instituto do Cancer do Estado de Sao Paulo (ICESP), Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo (FMUSP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Although post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has yielded promising results in various diseases, available data are limited regarding its outcomes in ATL. The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of reduced-intensity peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical donor using PTCy as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. This was a prospective, multicenter phase I/II study (UMIN000021783) conducted at 16 hospitals in Japan. The primary endpoint was the probability of survival with engraftment and without grade III/IV acute GVHD at day 60 after PBSCT. The expected probability of the primary endpoint was estimated to be 60%, and the threshold probability was set at 30% on the basis of previous studies. The conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine (30 mg/m(2)/d from day -7 to -2), melphalan (40 mg/m(2)/d on days -3 and -2), and total body irradiation (2 Gy on day -1). GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus starting at 0.02 mg/kg/d on day -1, PTCy (50 mg/kg/d on days +3 and +5), and mycophenolate mofetil 2000 mg/d starting on day +6. Eighteen ATL patients underwent PBSCT. The probability of patients who met the primary endpoint was 89% (95% confidence interval, 65% to 99%). The cumulative incidences of grade II to IV acute GVHD, III/IV acute GVHD, and moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD were 39%, 11%, and 17%, respectively. The probabilities of overall survival were 83% at 1 year and 73% at 2 years. The cumulative incidences of non-relapse mortality and disease progression at 1 year were 11% and 28%, respectively. HLA-haploidentical PBSCT with PTCy as GVHD prophylaxis is a valid option for patients with aggressive ATL.","['Tanaka, Takashi', 'Nakamae, Hirohisa', 'Ito, Ayumu', 'Fuji, Shigeo', 'Hirose, Asao', 'Eto, Tetsuya', 'Henzan, Hideho', 'Takase, Ken', 'Yamasaki, Satoshi', 'Makiyama, Junya', 'Moriuchi, Yukiyoshi', 'Choi, Ilseung', 'Nakano, Nobuaki', 'Hiramoto, Nobuhiro', 'Kato, Koji', 'Sato, Takahiko', 'Sawayama, Yasushi', 'Kim, Sung-Won', 'Inoue, Yoshitaka', 'Inamoto, Yoshihiro', 'Fukuda, Takahiro']","['Tanaka T', 'Nakamae H', 'Ito A', 'Fuji S', 'Hirose A', 'Eto T', 'Henzan H', 'Takase K', 'Yamasaki S', 'Makiyama J', 'Moriuchi Y', 'Choi I', 'Nakano N', 'Hiramoto N', 'Kato K', 'Sato T', 'Sawayama Y', 'Kim SW', 'Inoue Y', 'Inamoto Y', 'Fukuda T']","['Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Osaka International Cancer Institute, Osaka, Japan.', 'Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hamanomachi Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hamanomachi Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Kyushu Medical Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Kyushu Medical Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sasebo City General Hospital, Sasebo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sasebo City General Hospital, Sasebo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura General Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology & Cardiovascular Medicine, Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sasebo University Hospital, Sasebo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.

Reported here a versatile mitochondrial-damaging molecule, vitamin E succinate (VES), is creatively utilized to assist MDR reversal of doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX.HCl) via a nanovesicle platform self-assembled from amphiphilic polyphosphazenes containing pH-sensitive 1H-benzo-[d]imidazol-2-yl) methanamine (BIMA) groups. Driven by multiple non-covalent interactions, VES is fully introduced into the hydrophobic membrane of DOX.HCl-loaded nanovesicles with loading content of 23.5%. The incorporated VES also offers robust anti-leakage property toward DOX.HCl under normal physiological conditions. More importantly, upon release within acidic tumor cells, VES can target mitochondria and result in various dysfunctions including excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) loss, and inhibited adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, which contribute to cell apoptosis and insufficient energy supply for drug efflux pumps. Consequently, the killing-effect of DOX.HCl is significantly enhanced toward drug resistant cancer cells at the optimal mass ratio of DOX.HCl to VES. Further in vivo antitumor investigation on nude mice bearing xenograft drug-resistant human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562/ADR tumors verifies the extremely enhanced anti-tumor efficacy of the dual drug-loaded nanovesicle with the tumor inhibition rate (TIR) of 82.38%. Collectively, this study provides a s safe, facile and promising strategy for both precise drug delivery and MDR eradication to improve cancer therapy.","['Liang, Lina', 'Peng, Yan', 'Qiu, Liyan']","['Liang L', 'Peng Y', 'Qiu L']","['Ministry of Education (MOE) Key Laboratory of Macromolecular Synthesis and Functionalization Department of Polymer Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China.', 'Ministry of Education (MOE) Key Laboratory of Macromolecular Synthesis and Functionalization Department of Polymer Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China.', 'Ministry of Education (MOE) Key Laboratory of Macromolecular Synthesis and Functionalization Department of Polymer Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, China.

All 3 types of study design, including ecological, case-control, and cohort studies, were included in this study. In particular, different measurement units of radon exposure among studies were dealt with and analyzed thoroughly. METHODS: A medical librarian searched MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (from January 01, 1970 to November 05, 2020). For ecological studies, a conventional meta-analysis and subgroup analyses with meta-ANOVA analyses were conducted. For case-control and cohort studies, a two-stage dose-response meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 8 ecological, 9 case-control, and 15 ecological-cohort studies were analyzed. For ecological studies, the pooled correlation coefficient was 0.48 (95% CI 0.41-0.54). In the meta-analysis of variance (ANOVA) analyses, the age group (childhood vs. adult) showed a statistically significant result (Q = 7.93 and p = 0.019) with the pooled correlation coefficient for childhood, adult, and all age group of 0.67 (95% CI 0.53-0.77), 0.46 (95% CI 0.05-0.74), and 0.44 (95% CI 0.36-0.51), respectively. For case-control studies, the dose-response meta-analysis showed the pooled OR increase of 1.0308 (95% CI 1.0050-1.0573) for each 100 Bq/m(3) increase of radon dose. The pooled OR increase was 1.0361 (95% CI 1.0014-1.0720) for each 100 Bq/m(3) increase of radon dose for lymphoid leukemia subgroup and 1.0309 (95% CI 1.0050-1.0575) for each 100 Bq/m(3) increase of radon dose for childhood leukemia subgroup. Because of the inclusion of ecological studies with larger exposure assessment units, the pooled RR from ecological-cohort studies should be interpreted conservatively (a tendency towards a higher risk estimate). The overall pooled RR increase for each 100 Bq/m(3) increase of radon dose was 1.1221 (95% CI 1.0184-1.2363). The pooled RR increase was 1.2257 (95% CI 1.0034-1.4972) for each 100 Bq/m(3) increase of radon dose for the myeloid leukemia subgroup and 1.2503 (95% CI 1.0233-1.5276) for each 100 Bq/m(3) increase of radon dose for adult leukemia subgroup. DISCUSSION: A number of epidemiologic concepts, including the issue of sample size justification, the possibility of differential participation selection bias for case-control studies, the possibility of random and systematic errors in radon measurement, ecological fallacy for ecological studies, were discussed. The effect of age group, socioeconomic status, and gamma radiation exposure was also discussed. Future more accurate and conclusive large-scale case-control and cohort studies are needed.","['Moon, Jinyoung', 'Yoo, HyeKyoung']","['Moon J', 'Yoo H']","[""Department of Environmental Health Science, Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University, Gwanak-ro 1, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 08826, Republic of Korea; Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Seoul Saint Mary's Hospital, Banpo-daero 222, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591, Republic of Korea.

We performed novel network meta-analyses (NMA; 8 trials, 11 treatments) on the Kaplan-Meier curves to compare treatments for fludarabine-ineligible patients on progression-free survival (PFS), time-to-next-treatment (TTNT) and overall survival (OS). METHODS: Using the Guyot method of enhanced secondary analysis of digitized survival data and applying the fixed lognormal distribution model, we extracted the survival proportions and hazard ratios (HR) over 60 months of follow-up, including PFS comparisons by unmutated/mutated IGHV and del 17p. RESULTS: Acalabrutinib-plus-obinutuzumab was associated with higher 5-year PFS proportions than ibrutinib (HR = 0.42, 95% CrI = 0.25-0.63) but not acalabrutinib, ibrutinib-plus-obinutuzumab, ibrutinib-plus-rituximab or venetoclax-plus-obinutuzumab. In patients with un-mutated (but not with mutated) IGHV higher PFS proportions and favorable HRs were observed for acalabrutinib, acalabrutinib-plus-obinutuzumab, and ibrutinib-plus-obinutuzumab relative to ibrutinib; and targeted therapies were superior over chemoimmunotherapies in patients with del 17p. Targeted therapies containing ibrutinib or acalabrutinib regimens were associated with superior TTNT over venetoclax-plus-obinutuzumab and all chemoimmunotherapies. OS NMA generally found no difference between therapies except for some chemoimmunotherapies. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, only acalabrutinib-plus-obinutuzumab was associated with superior 5-year PFS gains over ibrutinib, which in turn was similar or superior in PFS benefit over other targeted therapies. Acalabrutinib and ibrutinib with obinutuzumab and acalabrutinib monotherapy were associated with greater 5-year TTNT benefits. Despite marked 5-year OS for many regimens, a differential 5-year OS benefit could not be ascertained.","['Alrawashdh, Neda', 'Persky, Daniel O', 'McBride, Ali', 'Sweasy, Joann', 'Erstad, Brian', 'Abraham, Ivo']","['Alrawashdh N', 'Persky DO', 'McBride A', 'Sweasy J', 'Erstad B', 'Abraham I']","['Center for Health Outcomes and PharmacoEconomic Research, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ; Department of Clinical Translational Sciences, College of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ.', 'Banner University Medical Center, Tucson, AZ; University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ.', 'Center for Health Outcomes and PharmacoEconomic Research, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ; Department of Pharmacy Practice and Science, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ.', 'Center for Health Outcomes and PharmacoEconomic Research, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ; University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ; Department of Pharmacy Practice and Science, College of Pharmacy, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ.

METHOD: Manifest content analysis of the content of chapters on leukemias in the books on hematology and internal medicine, clinical haematology and haematology undergraduate. Analysis categories: epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of leukemias. RESULTS: Epidemiological information from the revised books has a greater consideration of sex differences in incidence and prognosis but does not contain data on mortality and survival. Etiopathogenesis is described in all books as the same physiological process for both sexes and no differences in the presentation of symptoms are described in any book. Three books describe a unique treatment that is assumed equal for both sexes; two books mention the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia in pregnant women and one in chronic myeloid leukemia. No book mentions sex-differences in pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or treatment toxicity, although there is greater evidence on unequal behavior between the sexes. CONCLUSIONS: The contents of sex and gender differences in the leukemia chapters analyzed are insufficient compared to the evidence in the scientific literature today. Hematology textbooks might increase their scientific quality in future editions, including knowledge of sex-gender interaction in the sections of epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and consequences of leukemias, which will contribute to better professional practices, more efficient and equitable.","['Rodriguez-Soza, Carolina', 'Ruiz-Cantero, Maria Teresa']","['Rodriguez-Soza C', 'Ruiz-Cantero MT']","['Grupo de Investigacion de Salud Publica, Universidad de Alicante, Alicante, Espana.', 'Grupo de Investigacion de Salud Publica, Universidad de Alicante, Alicante, Espana; CIBER de Epidemiologia y Salud Publica (CIBERESP), Espana.

However, the prevalence and the prognostic value of del(11q) are still controversial. In this research, we retrospectively explored the prevalence, association, and prognostic significance of del(11q) in 352 untreated and 99 relapsed/refractory Chinese CLL patients. Totally 11.4% of untreated and 19.2% of relapsed/refractory patients harbored del(11q). Del(11q) was more common in patients with beta2-microglobulin > 3.5 mg/L, positive CD38, positive zeta-chain associated protein kinase 70, unmutated immunoglobulin heavy variable-region gene and ataxia telangiectasia mutated mutation. Kaplan-Meier method and univariate Cox regression indicated that del(11q) was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS). Based on the results of univariate Cox regression analysis, two nomograms that included del(11q) were established to predict survival. Desirable area under curve of receiver operating characteristic curves was obtained in the training and validation cohorts. In addition, the calibration curves for the probability of survival showed good agreement between the prediction by nomogram and actual observation. In summary, the prevalence of del(11q) is relatively low in our cohort and del(11q) is an unfavorable prognostic factor for untreated CLL patients. Besides, these two nomograms could be used to accurately predict the prognosis of untreated CLL patients.","['Zou, Yi-Xin', 'Tang, Han-Ning', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Tang, Xiao-Lu', 'Qin, Shu-Chao', 'Xia, Yi', 'Zhu, Hua-Yuan', 'Qiao, Chun', 'Wang, Li', 'Fan, Lei', 'Xu, Wei', 'Li, Jian-Yong', 'Miao, Yi']","['Zou YX', 'Tang HN', 'Zhang J', 'Tang XL', 'Qin SC', 'Xia Y', 'Zhu HY', 'Qiao C', 'Wang L', 'Fan L', 'Xu W', 'Li JY', 'Miao Y']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China; Pukou CLL Center, Nanjing 210000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China; Pukou CLL Center, Nanjing 210000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China; Pukou CLL Center, Nanjing 210000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China; Pukou CLL Center, Nanjing 210000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China; Pukou CLL Center, Nanjing 210000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China; Pukou CLL Center, Nanjing 210000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China; Pukou CLL Center, Nanjing 210000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China; Pukou CLL Center, Nanjing 210000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China; Pukou CLL Center, Nanjing 210000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China; Pukou CLL Center, Nanjing 210000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China; Pukou CLL Center, Nanjing 210000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China; Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing 210029, China; Pukou CLL Center, Nanjing 210000, China.

Both imidazolium salt dendrimers and their metallodendrimers counterparts showed promising anticancer activity, similar to cisplatin, mainly at high generations. In addition, both families of second and third generations were able to form dendriplexes with anticancer small interfering RNA (siRNA), protecting the cargo against RNAse and being able to internalize it in HEPG2 (human liver cancer) tumour cells. The characterization and effectiveness of the dendriplexes were evaluated by various analytical techniques such as zeta potential, electrophoresis and circular dichroism, the stability of the system and the protective nature of the dendrimer estimated using RNAse and the internalization of dendriplexes by confocal microscopy. The major advantage observed with the ruthenium metallodendrimers with respect to the imidazolium salts precursors was in cellular uptake, where the internalization of Mcl-1-FITC siRNA (myeloid cell leukaemia-1 fluorescein labelled siRNA) proceeded more efficiently. Therefore, we propose here that both imidazolium and Ru metallodendrimers are interesting candidates in cancer due to their double action, as anticancer per se and as carrier for anticancer siRNA, providing in this way a combined action.","['Rodriguez-Prieto, Tamara', 'Michlewska, Sylwia', 'Holota, Marcin', 'Ionov, Maksim', 'de la Mata, F Javier', 'Cano, Jesus', 'Bryszewska, Maria', 'Gomez, Rafael']","['Rodriguez-Prieto T', 'Michlewska S', 'Holota M', 'Ionov M', 'de la Mata FJ', 'Cano J', 'Bryszewska M', 'Gomez R']","['Department of Organic and Inorganic Chemistry, and Research Institute in Chemistry ""Andres M.

The cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells is greatly impaired in AML, and the profile of NK cell receptors is markedly altered in AML; however, this is not yet well characterized. In this study, we found the downregulation of Siglec-7 could be utilized as a potential marker of NK cell dysfunction in AML. The absolute numbers and percentages of NK cells were declined in the peripheral blood of patients with AML, and the levels of activating receptors NKG2D, NKp46, and NKp30 were reduced in NK cells from patients with AML compared with healthy controls. In contrast, the levels of inhibitory receptors TIM-3, ILT-4, ILT-5, and PD-1 were increased in NK cells from patients with AML. Of note, the level of Siglec-7 in NK cells from patients with AML was significantly lower than that in NK cells from healthy controls, and Siglec-7(+) NK cells displayed higher levels of activating receptors and stronger cytotoxicity when compared with Siglec-7(-) NK cells. Our data indicate that decreased Siglec-7 level may predict NK cell dysfunction in AML, and NK cells may be promising targets of immunotherapy for AML.","['Yang, Liu', 'Feng, Yuanyuan', 'Wang, Shanshan', 'Jiang, Shanyue', 'Tao, Longxiang', 'Li, Jing', 'Wang, Xuefu']","['Yang L', 'Feng Y', 'Wang S', 'Jiang S', 'Tao L', 'Li J', 'Wang X']","['School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Cancer Hospital, Hefei 230031, China.', 'The First Clinical Medical College, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, China.', 'Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, Anhui, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Anhui Medical University, Hefei 230032, Anhui, China.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this ecological study, an exploratory-etiologic multiple-group method has been adopted to investigate all children under 15 years of age with ALL in Iran during 2006-2014. Data analysis was performed using Mann Whitney U, Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs), Global Moran's I, Optimized hotspot analysis (OHSA), Global Poisson regression (GPR), Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression (GWPR) at a significant level of alpha = 0.05. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence rate of ALL was estimated at 21,315 per 100,000 Iranian children under 15 years of age. The value of Global Moran's I index was estimated 0.338 and significant (<0.001 P-value). Coldspots were observed in north and northwest of Iran and hotspots were identified in south, southwest and mid-east of Iran. In the present study, Max Temperature of Warmest Month (MTWM) and Direct Normal Irradiation (DNI) were risk factors and Precipitation of the Coldest Quarter (PCQ) and Altitude (AL) were protective factors in the incidence of ALL, even though the non-stationarity of local coefficients and local t-values was clear. GWPR, by capturing and applying spatial heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation, had a greater performance and goodness of fit than GPR. DISCUSSION: ALL has created spatial clusters in Iran. The incidence of ALL is the result of synergistic interaction between environmental, infectious, geographical and genetic risk factors. It is recommended to use of local models in ecological studies.","['Pordanjani, Sajjad Rahimi', 'Kavousi, Amir', 'Mirbagheri, Babak', 'Shahsavani, Abbas', 'Etemad, Koorosh']","['Pordanjani SR', 'Kavousi A', 'Mirbagheri B', 'Shahsavani A', 'Etemad K']","['Epidemiology, Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran; Epidemiology, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.

It has been classified as an inhibitory coreceptor for the B-cell receptor because of its function in establishing a baseline level of B-cell inhibition. The restricted expression of CD22 on B cells and its inhibitory function make it an attractive target for B-cell depletion in cases of B-cell malignancies. Genetically modified T cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) derived from the m971 antibody have shown promise when used as an immunotherapeutic agent against B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A key aspect of the efficacy of this CAR-T was its ability to target a membrane-proximal epitope on the CD22 extracellular domain; however, the molecular details of m971 recognition of CD22 have thus far remained elusive. Here, we report the crystal structure of the m971 fragment antigen-binding in complex with the two most membrane-proximal Ig-like domains of CD22 (CD22d6-d7). The m971 epitope on CD22 resides at the most proximal Ig domain (d7) to the membrane, and the antibody paratope contains electrostatic surfaces compatible with interactions with phospholipid head groups. Together, our data identify molecular details underlying the successful transformation of an antibody epitope on CD22 into an effective CAR immunotherapeutic target.","['Ereno-Orbea, June', 'Liu, Xianglei', 'Sicard, Taylor', 'Kucharska, Iga', 'Li, Wei', 'Borovsky, Dorota', 'Cui, Hong', 'Feng, Yang', 'Dimitrov, Dimiter S', 'Julien, Jean-Philippe']","['Ereno-Orbea J', 'Liu X', 'Sicard T', 'Kucharska I', 'Li W', 'Borovsky D', 'Cui H', 'Feng Y', 'Dimitrov DS', 'Julien JP']","['Program in Molecular Medicine, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Ikerbasque, Basque Foundation for Science, Bilbao, Bizkaia, Spain.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Program in Molecular Medicine, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Department of Biochemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Program in Molecular Medicine, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Program in Molecular Medicine, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Protein Interactions Group, Center for Cancer Research Nanobiology Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, Maryland, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Program in Molecular Medicine, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Department of Biochemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Although there is extensive experience using ruxolitinib for patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, the biologic effects and clinical implications of its dosing, tapering, and discontinuation for allogeneic HCT recipients are incompletely characterized. We describe three allogeneic HCT recipients who developed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure within 3 months of ruxolitinib discontinuation. Radiographic findings included marked bilateral ground-glass opacities. Systemic corticosteroids and reinitiation of ruxolitinib resulted in rapid clinical improvement in all three patients. All three patients achieved a significant clinical response, with decrease in oxygen requirement and improvement in radiographic changes. Given the increasing use of ruxolitinib in allogeneic HCT recipients, there is significant impetus to characterize the biologic and clinical effects resulting from discontinuation of ruxolitinib, to better tailor treatment plans and prevent potential adverse effects.","['Anandappa, Annabelle J', 'Hobbs, Gabriela S', 'Dey, Bimalangshu R', 'El-Jawahri, Areej', 'Frigault, Matthew J', 'McAfee, Steven L', ""O'Donnell, Paul V"", 'Spitzer, Thomas R', 'Chen, Yi-Bin', 'DeFilipp, Zachariah']","['Anandappa AJ', 'Hobbs GS', 'Dey BR', 'El-Jawahri A', 'Frigault MJ', 'McAfee SL', ""O'Donnell PV"", 'Spitzer TR', 'Chen YB', 'DeFilipp Z']","['Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Center for Leukemia, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Hematopoietic Cell Transplant and Cellular Therapy Program, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Hematopoietic Cell Transplant and Cellular Therapy Program, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Hematopoietic Cell Transplant and Cellular Therapy Program, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Hematopoietic Cell Transplant and Cellular Therapy Program, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Hematopoietic Cell Transplant and Cellular Therapy Program, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Hematopoietic Cell Transplant and Cellular Therapy Program, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Hematopoietic Cell Transplant and Cellular Therapy Program, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Hematopoietic Cell Transplant and Cellular Therapy Program, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4861-3159', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3556-1495', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6774-5694', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9554-1058', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7994-8974']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210730,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)']",IM,"['*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Nitriles', 'Pyrazoles', 'Pyrimidines', '*Respiratory Insufficiency', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",PMC8571747,['NOTNLM'],"['*Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*Discontinuation', '*Hypoxemic respiratory failure', '*Ruxolitinib']",2021/07/18 06:00,2021/12/22 06:00,['2021/07/17 06:35'],"['2021/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/22 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/17 06:35 [entrez]']",['10.1002/onco.13903 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncologist. 2021 Nov;26(11):e2082-e2085. doi: 10.1002/onco.13903.

The ITA-HEMA-COV project (NCT04352556) investigated patterns of seroconversion for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in patients with HMs. A total of 237 patients, SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive with at least one SARS-CoV-2 IgG test performed during their care, entered the analysis. Among these, 62 (26.2%) had myeloid, 121 (51.1%) lymphoid and 54 (22.8%) plasma cell neoplasms. Overall, 69% of patients (164 of 237) had detectable IgG SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies. Serologically negative patients (31%, 73 of 237) were evenly distributed across patients with myeloid, lymphoid and plasma cell neoplasms. In the multivariable logistic regression, chemoimmunotherapy [odds ratio (OR), 3.42; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-11.21; P = 0.04] was associated with a lower rate of seroconversion. This effect did not decline after 180 days from treatment withdrawal (OR, 0.35; 95% CI: 0.11-1.13; P = 0.08). This study demonstrates a low rate of seroconversion in HM patients and indicates that treatment-mediated immune dysfunction is the main driver. As a consequence, we expect a low rate of seroconversion after vaccination and thus we suggest testing the efficacy of seroconversion in HM patients.","['Passamonti, Francesco', 'Romano, Alessandra', 'Salvini, Marco', 'Merli, Francesco', 'Porta, Matteo G Della', 'Bruna, Riccardo', 'Coviello, Elisa', 'Romano, Ilaria', 'Cairoli, Roberto', 'Lemoli, Roberto', 'Farina, Francesca', 'Venditti, Adriano', 'Busca, Alessandro', 'Ladetto, Marco', 'Massaia, Massimo', 'Pinto, Antonio', 'Arcaini, Luca', 'Tafuri, Agostino', 'Marchesi, Francesco', 'Fracchiolla, Nicola', 'Bocchia, Monica', 'Armiento, Daniele', 'Candoni, Anna', 'Krampera, Mauro', 'Luppi, Mario', 'Cardinali, Valeria', 'Galimberti, Sara', 'Cattaneo, Chiara', 'La Barbera, Elettra Ortu', 'Mina, Roberto', 'Lanza, Francesco', 'Visani, Giuseppe', 'Musto, Pellegrino', 'Petrucci, Luigi', 'Zaja, Francesco', 'Grossi, Paolo A', 'Bertu, Lorenza', 'Pagano, Livio', 'Corradini, Paolo']","['Passamonti F', 'Romano A', 'Salvini M', 'Merli F', 'Porta MGD', 'Bruna R', 'Coviello E', 'Romano I', 'Cairoli R', 'Lemoli R', 'Farina F', 'Venditti A', 'Busca A', 'Ladetto M', 'Massaia M', 'Pinto A', 'Arcaini L', 'Tafuri A', 'Marchesi F', 'Fracchiolla N', 'Bocchia M', 'Armiento D', 'Candoni A', 'Krampera M', 'Luppi M', 'Cardinali V', 'Galimberti S', 'Cattaneo C', 'La Barbera EO', 'Mina R', 'Lanza F', 'Visani G', 'Musto P', 'Petrucci L', 'Zaja F', 'Grossi PA', 'Bertu L', 'Pagano L', 'Corradini P']","[""Dipartimento di Medicina e Chirurgia, Universita dell'Insubria, Varese, Italy."", 'ASST Sette Laghi, Ospedale di Circolo of Varese, Varese, Italy.', 'Universita degli Studi di Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'ASST Sette Laghi, Ospedale di Circolo of Varese, Varese, Italy.', 'Hematology, AUSL-IRCCS, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas Clinical and Research Hospital - IRCCS, Humanitas University, Milano, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Medicine, University of Eastern Piedmont and Ospedale Maggiore della Carita, Novara, Italy.', 'Ospedale Policlinico San Martino-IRCCS, Genova, Italy.', 'University of Florence and AOU Careggi, Firenze, Italy.', 'ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, Milano, Italy.', 'University of Genoa, Genova, Italy.', 'San Raffaele, Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biomedicina e Prevenzione, Universita Tor Vergata, Roma, Italy.', ""Stem Cell Transplant Center, AOU Citta' della Salute e della Scienza of Torino, Torino, Italy."", 'Dip di Medicina Traslazionale, Universita del Piemonte Orientale ed AO SS Antonio e Biagio e Cesare Arrigo, Alessandria, Italy.', 'Santa Croce Hospital, Cuneo, Italy.', 'Istituto Nazionale Tumori IRCCS ""Fondazione G.

This study evaluated the effect of LIF inhibition on the blockage of embryo implantation. A truncated mouse LIF (tmLIF) was designed and expressed in E. coli. The protein expression was optimized using different culture media and inducers. To block pregnancy, the mice were immunized by the purified protein via maternal injection of the protein or in utero injection of the anti-LIF serum. The expression of implantation-relevant genes was quantified in the uterine tissue. The results showed that the protein was expressed in aggregated form in E. coli. The highest yield of protein was produced in the M9 medium. The insoluble protein was completely dissociated by SDS and 2-ME combination, but not by urea. The maternal immunization reduced the number of offspring, but not significantly. Instead, in utero injection of the anti-LIF serum prevented the blastocyst implantation. Gene expression analyses showed decrease of Jam2, Msx1and HB-EGF genes and increase of Muc1 gene as the result of intrauterine administration of the anti-LIF serums. In conclusion, SDS-mediated solubilization of inclusion bodies was compatible with in vivo studies. The intrauterine administration of anti-LIF serum could prevent mouse pregnancy.

Graft-versus-host disease is particularly important, but various other complications, treatment side effects, and relapse of primary disease may also occur. We report an autopsy case of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia with a blastic crisis, in which activated and recovered autologous macrophage-related complications after cord blood transplantation caused the patient's death. Pathological analysis of autopsy specimens revealed diffuse infiltration of mature macrophages into the skin but scarce lymphocytes. These macrophages were found in the bone marrow interspersed with a small number of blasts that had previously occupied about 60% of the bone marrow before death. The direct cause of death was an opportunistic airway infection due to bone marrow and immune failures triggered by overactivation and proliferation of macrophages. Genetic analysis showed the activated macrophages were autologous. Together these findings indicate that the patient died from macrophage-mediated complications, but not from a blastic crisis or conventional graft-versus-host disease. When macrophage activation persists after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, macrophage-mediated complications should be considered as a differential diagnosis. To manage this complication, pathology specimens should be examined to check for the presence of effector cells at an early stage.","['Satoh, Tsugumi', 'Kayano, Hidekazu', 'Watanabe, Atsuko', 'Ohta, Atsuhiko', 'Endoh, Takuya', 'Shimizu, Yuki', 'Fukushima, Takashi', 'Tanaka, Ryuhei', 'Yasuda, Masanori']","['Satoh T', 'Kayano H', 'Watanabe A', 'Ohta A', 'Endoh T', 'Shimizu Y', 'Fukushima T', 'Tanaka R', 'Yasuda M']","['Department of Pathology, Saitama Medical University, International Medical Center, 1397-1, Yamane, Hidaka-shi, Saitama-ken, Japan. tsugumig@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pathology, Saitama Medical University, International Medical Center, 1397-1, Yamane, Hidaka-shi, Saitama-ken, Japan.', 'Faculty of Health and Medical Care, School of Medical Technology, Saitama Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Saitama Medical University, International Medical Center, 1397-1, Yamane, Hidaka-shi, Saitama-ken, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Saitama Medical University, International Medical Center, 1397-1, Yamane, Hidaka-shi, Saitama-ken, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Saitama Medical University, International Medical Center, 1397-1, Yamane, Hidaka-shi, Saitama-ken, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Saitama Medical University, International Medical Center, 1397-1, Yamane, Hidaka-shi, Saitama-ken, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Saitama Medical University, International Medical Center, 1397-1, Yamane, Hidaka-shi, Saitama-ken, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Saitama Medical University, International Medical Center, 1397-1, Yamane, Hidaka-shi, Saitama-ken, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Saitama Medical University, International Medical Center, 1397-1, Yamane, Hidaka-shi, Saitama-ken, Japan.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5807-6321'],['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20210716,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Autopsy', 'Biopsy', 'Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*diagnosis/*etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Macrophages/*pathology', 'Male']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Blastic crisis', 'Graft-versus-host disease', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia', 'Macrophage-mediated complication']",2021/07/18 06:00,2021/09/25 06:00,['2021/07/17 06:29'],"['2021/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/17 06:29 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-021-03189-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-021-03189-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2021 Oct;114(4):517-523. doi: 10.1007/s12185-021-03189-5.

The current review highlights the recent developments in standard intensive post-remission chemotherapy, evidence for the use of recently approved agents, and discusses the relevance of measurable residual disease (MRD) measurement in treatment adaptation. RECENT FINDINGS: Current approvals of midostaurin, venetoclax, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, VYXEOS, ivosidenib, enasidenib, glasdegib, and CC-486 have changed the structure, aim, and schedule of consolidation therapy, and new, well-tolerated agents are being evaluated as maintenance therapies. Furthermore, MRD assessment has been implemented to guide the duration and type of consolidation and maintenance therapy as well as indicate the optimal timing of allo-HCT. Novel therapies have changed the structure and perspective of post-remission therapy in AML for both young and elderly patients. In addition, MRD assessment could guide the type, duration, and intensity of consolidation and maintenance therapy.","['Jaramillo, Sonia', 'Schlenk, Richard F']","['Jaramillo S', 'Schlenk RF']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Rheumatology at Heidelberg University Hospital, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Rheumatology at Heidelberg University Hospital, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany. richard.schlenk@nct-heidelberg.de.', 'NCT-Trial Center, NCT Heidelberg, DKFZ and Heidelberg University Hospital, Im Neuenheimer Feld 130.3, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany. richard.schlenk@nct-heidelberg.de.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2397-3070'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210716,United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,,IM,,PMC8285306,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*CC-486', '*Consolidation therapy', '*Enasidenib', '*Gemtuzumab ozogamicin', '*Glasdegib', '*High-dose cytarabine', '*Ivosidenib', '*Midostaurin', '*VYXEOS', '*Venetoclax']",2021/07/18 06:00,2021/07/18 06:00,['2021/07/17 06:28'],"['2021/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/17 06:28 [entrez]', '2021/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11912-021-01092-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s11912-021-01092-0 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2021 Jul 16;23(9):109. doi: 10.1007/s11912-021-01092-0.,109,['(c) 2021.

However, it remains less clear whether pretransplant MRD status affects transplant outcomes in core binding factor AML (CBF-AML). We retrospectively evaluated the effect of pretransplant MRD, which was measured by a polymerase chain reaction of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or CBFB-MYH11 fusion transcripts, on transplant outcomes for a cohort of 959 adult patients with t(8;21) or inv(16) AML treated by allogeneic HCT during complete remission (CR), between 2000 and 2018. Multivariate analysis showed the absence of pretransplant MRD was significantly associated with lower relapse (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; P < 0.001), treatment failure (HR, 0.66; P = 0.004), and overall mortality (HR, 0.72; P = 0.037) among patients with t(8;21). However, pretransplant MRD negativity was not associated with relapse (HR, 0.73; P = 0.420), treatment failure (HR, 0.64; P = 0.063), or overall mortality (HR, 0.69; P = 0.149) among patients with inv(16). In subgroup analysis, pretransplant MRD status significantly affected relapse and LFS only in patients with t(8;21) undergoing allogeneic HCT during CR2. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the different prognostic values of pretransplant MRD for CBF-AML, highlighting the need to develop effective therapeutic strategies for such MRD-positive patients.","['Konuma, Takaaki', 'Kondo, Tadakazu', 'Masuko, Masayoshi', 'Shimizu, Hiroaki', 'Shiratori, Souichi', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Kato, Jun', 'Sawa, Masashi', 'Ozawa, Yukiyasu', 'Ota, Shuichi', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Kako, Shinichi', 'Fujisawa, Shin', 'Fukushima, Kentaro', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Yanada, Masamitsu']","['Konuma T', 'Kondo T', 'Masuko M', 'Shimizu H', 'Shiratori S', 'Fukuda T', 'Kato J', 'Sawa M', 'Ozawa Y', 'Ota S', 'Uchida N', 'Kanda Y', 'Kako S', 'Fujisawa S', 'Fukushima K', 'Ichinohe T', 'Atsuta Y', 'Yanada M']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. tkonuma@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Anjo Kosei Hospital, Anjo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Haematology, Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Administration, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya, Japan.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1496-376X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8959-6271', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5528-7112', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1869-5480', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3631-244X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5952-5926', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4866-9307', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2635-3395', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0393-4066', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4404-2870', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1602-9775']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210716,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,,,,,2021/07/18 06:00,2021/07/18 06:00,['2021/07/17 06:12'],"['2020/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/18 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/17 06:12 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-021-01409-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-021-01409-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2021 Nov;56(11):2779-2787. doi: 10.1038/s41409-021-01409-4.

The most common adverse events are immune related and include cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. However, early and late hematological toxicity has emerged as a substantial clinical hurdle leading among others to an increased risk for infections or bleeding. The underlying pathophysiology remains elusive and supportive measures comprise stem cell support or the use of growth factors. Here, we report a 66-year-old woman with r/r diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that received anti-CD19 CAR-T-cells achieving a complete metabolic remission. At month 3 after adoptive cell transfer, the patient still exhibited a grade 3 anemia and a grade 4 thrombocytopenia. The latter required regular platelet transfusions. Bone marrow smear revealed hypocellularity without dysplasia. Despite reduced megakaryopoiesis, immature platelet fraction was elevated indicating an at least partially consumptive underlying component. Based on the successful use of Romiplostim, a thrombopoietin receptor-agonist, in aplastic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia, we treated our patient accordingly. Platelet count (and hemoglobin levels) increased and the patient remains transfusion-free. Taken together, our therapeutic approach could represent a novel strategy for managing CAR-T-cell-related hematotoxicity but, self-evidently, requires further controlled clinical studies.","['Baur, Rebecca', 'Jitschin, Regina', 'Kharboutli, Soraya', 'Stoll, Andrej', 'Volkl, Simon', 'Buttner-Herold, Maike', 'Schmidt, Daniela', 'Rosler, Wolf', 'Mackensen, Andreas', 'Mougiakakos, Dimitrios']","['Baur R', 'Jitschin R', 'Kharboutli S', 'Stoll A', 'Volkl S', 'Buttner-Herold M', 'Schmidt D', 'Rosler W', 'Mackensen A', 'Mougiakakos D']","['Department of Internal Medicine 5 - Hematology and Clinical Oncology, Friedrich Alexander University (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 - Hematology and Clinical Oncology, Friedrich Alexander University (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 - Hematology and Clinical Oncology, Friedrich Alexander University (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 - Hematology and Clinical Oncology, Friedrich Alexander University (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 - Hematology and Clinical Oncology, Friedrich Alexander University (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Dept. of Nephropathology, Friedrich Alexander University (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Clinic of Nuclear Medicine, Friedrich Alexander University (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 - Hematology and Clinical Oncology, Friedrich Alexander University (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 - Hematology and Clinical Oncology, Friedrich Alexander University (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Deutsches Zentrum fur Immuntherapie (DZI), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 - Hematology and Clinical Oncology, Friedrich Alexander University (FAU), Erlangen, Germany dimitrios.mougiakakos@uk-erlangen.de.', 'Deutsches Zentrum fur Immuntherapie (DZI), Erlangen, Germany.']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD19/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*therapeutic use', 'Thrombocytopenia/*drug therapy']",PMC8287610,['NOTNLM'],"['*adoptive', '*chimeric antigen', '*hematologic neoplasms', '*immunotherapy', '*receptors']",2021/07/18 06:00,2022/01/12 06:00,['2021/07/17 05:44'],"['2021/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/17 05:44 [entrez]', '2021/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['jitc-2021-002721 [pii]', '10.1136/jitc-2021-002721 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2021 Jul;9(7). pii: jitc-2021-002721. doi: 10.1136/jitc-2021-002721.,,"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Ruxolitinib does not address all aspects of the disease, however; notably cytopenias, and its ability to modify the underlying biology of the disease remains in question. Furthermore, patients eventually lose response to ruxolitinib. Multiple groups have reported the median overall survival of MF patients after ruxolitinib discontinuation to be 13 to 14 months. While consensus criteria only recognize splenic and blast progression as ""progressive disease"" in patients with MF, disease progression can occur in a variety of ways. Besides increasing splenomegaly and progression to accelerated phase/leukemic transformation, patients may develop worsening disease-related symptoms, cytopenias, progressive leukocytosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, etc. As in the frontline setting, treatment needs to be tailored to the clinical needs of the patient. Current treatment options for patients with MF who fail ruxolitinib remain unsatisfactory, and this continues to represent an area of major unmet medical need. The regulatory approval of fedratinib has introduced an important option in the postruxolitinib setting. Fortunately, a plethora of novel agents, both new JAK inhibitors and drugs from other classes, eg, bromodomain and extraterminal (BET), murine double minute 2 (MDM2) and telomerase inhibitors, activin receptor ligand traps, BH3-mimetics and more, are poised to greatly expand the therapeutic armamentarium for patients with MF if successful in pivotal trials.","['Bose, Prithviraj', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Bose P', 'Verstovsek S']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

In particular, E2A, a member of the E protein family, plays a major role in the transcriptional regulatory network that promotes the differentiation and development of B and T lymphocytes. E2A-mediated transcriptional regulation usually requires the formation of E2A dimers, which then bind to coregulators. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms by which E2A participates in transcriptional regulation from a structural perspective. More specifically, the C-terminal helix-loop-helix (HLH) region of the basic HLH (bHLH) domain first dimerizes, and then the activation domains of E2A bind to different coactivators or corepressors in different cell contexts, resulting in histone acetylation or deacetylation, respectively. Then, the N-terminal basic region (b) of the bHLH domain binds to or dissociates from a specific DNA motif (E-box sequence). Last, trans-activation or trans-repression occurs. We also summarize the properties of these E2A domains and their interactions with the domains of other proteins. The feasibility of developing drugs based on these domains is discussed.","['Liang, Jia-Jie', 'Peng, Hu', 'Wang, Jiao-Jiao', 'Liu, Xiao-Hui', 'Ma, Lan', 'Ni, Yi-Ran', 'Yang, Huai-Jie', 'Zhang, Yan-Qiong', 'Ai, Wen-Bing', 'Wu, Jiang-Feng']","['Liang JJ', 'Peng H', 'Wang JJ', 'Liu XH', 'Ma L', 'Ni YR', 'Yang HJ', 'Zhang YQ', 'Ai WB', 'Wu JF']","['Medical College, China Three Gorges University, 8 Daxue Road, Xiling District, Yichang, 443002, China.', 'Institute of Organ Fibrosis and Targeted Drug Delivery, China Three Gorges University, 8 Daxue Road, Xiling District, Yichang, 443002, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Immunotherapy, China Three Gorges University, 8 Daxue Road, Xiling District, Yichang, 443002, China.', 'Institute of Organ Fibrosis and Targeted Drug Delivery, China Three Gorges University, 8 Daxue Road, Xiling District, Yichang, 443002, China.', 'The Yiling Hospital of Yichang, 32 Donghu Road, Yi Ling District, Yichang, 443100, Hubei, China.', 'Medical College, China Three Gorges University, 8 Daxue Road, Xiling District, Yichang, 443002, China.', 'Medical College, China Three Gorges University, 8 Daxue Road, Xiling District, Yichang, 443002, China.', 'Medical College, China Three Gorges University, 8 Daxue Road, Xiling District, Yichang, 443002, China.', 'Institute of Organ Fibrosis and Targeted Drug Delivery, China Three Gorges University, 8 Daxue Road, Xiling District, Yichang, 443002, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Immunotherapy, China Three Gorges University, 8 Daxue Road, Xiling District, Yichang, 443002, China.', 'Medical College, China Three Gorges University, 8 Daxue Road, Xiling District, Yichang, 443002, China.', 'Institute of Organ Fibrosis and Targeted Drug Delivery, China Three Gorges University, 8 Daxue Road, Xiling District, Yichang, 443002, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Immunotherapy, China Three Gorges University, 8 Daxue Road, Xiling District, Yichang, 443002, China.', ""The People's Hospital of China Three Gorges University, 31 Huti Subdistrict, Xi Ling District, Yichang, 443000, Hubei, China."", 'Medical College, China Three Gorges University, 8 Daxue Road, Xiling District, Yichang, 443002, China.', 'Institute of Organ Fibrosis and Targeted Drug Delivery, China Three Gorges University, 8 Daxue Road, Xiling District, Yichang, 443002, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Immunotherapy, China Three Gorges University, 8 Daxue Road, Xiling District, Yichang, 443002, China.', 'The Yiling Hospital of Yichang, 32 Donghu Road, Yi Ling District, Yichang, 443100, Hubei, China. 1043642574@qq.com.', 'Medical College, China Three Gorges University, 8 Daxue Road, Xiling District, Yichang, 443002, China. wujiangfeng@ctgu.edu.cn.', 'Institute of Organ Fibrosis and Targeted Drug Delivery, China Three Gorges University, 8 Daxue Road, Xiling District, Yichang, 443002, China. wujiangfeng@ctgu.edu.cn.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Immunotherapy, China Three Gorges University, 8 Daxue Road, Xiling District, Yichang, 443002, China. wujiangfeng@ctgu.edu.cn.', ""The People's Hospital of China Three Gorges University, 31 Huti Subdistrict, Xi Ling District, Yichang, 443000, Hubei, China. wujiangfeng@ctgu.edu.cn."", 'The Yiling Hospital of Yichang, 32 Donghu Road, Yi Ling District, Yichang, 443100, Hubei, China. wujiangfeng@ctgu.edu.cn.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4717-0141'],['eng'],"['WJ2019H533/Health commission of Hubei Province scientific research project', '81670555/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81701484/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2019KZL05/The Opening Foundation of Hubei Key Laboratory of Tumor', 'Microenvironment and Immunotherapy']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210716,Greece,J Biol Res (Thessalon),"Journal of biological research (Thessalonike, Greece)",101248115,,,,PMC8283981,['NOTNLM'],"['Activation domain', 'E2A', 'Structural basis', 'bHLH domain']",2021/07/18 06:00,2021/07/18 06:01,['2021/07/17 05:32'],"['2021/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/17 05:32 [entrez]', '2021/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40709-021-00146-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s40709-021-00146-5 [pii]']",epublish,J Biol Res (Thessalon). 2021 Jul 16;28(1):15. doi: 10.1186/s40709-021-00146-5.,15,['(c) 2021.

METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with new APL diagnoses underwent conventional cytogenetic analysis; fluorescence in situ hybridization for t(15;17)(q22;q21) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction detected PML/RARalpha in two forms: L (length) and S (short) and accepted treatment with all-trans retinoic acid and chemotherapy. Patients with additional chromosome aberrations were designated as the complex karyotype group and were compared with patients with only t(15;17), who were designated as the simple karyotype group. RESULTS: Additional chromosome aberrations was observed in 18/57 patients (31.6%) at initial diagnosis. Outcome was significantly different between the simple karyotype group and the complex karyotype group for complete remission (92.3% vs. 66.7% respectively, p = .025), overall survival at 3 years (92.3% vs. 65.0%, respectively, p = .017), and progression-free survival at 3 years (81.4% vs. 44.4%, respectively, p = .024).

In addition, CD19 CAR-T cells have been approved by the FDA for treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In this context, it is vital to detect cellular cytotoxicity and monitor the quality of ex vivo expanded immune cells before product release and patient infusion. Target cells could proliferate in parallel with effector cells during the cytotoxicity assay, making it difficult to estimate the death ratio using conventional approaches. Meanwhile, non-specific dyes or non-homogeneous biomarkers for target cells may interfere with the final readout post addition of effector cells. Here, we modified a component of the coincubation medium to suppress the spontaneous release of bis(acetoxymethyl)2,2':6',2''-terpyridine-6,6''-dicarboxylate and sustained the window at a stable range (~70%). Further, the optimized Eu-TDA method presented reliable outcomes compared with lactate dehydrogenase detection and was compatible with cytotoxicity tests for NK cells and specific CTLs. Finally, the reported assay can accurately detect death of target cells depending on the amount of hydrophilic complex and can be reliably applied in quality control and cell activity evaluation tests on co-suspended effector and target cells. SUMMARY: A medium component for cellular coincubations (and associated protocols) have been optimized and validated for cytotoxicity assays, which can reliably evaluate the potency of engineered CD19 CAR-T cells, NK cells, and specific CTLs. In particular, the reported method can be applied widely in routine assays for bi-suspended effector and target cells with a stable window.","['Cui, Lei', 'Yin, Feng', 'Cheng, Jingbo', 'Liu, Hui', 'Zheng, Meimei', 'Liu, Di', 'Wu, Zeji', 'Qian, Qiqun']","['Cui L', 'Yin F', 'Cheng J', 'Liu H', 'Zheng M', 'Liu D', 'Wu Z', 'Qian Q']","['Shanghai Cell Therapy Group Co., LTD, Shanghai 201805, China.', 'Shanghai Cell Therapy Group Co., LTD, Shanghai 201805, China.', 'Shanghai Cell Therapy Group Co., LTD, Shanghai 201805, China.', 'Shanghai Cell Therapy Group Co., LTD, Shanghai 201805, China.', 'Shanghai Cell Therapy Group Co., LTD, Shanghai 201805, China.', 'Shanghai Cell Therapy Group Co., LTD, Shanghai 201805, China.', 'Shanghai Cell Therapy Group Co., LTD, Shanghai 201805, China.', 'Shanghai Cell Therapy Group Co., LTD, Shanghai 201805, China.

We expand severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) T cells from the peripheral blood of COVID-19-recovered donors and non-exposed controls using different culture conditions. We observe that the choice of cytokines modulates the expansion, phenotype, and hierarchy of antigenic recognition by SARS-CoV-2 T cells. Culture with interleukin (IL)-2/4/7, but not under other cytokine-driven conditions, results in more than 1,000-fold expansion in SARS-CoV-2 T cells with a retained phenotype, function, and hierarchy of antigenic recognition compared with baseline (pre-expansion) samples. Expanded cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are directed against structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including the receptor-binding domain of Spike. SARS-CoV-2 T cells cannot be expanded efficiently from the peripheral blood of non-exposed controls. Because corticosteroids are used for management of severe COVID-19, we propose an efficient strategy to inactivate the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) in SARS-CoV-2 CTLs using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing.","['Basar, Rafet', 'Uprety, Nadima', 'Ensley, Emily', 'Daher, May', 'Klein, Kimberly', 'Martinez, Fernando', 'Aung, Fleur', 'Shanley, Mayra', 'Hu, Bingqian', 'Gokdemir, Elif', 'Nunez Cortes,

The aim of this study was to gain insight into the mutational profile of IDH-mutated patients, such as the frequency and clinical characteristics of coexisting mutated genes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated 485 newly diagnosed AML patients (range 18-81 years). DNA was extracted from bone marrow samples at the time of diagnosis. All samples were investigated with a panel of 49 mutational genes using next-generation sequencing (NGS). FLT3-ITD, NPM1, and CEBPA mutations were detected by Sanger PCR sequencing. RESULTS: We found 84 patients (17.3%) with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. There were 40 IDH1(R132) , 15 IDH2(R140Q) , 17 IDH2(R172K) , and 12 uncommon mutations. No patient was found to have both IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. Patients with IDH2(R140Q) mutations were more frequently older and presented with significantly lower average platelet counts, while IDH2(R172K) -mutated patients had significantly lower white blood cell (WBC) counts. On the background of IDH mutations, the presence of a normal karyotype showed a balanced distribution. The four most frequently coexisting mutated genes were NPM1, DNMT3A, TET2, and FLT3-ITD. The majority of coexisting mutated genes were involved in regulating transcription and DNA methylation. IDH mutation status had no effect on the CR rate, regardless of other molecular abnormalities. CONCLUSION: Isocitrate dehydrogenases mutations are associated with a complex coexisting mutation cluster in AML. Future investigation is needed to reveal the association between IDH mutations and other genetic abnormalities, which may have an impact on the progression and prognosis of disease.","['Lu, Jingtao', 'Chen, Meiyu', 'Hua, Haiying', 'Qin, Wei', 'Zhang, Ri', 'Lu, Xuzhang', 'Chao, Hongying']","['Lu J', 'Chen M', 'Hua H', 'Qin W', 'Zhang R', 'Lu X', 'Chao H']","['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Changzhou Second Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Changzhou Second Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Changzhou Second Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Changzhou Second Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Changzhou Second Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, China.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6850-0763', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3836-9260']",['eng'],"['20180033/Changzhou Sci Tech Program', ""2019K002/Young Scientists Foundation of Changzhou No. 2 People's Hospital"", 'QN202035/Science and Technology Project of Changzhou Health Committee', 'NMUB201/Science and Technology Development Fund Project of Nanjing Medical', 'University', 'CE20205027/Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University']",['Journal Article'],20210716,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

Germline mutations in GATA binding protein 2 (GATA2) led to haploinsufficiency, severe cytopenias of multiple cell lineages, susceptibility to infections and strong propensity to develop myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute myeloid leukemia. Mechanisms of progressive cytopenias remain unclear. MicroRNA (miRNA) represents a unique mechanism of post-transcriptional gene regulation. In this study, miRNA profiles were evaluated and eight miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed (>/=2-fold, P </= 0.05) in patient-derived cell lines (N = 13) in comparison to controls (N = 10). miR-9, miR-181a-2-3p, miR-181c, miR-181c-3p, miR-486-3p, and miR-582 showed increased expression, whereas miR-223 and miR-424-3p showed decreased expression. Cell death assays indicated that miR-181c potently induces cell death in lymphoid (Ly-8 and SP-53) and myeloid (HL-60) cell lines. miR-181c was predicted to target myeloid cell leukemia (MCL)1, which was confirmed by transfection assays, resulting in significantly reduced MCL1 mRNA and decreased live cell numbers. Bone marrow analysis of 34 GATA2 patients showed significantly decreased cellularity, CD34-positive cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, NK cells, B cells, and B cell precursors in comparison to healthy controls (N = 29; P < 0.001 for each), which was accompanied by decreased levels of MCL1 (P < 0.05). GATA2 expression led to significant repression of miR-181c expression in transfection experiments. Conversely, knockdown of GATA2 led to increased miR-181c expression. These findings indicate that miR-181c expression is increased and MCL1 levels decreased in GATA2 deficiency cells, and that GATA2 represses miR-181c transcription. Increased miR-181c may contribute to elevated cell death and cytopenia in GATA2 deficiency potentially through down-regulation of MCL1.","['Wang, Weixin', 'Chen, Rui', 'Droll, Stephenie', 'Barber, Emily', 'Saleh, Layla', 'Corrigan-Cummins, Meghan', 'Trick, Megan', 'Anastas, Vollter', 'Hawk, Nga Voong', 'Zhao, Zhen', 'Vinh, Donald C', 'Hsu, Amy', 'Hickstein, Dennis D', 'Holland, Steven M', 'Calvo, Katherine R']","['Wang W', 'Chen R', 'Droll S', 'Barber E', 'Saleh L', 'Corrigan-Cummins M', 'Trick M', 'Anastas V', 'Hawk NV', 'Zhao Z', 'Vinh DC', 'Hsu A', 'Hickstein DD', 'Holland SM', 'Calvo KR']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Beijing Tong-Ren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Hematology Section, Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute (NCI), NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Canada.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Immune Deficiency Cellular Therapy Program, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210716,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'GATA2', 'MCL1', 'MDS', 'apoptosis', 'bone marrow failure', 'immunodeficiency', 'miR-181c', 'miRNA']",2021/07/17 06:00,2021/07/17 06:00,['2021/07/16 18:02'],"['2021/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/17 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/16 18:02 [entrez]']",['10.1002/JLB.2A1220-824R [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Leukoc Biol. 2021 Jul 16. doi: 10.1002/JLB.2A1220-824R.,,"['(c)2021 Society for Leukocyte Biology.

We studied the relationship between occupational insecticide use and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) by pooling data from nine case-control studies participating in the InterLymph Consortium, including 7909 cases and 8644 controls from North America, the European Union and Australia. Insecticide use was coded using self-report or expert assessment, for insecticide groups (eg, organophosphates, pyrethroids) and active ingredients (eg, malathion, permethrin). Associations with insecticides were estimated using logistic regression to produce odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all NHL and NHL subtypes, with adjustment for study site, demographic factors and use of other pesticides. Occupational insecticide use, overall, was not associated with risk of NHL. Use of organophosphate insecticides was associated with increased risk of all NHL and the subtype follicular lymphoma, and an association was found with diazinon, in particular (ever use: OR = 2.05, 95%CI: 1.24-3.37). The carbamate insecticide, carbaryl, was associated with risk of all NHL, and the strongest associations were found with T-cell NHL for ever-use (OR = 2.44, 95%CI: 1.13-5.28) and longer duration (>8 years vs never: OR = 2.90, 95%CI: 1.02-8.25). There was no association of NHL with other broad groups of insecticides, including organochlorines and pyrethroids, and some inverse associations were estimated in relation to historical DDT use. Our findings contribute to the totality of evidence available to help inform risk decisions by public health and regulatory agencies of importance given continued, widespread use of organophosphate and carbamate insecticides.","['De Roos, Anneclaire J', 'Schinasi, Leah H', 'Miligi, Lucia', 'Cerhan, James R', 'Bhatti, Parveen', ""'t Mannetje, Andrea"", 'Baris, Dalsu', 'Benavente, Yolanda',

The response rate to the first-line chemotherapy of cisplatin and gemcitabine does not exceed 50%. In our previous research, elevated BMI1 (B-cell specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration region 1) expression in bladder cancer conferred poor survival and was associated with chemoresistance. Herein, via analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database and validation of clinical samples, BMI1 was elevated in patients with bladder cancer resistant to cisplatin and gemcitabine, which conferred tumor relapse and progression. Consistently, BMI1 was markedly increased in the established cisplatin- and gemcitabine-resistant T24 cells (T24/DDP&GEM). Functionally, BMI1 overexpression dramatically promoted drug efflux, enhanced viability and decreased apoptosis of bladder cancer cells upon treatment with cisplatin or gemcitabine, whereas BMI1 downregulation reversed this effect. Mechanically, upon interaction with p53, BMI1 was recruited on the promoter of miR-3682-3p gene concomitant with an increase in the mono-ubiquitination of histone H2A lysine 119, leading to transcription repression of miR-3682-3p gene followed by derepression of ABCB1 (ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 1) gene. Moreover, suppression of P-glycoprotein by miR-3682-3p mimics or its inhibitor XR-9576, could significantly reverse chemoresistance of T24/DDP&GEM cells. These results provided a novel insight into a portion of the mechanism underlying BMI1-mediated chemoresistance in bladder cancer.","['Chen, Ming-Kun', 'Zhou, Jun-Hao', 'Wang, Peng', 'Ye, Yun-Lin', 'Liu, Yang', 'Zhou, Jia-Wei', 'Chen, Zi-Jian', 'Yang, Jian-Kun', 'Liao, De-Ying', 'Liang, Zhi-Jian', 'Xie, Xiao', 'Zhou, Qi-Zhao', 'Xue, Kang-Yi', 'Guo, Wen-Bin', 'Xia, Ming', 'Bao, Ji-Ming', 'Yang, Cheng', 'Duan, Hai-Feng', 'Wang, Hong-Yi', 'Huang, Zhi-Peng', 'Qin, Zi-Ke', 'Liu, Cun-Dong']","['Chen MK', 'Zhou JH', 'Wang P', 'Ye YL', 'Liu Y', 'Zhou JW', 'Chen ZJ', 'Yang JK', 'Liao DY', 'Liang ZJ', 'Xie X', 'Zhou QZ', 'Xue KY', 'Guo WB', 'Xia M', 'Bao JM', 'Yang C', 'Duan HF', 'Wang HY', 'Huang ZP', 'Qin ZK', 'Liu CD']","['Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510630, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510630, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510630, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510630, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510630, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510630, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510630, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510630, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510630, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510630, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510630, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510630, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510630, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510630, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510630, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510630, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510630, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510630, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510630, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510630, China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210716,United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC8351696,['NOTNLM'],"['*BMI1', '*P-glycoprotein', '*bladder cancer', '*chemoresistance', '*miR-3682-3p']",2021/07/17 06:00,2021/12/17 06:00,['2021/07/16 17:26'],"['2020/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/17 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/16 17:26 [entrez]']","['203277 [pii]', '10.18632/aging.203277 [doi]']",ppublish,Aging (Albany NY). 2021 Jul 16;13(14):18310-18330. doi: 10.18632/aging.203277.

Real-world data of ATLL in Latin America are lacking. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed patients with ATLL (acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering) encountered in 11 Latin American countries between 1995 and 2019. Treatment response was assessed according to the 2009 consensus report. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. RESULTS: We identified 253 patients; 226 (lymphomatous: n = 122, acute: n = 73, chronic: n = 26, and smoldering: n = 5) had sufficient data for analysis (median age 57 years). Most patients with ATLL were from Peru (63%), Chile (17%), Argentina (8%), and Colombia (7%). Hypercalcemia was positively associated with acute type (57% v lymphomatous 27%, P = .014). The median survival times (months) were 4.3, 7.9, 21.1, and not reached for acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering forms, with 4-year survival rates of 8%, 22%, 40%, and 80%, respectively. First-line zidovudine (AZT)-interferon alfa (IFN) resulted in an overall response rate of 63% (complete response [CR] 24%) for acute. First-line chemotherapy yielded an overall response rate of 41% (CR 29%) for lymphomatous. CR rate was 42% for etoposide, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone versus 12% for cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone-like regimen (P < .001). Progression-free survival at 1 year for acute type patients treated with AZT-IFN was 67%, whereas 2-year progression-free survival in lymphomatous type patients who achieved CR after chemotherapy was 77%. CONCLUSION: This study confirms Latin American ATLL presents at a younger age and has a high incidence of lymphomatous type, low incidence of indolent subtypes, and worse survival rates as compared with Japanese patients. In aggressive ATLL, chemotherapy remains the preferred choice for lymphomatous favoring etoposide-based regimen (etoposide, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone), whereas AZT-IFN remains a good first-line option for acute subtype.","['Malpica, Luis', 'Enriquez, Daniel J', 'Castro, Denisse A', 'Pena, Camila', 'Idrobo, Henry', 'Fiad, Lorena', 'Prates, Maria', 'Otero, Victoria',

We describe the distribution of categories of evidence and consensus (EC) among the 10 most common hematologic malignancies with regard to recommendations for staging, initial and salvage therapy, and surveillance. Methods: We reviewed the level of evidence for the 10 most common hematological malignancies by incidence in the United States as of 2020. The NCCN definitions for EC are: category 1, high level of evidence, such as randomized controlled trials, with uniform consensus; category 2A, lower level of evidence with uniform consensus; category 2B, lower level of evidence without a uniform consensus but with no major disagreement; and category 3, any level of evidence but with major disagreement. We compared our results with previously published results from 2011. Results: Of 1353 recommendations, 5%, 91%, 4%, and 1% fell into EC categories 1, 2A, 2B, and 3, respectively, while in 2011 the comparable percentages were 3%, 93%, 4%, and 0%, respectively. Recommendations with category 1 EC were found in all guidelines, except for Burkitt lymphoma. Of all therapeutic recommendations, 6.3% were category 1 EC, with the majority of these (56.4%) pertaining to initial therapy. Guidelines with highest proportions of therapeutic recommendations with category 1 EC were multiple myeloma (12.4%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (6.9%), and acute myeloid leukemia (5.6%). Conclusions: Recommendations in the 2020 NCCN guidelines are largely developed from lower levels of evidence but with uniform expert opinion, underscoring the urgent need and available opportunities to expand the current evidence base in malignant hematological disorders.","['Chengappa, Madhuri', 'Desai, Aakash', 'Go, Ronald', 'Poonacha, Thejawsi']","['Chengappa M', 'Desai A', 'Go R', 'Poonacha T']","['Department of Medicine, Nazareth Hospital, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210716,United States,Oncology (Williston Park),"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",8712059,,IM,,,,,2021/07/17 06:00,2021/07/17 06:00,['2021/07/16 14:15'],"['2021/07/16 14:15 [entrez]', '2021/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.46883/ONC.2021.3507.390 [doi]'],epublish,Oncology (Williston Park). 2021 Jul 16;35(7):390-396. doi: 10.46883/ONC.2021.3507.390.,390-396,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Several studies have evaluated the gene expression profile of mantle cell lymphoma, differentiating LV-MCL from cMCL. The typical immunophenotypic profile is CD5-positive, SOX 11-negative, CD23-low, CD200-low, and cyclin D1 overexpressed. LV-MCL commonly has mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes. Data on treatment of LV-MCL is limited to retrospective analyses; the ideal treatment for these patients is unknown although many have a clinically indolent, asymptomatic presentation and often may be observed for an extended period without active treatment. LV-MCL is a clinically and biologically distinct entity. Clinically, it must be distinguished from chronic lymphocytic leukemia and cMCL.

In vitro data suggest that CD4+ T lymphocytes also sustain survival and proliferation of CLL clones through CD40L/CD40 interactions. In vivo data in animal models are conflicting. To clarify this clinically relevant biological issue, we generated genetically modified Emu-TCL1 mice lacking CD4+ T cells (TCL1+/+AB0), CD40 (TCL1+/+CD40-/-), or CD8+ T cells (TCL1+/+TAP-/-), and we monitored the appearance and progression of a disease that mimics aggressive human CLL by flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analyses. Findings were confirmed by adoptive transfer of leukemic cells into mice lacking CD4+ T cells or CD40L or mice treated with antibodies depleting CD4 T cells or blocking CD40L/CD40 interactions. CLL clones did not proliferate in mice lacking or depleted of CD4+ T cells, thus confirming that CD4+ T cells are essential for CLL development. By contrast, CD8+ T cells exerted an antitumor activity, as indicated by the accelerated disease progression in TCL1+/+TAP-/- mice. Antigen specificity of CD4+ T cells was marginal for CLL development, because CLL clones efficiently proliferated in transgenic mice whose CD4 T cells had a T-cell receptor with CLL-unrelated specificities. Leukemic clones also proliferated when transferred into wild-type mice treated with monoclonal antibodies blocking CD40 or into CD40L-/- mice, and TCL1+/+CD40-/- mice developed frank CLL. Our data demonstrate that CD8+ T cells restrain CLL progression, whereas CD4+ T cells support the growth of leukemic clones in TCL1 mice through CD40-independent and apparently noncognate mechanisms.","['Grioni, Matteo', 'Brevi, Arianna', 'Cattaneo, Elena', 'Rovida, Alessandra', 'Bordini, Jessica', 'Bertilaccio, Maria Teresa Sabrina', 'Ponzoni, Maurilio', 'Casorati, Giulia', 'Dellabona, Paolo', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Bellone, Matteo', 'Calcinotto, Arianna']","['Grioni M', 'Brevi A', 'Cattaneo E', 'Rovida A', 'Bordini J', 'Bertilaccio MTS', 'Ponzoni M', 'Casorati G', 'Dellabona P', 'Ghia P', 'Bellone M', 'Calcinotto A']","['Cellular Immunology Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation, and Infectious Diseases.', 'Cellular Immunology Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation, and Infectious Diseases.', 'Cellular Immunology Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation, and Infectious Diseases.', 'Unit of B Cell Neoplasia, Division of Experimental Oncology, and.', 'Unit of B Cell Neoplasia, Division of Experimental Oncology, and.', 'Unit of Lymphoid Malignancies, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of Lymphoid Malignancies, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy; and.', 'Experimental Immunology Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation, and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Experimental Immunology Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation, and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of B Cell Neoplasia, Division of Experimental Oncology, and.', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy; and.', 'Cellular Immunology Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation, and Infectious Diseases.', 'Cellular Immunology Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation, and Infectious Diseases.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2586-2569', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5102-4112', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2586-2569', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1746-6424']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD40 Ligand/genetics', '*Dromaiidae', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins']",PMC8341348,,,2021/07/17 06:00,2021/07/24 06:00,['2021/07/16 12:26'],"['2020/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/16 12:26 [entrez]', '2021/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(21)00369-4 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020003795 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2021 Jul 27;5(14):2817-2828. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020003795.,2817-2828,['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies examining factors that cause early death (ED; within 30 days of admission) and the correlation of survival with the timing of administration of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and hemostatic parameters are scarce. We performed a cohort analysis of nonselect patients with newly diagnosed APL who presented to the health care system in Hong Kong, where oral arsenic trioxide was used. From 1 January 2007 to 30 April 2020, 358 patients (median age, 47 [1-97] years) with newly diagnosed APL were identified. ED occurred in 56 patients (16%): 11 (3%) died in the first 2 days after admission (intracranial hemorrhage [ICH], n = 6; APL-differentiation syndrome [APL-DS], n = 4; infection, n = 1); 22 (6%) died within 3 to 7 days (ICH, n = 12; APL-DS, n = 8; infections, n = 2), and 23 (6%) died within 8 to 30 days (ICH, n = 7; APL-DS, n = 11; infection, n = 5). Factors significantly associated with ED by multivariate analysis included male sex (P = .01); presenting leukocyte count >/=10 x 109/L (P = .03); fibrinogen <1.5 g/L (P = .02); and ATRA administration >24 hours after hospital admission (P < .001). After a median follow-up of 47 (0-166) months, the 5- and 10-year overall survival (OS) was 68.6% and 61.2%, respectively. Excluding EDs, the 5- and 10-year post-30-day OS improved to 81.3% and 72.5%. Early administration of ATRA (<24 hours) and vigorous correction of hemostatic abnormalities, including hypofibrinogenemia, are key to reducing ED.","['Gill, Harinder', 'Yung, Yammy', 'Chu, Hiu-Tung', 'Au, Wing-Yan', 'Yip, Pui-Kwan', 'Lee, Emily', 'Yim, Rita', 'Lee, Paul', 'Cheuk, Daniel', 'Ha, Shau-Yin', 'Leung, Rock Y Y', 'Ma, Edmond S K', 'Kumana, Cyrus R', 'Kwong, Yok-Lam']","['Gill H', 'Yung Y', 'Chu HT', 'Au WY', 'Yip PK', 'Lee E', 'Yim R', 'Lee P', 'Cheuk D', 'Ha SY', 'Leung RYY', 'Ma ESK', 'Kumana CR', 'Kwong YL']","['Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Blood-Med Clinic, Central, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Division of Haematology and Blood Bank, Department of Pathology and Clinical Biochemistry, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China; and.', 'Department of Pathology, Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9551-4893', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1754-1247', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4149-0435', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1259-2205']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tretinoin']",PMC8341351,,,2021/07/17 06:00,2021/07/24 06:00,['2021/07/16 12:26'],"['2021/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/16 12:26 [entrez]', '2021/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(21)00370-0 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2021004789 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2021 Jul 27;5(14):2829-2838. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2021004789.,2829-2838,['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed at a single institution from 2004 to 2017. Pathology reports, operative notes, and patients' medical charts were reviewed. RESULTS: Of 566 lacrimal sacs submitted for routine histopathologic evaluation, 16 cases of lymphoma were identified. All were low-grade, non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas, biopsied at an average age of 71 years. Thirteen patients (81.25%) had a pre-existing lymphoma diagnosis; the average interval between the diagnosis of systemic or nonocular adnexal lymphoma and lacrimal sac lymphoma was 7.9 years (range 2-26 years; median 5.5 years). Three cases of primary lacrimal sac lymphoma were identified. Histopathology showed 3 cases (18.75%) of follicular lymphoma, 3 (18.75%) of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma, and 10 (62.5%) of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. Primary cases presented with epiphora and nasolacrimal duct obstruction, while secondary cases predominantly manifested as dacryocystitis. All lacrimal sac neoplasms were locally responsive (without local recurrence) to chemotherapy, radiation, or both. CONCLUSIONS: Lacrimal sac lymphoma is uncommon but should be suspected among patients with known lymphoma who develop dacryocystitis. In this series, primary lacrimal sac lymphoma most often presented as a mass or nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma was the most commonly identified cause of secondary lacrimal sac lymphoma. Distinguishing primary from secondary lacrimal sac lymphomas is important, as the extent of disease and histopathologic subtypes differ, which may affect patient management.","['Neerukonda, Vamsee K', 'Stagner, Anna M', 'Wolkow, Natalie']","['Neerukonda VK', 'Stagner AM', 'Wolkow N']","['David G.

At present, more and more research results show that the pathogenesis of different tumors is very complicated, and the methods of clinical treatment are also diverse. This review analyzes and summarizes the role of fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) genes in different tumors and provides a reference value for research and drug treatment methods. METHOD: We conducted a comprehensive literature search using the database. According to the article's primary purpose, irrelevant articles were excluded from the research summary and included in the relevant articles. Finally, the relevant information of the article was summarized. RESULT: In this article, the relationship between malignant tumors and FTO is introduced by citing many documents. In addition, the inhibitors that act on FTO are listed. CONCLUSION: This article has shown that FTO protein is a demethylase that can regulate N6-methyladenosine (m6A) levels in mRNA and plays a crucial role in the progression and resistance of various tumors such as leukemia, breast cancer, and lung cancer.","['Wei, Hao', 'Li, Zhen', 'Liu, Fang', 'Wang, Yang', 'Ding, Shi', 'Chen, Ye', 'Liu, Ju']","['Wei H', 'Li Z', 'Liu F', 'Wang Y', 'Ding S', 'Chen Y', 'Liu J']","['College of Pharmacy of Liaoning University, Shenyang, Liaoning 10036.

METHODS: Our clinical-analytical and descriptive study enrolled 27 patients with different phases of CML, who were followed up and treated at the Institute of Oncology between 1995-2020. Venous blood samples were taken for LDH measurement, molecular screening and detection of T315I mutation of the ABL gene in order to investigate the biological significance of the increased LDH values and T315I mutation. CML patients underwent chemotherapy with alkylating agents, antimetabolites and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). RESULTS: The patient age ranged from 20 to 67 years (mean 51.3+/-2,14). The diagnosis of CML was established in the late chronic phase in 25 (92.6%) patients. The quantitative real-time PCR revealed p210 transcript of the BCR-ABL chimeric gene in all cases, with the range of 23.17-100% and median value of 74.73+/-3.21%. LDH at diagnosis ranged between 169-1609.4 U/L and was increased in 14 (63.6%) patients, especially in those with leukocytosis over 100x109/l. The complete cytogenetic and complete or major molecular responses were recorded under treatment with different generations of TKIs in 16 (59.3%) cases, including 3 cases with T315I mutation. Relapses occurred in 10 (71.4%) patients with initially increased LDH values and in 5 of 6 patients with T315I mutation. One (3.7%) patient with T315I mutation evolved into the acute phase disease, and achieved the complete hematological response after treatment with ponatinib, a 3rd generation TKI. The survival of patients from the disease onset till the last monitoring visit ranged between 21 and 234.8 months (median 93.97+/-4.52). CONCLUSIONS: The increased LDH values may indicate the activity at diagnosis and relapse of CML. In our study T315I mutation of the ABL gene and the increased values of LDH were associated with a higher rate of relapses and resistance to imatinib. Notwithstanding the treatment line and in relapses TKIs improve considerably the survival and ECOG-WHO score of CML patients.","['Musteata, Vasile']",['Musteata V'],"['State University of Medicine and Pharmacy ""N.

European LeukemiaNet (ELN) group has defined specific treatment milestones with an optimal outcome to be achieved in patients. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, we evaluated the impact of clinical and biological variables on achieving an optimal response at 6 and 12 months according to ELN recommendations. We included 106 patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with appropriate bone marrow aspirate and biopsy for immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The number of white blood cells (WBC), the percentage of peripheral blast, the values of Sokal and ELTS scores and the percentage of Ki-67+ cells in the bone marrow predicted a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 6 months, but only WBC and EUTOS score predicts CCyR at 12 months. We found that Sokal score below 0.775 was very sensitive to achieve of CCyR at 6 months (m) and that all patients with a value <0.550 achieved CCyR-6m. Patients with a low percentage of blast in the peripheral blood (</=1.5%) or in the bone marrow (</=5%) together with lower WBC (</=100x109/L) were likely to have significantly higher CCyR rates at 6 and 12 months respectively. Also, patients with a higher number of Ki67+ cells in the leukemic areas of the bone marrow had a significantly better outcome. Unfortunately, our investigation did not reveal that bone marrow fibrosis (MF grade), microvascular density, percentage of CD34+, CD61+ or PTCH1+ cells could have any effect on achievement of CCyR at 6 or 12 months. CONCLUSION: Our investigation has shown that only a few biological characteristics in patients with CML can predict the optimal treatment outcome after imatinib.","['Milosevic, Violeta', 'Jovanovic, Maja Perunicic', 'Bukumiric, Zoran', 'Djordjevic, Vesna', 'Jovanovic, Jelica', 'Fekete, Marija Dencic', 'Lekovic, Danijela', 'Bogdanovic, Andrija']","['Milosevic V', 'Jovanovic MP', 'Bukumiric Z', 'Djordjevic V', 'Jovanovic J', 'Fekete MD', 'Lekovic D', 'Bogdanovic A']","['1Clinic of Hematology, University Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,2021/07/17 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/07/16 07:02'],"['2021/07/16 07:02 [entrez]', '2021/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2021 May-Jun;26(3):1070-1079.,1070-1079,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Randomized controlled trials support the use of antifungal prophylaxis with antimold activity as an optimal strategy for risk reduction in this population, but studies outlining the practical application of evidence-based recommendations are lacking. PROCEDURE: We conducted a 15-year, single-institution retrospective review in a diverse cohort of children with hematologic malignancies treated with chemotherapy to determine the incidence of proven or probable IMI diagnosed between 2006 and 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify host and disease factors associated with IMI risk. We then compared the incidence and type of IMI and related factors before and after 2016 implementation of an evidence-based, risk-adapted antifungal prophylaxis algorithm that broadened coverage to include molds in patients at highest risk for IMI. RESULTS: We identified 61 cases of proven or probable IMI in 1456 patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies during the study period (4.2%). Implementation of an antifungal prophylaxis algorithm reduced the IMI incidence in this population from 4.8% to 2.9%. Both Hispanic ethnicity and cancer diagnosis prior to 2016 were associated with risk for IMI. CONCLUSION: An evidence-based, risk-adapted approach to antifungal prophylaxis for children with hematologic malignancies is an effective strategy to reduce incidence of IMI.","['Dutta, Ankhi', 'Ikwuezunma, Ashley', 'Castellanos, Maria I', 'Brackett, Julienne', 'Reddy, Kiranmye', 'Mahajan, Priya', 'Marshburn, Ann M', 'Kamdar, Kala', 'Paek, Hana', 'Palazzi, Debra L', 'Rabin, Karen R', 'Scheurer, Michael E', 'Gramatges, Maria M']","['Dutta A', 'Ikwuezunma A', 'Castellanos MI', 'Brackett J', 'Reddy K', 'Mahajan P', 'Marshburn AM', 'Kamdar K', 'Paek H', 'Palazzi DL', 'Rabin KR', 'Scheurer ME', 'Gramatges MM']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Section of Infectious Diseases, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA."", 'University of Texas Medical School, Rio Grande Valley, Edinburg, Texas, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology and Oncology, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology and Oncology, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology and Oncology, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology and Oncology, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hospital Medicine, UTHealth Science Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology and Oncology, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Section of Infectious Diseases, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology and Oncology, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology and Oncology, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology and Oncology, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.""]","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9258-452X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6710-5865', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0892-7727', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0947-104X']",['eng'],"[""Consortium Grant/St. Baldrick's Foundation"", 'Minority Medical Student Award Program./American Society of Hematology']",['Journal Article'],20210716,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['antifungal prophylaxis', 'invasive mold infection', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma']",2021/07/17 06:00,2021/07/17 06:00,['2021/07/16 07:00'],"['2021/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/17 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/16 07:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.29228 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Dec;68(12):e29228. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29228.

However, regulatory authorities of different regions often make different decisions on the approvals of the same new drugs. We would like to discuss the appropriateness of Japanese regulatory approach through a case study of quizartinib, a novel anti-leukemia drug developed in Japan. The pivotal clinical trial ""QuANTUM-R"" conducted in 19 countries showed a modest increase in median overall survival with quizartinib than the conventional chemotherapy. However, because several critical defects in this trial were pointed out by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), quizartinib has not been approved in the US and Europe to date. On the contrary, the regulatory authority of Japan gave a notice of approval to quizartinib as a ""standard of care"", and the country becomes the sole country that granted market authorization.

Acalabrutinib is a second-generation Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) that was developed after ibrutinib, the first-in-class BTKi. Ibrutinib is usually well tolerated and provides durable remissions; however, some patients experience toxicities from the off-target effects that lead to treatment discontinuation. A recent press release of the phase III ELEVATE-RR trial comparing acalabrutinib to ibrutinib in relapsed high-risk CLL reported noninferior progression-free survival and statistically significantly lower rates of atrial fibrillation; however, publication of this data is pending. There is currently 53 months of follow-up for patients receiving acalabrutinib compared with 8 years for those on ibrutinib.

The increase extra-medullary relapses (ER) in the era of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy suggests a potential correlation between ATRA therapy and ER, and several potential explanations have been proposed. The gold standard post-remission approach, particularly for patients in late relapse, has not yet been established. The benefit of a transplant approach has been questioned in this setting because continuing ATRA-arsenic trioxide (ATO) might be curative. Here we report on the case of an APL patient who relapsed 9 years after achieving her first molecular complete remission (mCR) and who showed an atypical isolated localization at nodal sites, including the into- and peri-parotid glands. Genomic PML/RARa breakpoint analysis detected the same bcr3 PML/RARa hybrid gene in DNA purified from bone marrow and lymph nodes, suggesting that the relapse was because of the reemergence of the initial clone. This case shows that APL, treated with ATRA and cytotoxic drugs, may still emerge in extra-medullary sites even after a very prolonged mCR and could be salvaged with an ATO-based protocol, not including a transplant approach.","['Molica, Matteo', 'Mazzone, Carla', 'Ottone, Tiziana', 'Niscola, Pasquale', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Fratoni, Stefano', 'Voso, Maria Teresa', 'de Fabritiis, Paolo']","['Molica M', 'Mazzone C', 'Ottone T', 'Niscola P', 'Abruzzese E', 'Fratoni S', 'Voso MT', 'de Fabritiis P']","['Haematology Unit, St. Eugenio Hospital, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematology Unit, St. Eugenio Hospital, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematology Unit, St. Eugenio Hospital, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematology Unit, St. Eugenio Hospital, Rome, Italy.', 'Surgical Pathology, Hematopathology Unit, St. Eugenio Hospital, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematology Unit, St. Eugenio Hospital, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.']",,['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210629,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC8276173,['NOTNLM'],"['acute promyelocitic leukemia', 'all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide combination treatment', 'bcr3 variant', 'transplant free approach', 'very late relapse']",2021/07/17 06:00,2021/07/17 06:01,['2021/07/16 06:40'],"['2021/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/16 06:40 [entrez]', '2021/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.699886 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Jun 29;11:699886. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.699886. eCollection 2021.,699886,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Molica, Mazzone, Ottone, Niscola, Abruzzese, Fratoni, Voso and', 'de Fabritiis.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These advances are the result of both pre-clinical and clinical research but much about DS is still poorly understood. In 2020, the NIH announced their plan to update their DS research plan and requested input from the scientific and advocacy community. OBJECTIVE: The National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS) and the LuMind IDSC Foundation worked together with scientific and medical experts to develop recommendations for the NIH research plan. METHODS: NDSS and LuMind IDSC assembled over 50 experts across multiple disciplines and organized them in eleven working groups focused on specific issues for people with DS. RESULTS: This review article summarizes the research gaps and recommendations that have the potential to improve the health and quality of life for people with DS within the next decade. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights many of the scientific gaps that exist in DS research. Based on these gaps, a multidisciplinary group of DS experts has made recommendations to advance DS research. This paper may also aid policymakers and the DS community to build a comprehensive national DS research strategy.","['Hendrix, James A', 'Amon, Angelika', 'Abbeduto, Leonard', 'Agiovlasitis, Stamatis', 'Alsaied, Tarek', 'Anderson, Heather A', 'Bain, Lisa J', 'Baumer, Nicole', 'Bhattacharyya, Anita', 'Bogunovic, Dusan', 'Botteron, Kelly N', 'Capone, George', 'Chandan, Priya', 'Chase, Isabelle', 'Chicoine, Brian', 'Cieuta-Walti, Cecile', 'DeRuisseau, Lara R', 'Durand, Sophie', 'Esbensen, Anna', 'Fortea, Juan', 'Gimenez, Sandra', 'Granholm, Ann-Charlotte', 'Hahn, Laura J', 'Head, Elizabeth', 'Hillerstrom, Hampus', 'Jacola, Lisa M', 'Janicki, Matthew P', 'Jasien, Joan M', 'Kamer, Angela R', 'Kent, Raymond D', 'Khor, Bernard', 'Lawrence, Jeanne B', 'Lemonnier, Catherine', 'Lewanda, Amy Feldman', 'Mobley, William', 'Moore, Paul E', 'Nelson, Linda Pollak', 'Oreskovic, Nicolas M', 'Osorio, Ricardo S', 'Patterson, David', 'Rasmussen, Sonja A', 'Reeves, Roger H', 'Roizen, Nancy', 'Santoro, Stephanie', 'Sherman, Stephanie L', 'Talib, Nasreen', 'Tapia, Ignacio E', 'Walsh, Kyle M', 'Warren, Steven F', 'White, A Nicole', 'Wong, Guang William', 'Yi, John S']","['Hendrix JA', 'Amon A', 'Abbeduto L', 'Agiovlasitis S', 'Alsaied T', 'Anderson HA', 'Bain LJ', 'Baumer N', 'Bhattacharyya A', 'Bogunovic D', 'Botteron KN', 'Capone G', 'Chandan P', 'Chase I', 'Chicoine B', 'Cieuta-Walti C', 'DeRuisseau LR', 'Durand S', 'Esbensen A', 'Fortea J', 'Gimenez S', 'Granholm AC', 'Hahn LJ', 'Head E', 'Hillerstrom H', 'Jacola LM', 'Janicki MP', 'Jasien JM', 'Kamer AR', 'Kent RD', 'Khor B', 'Lawrence JB', 'Lemonnier C', 'Lewanda AF', 'Mobley W', 'Moore PE', 'Nelson LP', 'Oreskovic NM', 'Osorio RS', 'Patterson D', 'Rasmussen SA', 'Reeves RH', 'Roizen N', 'Santoro S', 'Sherman SL', 'Talib N', 'Tapia IE', 'Walsh KM', 'Warren SF', 'White AN', 'Wong GW', 'Yi JS']","['LuMind IDSC Foundation, Burlington, MA, USA.', 'Deceased.

A CT scan of the chest revealed a lobulated opacity in the right upper lobe and antibiotic therapy was initiated for a potential bacterial pneumonia. However, a high suspicion for pulmonary TB remained given her nation of origin, immunosuppression, and imaging findings. Three sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smears with PCR testing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative, as were examinations for other potential fungal or bacterial etiologies of the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. While awaiting final TB culture results from BAL, her CMML underwent a transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Given the urgent need for initiation of chemotherapy, empiric treatment for TB was commenced while awaiting the final TB culture. Within 48-hours of initiating therapy for TB, the patient's fevers subsided. One week after discharge our team was notified of a positive M. tuberculosis culture from BAL. We suspect that our patient had a latent TB infection which reactivated due to her CMML. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high clinical suspicion for TB in high-risk patients, even in the case of initially negative laboratory examinations. Further, it demonstrates the importance of screening and treating latent TB in patients with leukemias.","['Pescatore, Jay', 'Cohen, Ashley', 'Moturi, Krishna', 'Hernandez-Acosta, Ruben']","['Pescatore J', 'Cohen A', 'Moturi K', 'Hernandez-Acosta R']","['Medicine, John H.

Method: The sample research group comprised of eighty adolescents in the 15-18 age group who have leukemia in pediatric hematology outpatient clinics. The sample comparison group comprised of eighty healthy adolescents in the 15-18 age group who were students from years 9, 10, 11, and 12(th) in a high school. Data was collected using a socio-demographic questionnaire and the California Healthy Kids Survey Resilience and Youth Development Module High School Questionnaire form. The Mann-Whitney U Test, Kruskal Wallis variance analysis, homogeneity test (Levene), and Ki kare Test were used to evaluate the data. Results: It was seen that there were no significant differences between the psychological resilience of adolescents with leukemia and healthy adolescents (p>0.05) Females were observed to have higher levels of psychological resilience than males in the research group. A lower level of psychological resilience was identified in adolescents from the research group who did not receive psychological support during the illness compared with those who received psychological support (p<0.05). The sub-factor point average of caring relationships and high expectations at school were higher in the research group, whereas the sub-factor point average of goals and aspirations were higher in the healthy adolescents (p<0.05). Conclusion: As a result, it was suggested that preventive mental health services should be planned and implemented to develop resilience levels and protective relationships provided by the school, friends, family and society should be supported.","['Pars, Hatice', 'Cavusoglu, Hicran']","['Pars H', 'Cavusoglu H']","['Hacettepe Universitesi Hemsirelik Fakultesi, Cocuk Sagligi ve Hastaliklari Hemsireligi Anabilim Dali, Ankara, Turkiye.', 'Hacettepe Universitesi Hemsirelik Fakultesi, Cocuk Sagligi ve Hastaliklari Hemsireligi Anabilim Dali, Ankara, Turkiye.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4795-244X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3808-4225']",['tur'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",20190601,Turkey,Florence Nightingale Hemsire Derg,Florence Nightingale hemsirelik dergisi,101777801,,,,PMC8127600,['NOTNLM'],"['Adolescence', 'leukemia', 'nursing', 'psychological resilience']",2019/06/01 00:00,2019/06/01 00:01,['2021/07/16 06:39'],"['2018/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/16 06:39 [entrez]', '2019/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.26650/FNJN18024 [doi]', 'fnjn-27-2-104 [pii]']",epublish,Florence Nightingale Hemsire Derg. 2019 Jun 1;27(2):104-118. doi: 10.26650/FNJN18024. eCollection 2019 Jun.,104-118,['Copyright (c) 2019 Florence Nightingale Journal of Nursing.'],,,,['Conflict of Interest: The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,Losemili Adolesanlarda Psikolojik Saglamligin Incelenmesi: Karsilastirmali Bir Calisma.,,,

ET is very rare in childhood. The annual incidence is approximately 1 per 10,000,000 in children less than 14 years, and about 60 times lower than adults. The genetic landscape and clonal features in childhood ET has not been well defined. There is no evidence-based guidance on the diagnosis of childhood ET. Methods: Medical records of 28 pediatric patients (age </= 14 years at diagnosis) with ET were reviewed and evaluated to characterize the different mutation profiles and to evaluate the treatment modalities used and the potential long-term outcome. Results: More than half of the patients were found to have positive history of parental consanguinity (57.1%) whereas positive family history was documented for more than a quarter of our patients (28.6%). Janus kinase 2 gene (JAK2) V617F mutation was positive in two of 26 patients (7.7%). Myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) exon 10 and calreticulin (CALR) mutations were tested in eight patients, which were negative for all of them. Treatment included low-dose aspirin (LDA) in seven patients (50%), combination of LDA with hydroxyurea in three patients (21.4%), hydroxyurea in two patients (14.3%), combination of platelets apheresis with LDA and anagrelide in one patient each (7.1%). During the treatment, two patients experienced stroke (7.1%), one patient developed Budd-Chiari syndrome (3.6%) and one patient developed azoospermia (3.6%). Conclusions: The incidence of ET in children is extremely low in Saudi Arabia. Most of the children with ET were asymptomatic, and thrombocytosis was often discovered incidentally. JAK2 V617F mutation has no known impact on the prognosis or on the outcome of the disease in the pediatric age group that is in contrast to the adult ET. Children less than 1 year are at high risk for complications particularly during acute precipitating infectious episode. The potential complications and clinical course of pediatric ET are unpredictable.","['Ameen, Muhammed', 'Siddiqui, Khawar', 'Khan, Saadiya', 'Saleh, Mahasen', 'Al-Jefri, Abdullah', 'Al-Musa, Abdulrahman']","['Ameen M', 'Siddiqui K', 'Khan S', 'Saleh M', 'Al-Jefri A', 'Al-Musa A']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210616,Canada,J Hematol,Journal of hematology,101635099,,,,PMC8256913,['NOTNLM'],"['Essential thrombocythemia', 'JAK2 mutation', 'Pediatric ET']",2021/07/17 06:00,2021/07/17 06:01,['2021/07/16 06:37'],"['2021/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/16 06:37 [entrez]', '2021/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.14740/jh822 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematol. 2021 Jun;10(3):106-113. doi: 10.14740/jh822.

It occurs endemically in Africa and sporadically in the rest of the world. Due to the high proliferation rate of this tumor, intensive multi-drug treatment is required; however, the risk of tumor syndrome lysis is high. Overexpression of the proto-oncogene proviral integration of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM-1) kinase is associated with the development of hematological abnormalities, including Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). PIM-1 primarily exerts anti-apoptotic activities through BAD phosphorylation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro efficiency of a PIM-1 kinase pharmacological inhibitor (PIM1-1) in BL. The impact of PIM1-1 was evaluated in terms of the viability and apoptosis status of the BL B cell lines, Raji and Daudi, compared with K562 leukemia cells, which highly express PIM-1. Cell viability and apoptotic status were assessed with western blotting, and PIM-1 gene expression was assessed with reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. After 48 h of treatment, PIM1-1 inhibited the Daudi, Raji and K562 cell viability with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration corresponding to 10, 20 and 30 microM PIM1-1, respectively. A significant decrease of ERK phosphorylation was detected in PIM1-1-treated Daudi cells, confirming the antiproliferative effect. The addition of 10 microM PIM1-1 significantly decreased the PIM-1 protein and gene expression in Daudi cells. An inhibition of the pro-apoptotic BAD phosphorylation was observed in the Daudi cells treated with 0.1-1 microM PIM1-1 and 10 microM PIM1-1 decreased BAD phosphorylation in the Raji cells. The apoptotic status of both PIM1-1-treated cells lines were confirmed with the detection of cleaved capase-3. However, no change in cell viability and PIM-1 protein expression was observed in the 10 microM PIM1-1-treated K562 cells. In conclusion, the findings indicated that the PIM1-1 pharmacological inhibitor may have therapeutic potential in BL, but with lower efficiency in leukemia.","['Alsubaie, Mona', 'Matou-Nasri, Sabine', 'Aljedai, Abdullah', 'Alaskar, Ahmed', 'Al-Eidi, Hamad', 'Albabtain, Sarah A', 'Aldilaijan, Khawlah E', 'Alsayegh, Manal', 'Alabdulkareem, Ibrahim B']","['Alsubaie M', 'Matou-Nasri S', 'Aljedai A', 'Alaskar A', 'Al-Eidi H', 'Albabtain SA', 'Aldilaijan KE', 'Alsayegh M', 'Alabdulkareem IB']","['Cell and Gene Therapy Group, Medical Genomics Research Department, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Ministry of National Guard-Health Affairs, Riyadh 11481, Saudi Arabia.', 'Hematology and Serology Unit, Department of Laboratory Medicine Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, Al-Kharj, Riyadh 11942, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh 12372, Saudi Arabia.', 'Cell and Gene Therapy Group, Medical Genomics Research Department, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Ministry of National Guard-Health Affairs, Riyadh 11481, Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh 11481, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh 12372, Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh 11481, Saudi Arabia.', 'Division of Adult Hematology and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Oncology, King Abdullah Medical City, Ministry of National Guard-Health Affairs, Riyadh 14611, Saudi Arabia.', 'King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Ministry of National Guard-Health Affairs, Riyadh 11426, Saudi Arabia.', 'Cell and Gene Therapy Group, Medical Genomics Research Department, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Ministry of National Guard-Health Affairs, Riyadh 11481, Saudi Arabia.', 'Research Department, Health Sciences Research Center, Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh 11564, Saudi Arabia.', 'Research Department, Health Sciences Research Center, Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh 11564, Saudi Arabia.', 'Cell and Gene Therapy Group, Medical Genomics Research Department, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Ministry of National Guard-Health Affairs, Riyadh 11481, Saudi Arabia.', 'Cell and Gene Therapy Group, Medical Genomics Research Department, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Ministry of National Guard-Health Affairs, Riyadh 11481, Saudi Arabia.', 'Research Department, Health Sciences Research Center, Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh 11564, Saudi Arabia.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210629,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,,PMC8258613,['NOTNLM'],"[""Burkitt's lymphoma"", 'Daudi cells', 'Raji cells', 'apoptosis', 'proviral integration of the Moloney murine leukemia virus kinase', 'proviral integration of the Moloney murine leukemia virus pharmacological', 'inhibitor']",2021/07/17 06:00,2021/07/17 06:01,['2021/07/16 06:37'],"['2020/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/16 06:37 [entrez]', '2021/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2021.12883 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-12883 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2021 Aug;22(2):622. doi: 10.3892/ol.2021.12883.

Overexpression of Pim1 has been observed in many cancer types and is associated with the poor prognosis of breast cancer. However, it remains unclear whether Pim1 kinase is a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer patients. In this study, we found that Pim1 expression was strongly associated with HER2 expression and that HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells were more sensitive to Pim1 inhibitor-induced inhibitions of cell viability and metastatic ability. Mechanistically, Pim1 inhibitor suppressed the expression of HER2 at least in part through transcriptional level. More importantly, Pim1 inhibitor overcame the resistance of breast cancer cells to HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib. In summary, downregulation of HER2 by targeting Pim1 may be a promising and effective therapeutic approach not only for anti-cancer growth but also for circumventing lapatinib resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.","['Wang, Bo-Wei', 'Huang, Chih-Hao', 'Liu, Liang-Chih', 'Cheng, Fang-Ju', 'Wei, Ya-Ling', 'Lin, Yueh-Ming', 'Wang, Yu-Fei', 'Wei, Ching-Ting', 'Chen, Yeh', 'Chen, Yun-Ju', 'Huang, Wei-Chien']","['Wang BW', 'Huang CH', 'Liu LC', 'Cheng FJ', 'Wei YL', 'Lin YM', 'Wang YF', 'Wei CT', 'Chen Y', 'Chen YJ', 'Huang WC']","['Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Center for Molecular Medicine and Research Center for Cancer Biology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Breast Surgery, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Breast Surgery, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Center for Molecular Medicine and Research Center for Cancer Biology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Center for Molecular Medicine and Research Center for Cancer Biology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Colorectal Surgery, Department of Surgery, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Center for Molecular Medicine and Research Center for Cancer Biology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine for International Students, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine for International Students, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, E-Da Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Center for Molecular Medicine and Research Center for Cancer Biology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Drug Development Center, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'The Ph.D. Program for Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, China Medical University and Academia Sinica, Taichung, Taiwan.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210629,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC8276059,['NOTNLM'],"['HER2', 'PIM1', 'breast cancer', 'drug resistance', 'lapatinib']",2021/07/17 06:00,2021/07/17 06:01,['2021/07/16 06:36'],"['2020/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/16 06:36 [entrez]', '2021/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2021.614673 [doi]', '614673 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2021 Jun 29;12:614673. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2021.614673. eCollection 2021.,614673,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Wang, Huang, Liu, Cheng, Wei, Lin, Wang, Wei, Chen, Chen and', 'Huang.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nelarabine combined with chemotherapy, in COG AALL0434 study, showed 4-year disease-free survival of 54.8% in patients with primary refractory T ALL. An allogeneic BMT in such patients may further improve outcome. In this report, three patients with primary refractory T cell ALL including a case of ETP-ALL and near ETP-ALL were treated with Nelarabine combined with COG based regime and thereafter an allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

We therefore retrospectively analyzed our data of AML and MDS patients who received MAC and RIC allo-HSCT at our center and compared the long term outcome of the two conditioning regimens. One hundred twenty six consecutive patients were evaluated, 32 (25.4%) underwent MAC allo-HSCT and 94 (74.6%) underwent RIC allo-HSCT. The most common MAC regimen used was busulfan plus cyclophosphamide and the most common RIC regimen used was fludarabine plus melphalan.

However, there is a paucity of data on haploidentical HSCT from India. The report is an analysis of data of haploidentical HSCT performed at our center. Analysis of patients with acute leukemia or chronic myeloid leukemia who underwent haploidentical HSCT during 2014-2019 was performed. The graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was post-transplant Cyclophosphamide with Mycophenolate-mofetil and Cyclosporine. All patients were transfused peripheral blood stem cells from donors. Overall survival (OS) was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Twenty-one patients underwent haploidentical HSCT. Fourteen-patients were males. The median age of patients was 15 years. Fludarabine with total body irradiation was the most common conditioning regimen (n = 15, 71.4%). The median duration for neutrophil and platelet engraftment was 14 days. Cumulative incidence of acute and chronic GVHD was 19%, and 38% respectively. The median follow-up was 26 months and the two-year OS was 38%. Twelve (57%) patients died during the study period, 8 patients (38%) died from transplant-related mortality (TRM), and 4 from disease relapse. Sepsis was the cause of death in six of the eight TRM.

The percent of LSCs at baseline in favorable risk group (mean = 13.06%) was significantly less than the adverse (mean = 34.8%, p = 0.027) and the intermediate risk group (mean = 53.2%, p = 0.001). On further analysis, 12 patients attaining IR in intermediate risk group had significantly less LSCs than 15 in non-IR group (mean = 21.18%; range 3-85.6% vs mean = 73.85%; range 12.1-97.9%, p = 0.0002). Of all 47 patients, the proportion of LSCs at baseline was significantly less in those achieving IR (p = 0.024) and correlated with time to response (TTR) (rs = 0.432). Thus to conclude, the proportion of CD34 (+) CD38 (- )CD123( +) LSCs at diagnosis is less in the favorable than the intermediate and adverse risk groups and is an emerging novel marker for predicting remission in the prognostically diverse intermediate risk group.","['Mishra, Priyanka', 'Tyagi, Seema', 'Sharma, Rahul', 'Halder, Rohan', 'Pati, Hara P', 'Saxena, Renu', 'Mahapatra, Manoranjan']","['Mishra P', 'Tyagi S', 'Sharma R', 'Halder R', 'Pati HP', 'Saxena R', 'Mahapatra M']","['Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India 110049.grid.413618.90000 0004 1767 6103', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India 110049.grid.413618.90000 0004 1767 6103', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India 110049.grid.413618.90000 0004 1767 6103', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India 110049.grid.413618.90000 0004 1767 6103', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India 110049.grid.413618.90000 0004 1767 6103', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India 110049.grid.413618.90000 0004 1767 6103', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India 110049.grid.413618.90000 0004 1767 6103']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210103,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,PMC8239121,['NOTNLM'],"['Aml', 'Induction remission', 'Leukemia stem cells', 'Prognosis', 'Relapse']",2021/07/17 06:00,2021/07/17 06:01,['2021/07/16 06:33'],"['2020/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/07/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/07/16 06:33 [entrez]', '2021/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-020-01383-9 [doi]', '1383 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2021 Jul;37(3):391-397. doi: 10.1007/s12288-020-01383-9.

This study evaluated the utility of prephase response and day 15 bone marrow when a minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment was available. A file review of children aged </= 15 years diagnosed with precursor-B ALL from 2014 to 2019 was performed. The protocol used for risk stratification and treatment was based on a UKALL-2003 backbone. All patients received one week of prephase therapy comprised of intravenous dexamethasone in the first 48 h followed by oral prednisolone. The median age of the 255 patients in the study was 5 years. Following the prephase, the peripheral blood absolute blast count was 0 and >/= 1000/microL blasts in 141 (56%) and 29 (11%), respectively. Ten of 199 (5%) patients with an evaluable day 15 bone marrow had M3 status. At the end of induction, 30 (12%), 127 (50%) and 98 (38%) patients belonged to the standard-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk (HR) groups, respectively. An M3 day15 bone marrow was the sole reason for escalation in three (3%) of the patients in the HR group. A lack of complete clearance of peripheral blood blasts post-prephase [HR: 2.45 (1.04-5.75), p = 0.040] and a positive MRD [HR: 3.00 (1.28-7.02), p = 0.011] independently predicted risk of relapse. Complete blast clearance is superior to the traditional cut-off of 1000/microL in predicting relapse. The role of a day 15 bone marrow morphology is diminished when an end of induction MRD is available.","['Cherian, Thomas', 'John, Rikki', 'Joseph, Leenu Lizbeth', 'Srinivasan, Hema N', 'Boddu, Deepthi', 'Geevar, Tulasi', 'Mathew, Leni Grace', 'Totadri, Sidharth']","['Cherian T', 'John R', 'Joseph LL', 'Srinivasan HN', 'Boddu D', 'Geevar T', 'Mathew LG', 'Totadri S']","['Paediatric Haematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Paediatrics, Christian Medical College and Hospital, Vellore, India.grid.11586.3b0000 0004 1767 8969', 'Paediatric Haematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Paediatrics, Christian Medical College and Hospital, Vellore, India.grid.11586.3b0000 0004 1767 8969', 'Paediatric Haematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Paediatrics, Christian Medical College and Hospital, Vellore, India.grid.11586.3b0000 0004 1767 8969', 'Paediatric Haematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Paediatrics, Christian Medical College and Hospital, Vellore, India.grid.11586.3b0000 0004 1767 8969', 'Paediatric Haematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Paediatrics, Christian Medical College and Hospital, Vellore, India.grid.11586.3b0000 0004 1767 8969', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Immunohaematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.grid.11586.3b0000 0004 1767 8969', 'Paediatric Haematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Paediatrics, Christian Medical College and Hospital, Vellore, India.grid.11586.3b0000 0004 1767 8969', 'Paediatric Haematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Paediatrics, Christian Medical College and Hospital, Vellore, India.grid.11586.3b0000 0004 1767 8969']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0076-994X'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200913,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,PMC8239084,['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood leukemia', 'Early bone marrow', 'Poor prednisolone response', 'Prognostic marker', 'Rapid early response']",2021/07/17 06:00,2021/07/17 06:01,['2021/07/16 06:33'],"['2020/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/07/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/07/16 06:33 [entrez]', '2021/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-020-01354-0 [doi]', '1354 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2021 Jul;37(3):366-371. doi: 10.1007/s12288-020-01354-0.

Unfortunately, resistance occurs and has been linked to expression of the enzyme asparagine synthetase (ASNS), which generates asparagine from intracellular sources. Although TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in cancer overall, TP53 mutations are rare in ALL. However, TP53 mutation is associated with poor therapy response and occurs at higher frequency in relapsed ALL. The mutant p53-reactivating compound APR-246 (Eprenetapopt/PRIMA-1Met) is currently being tested in phase II and III clinical trials in several hematological malignancies with mutant TP53. Here we present CEllular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) data indicating that ASNS is a direct or indirect target of APR-246 via the active product methylene quinuclidinone (MQ). Furthermore, combination treatment with asparaginase and APR-246 resulted in synergistic growth suppression in ALL cell lines. Our results thus suggest a potential novel treatment strategy for ALL.","['Ceder, Sophia', 'Eriksson, Sofi E', 'Liang, Ying Yu', 'Cheteh, Emarndeena H', 'Zhang, Si Min', 'Fujihara, Kenji M', 'Bianchi, Julie', 'Bykov, Vladimir J N', 'Abrahmsen, Lars', 'Clemons, Nicholas J', 'Nordlund, Par', 'Rudd, Sean G', 'Wiman, Klas G']","['Ceder S', 'Eriksson SE', 'Liang YY', 'Cheteh EH', 'Zhang SM', 'Fujihara KM', 'Bianchi J', 'Bykov VJN', 'Abrahmsen L', 'Clemons NJ', 'Nordlund P', 'Rudd SG', 'Wiman KG']","['Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, BioClinicum J6, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, BioClinicum J6, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, BioClinicum J6, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, A*STAR, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, BioClinicum J6, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Science For Life Laboratory, Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden.', 'Cancer Research Division, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, BioClinicum J6, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, BioClinicum J6, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Aprea Therapeutics AB, Solna, Sweden.', 'Cancer Research Division, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, BioClinicum J6, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, A*STAR, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Science For Life Laboratory, Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, BioClinicum J6, Stockholm, Sweden.

We retrieved official death certification data and population figures from the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization databases. We analysed mortality from all neoplasms combined and for selected cancer sites. We estimated numbers of deaths and age-standardized mortality rates for the year 2021 using a logarithmic Poisson count data joinpoint model. Total cancer mortality is predicted to decline in all countries considered for both sexes, with the exception of Argentinian women. The lowest total mortality rates were predicted in Mexico (65.4/100 000 men and 62.3 in women), the highest ones were in Cuba (133.3/100 000 men and 91.0 in women). Stomach cancer rates have been decreasing since 1970 in all countries; colorectal cancer started to decline over recent calendar periods. Rates for this cancer were unfavourable in the youngest age group. Lung cancer trends declined in males and remained comparatively low in all countries except Cuba. In Cuba, lung cancer rates in women overtook those for breast. Mortality from cancers of the breast, (cervix) uterus, ovary, prostate and bladder, as well as leukemia mostly showed favourable trends.

This study aims to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the care of patients with cancer by comparing a period of 4 months after the outbreak began (2 March 2020) with an equal period from 2019. METHODS: Cancer cases of the esophagus, stomach, colon and rectum, pancreas, lung, skin-melanoma, breast, cervix, prostate, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia from the Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto, and diagnosed between 2 March and 1 July 2019 (before COVID-19) and 2020 (after COVID-19) were identified. Those with the first treatment outside the Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto were excluded. Sociodemographic, clinical and treatment characteristics were obtained from the cancer registry database and clinical files. RESULTS: The absolute number of new cancer cases decreased nearly 40% after the COVID-19 pandemic (from 1430 to 866). The largest decreases were observed for cervical (-74.3%) and prostate (-71.7%) cancers. Cases were more often diagnosed at more advanced stages in 2020 (P = 0.001), and the proportion of patients not starting any treatment until 1 July was just under 20% in 2019 and nearly 40% in 2020. The median times from symptoms onset, first medical exam and first appointment to diagnosis, and from diagnosis to first appointment, multidisciplinary tumor board meeting and first treatment were shorter after COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: There was a notable overall decrease in cancer diagnoses after COVID-19, with changes in the characteristics of incident cases.","['Morais, Samantha', 'Antunes, Luis', 'Rodrigues, Jessica', 'Fontes, Filipa', 'Bento, Maria Jose', 'Lunet, Nuno']","['Morais S', 'Antunes L', 'Rodrigues J', 'Fontes F', 'Bento MJ', 'Lunet N']","['EPIUnit, Instituto de Saude Publica, Universidade do Porto, Rua das Taipas n masculine135', 'Departamento de Ciencias da Saude Publica e Forenses e Educacao Medica, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Porto, Alameda Professor Hernani Monteiro', 'Grupo de Epidemiologia do Cancro, Centro de Investigacao do Instituto Portugues de Oncologia do Porto, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia do Porto, Rua Dr. Antonio Bernardino de Almeida', 'Grupo de Epidemiologia do Cancro, Centro de Investigacao do Instituto Portugues de Oncologia do Porto, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia do Porto, Rua Dr. Antonio Bernardino de Almeida', 'EPIUnit, Instituto de Saude Publica, Universidade do Porto, Rua das Taipas n masculine135', 'Departamento de Ciencias da Saude Publica e Forenses e Educacao Medica, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Porto, Alameda Professor Hernani Monteiro', 'Servico de Imagem, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia do Porto, Rua Dr. Antonio Bernardino de Almeida', 'Grupo de Epidemiologia do Cancro, Centro de Investigacao do Instituto Portugues de Oncologia do Porto, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia do Porto, Rua Dr. Antonio Bernardino de Almeida', 'Departamento de Estudos de Populacoes, Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas Abel Salazar da Universidade do Porto, Rua Jorge de Viterbo Ferreira 228, Porto, Portugal', 'EPIUnit, Instituto de Saude Publica, Universidade do Porto, Rua das Taipas n masculine135', 'Departamento de Ciencias da Saude Publica e Forenses e Educacao Medica, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Porto, Alameda Professor Hernani Monteiro']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210708,England,Eur J Cancer Prev,European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP),9300837,,IM,,,,,2021/07/17 06:00,2021/07/17 06:00,['2021/07/16 05:54'],"['2021/07/16 05:54 [entrez]', '2021/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000686 [doi]', '00008469-900000000-99030 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Eur J Cancer Prev. 2021 Jul 8. pii: 00008469-900000000-99030. doi: 10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000686.,,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, little is known about the actual outcomes and adverse events(AEs)associated with the use of ibrutinib in Japanese patients. OBJECTIVE: The outcomes and AEs of patients treated with ibrutinib in a real-world setting were investigated. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of all patients with CLL/SLL who were treated with ibrutinib at a single institution was conducted. RESULT: In total, 10 patients, including 5 treatment-naive patients(50%), were enrolled. The median follow-up period was 9.8 months(range, 0.2-21.6 months), and the estimated overall response rate (ORR: complete remission plus partial remission)was 60%. The median overall survival and progression-free survival outcomes were not reached. During the follow-up period, 4 patients(40%)had at least one AE and 1 patient(10%)had at least one grade>/=3 AE. Ibrutinib was discontinued in 4 patients(40%)because of AEs in 2 patients(20%), the progression of CLL in 1 patient(10%), and financial reasons in 1 patient(10%).

Interestingly, recurrent inactivating mutations of SETD2 and aberrant H3K36me3 are increasingly reported to be involved in hematopoietic malignancies. Benzene (BZ) is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant and carcinogen that causes leukemia. The leukemogenic properties of BZ depend on its biotransformation in the bone marrow into oxidative metabolites, in particular 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ). This hematotoxic metabolite can form DNA and protein adducts that result in the damage and the alteration of cellular processes. Recent studies suggest that BZ-dependent leukemogenesis could depend on epigenetic perturbations, notably aberrant histone methylation. We investigated whether H3K36 trimethylation by SETD2 could be impacted by BZ and its hematotoxic metabolites. Herein, we show that BQ, the major leukemogenic metabolite of BZ, inhibits irreversibly the human histone methyltransferase SETD2, resulting in decreased H3K36me3. Our mechanistic studies further indicate that the BQ-dependent inactivation of SETD2 is due to covalent binding of BQ to reactive Zn-finger cysteines within the catalytic domain of the enzyme. The formation of these quinoprotein adducts results in loss of enzyme activity and protein crosslinks/oligomers. Experiments conducted in hematopoietic cells confirm that exposure to BQ results in the formation of SETD2 crosslinks/oligomers and concomitant loss of H3K36me3 in cells. Taken together, our data indicate that BQ, a major hematotoxic metabolite of BZ, could contribute to BZ-dependent leukemogenesis by perturbing the functions of SETD2, a histone lysine methyltransferase of hematopoietic relevance. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Benzoquinone is a major leukemogenic metabolite of benzene. Dysregulation of histone methyltransferase is involved in hematopoietic malignancies. This study found that benzoquinone irreversibly impairs SET domain containing 2, a histone H3K36 methyltransferase that plays a key role in hematopoiesis. Benzoquinone forms covalent adducts on Zn-finger cysteines within the catalytic site, leading to loss of activity, protein crosslinks/oligomers, and concomitant decrease of H3K36me3 histone mark. These data provide evidence that a leukemogenic metabolite of benzene can impair a key epigenetic enzyme.","['Berthelet, Jeremy', 'Michail, Christina', 'Bui, Linh-Chi', 'Le Coadou, Louise', 'Sirri, Valentina', 'Wang, Li', 'Dulphy, Nicolas', 'Dupret, Jean-Marie', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Guidez, Fabien', 'Rodrigues-Lima, Fernando']","['Berthelet J', 'Michail C', 'Bui LC', 'Le Coadou L', 'Sirri V', 'Wang L', 'Dulphy N', 'Dupret JM', 'Chomienne C', 'Guidez F', 'Rodrigues-Lima F']","['Universite de Paris, Unite de Biologie Fonctionnelle et Adaptative (BFA), UMR 8251, CNRS, Paris, France (J.B., C.M., L.-C.B., L.L.C., V.S., J.-M.D., F.R.-L.);

We previously described two types of endogenous human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-II restricted antigens depending on their behavior towards HLA-DM. While DM-resistant antigens are presented in the presence of HLA-DM, DM-sensitive antigens rely on the expression of HLA-DO-the natural inhibitor of HLA-DM. Since expression of HLA-DO is not upregulated by inflammatory cytokines, DM-sensitive antigens cannot be presented on non-hematopoietic tissues even under inflammatory conditions. Therefore, usage of CD4+ T cells directed against DM-sensitive antigens might allow induction of graft-versus-leukemia effect without GvHD. As DM-sensitivity is likely linked to low affinity peptides, it remains elusive whether DM-sensitive antigens are inferior in their immunogenicity. METHODS: We created an in vivo system using a DM-sensitive and a DM-resistant variant of the same antigen. First, we generated murine cell lines overexpressing either H2-M or H2-O (murine HLA-DM and HLA-DO) to assign the two model antigens ovalbumin (OVA) and DBY to their category. Further, we introduced mutations within the two T-cell epitopes and tested the effect on DM-sensitivity or DM-resistance. Furthermore, we vaccinated C57BL/6 mice with either variant of the epitope and measured expansion and reactivity of OVA-specific and DBY-specific CD4+ T cells. RESULTS: By testing T-cell recognition of OVA and DBY on a murine B-cell line overexpressing H2-M and H2-O, respectively, we showed that OVA leads to a stronger T-cell activation in the presence of H2-O demonstrating its DM-sensitivity. In contrast, the DBY epitope does not rely on H2-O for T-cell activation indicating DM-resistance. By introducing mutations within the T-cell epitopes we could generate one further DM-sensitive variant of OVA and two DM-resistant counterparts. Likewise, we designed DM-resistant and DM-sensitive variants of DBY. On vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with either epitope variant we measured comparable expansion and reactivity of OVA-specific and DBY-specific T-cells both in vivo and ex vivo. By generating T-cell lines and clones of healthy human donors we showed that DM-sensitive antigens are targeted by the natural T-cell repertoire. CONCLUSION: We successfully generated DM-sensitive and DM-resistant variants for two model antigens. Thereby, we demonstrated that DM-sensitive antigens are not inferior to their DM-resistant counterpart and are therefore interesting tools for immunotherapy after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","['Bernhardt, Anna Luise', 'Zeun, Julia', 'Marecek, Miriam', 'Reimann, Hannah', 'Kretschmann, Sascha', 'Bausenwein, Judith', 'van der Meijden, Edith D', 'Karg, Margarete M', 'Haug, Tabea', 'Meintker, Lisa', 'Lutzny-Geier, Gloria', 'Mackensen, Andreas', 'Kremer, Anita N']","['Bernhardt AL', 'Zeun J', 'Marecek M', 'Reimann H', 'Kretschmann S', 'Bausenwein J', 'van der Meijden ED', 'Karg MM', 'Haug T', 'Meintker L', 'Lutzny-Geier G', 'Mackensen A', 'Kremer AN']","['Department of Internal Medicine 5 - Hematology and Internal Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Bayern, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 - Hematology and Internal Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Bayern, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 - Hematology and Internal Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Bayern, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 - Hematology and Internal Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Bayern, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 - Hematology and Internal Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Bayern, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 - Hematology and Internal Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Bayern, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 - Hematology and Internal Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Bayern, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 - Hematology and Internal Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Bayern, Germany.', 'Schepens Eye Research Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 - Hematology and Internal Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Bayern, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 - Hematology and Internal Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Bayern, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 - Hematology and Internal Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Bayern, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 - Hematology and Internal Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Bayern, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5 - Hematology and Internal Oncology, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Bayern, Germany anita.kremer@uk-erlangen.de.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9309-8972'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '148770-78-9 (HIVEP2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation/*immunology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",PMC8286791,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD4-positive T-lymphocytes', '*adoptive', '*antigen presentation', '*antigens', '*immunotherapy']",2021/07/17 06:00,2022/01/12 06:00,['2021/07/16 05:51'],"['2021/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/16 05:51 [entrez]', '2021/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['jitc-2021-002401 [pii]', '10.1136/jitc-2021-002401 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2021 Jul;9(7). pii: jitc-2021-002401. doi: 10.1136/jitc-2021-002401.,,"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

METHODS: Retrospective study were analysis among pediatric ALL patients from the TARGET dataset. RESULT: Totally, 1668 eligible pediatric patients were enrolled in this study. Of them, 993 are male and 675 are female with a median age of 7.6 years old. The median follow-up for those patients was 7.7 years (range 0.1-15.7 years). The probability of 15-year EFS and OS were reported to be 67.5 +/- 3.1% and 78.3 +/- 2.5%, respectively. BCR/ABL1 fusion gene affected the early treatment response and the survival of childhood ALL. Moreover, those patients with ETV6/RUNX1 fusion gene were also significantly associated with better EFS (HR = 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.8, P = 0.003) and OS (HR = 0.3, 95%CI 0.2-0.5, P < 0.001) compared to patients with no ETV6/RUNX1. On the contrary, BM NR on Day+ 29 showed a significant decrease in EFS (HR = 3.1, 95%CI 2.1-4.5, P < 0.001) and OS (HR = 1.7, 95%CI 1.1-2.8, P = 0.026). Multivariate analysis showed that DI was significantly associated with better EFS and OS. The threshold effect of DI on poor outcome was significant after adjusting for potential confounders. The adjusted regression coefficient (Log RR) was 0.7 (95%CI 0.1-3.2, P = 0.597) for DI < 1.1 while 8.8 (95%CI 1.4-56.0, P = 0.021) for DI >/= 1.2 and 0.0 (95%CI 0.0-0.8, P = 0.041) for 1.1 </= DI < 1.2. Generalized additive models revealed that the lowest rates of the adverse outcomes estimated to occur among DI between 1.1 and 1.2. CONCLUSION: For those childhood ALL treated on COG protocols between 2000 and 2015, ETV6/RUNX1 and BM NR were closely related to the prognosis. Moreover, the DI between 1.1 and 1.2 can serve as a significant cut-point discriminating the risk group, which indicated a favourable prognostic factor.","['Qiu, Kun-Yin', 'Liao, Xiong-Yu', 'He, Zhan-Wen', 'Wu, Ruo-Hao', 'Li, Yang', 'Xu, Lu-Hong', 'Zhou, Dun-Hua', 'Fang, Jian-Pei']","['Qiu KY', 'Liao XY', 'He ZW', 'Wu RH', 'Li Y', 'Xu LH', 'Zhou DH', 'Fang JP']","[""Department of Paediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Paediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Paediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Paediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Paediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Paediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China."", ""Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Paediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China. zhoudunh@mail.sysu.edu.cn."", ""Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China. zhoudunh@mail.sysu.edu.cn."", ""Department of Paediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China. fangjpei@mail.sysu.edu.cn."", ""Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China. fangjpei@mail.sysu.edu.cn.""]",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210715,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Child', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC8283927,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'Children', 'DNA index', 'chemotherapy', 'value']",2021/07/17 06:00,2021/10/16 06:00,['2021/07/16 05:35'],"['2021/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/16 05:35 [entrez]', '2021/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-021-08545-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-021-08545-6 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2021 Jul 15;21(1):813. doi: 10.1186/s12885-021-08545-6.,813,['(c) 2021.

Alternatively activated or M2-type tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) are recruited under chemotherapy and are highly implicated in the chemoresistance development, but underlying molecular mechanism for TAM activation is largely unknown. Here, we present that tumor-derived Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) induced by chemo drugs represses the chemo sensitivity of gastric tumor cells in a TAM-dependent manner. Mechanistically, cisplatin-induced HIF1alpha signaling activation directly drive the transcription of LIF, which promotes the resistance of gastric tumors to chemo drug. Further study revealed that tumor cell-derived LIF stimulates macrophages into tumor-supporting M2-type phenotype via activating STAT3 signaling pathway. Therapeutically, blocking LIF efficiently elevates chemo sensitivity of tumor cells and further represses the growth rates of tumors under chemotherapy. Therefore, our study reveals a novel insight in understanding the cross talking between tumor cells and immune cells and provides new therapeutic targets for gastric cancer.","['Yu, Shan', 'Li, Qian', 'Wang, Yan', 'Cui, Yuehong', 'Yu, Yiyi', 'Li, Wei', 'Liu, Fenglin', 'Liu, Tianshu']","['Yu S', 'Li Q', 'Wang Y', 'Cui Y', 'Yu Y', 'Li W', 'Liu F', 'Liu T']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.

Here, we describe that a moniliformin derivative (IUPAC name: 3-(naphthalen-2-ylsulfanyl)-4-{[(2Z)-1,3,3-trimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-2-ylide ne]methyl}cyclobut-3-ene-1,2-dione; code: MCC1381) bypasses P-gp-mediated MDR. Using transcriptomics, we identified a large number of genes significantly regulated in response to MCC1381, which affected the cell cycle and disturbed cellular death and survival. The potential targets of MCC1381 might be histone deacetylases (HDACs) as predicted by SwissTargetPrediction. In silico studies confirmed that MCC1381 presented comparable affinity with HDAC1, 2, 3, 6, 8 and 11. Besides, the inhibition activity of HDACs was dose-dependently inhibited by MCC1381. Particularly, a strong binding affinity was observed between MCC1381 and HDAC6 by microscale thermophoresis analysis. MCC1381 decreased the expression of HDAC6, inversely correlated with the increase of acetylated HDAC6 substrates, acetylation p53 and alpha-tubulin. Furthermore, MCC1381 arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase, induced the generation of reactive oxygen species and collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential. MCC1381 exhibited in vivo anti-cancer activity in xenografted zebrafish. Collectively, MCC1381 extended cytotoxicity towards P-gp-resistant leukemia cancer cells and may act as a pan-HDACs inhibitor, indicating that MCC1381 is a novel candidate for cancer therapy.","['Lu, Xiaohua', 'Yan, Ge', 'Dawood, Mona', 'Klauck, Sabine M', 'Sugimoto, Yoshikazu', 'Klinger, Anette', 'Fleischer, Edmond', 'Shan, Letian', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Lu X', 'Yan G', 'Dawood M', 'Klauck SM', 'Sugimoto Y', 'Klinger A', 'Fleischer E', 'Shan L', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany; Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Al-Neelain University, Khartoum, Sudan.', 'Division of Cancer Genome Research, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Chemotherapy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'MicroCombiChem GmbH, 65203 Wiesbaden, Germany.', 'MicroCombiChem GmbH, 65203 Wiesbaden, Germany.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany.

RECENT FINDINGS: HCL is a chronic B-cell malignancy with multiple treatment options. In recent years, many novel drugs have been assessed for HCL treatment with promising results. The investigated nonchemotherapy options include moxetumomab pasudotox, which targets CD22; vemurafenib or dabrafenib, which target the BRAFV600E protein; trametinib, which targets mitogen-activated protein kinase enzyme; and ibrutinib, which targets Bruton tyrosine kinase. SUMMARY: Purine analogs significantly improve survival in patients with HCL. However, patients often relapse, require multiple treatments, and may become refractory. The introduction of novel agents has expanded the spectrum of therapy possibilities in those patients. In the coming years, they will assist standard therapy for patients with HCL who may currently have suboptimal results.","['Pula, Anna', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Pula A', 'Robak T']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Hairy Cell/drug therapy', 'Recurrence']",,,,2021/07/16 06:00,2022/01/14 06:00,['2021/07/15 17:30'],"['2021/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/15 17:30 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CCO.0000000000000771 [doi]', '00001622-900000000-98996 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2021 Sep 1;33(5):412-419. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0000000000000771.,412-419,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

An assessment by peripheral quantitative computed tomography.,10.1002/pbc.29218 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Loss of bone mineral is a common concomitant of the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) due mainly to chemotherapy, especially with corticosteroids. Osteopenia/osteoporosis may be encountered long into survivorship. Measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is limited to two-dimensionality and cannot distinguish trabecular from cortical bone. METHODS: A sample of 74 subjects, ages 13.5-38.3 years more than 10 years from diagnosis, underwent peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) at metaphyseal (trabecular bone) and diaphyseal (cortical bone) sites in the radius and tibia. pQCT provides three-dimensional assessment of bone geometry, density, and architecture. RESULTS: Average values in multiple metrics were similar to those in healthy individuals, but deficits in both trabecular and cortical bones were revealed by lower Z scores using an ethnically comparable sample of healthy individuals. Connectivity, a measure of bone architecture and a surrogate measure of bone strength, was lower in females than males. Survivors of standard-risk ALL had greater connectivity in and more compact trabecular bone than high-risk survivors who had received more intensive osteotoxic chemotherapy. There were no statistically significant differences in any of the metrics at any of the sites between subjects who had or had not a history of fracture, cranial irradiation, or use of a bisphosphonate. CONCLUSIONS: These long-term survivors of ALL have somewhat compromised bone health, but data in comparable healthy populations are limited. Longitudinal studies in larger and more ethnically diverse cohorts will provide greater insight into bone health in this vulnerable population.","['Barr, Ronald D', 'Inglis, Dean', 'Athale, Uma', 'Jaworski, Maciej', 'Farncombe, Troy', 'Gordon, Christopher L']","['Barr RD', 'Inglis D', 'Athale U', 'Jaworski M', 'Farncombe T', 'Gordon CL']","['Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence and Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', ""Department of Biochemistry, RadioImmunology and Experimental Medicine, The Children's Memorial Health Institute, Warsaw, Poland."", 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5711-7440', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3236-6560', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6758-371X']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210715,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['bone', 'health', 'leukemia', 'pQCT', 'survivors']",2021/07/16 06:00,2021/07/16 06:00,['2021/07/15 12:31'],"['2021/05/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/15 12:31 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.29218 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Dec;68(12):e29218. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29218.

However, the use of electronic health records (EHRs) in the examination room remains a practical necessity. On the basis of existing literature, the authors developed and tested an integration model, PRIME-EHR, that focuses on the best-practice guidelines. To their knowledge, no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted to test the effectiveness of such models. METHODS: In this double-blind, crossover RCT, 120 eligible patients with cancer were enrolled between April 1, 2019 and February 15, 2020 at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The objectives were to compare patients' perceptions of physicians' skills and their overall preference after they watched 2 standardized, scripted video vignettes of physicians: 1 portraying the use of a standard EHR and the other portraying the use of a PRIME-EHR. Actors and patients were blinded to the purpose of the study. Investigators were blinded to the sequence of videos watched by the patients. Validated questionnaires to rate physicians' compassion (0 = best, 50 = worst), communication skills (14 = poor, 70 = excellent), and professionalism (4 = poor, 20 = very good) were used. RESULTS: PRIME-EHR, compared with the standard EHR, resulted in better scores for physician compassion (median score, 5 [interquartile range, 0-10] vs 12 [interquartile range, 4-25]; P = .0009), communication skills (median score, 69 [interquartile range, 63-70] vs 61 [interquartile range, 50-69]; P = .0026), and professionalism (median score, 20 [interquartile range, 18-20] vs 18 [interquartile range, 14-20]; P = .0058). The majority of patients preferred physicians who used PRIME-EHR (n = 70 [77%] vs n = 21 [23%]; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: The PRIME-EHR approach significantly improved patients' perceptions of and preference for the physicians. This integrated model of health care delivery has the potential to improve communication and compassion in cancer care.","['Haider, Ali', 'Azhar, Ahsan', 'Tanco, Kimberson C', 'Epner, Margeaux', 'Naqvi, Syed Mussadiq Ali Akber', 'Abdelghani, Eman', 'Reddy, Akhila', 'Dev, Rony', 'Wu, Jimin', 'Bruera, Eduardo']","['Haider A', 'Azhar A', 'Tanco KC', 'Epner M', 'Naqvi SMAA', 'Abdelghani E', 'Reddy A', 'Dev R', 'Wu J', 'Bruera E']","['Department of Palliative Care, Rehabilitation, and Integrative Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Palliative Care, Rehabilitation, and Integrative Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Palliative Care, Rehabilitation, and Integrative Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'The University of Texas Health Science Center, McGovern Medical School, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Palliative Care, Rehabilitation, and Integrative Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Palliative Care, Rehabilitation, and Integrative Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Palliative Care, Rehabilitation, and Integrative Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Palliative Care, Rehabilitation, and Integrative Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3323-8595', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5648-8250', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7628-8675', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7283-0519', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8745-0412']",['eng'],"['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center', 'CA16672/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16672/NH/NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20210715,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['advanced cancer', 'communication', 'electronic health record (EHR)', 'examination room computer', 'patient-reported outcome measures']",2021/07/16 06:00,2021/07/16 06:00,['2021/07/15 12:30'],"['2021/03/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/15 12:30 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33778 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2021 Nov 1;127(21):3967-3974. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33778.

Recent studies have revealed KA's antitumor activities in colorectal cancer, leukemia, and lung cancer. However, its antitumor effect in thyroid cancer remains largely unknown. METHODS: The effects of KA on proliferation, colony formation, apoptosis in thyroid cancer cells were assessed by MTT assay and flow cytometry. After KA treatment, the glycolysis ability of thyroid cancer cells was detected by ECAR, and the glycolytic products and relative ATP levels were measured by ELISA. The underlying mechanisms of antineoplastic activity of KA in thyroid cancer were detected by Western blot. Finally, the antineoplastic activity in vivo was observed in Xenograft mouse models. RESULTS: KA inhibited the proliferation, colony formation, and increased cell apoptosis in thyroid cancer cell lines in a dose and time-dependent manner. We verified that the glycolysis ability, ATP production, and lactic acid level in thyroid cancer cells had experienced an extensive decrease after KA treatment. In addition, lactic acid, the metabolite of glycolysis, could weaken the effect of KA on its colony formation ability in C643 thyroid cancer cell line. Our data also showed that KA kills thyroid cancer cells by inhibiting the MAPK/ERK pathway and decreasing Bcl-2 level. By contrast with the control group, the growth of xenograft tumor was dramatically inhibited by KA without obvious drug side effects. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that KA kills thyroid cancer cell lines by inhibiting their glycolysis ability, the MAPK/ERK pathway and the Bcl-2 level and suggest that KA has potential clinical value in thyroid cancer therapy.","['Jing, Changxin', 'Li, Yanyan', 'Gao, Zhifei', 'Wang, Rong']","['Jing C', 'Li Y', 'Gao Z', 'Wang R']","['Department of Endocrinology, The First Hospital of Yulin, 719000, Yulin, PR China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, The First Hospital of Yulin, 719000, Yulin, PR China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, The First Hospital of Yulin, 719000, Yulin, PR China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, The First Hospital of Yulin, 719000, Yulin, PR China. ronger_0516@163.com.', ""Department of Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, 710061, Xi'an, PR China. ronger_0516@163.com."", ""Key Laboratory for Tumor Precision Medicine of Shaanxi Province, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, 710061, Xi'an, PR China. ronger_0516@163.com.""]",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6553-8416'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210715,United States,Endocrine,Endocrine,9434444,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATP deprivation', 'Antineoplastic activity', 'Extracellular acidification rate', 'Glycolysis ability', 'Koningic acid', 'Thyroid cancer']",2021/07/16 06:00,2021/07/16 06:00,['2021/07/15 12:28'],"['2021/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/15 12:28 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12020-021-02822-x [doi]', '10.1007/s12020-021-02822-x [pii]']",ppublish,Endocrine. 2022 Jan;75(1):169-177. doi: 10.1007/s12020-021-02822-x.

Although about two-thirds of patients are cured with initial chemo-immunotherapy, a sizable minority of patients will have relapsed or refractory (r/r) DLBCL. Standard therapy for r/r DLBCL is salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT); however, a minority of patients have long-term remission with this approach. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of immunotherapies for the treatment of DLBCL that have expanded our treatment options for these patients, providing the opportunity for durable remissions that were not previously possible. In this review, we discuss these novel immunotherapies, including monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. The plethora of novel agents leaves patients with more therapeutic options, but leaves the practitioner faced with challenging decisions regarding the timing and indications for use of these immunotherapies. Although studies are ongoing, no agents have been verified as alternatives to standard salvage therapy followed by ASCT at first relapse. The opportunity for durable response and broad age range eligibility makes a strong case for CAR T cells to be used as third-line therapy. The remainder of the agents discussed can be useful in specific clinical scenarios including in patients who are not candidates for ASCT or CAR T cells, as bridging therapy to CAR T cells, or in the r/r setting after CAR T cell therapy failure.","['Shouse, Geoffrey', 'Herrera, Alex F']","['Shouse G', 'Herrera AF']","['Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope, 1500 E.

Little is known about the function of RUNX1T1 itself, although data on its function and regulation have begun to emerge from clinical, and in vitro studies. It is a putative tumor suppressor, whose expression is altered in a variety of solid tumors. Recently, reduced expression of RUNX1T1 in triple-negative breast tumors, and its influence on prognosis was reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier Plotter online tool was used to study the relationship between RUNX1T1 expression and survival of breast cancer patients. High RUNX1T1 expression was associated with longer overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS) and distant metastasis free survival (DMFS). RUNX1T1 expression positively and negatively influenced OS of patients with ERalpha-positive and ERalpha-negative breast tumors, respectively. It was also associated with prolonged RFS, and DMFS in tamoxifen-treated patients. Expression of RUNX1T1 and ERalpha mRNA was analyzed in 40 breast tumor samples, and breast cancer cell lines using RT-PCR. TCGA-BRCA data was mined to study the relationship between RUNX1T1 and ERalpha mRNA expression. ERalpha-positive breast tumors showed significantly higher RUNX1T1 mRNA expression compared to ERalpha-negative tumors. RUNX1T1 mRNA expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR in MCF-7 or T47D cells, which were treated with 17beta-estradiol, or the ERalpha agonist PPT, alone or in combination with 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Effect of ERalpha knockdown was also investigated. Results indicate that estrogen downmodulated RUNX1T1 mRNA expression via ERalpha. CONCLUSION: Higher expression of RUNX1T1 in breast tumors is associated with favourable prognosis. RUNX1T1 and ERalpha show co-ordinated expression in breast tumors, and breast cancer cell lines. Estrogen-ERalpha signalling downmodulates the expression of RUNX1T1 mRNA in ERalpha-positive breast cancer cells. In-depth investigations on the interaction between RUNX1T1 and ERalpha are warranted to unravel the role and relevance of RUNX1T1 in breast cancer.","['Saikia, Snigdha', 'Pal, Uttariya', 'Kalita, Deep Jyoti', 'Rai, Avdhesh Kumar', 'Sarma, Anupam', 'Kataki, Amal Chandra', 'Limaye, Anil Mukund']","['Saikia S', 'Pal U', 'Kalita DJ', 'Rai AK', 'Sarma A', 'Kataki AC', 'Limaye AM']","['Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, Assam, 781039, India.', 'Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, Assam, 781039, India.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Dr. Bhubaneswar Borooah Cancer Institute, Guwahati, Assam, 781016, India.', 'DBT Centre for Molecular Biology and Cancer Research, Dr. Bhubaneswar Borooah Cancer Institute, Guwahati, Assam, 781016, India.', 'Department of Oncopathology, Dr. Bhubaneswar Borooah Cancer Institute, Guwahati, Assam, 781016, India.', 'Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Dr. Bhubaneswar Borooah Cancer Institute, Guwahati, Assam, 781016, India.', 'Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, Assam, 781039, India. amul@iitg.ac.in.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7488-8079'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210715,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)']",IM,"['*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Breast cancer', 'ERalpha', 'Estrogen', 'RUNX1T1', 'Survival analysis']",2021/07/16 06:00,2022/01/07 06:00,['2021/07/15 12:27'],"['2021/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/07 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/15 12:27 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11033-021-06542-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s11033-021-06542-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2021 Jul;48(7):5399-5409. doi: 10.1007/s11033-021-06542-3.

The aim of the current study was to determine the prevelance and related factors of obesity/abdominal obesity and evaluate the association between nutrition and overweight/obesity after cancer treatment in pediatric ALL survivors. METHOD: An observational retrospective cohort study was performed among 67 volunteers (aged 5-15). Participants completed 3 consecutive days (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) recording food consumption and physical activity simultaneously. Weight, height, and waist circumference measurements were performed in remission period, and retrospective data were obtained from patient records. We examined data at three periods: diagnosis, end of treatment, and remission. Subjects were classified into four groups according to body mass index for age z score (BAZ): underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese. Abdominal obesity was defined waist-to-height ratio >/= 0.5. RESULTS: Prevalence of overweight, obesity, and abdominal obesity were 25.3%, 23.9%, 38.8%, respectively in remission. BAZ at diagnosis and at treatment completion, dietary energy intake, and physical activity were associated with an increased risk of being overweight/obese in remission (p < .05). Gender, age at diagnosis, cranial radiotherapy, and treatment risk category were not significant (p > .05). CONCLUSIONS: As in obesity, abdominal obesity was found an important problem in pediatric ALL survivors. Therefore, nutritional targets are needed to prevent obesity. Survivors should be closely monitored in terms of nutritional status during and after treatment and informed about and supported for healthy lifestyle (balanced and adequate nutrition, increase in physical activity).","['Aktolan, Teslime', 'Acar-Tek, Nilufer']","['Aktolan T', 'Acar-Tek N']","['Nutrition and Diet Policlinic, Akyurt Devlet Hastanesi, Akyurt, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Health Science, Department of Nutrition and Dietetic, Gazi University, Emek, Ankara, Turkey.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210715,United States,J Am Coll Nutr,Journal of the American College of Nutrition,8215879,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Pediatric ALL', 'nutrition', 'obesity', 'survivors']",2021/07/16 06:00,2021/07/16 06:00,['2021/07/15 12:13'],"['2021/07/15 12:13 [entrez]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/07315724.2020.1846635 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Am Coll Nutr. 2021 Jul 15:1-7. doi: 10.1080/07315724.2020.1846635.,1-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Depletion of this transcriptionally activating mark by DOT1L deletion or high concentrations of the inhibitor pinometostat downregulates HOXA9 and MEIS1, and consequently reduces leukemia survival. Yet, some MLL-rearranged leukemias are inexplicably susceptible to low-dose pinometostat, far below concentrations that downregulate this canonical proliferation pathway. In this context, we define alternative proliferation pathways that more directly derive from H3K79me2 loss. By ICeChIP-seq, H3K79me2 is markedly depleted at pinometostat-downregulated and MLL-fusion targets, with paradoxical increases of H3K4me3 and loss of H3K27me3. Although downregulation of polycomb components accounts for some of the proliferation defect, transcriptional downregulation of FLT3 is the major pathway. Loss-of-FLT3-function recapitulates the cytotoxicity and gene expression consequences of low-dose pinometostat, whereas overexpression of constitutively active STAT5A, a target of FLT3-ITD-signaling, largely rescues these defects. This pathway also depends on MLL1, indicating combinations of DOT1L, MLL1 and FLT3 inhibitors should be explored for treating FLT3-mutant leukemia.","['Richter, William F', 'Shah, Rohan N', 'Ruthenburg, Alexander J']","['Richter WF', 'Shah RN', 'Ruthenburg AJ']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, United States.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, United States.', 'Pritzker School of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, United States.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, United States.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4469-6428', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2709-4564']",['eng'],"['R01 GM115945/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007183/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210715,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DOT1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC8315800,['NOTNLM'],"['*FLT3', '*H3K79me2', '*MLL-rearranged', '*MV4;11', '*cancer biology', '*chromatin', '*chromosomes', '*gene expression', '*leukemia', '*none']",2021/07/16 06:00,2021/11/03 06:00,['2021/07/15 08:45'],"['2020/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/03 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/15 08:45 [entrez]']","['10.7554/eLife.64960 [doi]', '64960 [pii]']",epublish,Elife. 2021 Jul 15;10. pii: 64960. doi: 10.7554/eLife.64960.,,"['(c) 2021, Richter et al.']",,,,"['WR, RS, AR No competing interests declared']",,,,"['GEO/GSM4952087', 'GEO/GSM4952104']",,,,,,,,,,

It mostly frequently affects younger adults and has a fulminant course with a median overall survival of 2 months. Challenges in managing this disease include an aggressive clinical course, hematologic complications, limited clinical evidence, and a lack of consensus on therapeutic strategies. AREAS COVERED: Here, authors reviewed the key aspects of the epidemiology and current understandings of the molecular pathogenesis of ANKL. The available clinical evidence and proposed diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms in treating ANKL are discussed. Currently, the only potential cure is induction therapy with L-asparaginase-based combined chemotherapy regimens, followed by allogeneic hematologic stem transplant. However, options are extremely limited in the relapsed/refractory setting. Recently, international efforts have been made to understand the aberrant molecular pathways of ANKL and identify potential drug targets for this disease; PD-1 inhibitors, EBV-specific cytotoxic lymphocyte therapy, BCL-2 inhibitors, and JAK2 inhibitors in combination with other agents have been shown to have promising potential in treating this aggressive disease. EXPERT OPINION: When clinical trials are not available, a personalized approach using next-generation sequencing results should be encouraged in the relapse/refractory setting.","['Zhang, Yumeng', 'Lee, Dasom', 'Gesiotto, Quinto', 'Sokol, Lubomir']","['Zhang Y', 'Lee D', 'Gesiotto Q', 'Sokol L']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Hematology and Medical Oncology Fellowship Program, H.

Somatic mutations occur in individuals with normal blood counts, and increase in frequency with age. The genes affected are the same genes that are commonly mutated in overt myeloid malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). This phenomenon is referred to as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). CONTENT: In this review, we explore the diagnostic and clinical implications of clonal hematopoiesis. In addition to CHIP, clonal hematopoiesis may be seen in patients with cytopenia who do not otherwise meet criteria for hematologic malignancy, a condition referred to as clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance (CCUS). Distinguishing CHIP and CCUS from overt myeloid neoplasm is a challenge to diagnosticians due to the overlapping mutational landscape observed in these conditions. We describe helpful laboratory and clinical features in making this distinction. CHIP confers a risk of progression to overt hematologic malignancy similar to other premalignant states. CHIP is also associated with a proinflammatory state with multisystem implications and increased mortality risk due to cardiovascular events. The current approach to follow up and management of patients with clonal hematopoiesis is described. SUMMARY: Nuanced understanding of clonal hematopoiesis is essential for diagnosis and clinical management of patients with hematologic conditions. Further data are needed to more accurately predict the natural history and guide management of these patients with respect to both malignant progression as well as nonhematologic sequelae.","['Osman, Afaf', 'Patel, Jay L']","['Osman A', 'Patel JL']","['Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, University of Utah, and Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah and ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,,IM,,,,,2021/07/16 06:00,2021/07/16 06:00,['2021/07/15 06:29'],"['2021/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/15 06:29 [entrez]']","['6321659 [pii]', '10.1093/clinchem/hvab105 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2021 Aug 5;67(8):1062-1070. doi: 10.1093/clinchem/hvab105.,1062-1070,"['(c) American Association for Clinical Chemistry 2021.

However, flow confinement for most microfluidic devices is generally only one-dimensional using sheath flow. As a result, the equilibrium distribution of cells spreads beyond the focal plane of commonly used Gaussian laser excitation beams, resulting in a large number of blurred images that hinder subsequent cell sorting based on cell image features. To address this issue, we present a Bessel-Gaussian beam image-guided cell sorter with an ultra-long depth of focus, enabling focused images of >85% of passing cells. This system features label-free sorting capabilities based on features extracted from the output temporal waveform of a photomultiplier tube (PMT) detector. For the sorting of polystyrene beads, SKNO1 leukemia cells, and Scenedesmus green algae, our results indicate a sorting purity of 97%, 97%, and 98%, respectively, showing that the temporal waveforms from the PMT outputs have strong correlations with cell image features. These correlations are also confirmed by off-line reconstructed cell images from a temporal-spatial transformation algorithm tailored to the scanning Bessel-Gaussian beam.","['Chen, Xinyu', 'Waller, Lauren', 'Chen, Jiajie', 'Tang, Rui', 'Zhang, Zunming', 'Gagne, Ivan', 'Gutierrez, Bien', 'Cho, Sung Hwan', 'Tseng, Chi-Yang', 'Lian, Ian Y', 'Lo, Yu-Hwa']","['Chen X', 'Waller L', 'Chen J', 'Tang R', 'Zhang Z', 'Gagne I', 'Gutierrez B', 'Cho SH', 'Tseng CY', 'Lian IY', 'Lo YH']","['Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.', 'College of Physics and Optoelectronics Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, China.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.', 'NanoCellect Biomedical, Inc., San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'NanoCellect Biomedical, Inc., San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'NanoCellect Biomedical, Inc., San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Lamar University, Beaumont, Texas 77710, USA.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9507-5835', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4778-6082', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7200-6626', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7024-3831', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4102-4602']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210702,United States,APL Photonics,APL photonics,101719533,,,,PMC8259130,,,2021/07/16 06:00,2021/07/16 06:01,['2021/07/15 06:25'],"['2021/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/15 06:25 [entrez]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1063/5.0051354 [doi]', '5.0051354 [pii]']",ppublish,APL Photonics. 2021 Jul 1;6(7):076101. doi: 10.1063/5.0051354.

However, the antibiotic management of NF in sub-Saharan Africa has not been well described. We evaluated the timing and selection of antibiotics for patients with NF at the Uganda Cancer Institute (UCI). Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of adults with acute leukemia admitted to UCI from 1 January 2016 to 31 May 2017, who developed NF. For each NF event, we evaluated the association of clinical presentation and demographics with antibiotic selection as well as time to both initial and guideline-recommended antibiotics. We also evaluated the association between ordered antibiotics and the in-hospital case fatality ratio (CFR). Results: Forty-nine NF events occurred among 39 patients. The time to initial antibiotic order was <1 day. Guideline-recommended antibiotics were ordered for 37 (75%) NF events. The median time to guideline-recommended antibiotics was 3 days. Fever at admission, a documented physical examination, and abdominal abnormalities were associated with a shorter time to initial and guideline-recommended antibiotics. The in-hospital CFR was 43%. There was no difference in in-hospital mortality when guideline-recommended antibiotics were ordered as compared to when non-guideline or no antibiotics were ordered (hazard ratio, 0.51 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .10-2.64] and 0.78 [95% CI, .20-2.96], respectively). Conclusions: Patients with acute leukemia and NF had delayed initiation of guideline-recommended antibiotics and a high CFR. Prospective studies are needed to determine optimal NF management in sub-Saharan Africa, including choice of antibiotics and timing of antibiotic initiation.","['Gulleen, Elizabeth A', 'Adams, Scott V', 'Chang, Bickey H', 'Falk, Lauren', 'Hazard, Riley', 'Kabukye, Johnblack', 'Scala, Jackie', 'Liu, Catherine', 'Phipps, Warren', 'Abrahams, Omoding', 'Moore, Christopher C']","['Gulleen EA', 'Adams SV', 'Chang BH', 'Falk L', 'Hazard R', 'Kabukye J', 'Scala J', 'Liu C', 'Phipps W', 'Abrahams O', 'Moore CC']","['Vaccine and Infectious Diseases Divison, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Vaccine and Infectious Diseases Divison, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Uganda Cancer Institute, Kampala, Uganda.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA.', 'Vaccine and Infectious Diseases Divison, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Vaccine and Infectious Diseases Divison, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Uganda Cancer Institute, Kampala, Uganda.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases and International Health, Department of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0035-5015', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8411-8051', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3774-2705', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7864-1858', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6370-0771', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7532-4822', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3564-8571', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5995-1471']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210610,United States,Open Forum Infect Dis,Open forum infectious diseases,101637045,,,,PMC8275883,['NOTNLM'],"['antimicrobial stewardship', 'guideline adherence', 'hematologic malignancy', 'neutropenic fever', 'sub-Saharan Africa']",2021/07/16 06:00,2021/07/16 06:01,['2021/07/15 06:24'],"['2021/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/15 06:24 [entrez]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1093/ofid/ofab307 [doi]', 'ofab307 [pii]']",epublish,Open Forum Infect Dis. 2021 Jun 10;8(7):ofab307. doi: 10.1093/ofid/ofab307. eCollection 2021 Jul.,ofab307,"['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

CD19 and CD20 are common targets for lymphoid malignancies, though patients who relapse have few therapeutic options remaining. CD22 is a cell surface sialoglycoprotein uniquely present on B-cells and regulates B-cell function and proliferation. Thus, it is an appealing therapeutic target for autoimmune disorders and B-cell malignancies. A variety of therapies targeting CD22 have been developed, including monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, radioimmunoconjugates, chimeric antigen receptor T cells, and bispecific antibodies.

Here we demonstrate that HAGE/WT1-ImmunoBody((R)) vaccines derived T-cells can kill ex-vivo human CML cell lines expressing these antigens and significantly delay B16/HHDII(+)/DR1(+)/HAGE(+)/WT1(+) tumour growth in the HHDII/DR1 mice and prolonged mouse survival in the prophylactic setting in comparison to non-immunised control mice. We show that immunisation of HHDII/DR1 mice with HAGE- and WT1-ImmunoBody((R)) DNA vaccines in a prime-boost regime in two different flanks induce significant IFN-gamma release by splenocytes from treated mice, and a significant level of cytotoxicity against tumour targets expressing HAGE/WT1 in vitro. More importantly, the combined HAGE/WT1 ImmunoBody((R)) vaccine significantly delayed tumour growth in the B16/HHDII(+)/DR1(+)/HAGE(+)/WT1(+) tumour model and prolonged mouse survival in the prophylactic setting in comparison to non-immunised control mice. Overall, this work demonstrates that combining both HAGE- and WT1-ImmunoBody((R)) into a single vaccine is better than either vaccine alone. This combination vaccine could be given to patients whose cancer expresses HAGE and WT1 in parallel with existing therapies in order to decrease the chance of disease progression and relapse.","['Almshayakhchi, Rukaia', 'Nagarajan, Divya', 'Vadakekolathu, Jayakumar', 'Guinn, Barbara-Ann', 'Reeder, Stephen', 'Brentville, Victoria', 'Metheringham, Rachael', 'Pockley, A Graham', 'Durrant, Lindy', 'McArdle, Stephanie']","['Almshayakhchi R', 'Nagarajan D', 'Vadakekolathu J', 'Guinn BA', 'Reeder S', 'Brentville V', 'Metheringham R', 'Pockley AG', 'Durrant L', 'McArdle S']","['John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Health, Ageing and Understanding Disease, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Health, Ageing and Understanding Disease, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Health, Ageing and Understanding Disease, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Hull, Hull, United Kingdom.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Health, Ageing and Understanding Disease, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Scancell Ltd, Biodiscovery Institute, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Scancell Ltd, Biodiscovery Institute, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Health, Ageing and Understanding Disease, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Scancell Ltd, Biodiscovery Institute, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Health, Ageing and Understanding Disease, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, United Kingdom.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210628,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC8273701,['NOTNLM'],"['HAGE', 'HHDII/DR1 mice', 'ImmunoBody(R)', 'WT1', 'cancer vaccine combination', 'immunotherapy']",2021/07/16 06:00,2021/07/16 06:01,['2021/07/15 06:23'],"['2020/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/15 06:23 [entrez]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.636977 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Jun 28;11:636977. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.636977. eCollection 2021.,636977,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Almshayakhchi, Nagarajan, Vadakekolathu, Guinn, Reeder,', 'Brentville, Metheringham, Pockley, Durrant and McArdle.']",,,,"['LD is a director and shareholder of Scancell Ltd and is a named inventor on the', 'ImmunoBody patents.

The rehabilitation goals change as the cancer pathway alters. Following any treatment for head and neck cancer, a physiatrist plays an essential role in preventing various complications and helping patients to mitigate impairments and restore function, optimizing their quality of life. Case description: This is a case study of a 56-year-old man with squamous cell cancer of the tongue managed with glossectomy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. He also has a remote history of acute myeloid leukemia involving the central nervous system, presenting with seizure and infective endocarditis. He underwent a sternotomy and an aortic valve replacement. His postoperative course was complicated by sternal infection, bradycardia with agonal breathing, and a weak pulse, for which the patient underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation and achieved return of spontaneous circulation and was intubated and managed with antibiotics. He had a tracheostomy and underwent aggressive pulmonary toileting and suctioning in acute care. As the patient stabilized, he was transferred to in-patient rehabilitation. Interventions: While the patient was in the in-patient rehabilitation unit, cancer rehabilitation issues were addressed, including swallowing, pulmonary rehabilitation, management of upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis and infection, bowel and bladder issues, skin care, and evaluation of mental status. The patient's cancer prognosis and future were discussed in collaboration with his oncologist. He was discharged with a palliative care plan. Conclusion: This report illustrates the significance of physical medicine and rehabilitation in management of cancer patients, as most cancer patients experience some deconditioning that results in physical challenges. As the prognosis for most types of cancers improves, it becomes more important to ensure that all cancer patients regain maximum function in the broadest sense to maximize their independence.","['Lawati, Zainab Al', 'Smith, Riley']","['Lawati ZA', 'Smith R']","['Beaumont Medical Group, Royal Oak, MI, USA.', 'Beaumont Medical Group, Royal Oak, MI, USA.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0879-8267'],['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210630,England,SAGE Open Med Case Rep,SAGE open medical case reports,101638686,,,,PMC8252331,['NOTNLM'],"['Oncology', 'orthopedics/rehabilitation/occupational therapy', 'otolaryngology']",2021/07/16 06:00,2021/07/16 06:01,['2021/07/15 06:22'],"['2020/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/15 06:22 [entrez]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2050313X211025450 [doi]', '10.1177_2050313X211025450 [pii]']",epublish,SAGE Open Med Case Rep. 2021 Jun 30;9:2050313X211025450. doi: 10.1177/2050313X211025450. eCollection 2021.,2050313X211025450,['(c) The Author(s) 2021.'],,,,"['Declaration of conflicting interests: The author(s) declared no potential', 'conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or', 'publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Importantly, the present case suggests that early diagnosis and treatment with a pulmonary vasodilator, such as tadalafil, can greatly decrease pulmonary vascular resistance in patients with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension after hematopoietic stem cell transplant and can then improve other symptoms. Accordingly, pulmonary vascular disease should be considered if respiratory symptoms develop following hematopoietic stem cell transplant, because treatment with pulmonary vasodilator may lead to significant improvement in pulmonary arterial hypertension.","['Tanaka, Toshikazu D', 'Ishizawar, David C', 'Saito, Takeshi', 'Yoshii, Akira', 'Yoshimura, Michihiro']","['Tanaka TD', 'Ishizawar DC', 'Saito T', 'Yoshii A', 'Yoshimura M']","['Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Wauwatosa, WI, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0711-7880'],['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210628,United States,Pulm Circ,Pulmonary circulation,101557243,,,,PMC8243114,['NOTNLM'],"['hematopoietic stem cell transplant', 'phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'pulmonary hypertension']",2021/07/16 06:00,2021/07/16 06:01,['2021/07/15 06:21'],"['2021/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/15 06:21 [entrez]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/20458940211027791 [doi]', '10.1177_20458940211027791 [pii]']",epublish,Pulm Circ. 2021 Jun 28;11(3):20458940211027791. doi: 10.1177/20458940211027791. eCollection 2021 Jul-Sep.,20458940211027791,['(c) The Author(s) 2021.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The standard treatment for pediatric AML currently consists in a combination of cytarabine (Ara-C) and antracycline. Iron plays an important role in cancer development and progression. Targeting iron and its metabolism mediators could be a novel therapeutic strategy in cancer.Deferasirox (DFX) inhibits cancer cell proliferation and its use as an antiblastic drug could be suggested. Eltrombopag (ELT), a thrombopoietin receptor agonist used in immunethrombocytopenia, shows anticancer properties related to its emerging iron chelating properties. We compare the anticancer effect of classically used cytarabine with DFX and ELT effects in a pediatric AML cell line, THP-1, in order to identify innovative and more effective therapeutic strategies. ELT and DFX reduce intracellular iron concentration by inhibiting its uptake and by promoting its release. In particular, even though further investigations are needed to better understand the extact underlying action mechanisms, we demonstrated that ELT improves cytarabine antineoplastic activity in pediatric AML cell line.","['Argenziano, Maura', 'Tortora, Chiara', 'Paola, Alessandra Di', 'Pota, Elvira', 'Martino, Martina Di', 'Pinto, Daniela Di', 'Leva, Caterina Di', 'Rossi, Francesca']","['Argenziano M', 'Tortora C', 'Paola AD', 'Pota E', 'Martino MD', 'Pinto DD', 'Leva CD', 'Rossi F']","['Department of Woman, Child and General and Specialist Surgery, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Naples 80138, Italy.', 'Department of Woman, Child and General and Specialist Surgery, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Naples 80138, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Naples 80138, Italy.', 'Department of Woman, Child and General and Specialist Surgery, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Naples 80138, Italy.', 'Department of Woman, Child and General and Specialist Surgery, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Naples 80138, Italy.', 'Department of Woman, Child and General and Specialist Surgery, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Naples 80138, Italy.', 'Department of Woman, Child and General and Specialist Surgery, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Naples 80138, Italy.', 'Department of Woman, Child and General and Specialist Surgery, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Naples 80138, Italy.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210706,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,PMC8274721,['NOTNLM'],"['acute monocytic leukemia', 'cancer', 'deferasirox', 'eltrombopag', 'iron chelation']",2021/07/16 06:00,2021/07/16 06:01,['2021/07/15 06:20'],"['2021/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/15 06:20 [entrez]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.28000 [doi]', '28000 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2021 Jul 6;12(14):1377-1387. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.28000. eCollection 2021 Jul 6.,1377-1387,['Copyright: (c) 2021 Argenziano et al.'],,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST Authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, within a single tumor there is often extensive genetic heterogeneity as evidenced by single-cell and bulk DNA sequencing data. The goal of this work is to jointly infer the underlying genotypes of tumor subpopulations and the distribution of those subpopulations in individual tumors by integrating single-cell and bulk sequencing data. Understanding the genetic composition of the tumor at the time of treatment is important in the personalized design of targeted therapeutic combinations and monitoring for possible recurrence after treatment. We propose a hierarchical Dirichlet process mixture model that incorporates the correlation structure induced by a structured sampling arrangement and we show that this model improves the quality of inference. We develop a representation of the hierarchical Dirichlet process prior as a Gamma-Poisson hierarchy and we use this representation to derive a fast Gibbs sampling inference algorithm using the augment-and-marginalize method. Experiments with simulation data show that our model outperforms standard numerical and statistical methods for decomposing admixed count data. Analyses of real acute lymphoblastic leukemia cancer sequencing dataset shows that our model improves upon state-of-the-art bioinformatic methods. An interpretation of the results of our model on this real dataset reveals co-mutated loci across samples.","['He, Shai', 'Schein, Aaron', 'Sarsani, Vishal', 'Flaherty, Patrick']","['He S', 'Schein A', 'Sarsani V', 'Flaherty P']","['Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Massachusetts Amherst.', 'Data Science Institute, Columbia University.', 'Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Massachusetts Amherst.', 'Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Massachusetts Amherst.']",,['eng'],['R01 GM135931/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20210712,United States,Ann Appl Stat,The annals of applied statistics,101479511,,,,PMC8277113,['NOTNLM'],"['Bayesian nonparametric', 'DNA sequencing', 'Dirichlet process mixture', 'augment-and-marginalize', 'tumor heterogeneity']",2021/07/16 06:00,2021/07/16 06:01,['2021/07/15 06:20'],"['2021/07/15 06:20 [entrez]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1214/20-aoas1434 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Appl Stat. 2021 Jun;15(2):925-951. doi: 10.1214/20-aoas1434.

Its striking genetic heterogeneity is not yet fully understood. Although the CLL genetic landscape has been well-described, patient stratification based on mutation profiles remains elusive mainly due to the heterogeneity of data. Here we attempted to decrease the heterogeneity of somatic mutation data by mapping mutated genes in the respective biological processes. From the sequencing data gathered by the International Cancer Genome Consortium for 506 CLL patients, we generated pathway mutation scores, applied ensemble clustering on them, and extracted abnormal molecular pathways with a machine learning approach. We identified four clusters differing in pathway mutational profiles and time to first treatment. Interestingly, common CLL drivers such as ATM or TP53 were associated with particular subtypes, while others like NOTCH1 or SF3B1 were not. This study provides an important step in understanding mutational patterns in CLL.","['Taus, Petr', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Plevova, Karla']","['Taus P', 'Pospisilova S', 'Plevova K']","['Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czechia.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czechia.', 'Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czechia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czechia.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czechia.', 'Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czechia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czechia.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210628,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,,,PMC8273263,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'ensemble clustering', 'extreme gradient boosting', 'mutation subtypes', 'pathway mutation score']",2021/07/16 06:00,2021/07/16 06:01,['2021/07/15 06:19'],"['2020/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/15 06:19 [entrez]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2021.627964 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2021 Jun 28;12:627964. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2021.627964. eCollection 2021.,627964,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Taus, Pospisilova and Plevova.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among them, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are especially important, as they were the first molecules to proof the concept of targeted anti-cancer treatment. Since 2001, TKIs can be successfully used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). CML is a hematologic neoplasm, predominantly caused by reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) leading to formation of the so-called BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. By binding to the BCR-ABL1 kinase and inhibition of downstream target phosphorylation, TKIs, such as imatinib or nilotinib, can be used as single agents to treat CML patients resulting in 80 % 10-year survival rates. However, treatment failure can be observed in 20-25 % of CML patients occurring either dependent or independent from the BCR-ABL1 kinase. Here, we review approved TKIs that are indicated for the treatment of CML, their side effects and limitations. We point out mechanisms of TKI resistance focusing either on BCR-ABL1-dependent mechanisms by summarizing the clinically observed BCR-ABL1-mutations and their implications on TKI binding, as well as on BCR-ABL1-independent mechanisms of resistances. For the latter, we discuss potential mechanisms, among them cytochrome P450 implications, drug efflux transporter variants and expression, microRNA deregulation, as well as the role of alternative signaling pathways. Further, we give insights on how TKI resistance could be analyzed and what could be learned from studying TKI resistance in CML in vitro.","['Kaehler, Meike', 'Cascorbi, Ingolf']","['Kaehler M', 'Cascorbi I']","['Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210628,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC8273252,['NOTNLM'],"['ABCB1', 'ABCG2', 'BCR-ABL', 'CML', 'CYP3A4', 'OCT1', 'drug resistance', 'miRNA']",2021/07/16 06:00,2021/07/16 06:01,['2021/07/15 06:19'],"['2021/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/15 06:19 [entrez]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2021.696960 [doi]', '696960 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2021 Jun 28;12:696960. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2021.696960. eCollection 2021.,696960,['Copyright (c) 2021 Kaehler and Cascorbi.'],,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tethering and rolling of the cells on endothelium, the crucial initial step of the adhesion cascade, is mediated by interactions between selectins expressed on endothelium to their ligands expressed on HSPCs/leukemic cells in flow. Although multiple factors that affect the rolling behavior of the cells have been identified, molecular mechanisms that enable the essential slow and stable cell rolling remain elusive. Here, using a microfluidics-based single-molecule live cell fluorescence imaging, we reveal that unique spatiotemporal dynamics of selectin ligands on the membrane tethers and slings, which are distinct from that on the cell body, play an essential role in the rolling of the cell. Our results suggest that the spatial confinement of the selectin ligands to the tethers and slings together with the rapid scanning of a large area by the selectin ligands, increases the efficiency of selectin-ligand interactions during cell rolling, resulting in slow and stable rolling of the cell on the selectins. Our findings provide novel insights and contribute significantly to the molecular-level understanding of the initial and essential step of the homing process.","['Al Alwan, Bader', 'AbuZineh, Karmen', 'Nozue, Shuho', 'Rakhmatulina, Aigerim', 'Aldehaiman, Mansour', 'Al-Amoodi, Asma S', 'Serag, Maged F', 'Aleisa, Fajr A', 'Merzaban, Jasmeen S', 'Habuchi, Satoshi']","['Al Alwan B', 'AbuZineh K', 'Nozue S', 'Rakhmatulina A', 'Aldehaiman M', 'Al-Amoodi AS', 'Serag MF', 'Aleisa FA', 'Merzaban JS', 'Habuchi S']","['King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Biological and Environmental Science and Engineering Division, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.', 'King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Biological and Environmental Science and Engineering Division, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.', 'King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Biological and Environmental Science and Engineering Division, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.', 'King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Biological and Environmental Science and Engineering Division, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.', 'King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Biological and Environmental Science and Engineering Division, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.', 'King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Biological and Environmental Science and Engineering Division, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.', 'King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Biological and Environmental Science and Engineering Division, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.', 'King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Biological and Environmental Science and Engineering Division, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.', 'King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Biological and Environmental Science and Engineering Division, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia. jasmeen.merzaban@kaust.edu.sa.', 'King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Biological and Environmental Science and Engineering Division, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia. satoshi.habuchi@kaust.edu.sa.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6075-3889', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0005-0492', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6153-1089', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6403-374X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7276-2907', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6663-2807']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210714,England,Commun Biol,Communications biology,101719179,"['0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Ligands)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'E-Selectin/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Microfluidics/*methods', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', 'Models, Biological', 'Single Molecule Imaging/*methods']",PMC8280113,,,2021/07/16 06:00,2021/08/17 06:00,['2021/07/15 06:09'],"['2020/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/15 06:09 [entrez]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s42003-021-02398-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s42003-021-02398-2 [pii]']",epublish,Commun Biol. 2021 Jul 14;4(1):868. doi: 10.1038/s42003-021-02398-2.,868,['(c) 2021.

In this study, we established an acquired GC-resistant leukemia cell model and found a long noncoding RNA, HOTAIRM1, was overexpressed in the resistant cells by transcriptional profiling, and was higher expressed in patients with poor prognosis. The whole-genome-binding sites of HOTAIRM1 were determined by ChIRP-seq (chromatin isolation by RNA purification combined with sequencing) analysis. Further study determined that HOTAIRM1 bound to the transcriptional inhibitory region of ARHGAP18 and repressed the expression of ARHGAP18, which led to the increase of RHOA/ROCK1 signaling pathway and promoted GC resistance through antiapoptosis of leukemia cells. The inhibition of ROCK1 in GC-resistant cells could restore GCs responsiveness. In addition, HOTAIRM1 could also act as a protein sequester to prevent transcription factor AML1(acute myeloid leukemia 1) from binding to the regulatory region of ARHGAP18 by interacting with AML1. At last, we also proved AML1 could directly activate the expression of HOTAIRM1 through binding to the promoter of HOTAIRM1, which enriched the knowledge on the regulation of lncRNAs. This study revealed epigenetic causes of glucocorticoid resistance from the perspective of lncRNA, and laid a foundation for the optimization of glucocorticoid-based leukemia treatment strategy in clinic.","['Liang, Liang', 'Gu, Wenbin', 'Li, Meng', 'Gao, Ran', 'Zhang, Xin', 'Guo, Chongye', 'Mi, Shuangli']","['Liang L', 'Gu W', 'Li M', 'Gao R', 'Zhang X', 'Guo C', 'Mi S']","['Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China National Center for Bioinformation, Beijing, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China National Center for Bioinformation, Beijing, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China National Center for Bioinformation, Beijing, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China National Center for Bioinformation, Beijing, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China National Center for Bioinformation, Beijing, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China National Center for Bioinformation, Beijing, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China National Center for Bioinformation, Beijing, China. mishl@big.ac.cn.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China. mishl@big.ac.cn.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8883-3215'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210714,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (ARHGAP18 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (long non-coding RNA HOTAIRM1, human)', '124671-05-2 (RHOA protein, human)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ROCK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Signal Transduction', 'rho-Associated Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC8280127,,,2021/07/16 06:00,2021/09/22 06:00,['2021/07/15 05:44'],"['2020/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/06/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/15 05:44 [entrez]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-021-03982-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-021-03982-4 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2021 Jul 14;12(7):702. doi: 10.1038/s41419-021-03982-4.,702,['(c) 2021.

Our initial observation of erythroblast transformation specific regulated gene-1 (ERG) reactivity in myeloid sarcomas led us to broadly explore the utility of ERG as a marker of immature hematolymphoid neoplasms presenting in extramedullary sites. We stained 207 immature and mature hematolymphoid lesions as well as 39 benign hematolymphoid tissues and found weak-to-moderate ERG immunopositivity in 15 of 16 (94%) acute myeloid leukemias/myeloid sarcomas, including 4 of 5 (80%) CD34-negative/CD117-negative acute myeloid leukemias/myeloid sarcomas. ERG positivity was also seen in all 9 cases of B-lymphoblastic and T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, all 3 cases of hematogone hyperplasia, and all 4 cases of systemic mastocytosis. ERG was negative in 148 mature B-cell and T-cell lymphomas, including 2 high-grade B-cell lymphomas and 2 blastoid variant mantle cell lymphomas; 23 histiocytic/dendritic cell neoplasms; 2 indolent T-lymphoblastic proliferations; and 2 blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasms. We conclude that ERG immunoreactivity may pose a significant diagnostic pitfall in the workup of undifferentiated malignant neoplasms, particularly those presenting in extramedullary sites.","['Koo, Matthew', 'Natkunam, Yasodha']","['Koo M', 'Natkunam Y']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,,IM,,,,,2021/07/16 06:00,2021/07/16 06:00,['2021/07/15 05:42'],"['2020/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/15 05:42 [entrez]']","['10.1097/PAI.0000000000000958 [doi]', '00129039-900000000-98525 [pii]']",ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2022 Jan 1;30(1):42-48. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0000000000000958.,42-48,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In this study, the expressions of NRON, NFATc1, CD3/CD4, and proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM)-1 were examined by in situ hybridization, immunohistochemical analysis, and immunofluorescence in labial salivary glands (LSGs) obtained from 16 patients with SS and five controls. The microcell count method has been applied to calculate the NFATc1-positive area/infiltrating cell area in LSGs, and we compared those results to the infiltrating cell area, focus score, serum immunoglobulin G, and the European League Against Rheumatism Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index. The NRON expression in the nuclei of cell-infiltration lesions of the SS patients were prominent. The NFATc1 expression was strong in the cytoplasm of infiltrating mononuclear cells and weak in ducts of both SS and controls. In SS, the NFATc1-positive area/infiltrating cell area was positively correlated with the infiltrating cell area and focus score. CD3/CD4 was expressed in infiltrating mononuclear cells, and PIM-1 colocalized with NFATc1 in the cytoplasm. These results suggest NRON along with NFATc1/PIM-1 in SS LSGs might participate in SS pathophysiology.","['Horai, Yoshiro', 'Nakamura, Hideki', 'Shimizu, Toshimasa', 'Nishihata, Shinya', 'Iwamoto, Naoki', 'Kuroki, Tamotsu', 'Okano, Shinji', 'Kawakami, Atsushi']","['Horai Y', 'Nakamura H', 'Shimizu T', 'Nishihata S', 'Iwamoto N', 'Kuroki T', 'Okano S', 'Kawakami A']","['Departments of Rheumatology.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagasaki Medical Center, Omura.', 'Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Division of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.', 'Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Division of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Rheumatology, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Division of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.', 'Clinical Research Center.', 'Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Division of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.', 'Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Division of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.', 'Surgery.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagasaki Medical Center, Omura.', 'Department of Pathology, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki.', 'Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Division of Advanced Preventive Medical Sciences, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,,IM,,PMC8579987,,,2021/07/16 06:00,2021/07/16 06:00,['2021/07/15 05:42'],"['2020/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/15 05:42 [entrez]']","['10.1097/PAI.0000000000000959 [doi]', '00129039-900000000-98523 [pii]']",ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2021 Nov-Dec 01;29(10):734-740. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0000000000000959.,734-740,"['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

It has been reported that long non-coding RNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 11 (SNHG11) is highly expressed in chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients. However, the role of SNHG11 in CP progression is unclear. The purport of the study was to survey the role of SNHG11 in CP. We employed transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 (TGF-beta1) to activate human pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). Expression of SNHG11 was assessed with qRT-PCR. Loss-of-function experiments were executed to evaluate the effects of SNHG11 on the proliferation and migration of TGF-beta1-treated PSCs. Some protein levels were detected by western blotting. The regulatory mechanism of SNHG11 was verified by the dual-luciferase reporter and RIP assays. As a result, SNHG11 was upregulated in plasma of CP patients and TGF-beta1-treated PSCs. Also, SNHG11 inhibition reduced TGF-beta1-induced proliferation, migration, and ECM accumulation in PSCs. Mechanistically, SNHG11 regulated leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) expression by sponging miR-34b. Furthermore, miR-34b inhibitor abolished SNHG11 silencing-mediated effects on TGF-beta1-treated PSC proliferation, migration, and ECM accumulation. LIF overexpression counteracted the repressive influence of miR-34b mimic on proliferation, migration, and ECM accumulation of TGF-beta1-treated PSCs. In conclusion, SNHG11 knockdown reduced TGF-beta1-induced PSC proliferation, migration, and ECM accumulation by the miR-34b/LIF axis.","['Wu, Desheng', 'Guo, Jin', 'Qi, Benquan', 'Xiao, Heng']","['Wu D', 'Guo J', 'Qi B', 'Xiao H']","['Department of Emergency Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu 233000, China.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu 233000, China.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu 233000, China.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu 233000, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210715,Japan,Endocr J,Endocrine journal,9313485,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic pancreatitis', 'Leukemia inhibitory factor', 'MicroRNA-34b', 'Small nucleolar RNA host gene 11']",2021/07/16 06:00,2021/07/16 06:00,['2021/07/15 05:40'],"['2021/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/15 05:40 [entrez]']",['10.1507/endocrj.EJ21-0176 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocr J. 2021 Nov 29;68(11):1347-1357. doi: 10.1507/endocrj.EJ21-0176.

Bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal niches play an essential role in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and LSC maintenance. Using a murine CML model, we examine leukemia-induced alterations in mesenchymal cell populations. We show that 6C3+ stromal progenitors expand in CML BM and exhibit increased LSC but reduced HSC supportive capacity. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) signaling mediates expansion and higher expression of CXCL1 in CML BM 6C3+ cells and higher expression of the CXCL1 receptor CXCR2 in LSCs. CXCL1 enhances LSC proliferation and self-renewal, whereas CXCR2 inhibition reduces LSC growth and enhances LSC targeting in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We find that TNF-alpha-mediated alterations in CML BM stromal niches enhance support of LSC maintenance and growth via CXCL1-CXCR2 signaling and that CXCR2 inhibition effectively depletes CML LSCs.","['Agarwal, Puneet', 'Li, Hui', 'Choi, Kwangmin', 'Hueneman, Kathleen', 'He, Jianbo', 'Welner, Robert S', 'Starczynowski, Daniel T', 'Bhatia, Ravi']","['Agarwal P', 'Li H', 'Choi K', 'Hueneman K', 'He J', 'Welner RS', 'Starczynowski DT', 'Bhatia R']","[""Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA; Division of Experimental Hematology & Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology & Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology & Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology & Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.

We report the regulation of RAG1 through a microRNA (miRNA), miR-29c, in a B cell stage-specific manner in mice and humans. Various lines of experimentation, including CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, demonstrate the target specificity and direct interaction of miR-29c to RAG1. Modulation of miR-29c levels leads to change in V(D)J recombination efficiency in pre-B cells. The miR-29c expression is inversely proportional to RAG1 in a B cell developmental stage-specific manner, and miR-29c null mice exhibit a reduction in mature B cells. A negative correlation of miR-29c and RAG1 levels is also observed in leukemia patients, suggesting the potential use of miR-29c as a biomarker and a therapeutic target. Thus, our results reveal the role of miRNA in the regulation of RAG1 and its relevance in cancer.","['Kumari, Rupa', 'Roy, Urbi', 'Desai, Sagar', 'Nilavar, Namrata M', 'Van Nieuwenhuijze, Annemarie', 'Paranjape, Amita', 'Radha, Gudapureddy', 'Bawa, Pushpinder', 'Srivastava, Mrinal', 'Nambiar, Mridula', 'Balaji, Kithiganahalli Narayanaswamy', 'Liston, Adrian', 'Choudhary, Bibha', 'Raghavan, Sathees C']","['Kumari R', 'Roy U', 'Desai S', 'Nilavar NM', 'Van Nieuwenhuijze A', 'Paranjape A', 'Radha G', 'Bawa P', 'Srivastava M', 'Nambiar M', 'Balaji KN', 'Liston A', 'Choudhary B', 'Raghavan SC']","['Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India.', 'Institute of Bioinformatics and Applied Biotechnology, Bangalore 560100, India; Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, Karnataka 576104, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Laboratory of Adaptive Immunity, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India.', 'Institute of Bioinformatics and Applied Biotechnology, Bangalore 560100, India.', 'TIFR Centre for Interdisciplinary Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Hyderabad 500046, India.', 'Department of Biology, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune, India.', 'Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India.', 'Immunology Programme, Babraham Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Bioinformatics and Applied Biotechnology, Bangalore 560100, India.

AID requires single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to act, but it has been unclear why or how this region transiently acquires a ssDNA state. Here, we demonstrate the ssDNA state in the 23 bp E2A fragile zone using several methods, including native bisulfite DNA structural analysis in live human pre-B cells. AID deamination within the E2A fragile zone does not require but is increased upon transcription. High C-string density, nascent RNA tails, and direct DNA sequence repeats prolong the ssDNA state of the E2A fragile zone and increase AID deamination at overlapping AID hotspots that contain the CpG sites at which breaks occur in patients. These features provide key insights into lymphoid fragile zones generally.","['Liu, Di', 'Loh, Yong-Hwee Eddie', 'Hsieh, Chih-Lin', 'Lieber, Michael R']","['Liu D', 'Loh YE', 'Hsieh CL', 'Lieber MR']","['Departments of Pathology, Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, and Molecular Microbiology & Immunology, and Section of Molecular & Computational Biology (Department of Biological Sciences), USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California and USC Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'USC Libraries Bioinformatics Services, University of Southern California and USC Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Urology, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California and USC Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology, Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, and Molecular Microbiology & Immunology, and Section of Molecular & Computational Biology (Department of Biological Sciences), USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California and USC Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

Active cancer diagnosis and treatment are well-known risk factors; however, a risk assessment model (RAM) for VTE in patients with both cancer and COVID-19 is lacking. OBJECTIVES: To assess the incidence of and risk factors for thrombosis in hospitalized patients with cancer and COVID-19. METHODS: Among patients with cancer in the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium registry (CCC19) cohort study, we assessed the incidence of VTE and ATE within 90 days of COVID-19-associated hospitalization. A multivariable logistic regression model specifically for VTE was built using a priori determined clinical risk factors. A simplified RAM was derived and internally validated using bootstrap. RESULTS: From March 17, 2020 to November 30, 2020, 2804 hospitalized patients were analyzed. The incidence of VTE and ATE was 7.6% and 3.9%, respectively. The incidence of VTE, but not ATE, was higher in patients receiving recent anti-cancer therapy. A simplified RAM for VTE was derived and named CoVID-TE (Cancer subtype high to very-high risk by original Khorana score +1, VTE history +2, ICU admission +2, D-dimer elevation +1, recent systemic anti-cancer Therapy +1, and non-Hispanic Ethnicity +1). The RAM stratified patients into two cohorts (low-risk, 0-2 points, n = 1423 vs. high-risk, 3+ points, n = 1034) where VTE occurred in 4.1% low-risk and 11.3% high-risk patients (c statistic 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.63-0.71). The RAM performed similarly well in subgroups of patients not on anticoagulant prior to admission and moderately ill patients not requiring direct ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized patients with cancer and COVID-19 have elevated thrombotic risks. The CoVID-TE RAM for VTE prediction may help real-time data-driven decisions in this vulnerable population.","['Li, Ang', 'Kuderer, Nicole M', 'Hsu, Chih-Yuan', 'Shyr, Yu', 'Warner, Jeremy L', 'Shah,

We evaluate the impact of various factors on survival outcomes post-transplant in MF. Data of 89 consecutive MF patients (primary 47%) who underwent allo-HCT between 2005 and 2018 was evaluated. Fifty-four percent patients had received JAK1/2 inhibitors (JAKi) pre-HCT. The median CD34 count was 7.1x10(6) cells/kg. Graft failure was seen in 10% of the patients. Grade 3-4 acute GVHD (aGVHD) and moderate/severe chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) occurred in 24% and 40% patients, respectively. Two-year overall survival (OS) and relapse free survival (RFS) were 51% and 43%, respectively. Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 2 years were 11% and 46%, respectively. Higher CD34 cell dose (</=5 x 10(6) cells/kg vs 5-9 or >/=9 x 10(6) cells/kg) and lower pre-HCT ferritin (</=1000 ng/ml) were associated with better OS, RFS and lower NRM. Grade 3-4 aGVHD was associated with higher NRM. Use of pre-transplant JAKi was associated with lower incidence of grade 3-4 aGVHD. In summary, higher CD34 cell dose is associated with better allo-HCT outcomes in MF and pre-HCT JAKi use is associated with reduced risk of severe aGVHD. These two modifiable parameters should be considered during allo-HCT for MF.","['Cyriac, Sunu', 'Prem, Shruti', 'Salas, Maria Queralt', 'Chen, Shiyi', 'Al-Shaibani, Zeyad', 'Lam, Wilson', 'Law, Arjun', 'Gupta, Vikas', 'Michelis, Fotios V', 'Kim, Dennis Dong Hwan', 'Lipton, Jeffrey', 'Kumar, Rajat', 'Mattsson, Jonas', 'Viswabandya, Auro']","['Cyriac S', 'Prem S', 'Salas MQ', 'Chen S', 'Al-Shaibani Z', 'Lam W', 'Law A', 'Gupta V', 'Michelis FV', 'Kim DDH', 'Lipton J', 'Kumar R', 'Mattsson J', 'Viswabandya A']","['Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Leukemia Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3345-1583', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7918-8306', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4567-3682', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2956-0848', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7391-7168']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210727,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic', 'CD34 count', 'Hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'JAK2 inhibitor', 'Myelofibrosis']",2021/07/15 06:00,2021/07/15 06:00,['2021/07/14 17:39'],"['2021/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2021/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/14 17:39 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13689 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2021 Nov;107(5):517-528. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13689.

Adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL) is a rarer source of acute hepatitis, with only 3 cases reported and all resulting in immediate deterioration with death. ATLL rises from human T-lymphocytic virus-1 (HTLV-1), commonly found in Japan (southern and northern islands), the Caribbean, Central and South America, intertropical Africa, Romania, and northern Iran. In Micronesia, HTLV-1 infection amongst native-born is absent or exceedingly rare. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 77-year-old Marshallese man presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of generalized weakness, fatigue, and nausea. The physical exam revealed a cervical papulonodular exanthem and scleral icterus. DIAGNOSIS: Laboratory studies were remarkable for aspartate-aminotransferase of 230 IU/L (reference range [RR]: 0-40), alanine-aminotransferase of 227 IU/L (RR: 0-41), alkaline phosphatase of 133 IU/L (RR: 35-129), and total bilirubin of 4.7 mg/dL (RR: 0-1.2), supporting acute liver injury. Platelet count was 11.6x104/muL (RR: 15.1-42.4 x 104), hemoglobin was 13.8 g/dL (RR: 13.7-17.5), and white blood cell count was 7570/muL (RR: 3800-10,800) with 81.8% neutrophils (RR: 34.0-72.0) and 10.4% lymphocytes (RR: 12.0-44.0). The peripheral blood smear demonstrated abnormal lymphocytes with occasional flower cell morphology. HTLV-1/2 antibody tested positive. The skin and liver biopsies confirmed atypical T-cell infiltrate. The diagnosis of ATLL was established. INTERVENTIONS: The patient elected for palliative chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP). He began antiviral treatment with zidovudine 250 mg bis in die (BID) indefinitely. Ursodiol and cholestyramine were added for his hyperbilirubinemia. OUTCOMES: Four weeks from admission, the patient returned to near baseline functional status and was discharged home. LESSONS: This case highlights that ATLL can initially present as isolated acute hepatitis, and how careful examination of peripheral blood-smear may elucidate hepatitis etiology. We also present support for utilizing ursodiol with cholestyramine for treating a hyperbilirubinemia. Moreover, unlike prior reports of ATLL presenting as liver dysfunction, combined antiviral and CVP chemotherapy was effective in this case. Lastly, there are seldom demographic reports of HTLV-1 infection from the Micronesian area, and our case represents the first indexed case of HTLV-1-associated-ATLL presenting as acute liver failure in a Marshallese patient.","['Ghaffari-Rafi, Arash', 'Rho, Young Soo', 'Hall, Andrew', 'Villanueva, Nicolas', 'Nogi, Masayuki']","['Ghaffari-Rafi A', 'Rho YS', 'Hall A', 'Villanueva N', 'Nogi M']","['University of California, Davis, School of Medicine, Department of Neurological Surgery Sacramento, CA.', ""University of Hawai'i at Manoa, John A.

Methods: This retrospective analysis included adult patients with one or more claims for rituximab-pvvr, with an index date of 23 January 2020 and a study period covering 1 January 2019-31 July 2020. Results: Of 249 patients included, the most common rituximab-pvvr indications were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (77.5%) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (11.2%). Some patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (42.5%) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (39.3%) switched to rituximab-pvvr from the reference product or another rituximab biosimilar. Most patients were aged >/=65 years (63.5%) and were male (54.6%). Most (59.0%) rituximab-pvvr prescribers practiced in the south of the USA.

The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) changed the history of Philadelphia-chromosome positive (Ph+) ALL. Nowadays, almost all Ph+ ALL patients treated with TKIs achieve a complete hematologic response, and most become minimal residual disease negative. In Ph- ALL, genomic profiling studies have identified a subtype associated with a high relapse risk and a transcriptional profile similar to that of Ph+ ALL, the so-called Ph-like ALL. Given the high prevalence of kinase-activating lesions in this subset, there is compelling evidence from experimental models and clinical observations favoring TKI administration.Areas covered: We discuss the main findings exploring the efficacy of TKIs in ALL.Expert opinion: The use of more potent TKIs will further enhance the inhibitory activity on leukemia cells and increase the possibility of eradicating the disease at a molecular level. In the future, 'combined' approaches of different inhibitors may be considered to prevent/avoid resistance and/or mutations. A rapid identification of Ph-like ALL patients is needed to propose early TKI-based intervention. Several questions remain open, including the initial TKI choice in Ph+ ALL and whether Ph-like ALL patients might benefit from immunotherapy.","['Ansuinelli, Michela', 'Cesini, Laura', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Foa, Robin']","['Ansuinelli M', 'Cesini L', 'Chiaretti S', 'Foa R']","['Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210727,England,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs,Expert opinion on emerging drugs,101135662,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'PH chromosome', 'PH-like signature', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2021/07/15 06:00,2021/07/15 06:00,['2021/07/14 08:43'],"['2021/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/14 08:43 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14728214.2021.1956462 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs. 2021 Sep;26(3):281-294. doi: 10.1080/14728214.2021.1956462.

Here, we proposed a general strategy to unravel leukocytes heterogeneity and screen differentiated metabolites as biomarker candidates for leukocyte subtypes using the label-free mass cytometry (CyESI-MS) combined with a homemade data processing workflow. Taking leukemia cells as an example, metabolic fingerprints of single leukemia cells were obtained from 472 HL-60, 416 THP-1, 313 U937, 356 Jurkat, and 366 Ramos cells, with throughput up to 40 cells/min. Five leukemia subtypes were clearly distinguished by unsupervised learning t-SNE analysis of the single-cell metabolic fingerprints. Cell discrimination in the mixed leukemia cell samples was also realized by supervised learning of the single-cell metabolic fingerprints with high recovery and good repetition (98.31 +/- 0.24%, -102.35 +/- 4.82%). Statistical analysis and metabolite assignment were carried out to screen characteristic metabolites for discrimination and 36 metabolites with significant differences were annotated. Then, differentiated metabolites for pairwise discrimination of five leukemia subtypes were further selected as biomarker candidates. Furthermore, discriminating cultured leukemia cells from human normal leukocytes, separated from fresh human peripheral blood, was performed based on single-cell metabolic fingerprints as well as the proposed biomarker candidates, unveiling the potential of this strategy in clinical research. This work makes efforts to realize high-throughput single-leukocyte metabolic analysis and metabolite-based discrimination of leukocytes. It is expected to be a powerful means for the clinical molecular diagnosis of hematological diseases.","['Yao, Huan', 'Zhao, Hansen', 'Pan, Xingyu', 'Zhao, Xu', 'Feng, Jiaxin', 'Yang, Chengdui', 'Zhang, Sichun', 'Zhang, Xinrong']","['Yao H', 'Zhao H', 'Pan X', 'Zhao X', 'Feng J', 'Yang C', 'Zhang S', 'Zhang X']","['Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, P.

However, the characteristics of transfusion-transmitted HBV infection caused by individual donor nucleic acid amplification test (ID-NAT)-negative blood products are unclear. CASE PRESENTATION: A 76-year-old woman with acute myeloid leukemia was diagnosed with transfusion-transmitted HBV infection after receiving apheresis platelets derived from an ID-NAT-negative blood donation. This case was diagnosed definitively as transfusion-mediated because complete nucleotide homology of a 1556 bp region of the HBV Pol/preS1-preS2-S genes and a 23 bp region of the HBV core promoter/precore between the donor and recipient strains was confirmed by PCR-directed sequencing. The case is uncommon with respect to the unexpectedly prolonged HBV-DNA incubation period of nearly 5 months after transfusion (previously, the longest period observed since the recent implementation of ID-NAT pre-transfusion laboratory testing in Japan was 84 days). Slow-replicating HBV genotype A2 may contribute to the prolonged incubation period; also, the quantity of apheresis platelets delivered in a large volume of plasma, and/or the immune response of the recipient suffering from a hematological neoplasm, may have contributed to establishment of HBV infection in the recipient. This was supported by analysis of three previously documented cases of transfusion-transmitted HBV infection by blood products derived from ID-NAT-negative donations in Japan. CONCLUSION: Continuous monitoring of HBV infection for longer periods (>3 months) may be required after transfusion of blood components from an ID-NAT-negative HBV window donation.","['Matsuno, Takahiro', 'Matsuura, Hideaki', 'Fujii, Sumie', 'Tanaka, Ami', 'Satake, Masahiro', 'Kinoshita, Tomohiro', 'Tomita, Akihiro', 'Matsui, Yusuke', 'Sugiura, Yukari', 'Miura, Yasuo']","['Matsuno T', 'Matsuura H', 'Fujii S', 'Tanaka A', 'Satake M', 'Kinoshita T', 'Tomita A', 'Matsui Y', 'Sugiura Y', 'Miura Y']","['Department of Blood Transfusion, Fujita Health University Hospital, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, Fujita Health University Hospital, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Laboratory Medicine, Fujita Health University School of Medical Sciences, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan.', 'Central Blood Institute, Blood Service Headquarters, Japanese Red Cross Society, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Central Blood Institute, Blood Service Headquarters, Japanese Red Cross Society, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Aichi Blood Center, Seto, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan.', 'School of Public Health, Division of Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, University of California, Berkeley, California, USA.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, Fujita Health University Hospital, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, Fujita Health University Hospital, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6307-3379', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4660-6839', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9654-1300']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210714,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Blood Donors', 'Blood Safety', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Female', 'Hepatitis B/etiology/*transmission/virology', 'Hepatitis B virus/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/therapy', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques', 'Platelet Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'Transfusion Reaction/*etiology/virology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*hepatitis B virus', '*incubation period', '*transfusion-transmitted infection']",2021/07/15 06:00,2021/11/09 06:00,['2021/07/14 07:18'],"['2021/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2021/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/14 07:18 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.16557 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2021 Sep;61(9):2782-2787. doi: 10.1111/trf.16557.

METHODS: A multicenter retrospective survey was conducted via face-to-face interviews based on the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. A total of 121 adult CML patients resistant to imatinib and used nilotinib for at least 3 months were enrolled. The influential features were assessed by multiple linear regression models. RESULTS: Patients had the mean age of 47.49 (SD = 13.67) years, dominated by middle-aged and male groups. The mean scores of functions ranged from 75 to 83, and those of symptoms were from 5 to 28, with the highest of fatigue (28.28), insomnia (22.87), and pain (21.07). The mean global health status/QoL score was 67.70 (SD = 16.80) with considerable financial difficulties (52.34 (SD = 32.15)). Male patients reported higher functional scores and fewer symptoms compared with female patients. All aspects of QoL became worse with increasing age. Besides age and gender, level of education, duration of nilotinib usage, and comorbidities were also significantly influential factors in many QoL domains. A predicted model for expected mean scores of QoL domains was built based on these factors. CONCLUSIONS: The CML patients treated with nilotinib had the above-moderate QoL scores, a light decrease of functional scores, great financial difficulties, and still experienced symptoms. Strategies and more therapeutic considerations to enhance QoL for CML patients targeted toward women, the old, low educational level, and long duration of nilotinib usage, and many comorbidities are needed in the setting.","['Nguyen, Cuc Thi Thu', 'Nguyen, Binh Thanh', 'Nguyen, Thuy Thi Thu', 'Petrelli, Fabio', 'Scuri, Stefania', 'Grappasonni, Iolanda']","['Nguyen CTT', 'Nguyen BT', 'Nguyen TTT', 'Petrelli F', 'Scuri S', 'Grappasonni I']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Administration and Economics, Hanoi University of Pharmacy, 13-15 Le Thanh Tong, Hoan Kiem, Hanoi, Vietnam. cucnguyen.pharm@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Administration and Economics, Hanoi University of Pharmacy, 13-15 Le Thanh Tong, Hoan Kiem, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Department of Organization and Drug Administration, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'School of Medicinal and Health Products Sciences, University of Camerino, Camerino, Marche, Italy.', 'School of Medicinal and Health Products Sciences, University of Camerino, Camerino, Marche, Italy.', 'School of Medicinal and Health Products Sciences, University of Camerino, Camerino, Marche, Italy.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6893-5430', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1131-4286']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210714,Netherlands,Qual Life Res,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",9210257,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Intolerance', 'Nilotinib', 'Quality of life', 'Resistance', 'Second-line']",2021/07/15 06:00,2021/07/15 06:00,['2021/07/14 07:17'],"['2021/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/14 07:17 [entrez]', '2021/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11136-021-02952-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s11136-021-02952-9 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Qual Life Res. 2021 Jul 14. pii: 10.1007/s11136-021-02952-9. doi: 10.1007/s11136-021-02952-9.,,"['(c) 2021.

Here, we investigated a murine BCMA-CD3-targeting BsAb in the immunocompetent Vk*MYC and its IMiD-sensitive derivative Vk*MYC(hCRBN) models of MM. The BCMA-CD3 BsAb was safe and efficacious in a subset of mice, but failed in those with high-tumor burden, consistent with clinical reports of BsAb in leukemia. The combination of BCMA-CD3 BsAb with pomalidomide expanded lytic T cells and improved activity even in IMiD resistant high-tumor burden cases. Yet, survival was only marginally extended due to acute toxicity and T cell exhaustion, which impaired T cell persistence. In contrast, the combination with cyclophosphamide was safe and allowed for a tempered pro-inflammatory response associated with long-lasting complete remission. Concurrent cytotoxic therapy with BsAb actually improved T cell persistence and function, offering a promising approach to patients with a large tumor burden.","['Meermeier, Erin W', 'Welsh, Seth J', 'Sharik, Meaghen E', 'Du, Megan T', 'Garbitt, Victoria M', 'Riggs, Daniel L', 'Shi, Chang-Xin', 'Stein, Caleb K', 'Bergsagel, Marco', 'Chau, Bryant', 'Wheeler, Matthew L', 'Bezman, Natalie', 'Wang, Feng', 'Strop, Pavel', 'Bergsagel, P Leif', 'Chesi, Marta']","['Meermeier EW', 'Welsh SJ', 'Sharik ME', 'Du MT', 'Garbitt VM', 'Riggs DL', 'Shi CX', 'Stein CK', 'Bergsagel M', 'Chau B', 'Wheeler ML', 'Bezman N', 'Wang F', 'Strop P', 'Bergsagel PL', 'Chesi M']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Discovery Biotherapeutics, Bristol Myers Squibb, Redwood City, California.', 'Tumor Microenvironment Thematic Research Center, Bristol Myers Squibb, Redwood City, California.', 'Tumor Microenvironment Thematic Research Center, Bristol Myers Squibb, Redwood City, California.', 'Discovery Biotherapeutics, Bristol Myers Squibb, Redwood City, California.', 'Discovery Biotherapeutics, Bristol Myers Squibb, Redwood City, California.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona. chesi.marta@mayo.edu.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9709-7624', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1523-7388', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1523-7388', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4024-8225']",['eng'],"['P50 CA186781/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA234181/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA224018/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Cancer Discov,Blood cancer discovery,101764786,,,,PMC8266040,,,2021/07/15 06:00,2021/07/15 06:01,['2021/07/14 07:13'],"['2021/07/14 07:13 [entrez]', '2021/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1158/2643-3230.BCD-21-0038 [doi]', '2643-3230.BCD-21-0038 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood Cancer Discov. 2021 Jul;2(4):354-369. doi: 10.1158/2643-3230.BCD-21-0038.,354-369,,,,,,,['NIHMS1698654'],,,,['Blood Cancer Discov. 2022 Jan;3(1):82.

First, our results confirm that MYC is mandatory for PTEN loss-mediated leukemogenesis, while it is not required for terminal steps of thymopoiesis. In contrast, we uncovered that Myc ablation in CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes disrupts T lymphocytes homeostasis in the spleen, notably by drastically reducing the number of MYC-deficient effector/memory T cells. Collectively, our data show that besides naive T cells proliferation, MYC is essential for effector/memory differentiation.","['Nozais, Mathis', 'Loosveld, Marie', 'Pankaew, Saran', 'Grosjean, Clemence', 'Gentil, Noemie', 'Quessada, Julie', 'Nadel, Bertrand', 'Mionnet, Cyrille', 'Potier, Delphine', 'Payet-Bornet, Dominique']","['Nozais M', 'Loosveld M', 'Pankaew S', 'Grosjean C', 'Gentil N', 'Quessada J', 'Nadel B', 'Mionnet C', 'Potier D', 'Payet-Bornet D']","[""Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, INSERM, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy (CIML), Parc scientifique de Luminy, Case 906, 13288 Marseille cedex 9, France."", ""Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, INSERM, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy (CIML), Parc scientifique de Luminy, Case 906, 13288 Marseille cedex 9, France."", ""APHM, Hopital La Timone, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Marseille, France."", ""Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, INSERM, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy (CIML), Parc scientifique de Luminy, Case 906, 13288 Marseille cedex 9, France."", ""Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, INSERM, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy (CIML), Parc scientifique de Luminy, Case 906, 13288 Marseille cedex 9, France."", ""Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, INSERM, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy (CIML), Parc scientifique de Luminy, Case 906, 13288 Marseille cedex 9, France."", ""Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, INSERM, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy (CIML), Parc scientifique de Luminy, Case 906, 13288 Marseille cedex 9, France."", ""Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, INSERM, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy (CIML), Parc scientifique de Luminy, Case 906, 13288 Marseille cedex 9, France."", ""Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, INSERM, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy (CIML), Parc scientifique de Luminy, Case 906, 13288 Marseille cedex 9, France."", ""Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, INSERM, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy (CIML), Parc scientifique de Luminy, Case 906, 13288 Marseille cedex 9, France."", ""Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, INSERM, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy (CIML), Parc scientifique de Luminy, Case 906, 13288 Marseille cedex 9, France.""]",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210619,United States,iScience,iScience,101724038,,,,PMC8259416,['NOTNLM'],"['Immunology', 'Molecular biology', 'Molecular genetics']",2021/07/15 06:00,2021/07/15 06:01,['2021/07/14 07:12'],"['2021/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/14 07:12 [entrez]', '2021/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.isci.2021.102761 [doi]', 'S2589-0042(21)00729-X [pii]']",epublish,iScience. 2021 Jun 19;24(7):102761. doi: 10.1016/j.isci.2021.102761. eCollection 2021 Jul 23.,102761,['(c) 2021 The Authors.'],,,,['The authors declare no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We successfully performed intravesical onabotulinumtoxinA therapy for refractory neurogenic overactive bladder due to human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. Case presentation: We retrospectively reviewed four neurogenic overactive bladder patients with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis who underwent bladder wall injections of onabotulinumtoxinA from April to October 2020. All patients were female. Their median age was 66 (range, 63-71) years. They were previously treated with beta3-adrenergic receptor agonists or anticholinergic drugs alone or in combination for >/=12 weeks. However, insufficient results were obtained. After 4 weeks of intravesical onabotulinumtoxinA therapy, overactive bladder symptoms improved and maximum cystometric capacity increased in all cases.

Inhibitors directed to epigenetic modifiers, aiming at transcriptional reprogramming of AML cells, are currently in clinical trials for AML patients. Several of these inhibitors target bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins, cyclic AMP response binding protein-binding protein (CBP), and the E1A-interacting protein of 300 kDa (p300), affecting histone acetylation. Unfortunately, single epigenetic inhibitors showed limited efficacy due to appearance of resistance and lack of effective eradication of leukemic stem cells. Here, we describe the efficacy of 2 novel, orally available inhibitors targeting both the BET and CBP/p300 proteins, NEO1132 and NEO2734, in primary AML. NEO2734 and NEO1132 efficiently reduced the viability of AML cell lines and primary AML cells by inducing apoptosis. Importantly, both NEO drugs eliminated leukemic stem/progenitor cells from AML patient samples, and NEO2734 increased the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy treatment in an in vivo AML patient-derived mouse model. Thus, dual inhibition of BET and CBP/p300 using NEO2734 is a promising therapeutic strategy for AML patients, making it a focus for clinical translation.","['van Gils, Noortje', 'Martianez Canales, Tania', 'Vermue, Eline', 'Rutten, Arjo', 'Denkers, Fedor', 'van der Deure, Tiem', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Giles, Francis', 'Smit, Linda']","['van Gils N', 'Martianez Canales T', 'Vermue E', 'Rutten A', 'Denkers F', 'van der Deure T', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Giles F', 'Smit L']","['Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC Location VUmc, Cancer Center Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC Location VUmc, Cancer Center Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC Location VUmc, Cancer Center Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC Location VUmc, Cancer Center Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC Location VUmc, Cancer Center Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC Location VUmc, Cancer Center Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC Location VUmc, Cancer Center Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Epigene Therapeutics Consortium, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC Location VUmc, Cancer Center Amsterdam, the Netherlands.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210708,United States,Hemasphere,HemaSphere,101740619,,,,PMC8265862,,,2021/07/15 06:00,2021/07/15 06:01,['2021/07/14 07:12'],"['2020/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/14 07:12 [entrez]', '2021/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1097/HS9.0000000000000610 [doi]'],epublish,Hemasphere. 2021 Jul 8;5(8):e610. doi: 10.1097/HS9.0000000000000610. eCollection 2021 Aug.,e610,"['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

This makes confident assignment of detected variants to malignancy challenging. The issue is particularly crucial for AML post-treatment measurable residual disease monitoring, where results can be discordant between genetic sequencing and flow cytometry. We show here, that it is possible to distinguish AML from clonal hematopoiesis and to resolve the immunophenotypic identity of clonal architecture. To achieve this, we first design patient-specific DNA probes based on patient's whole-genome sequencing, and then use them for patient-personalized single-cell DNA sequencing with simultaneous single-cell antibody-oligonucleotide sequencing. Examples illustrate AML arising from DNMT3A and TET2 mutated clones as well as independently. The ability to personalize single-cell proteogenomic assessment for individual patients based on leukemia-specific genomic features has implications for ongoing AML precision medicine efforts.","['Dillon, Laura W', 'Ghannam, Jack', 'Nosiri, Chidera', 'Gui, Gege', 'Goswami, Meghali', 'Calvo, Katherine R', 'Lindblad, Katherine E', 'Oetjen, Karolyn A', 'Wilkerson, Matthew D', 'Soltis, Anthony R', 'Sukumar, Gauthaman', 'Dalgard, Clifton L', 'Thompson, Julie', 'Valdez, Janet', 'DeStefano, Christin B', 'Lai, Catherine', 'Sciambi, Adam', 'Durruthy-Durruthy, Robert', 'Llanso, Aaron', 'Gulati, Saurabh', 'Wang, Shu', 'Ooi, Aik', 'Dagur, Pradeep K', 'McCoy, J Philip', 'Burr, Patrick', 'Li, Yuesheng', 'Hourigan, Christopher S']","['Dillon LW', 'Ghannam J', 'Nosiri C', 'Gui G', 'Goswami M', 'Calvo KR', 'Lindblad KE', 'Oetjen KA', 'Wilkerson MD', 'Soltis AR', 'Sukumar G', 'Dalgard CL', 'Thompson J', 'Valdez J', 'DeStefano CB', 'Lai C', 'Sciambi A', 'Durruthy-Durruthy R', 'Llanso A', 'Gulati S', 'Wang S', 'Ooi A', 'Dagur PK', 'McCoy JP', 'Burr P', 'Li Y', 'Hourigan CS']","['Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Precision Medicine Initiative for Military Medical Research and Education, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Henry M.

In addition to bacterial asparaginases, which are still used to treat childhood leukemia, enzymes of plant and mammalian origin are now also known. They have all been structurally characterized by crystallography, in some cases at outstanding resolution. The structural data have also shed light on the mechanistic details of these deceptively simple enzymes. Yet, despite all this progress, no better therapeutic agents have been found to beat bacterial asparaginases.

The study aimed to compare the prolonged cytopenias depending on fitness and report real-life data on dose reduction measures and efficacy. According to our database, 120 and 14 patients were treated with FCR between 2011 and 2015 and between 2016 and 2019. Out of the first cohort, 34 patients were treated in subsequent lines. The complete and partial remission rate after first-line treatment was 79%, 16% in the first cohort and 86%, 14% in the second cohort, respectively; and 47%, 35% after non first-line treatment. Based on today's standards, only 37.5% of the patients were fit for FCR. The frequency of persistent cytopenia was 14%, and it was significantly associated with fitness (chi (2) (1) = 6.001, p = 0.014 for all patients). The small number of FCR treated patients after 2016 shows how the availability of targeted therapies, mostly ibrutinib, in later lines changed the first-line choice. Recently, it is recommended first-line for fit patients with mutated IGHV and no TP53 aberrations.

Although the remission rate has increased, the current treatment options for B-ALL are usually related to adverse reactions and recurrence, so it is necessary to find other treatment options. G protein signaling modulator 1 (GPSM1) is one of several factors that affect the basic activity of the G protein signaling system, but its role in B-ALL has not yet been clarified. In this study, we analyzed the expression of GPSM1 in the Oncomine database and found that the GPSM1 levels were higher in B-ALL cells than in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Analyses of the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) demonstrated that patients with high GPSM1 levels had shorter survival times than those with low levels. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) suggested that GPSM1 was positively correlated with proliferation, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligand binding, Galphas signaling and calcium signaling pathways. In further experiments, GPSM1 was found to be highly expressed in Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines, and downregulation of GPSM1 inhibited proliferation and promoted cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in BALL-1 and Reh cells. Moreover, knockdown of GPSM1 suppressed ADCY6 and RAPGEF3 expression in BALL-1 and Reh cells. Furthermore, we reported that GPSM1 regulated JNK expression via ADCY6-RAPGEF3. The present study demonstrates that GPSM1 promotes tumor growth in BALL-1 and Reh cells by modulating ADCY6-RAPGEF3-JNK signaling.","['Zhang, Ye', 'Zhou, Bo', 'Sun, Jingjing', 'He, Qun', 'Zhao, Yujie']","['Zhang Y', 'Zhou B', 'Sun J', 'He Q', 'Zhao Y']","['Key Laboratory of Cell Biology of Ministry of Public Health, and Key Laboratory of Medical Cell Biology of Ministry of Education, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, School of Life Sciences, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Biology of Ministry of Public Health, and Key Laboratory of Medical Cell Biology of Ministry of Education, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, School of Life Sciences, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Biology of Ministry of Public Health, and Key Laboratory of Medical Cell Biology of Ministry of Education, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, School of Life Sciences, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, School of Life Sciences, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Biology of Ministry of Public Health, and Key Laboratory of Medical Cell Biology of Ministry of Education, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210407,Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (GPSM1 protein, human)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (RAPGEF3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (adenylyl cyclase 6)']",IM,"['Adenylyl Cyclases/genetics/*metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC8262160,['NOTNLM'],"['ADCY6', 'B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'GPSM1', 'JNK', 'RAPGEF3']",2021/07/15 06:00,2022/01/04 06:00,['2021/07/14 07:02'],"['2020/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/14 07:02 [entrez]', '2021/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3389/pore.2021.643376 [doi]', '643376 [pii]']",epublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 2021 Apr 7;27:643376. doi: 10.3389/pore.2021.643376. eCollection 2021.,643376,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhang, Zhou, Sun, He and Zhao.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, we used a network-based mathematical model to identify sensitivity regulators and drug combinations for the PI3Kalpha inhibitor alpelisib in estrogen receptor positive (ER(+)) PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer. The model-predicted efficacious combination of alpelisib and BH3 mimetics, for example, MCL1 inhibitors, was experimentally validated in ER(+) breast cancer cell lines. Consistent with the model, FOXO3 downregulation reduced sensitivity to alpelisib, revealing a novel potential resistance mechanism. Cell line-specific sensitivity to combinations of alpelisib and BH3 mimetics depended on which BCL2 family members were highly expressed. On the basis of these results, newly developed cell line-specific network models were able to recapitulate the observed differential response to alpelisib and BH3 mimetics. This approach illustrates how network-based mathematical models can contribute to overcoming the challenge of cancer drug resistance. SIGNIFICANCE: Network-based mathematical models of oncogenic signaling and experimental validation of its predictions can identify resistance mechanisms for targeted therapies, as this study demonstrates for PI3Kalpha-specific inhibitors in breast cancer.","['Gomez Tejeda Zanudo, Jorge', 'Mao, Pingping', 'Alcon, Clara', 'Kowalski, Kailey', 'Johnson, Gabriela N', 'Xu, Guotai', 'Baselga, Jose', 'Scaltriti, Maurizio', 'Letai, Anthony', 'Montero, Joan', 'Albert, Reka', 'Wagle, Nikhil']","['Gomez Tejeda Zanudo J', 'Mao P', 'Alcon C', 'Kowalski K', 'Johnson GN', 'Xu G', 'Baselga J', 'Scaltriti M', 'Letai A', 'Montero J', 'Albert R', 'Wagle N']","['Eli and Edythe L.

Some individuals could have promising response to standard therapy while others are unresponsive to standard chemotherapy or relapse after autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (ASCT), which indicates the necessity to develop novel therapies for refractory or relapsed B-NHLs. In recent years, a novel cell therapy, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T), was invented to overcome the limitation of traditional treatments. Patients with aggressive B-NHL are considered for CAR-T cell therapy when they have progressive lymphoma after second-line chemotherapy, relapse after ASCT, or require a third-line therapy. Clinical trials of anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy have manifested encouraging efficacy in refractory or relapsed B-NHL. However, adverse effects of this cellular therapy including cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, tumor lysis syndrome and on-target, off-tumor toxicities should attract our enough attention despite the great anti-tumor effects of CAR-T cell therapy. Although CAR-T cell therapy has shown remarkable results in patients with B-NHL, the outcomes of patients with B-NHL were inferior to patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The inferior response rate may be associated with physical barrier of lymphoma, tumor microenvironment and low quality of CAR-T cells manufactured from B-NHL patients. Besides, some patients relapsed after anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy, which possibly were due to limited CAR-T cells persistence, CD19 antigen escape or antigen down-regulation. Quite a few new antigen-targeted CAR-T products and new-generation CAR-T, for example, CD20-targeted CAR-T, CD79b-targeted CAR-T, CD37-targeted CAR-T, multi-antigen-targeted CAR-T, armored CAR-T and four-generation CAR-T are developing rapidly to figure out these deficiencies.","['Yin, Zixun', 'Zhang, Ya', 'Wang, Xin']","['Yin Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang X']","['Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, China.', 'School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, China. maryzhangya@gmail.com.', 'School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, China. maryzhangya@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China. maryzhangya@gmail.com.', 'Shandong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Lymphoma, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, China. maryzhangya@gmail.com.', 'Branch of National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, China. maryzhangya@gmail.com.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, 251006, China. maryzhangya@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, China. xinw007@126.com.', 'School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, China. xinw007@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China. xinw007@126.com.', 'Shandong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Lymphoma, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, China. xinw007@126.com.', 'Branch of National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, China. xinw007@126.com.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, 251006, China. xinw007@126.com.']",,['eng'],"['No.2020ZKMB01/Translational Research Grant of National Clinical Research Center', 'for Hematologic Diseases', 'No.2021WWB02/Translational Research Grant of National Clinical Research Center', 'for Hematologic Diseases', 'No.82000195/National Natural Science Foundation', 'No.81473486/National Natural Science Foundation', 'No. 82070203/National Natural Science Foundation', 'No.81770210/National Natural Science Foundation', 'No.81270598/National Natural Science Foundation', 'No.2018CXGC1213/Key Research and Development Program of Shandong Province', 'No.2017GSF18189/Technology Development Projects of Shandong Province', 'No.ZR201911140028/Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (CN)']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210713,England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,,,,PMC8278776,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR-T-associated toxicities', 'Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy', 'New targets']",2021/07/15 06:00,2021/07/15 06:01,['2021/07/14 05:41'],"['2021/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/14 05:41 [entrez]', '2021/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40364-021-00309-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s40364-021-00309-5 [pii]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2021 Jul 13;9(1):58. doi: 10.1186/s40364-021-00309-5.,58,['(c) 2021.

In a pivotal phase 3 study that evaluated 309 patients aged 60 to 75 years with newly diagnosed high-risk/secondary acute myeloid leukemia, CPX-351 significantly improved median overall survival versus conventional 7 + 3 chemotherapy (cytarabine continuous infusion for 7 days plus daunorubicin for 3 days), with a comparable safety profile. A Quality-adjusted Time Without Symptoms of disease or Toxicity (Q-TWiST) analysis of the phase 3 study was performed to compare survival quality between patients receiving CPX-351 versus conventional 7 + 3 after 5 years of follow-up. METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 between December 20, 2012 and November 11, 2014 to receive induction with CPX-351 or 7 + 3. Survival time for each patient was partitioned into 3 health states: TOX (time with any grade 3 or 4 toxicity or prior to remission), TWiST (time in remission without relapse or grade 3 or 4 toxicity), and REL (time after relapse). Within each treatment arm, Q-TWiST was calculated by adding the mean time spent in each health state weighted by its respective quality-of-life, represented by health utility. The relative Q-TWiST gain, calculated as the difference in Q-TWiST between treatment arms divided by the mean survival of the 7 + 3 control arm, was determined in order to evaluate results in the context of other Q-TWiST analyses. RESULTS: The relative Q-TWiST gain with CPX-351 versus 7 + 3 was 53.6% in the base case scenario and 39.8% among responding patients. Across various sensitivity analyses, the relative Q-TWiST gains for CPX-351 ranged from 48.0 to 57.6%, remaining well above the standard clinically important difference threshold of 15% for oncology. CONCLUSIONS: This post hoc analysis demonstrates that CPX-351 improved quality-adjusted survival, further supporting the clinical benefit in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk/secondary acute myeloid leukemia.

It is more likely to be detected in blood than Campylobacter jejuni or Campylobacter coli, specifically reported in 53% of patients. In our case, C. fetus was detected in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures. CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old woman, who was on maintenance chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), presented to our clinic with chief complaints of severe headache and nausea. Blood and CSF cultures revealed C. fetus. We administrated meropenem 2 g intravenously (IV) every 8 h for 3 weeks, and she was discharged without neurological sequelae. CONCLUSION: We encountered a case of C. fetus meningitis without gastrointestinal symptoms, neck stiffness or jolt accentuation in a patient with ALL. Undercooked beef was considered the source of C. fetus infection in this case, suggesting that the need for a neutropenic diet and safe food handling be considered.","['Nakatani, Ryo', 'Shimizu, Koki', 'Matsuo, Takahiro', 'Koyamada, Ryosuke', 'Mori, Nobuyoshi', 'Yamashita, Takuya', 'Mori, Shinichiro']","['Nakatani R', 'Shimizu K', 'Matsuo T', 'Koyamada R', 'Mori N', 'Yamashita T', 'Mori S']","[""Department of Internal Medicine, St. Luke's International Hospital, 9-1, Akashi-cho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan. nakaryo@luke.ac.jp."", ""Department of Hematology, St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology, St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology, St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology, St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3438-0251'],['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20210713,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '75J73V1629 (Ceftriaxone)', 'FV9J3JU8B1 (Meropenem)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage', '*Campylobacter Infections/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Campylobacter fetus/*isolation & purification', 'Ceftriaxone/*administration & dosage', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Drug Therapy/methods', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/diagnosis', 'Female', '*Foodborne Diseases/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Humans', '*Meningitis, Bacterial/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Meropenem/*administration & dosage', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC8278592,['NOTNLM'],"['Campylobacter fetus', 'Ceftriaxone', 'Meropenem']",2021/07/15 06:00,2021/07/27 06:00,['2021/07/14 05:35'],"['2021/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/14 05:35 [entrez]', '2021/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12879-021-06364-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12879-021-06364-5 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2021 Jul 13;21(1):680. doi: 10.1186/s12879-021-06364-5.,680,['(c) 2021.

This has fueled the notion that inhibition of MYB has potential as a therapeutic approach against MYB-driven malignancies. Here, we have used a MYB reporter cell line to screen a library of FDA-approved drugs for novel MYB inhibitors. We demonstrate that proteasome inhibitors have significant MYB-inhibitory activity, prompting us to characterize the proteasome inhibitor oprozomib in more detail. Oprozomib was shown to interfere with the ability of the co-activator p300 to stimulate MYB activity and to exert anti-proliferative effects on human AML and ACC cells.

However, the mechanism of pathogenesis is not yet fully understood. The TAX and HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ) proteins maintain viral persistence and affect pathogenesis through cell proliferation and immune and inflammatory responses that accompany each clinical manifestation. TAX expression leads to inhibition of transcription error control, OX40 overexpression, and cell proliferation in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). OX40 levels are elevated in the central nervous system (CNS), and the expression of TAX in the CNS causes neuronal damage and loss of immune reactivity among patients with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM). HBZ reduces viral replication and suppresses the immune response. Its cell compartmentalization has been associated with the pathogenesis of HAM (cytoplasmic localization) and ATL (nuclear localization). TAX and HBZ seem to act antagonistically in immune responses, affecting the pathogenesis of HTLV-1 infection. The progression from HTLV-1 infection to disease is a consequence of HTLV-1 replication in CD4(+) T and CD8(+) T lymphocytes and the imbalance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The compartmentalization of HBZ suggests that this protein may be an additional tool for assessing immune and inflammatory responses, in addition to those already recognized as potential biomarkers associated with progression from infection to disease (including human leukocyte antigen (HLA), killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-28, Fas, Fas ligand, interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and mannose-binding lectin).","['Brites, Carlos', 'Grassi, Maria Fernanda', 'Quaresma, Juarez Antonio Simoes', 'Ishak, Ricardo', 'Vallinoto, Antonio Carlos Rosario']","['Brites C', 'Grassi MF', 'Quaresma JAS', 'Ishak R', 'Vallinoto ACR']","['Federal University of Bahia (UFBA), Professor Edgard Santos University Hospital Complex, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases Research, Salvador, BA, Brazil.', 'Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Advanced Laboratory of Public Health, Salvador, BA, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Para (UFPA), Nucleus of Tropical Medicine, Belem, PA, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Para (UFPA), Institute of Biological Sciences, Laboratory of Virology, Belem, PA, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Para (UFPA), Institute of Biological Sciences, Laboratory of Virology, Belem, PA, Brazil.

We examined whether the administration of human, bone marrow-derived, multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) could regulate experimental GvHD. The immunoregulatory capacity of MAPC cells was evaluated in vivo using established murine GvHD models. Injection of MAPC cells on day +1 (D1) and +4 (D4) significantly reduced T-cell expansion and the numbers of donor-derived, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNFalpha) and Interferon Gamma (IFNgamma)-producing, CD4+ and CD8+ cells by D10 compared with untreated controls. These findings were associated with reductions in serum levels of TNFalpha and IFNgamma, intestinal and hepatic inflammation and systemic GvHD as measured by survival and clinical score. Biodistribution studies showed that MAPC cells tracked from the lung and to the liver, spleen, and mesenteric nodes within 24 hours after injection. MAPC cells inhibited mouse T-cell proliferation in vitro and this effect was associated with reduced T-cell activation and inflammatory cytokine secretion and robust increases in the concentrations of Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGFbeta). Indomethacin and E-prostanoid 2 (EP2) receptor antagonism both reversed while EP2 agonism restored MAPC cell-mediated in vitro T-cell suppression, confirming the role for PGE2. Furthermore, cyclo-oxygenase inhibition following allo-BMT abrogated the protective effects of MAPC cells. Importantly, MAPC cells had no effect on the generation cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity in vitro, and the administration of MAPC cells in the setting of leukemic challenge resulted in superior leukemia-free survival. Collectively, these data provide valuable information regarding the biodistribution and regulatory capacity of MAPC cells, which may inform future clinical trial design.","['Metheny, Leland', 'Eid, Saada', 'Wuttisarnwattana, Patiwet', 'Auletta, Jeffery J', 'Liu, Chen', 'Van Dervort, Alana', 'Paez, Conner', 'Lee, ZhengHong', 'Wilson, David', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Deans, Robert', 'Vant Hof, Wouter', 'Ktena, Yiouli', 'Cooke, Kenneth R']","['Metheny L', 'Eid S', 'Wuttisarnwattana P', 'Auletta JJ', 'Liu C', 'Van Dervort A', 'Paez C', 'Lee Z', 'Wilson D', 'Lazarus HM', 'Deans R', 'Vant Hof W', 'Ktena Y', 'Cooke KR']","['University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Computer Engineering, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering Center, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.', ""Host Defense Program, Hematology, Oncology, and Infectious Diseases, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, USA."", 'Department of Pathology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Athersys, Inc, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Athersys, Inc, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1980-9999'],['eng'],"['Meredith Cowden Foundation', 'T32 CA060441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Ohio Board of Regents', 'Case Western Reserve University', 'Stadler Family Charitable Foundation']",['Journal Article'],20210728,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,,IM,,PMC8596993,['NOTNLM'],"['Immune modulation', 'inflammation', 'lymphocytes', 'prostaglandin']",2021/07/14 06:00,2021/07/14 06:00,['2021/07/13 17:32'],"['2019/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/13 17:32 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.3434 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2021 Nov;39(11):1506-1519. doi: 10.1002/stem.3434.

The mechanism connecting BAFF receptor (BAFFR) signal to downstream pathways and pathophysiological functions is not well understood. Here we identified DYRK1a as a kinase that responds to BAFF stimulation and mediates BAFF-induced B-cell survival. B-cell-specific DYRK1a deficiency causes peripheral B-cell reduction and ameliorates autoimmunity in a mouse model of lupus. An unbiased screen identified DYRK1a as a protein that interacts with TRAF3, a ubiquitin ligase component mediating degradation of the noncanonical nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK). DYRK1a phosphorylates TRAF3 at serine-29 to interfere with its function in mediating NIK degradation, thereby facilitating BAFF-induced NIK accumulation and noncanonical NF-kappaB activation. Interestingly, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cells express high levels of BAFFR and respond to BAFF for noncanonical NF-kappaB activation and survival in a DYRK1a-dependent manner. Furthermore, DYRK1a promotes a mouse model of B-ALL through activation of the noncanonical NF-kappaB pathway. These results establish DYRK1a as a critical BAFFR signaling mediator and provide novel insight into B-ALL pathogenesis.","['Li, Yanchuan', 'Xie, Xiaoping', 'Jie, Zuliang', 'Zhu, Lele', 'Yang, Jin-Young', 'Ko, Chun-Jung', 'Gao, Tianxiao', 'Jain, Antrix', 'Jung, Sung Yun', 'Baran, Natalia', 'Konopleva, Marina Y', 'Cheng, Xuhong', 'Sun, Shao-Cong']","['Li Y', 'Xie X', 'Jie Z', 'Zhu L', 'Yang JY', 'Ko CJ', 'Gao T', 'Jain A', 'Jung SY', 'Baran N', 'Konopleva MY', 'Cheng X', 'Sun SC']","['Department of Immunology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Immunology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Immunology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Biology, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.', 'Department of Immunology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Immunology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Immunology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Mass Spectrometry Proteomics Core.', 'Verna and Marrs McLean Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'Department of Immunology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Immunology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center UTHealth Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Houston, TX.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1732-8753', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2815-3645', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0618-4798', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9347-2212', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7353-9400']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tnfsf13b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Dyrk kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/immunology/pathology', '*Autoimmunity', 'B-Cell Activating Factor/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Carcinogenesis/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'NF-kappa B/*immunology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*immunology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*immunology']",,,,2021/07/14 06:00,2022/01/04 06:00,['2021/07/13 17:29'],"['2021/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/13 17:29 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(21)01345-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2021011247 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2021 Dec 9;138(23):2360-2371. doi: 10.1182/blood.2021011247.,2360-2371,['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that YTHDC1 is overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and that it is required for the proliferation and survival of human AML cells. Genetic deletion of Ythdc1 markedly blocks AML development and maintenance as well as self-renewal of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in vivo in mice. We found that Ythdc1 is also required for normal hematopoiesis and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) maintenance in vivo. Notably, Ythdc1 haploinsufficiency reduces self-renewal of LSCs but not HSPCs in vivo. YTHDC1 knockdown has a strong inhibitory effect on proliferation of primary AML cells. Mechanistically, YTHDC1 regulates leukemogenesis through MCM4, which is a critical regulator of DNA replication.

Cyclin D3/CDK6 facilitated PFKP nuclear translocation by dimerization and by exposing the NLS of PFKP to induce the interaction between PFKP and importin 9. Nuclear PFKP stimulated the expression of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), a chemokine receptor regulating leukemia homing/infiltration, to promote T-ALL cell invasion, which depended on the activity of c-Myc. In vivo experiments showed that nuclear PFKP promoted leukemia homing/infiltration into the bone marrow, spleen, and liver, which could be blocked with CXCR4 antagonists. Immunohistochemical staining of tissues from a clinically well-annotated cohort of T cell lymphoma/leukemia patients showed nuclear PFKP localization in invasive cancers, but not in nonmalignant T lymph node or reactive hyperplasia.

Furthermore, stem cells have the potential to make new tissues and organs. Thus, some scientists propose that organ transplantation will significantly rely on stem cell technology and organogenesis in the future. Stem cells and its robust potential to differentiate into specific types of cells and regenerate tissues and body organs, have been investigated by numerous clinician scientists and researchers for their therapeutic effects. Degenerative diseases in different organs have been the main target of stem cell therapy. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, musculoskeletal diseases such as osteoarthritis, congenital cardiovascular diseases, and blood cell diseases such as leukemia are among the health conditions that have benefited from stem cell therapy advancements. One of the most challenging parts of the process of incorporating stem cells into clinical practice is controlling their division and differentiation potentials. Sometimes, their potential for uncontrolled growth will make these cells tumorigenic. Another caveat in this process is the ability to control the differentiation process. While stem cells can easily differentiate into a wide variety of cells, a paracrine effect controlled activity, being in an appropriate medium will cause abnormal differentiation leading to treatment failure. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the therapeutic effects of stem cells in diseases of various organ systems. In order to advance this new treatment to its full potential, researchers should focus on establishing methods to control the differentiation process, while policymakers should take an active role in providing adequate facilities and equipment for these projects. Large population clinical trials are a necessary tool that will help build trust in this method. Moreover, improving social awareness about the advantages and adverse effects of stem cell therapy is required to develop a rational demand in the society, and consequently, healthcare systems should consider established stem cell-based therapeutic methods in their treatment algorithms.","['Ebrahimi, Alireza', 'Ahmadi, Hanie', 'Pourfraidon Ghasrodashti, Zahra', 'Tanide, Nader', 'Shahriarirad, Reza', 'Erfani, Amirhossein', 'Ranjbar, Keivan', 'Ashkani-Esfahani, Soheil']","['Ebrahimi A', 'Ahmadi H', 'Pourfraidon Ghasrodashti Z', 'Tanide N', 'Shahriarirad R', 'Erfani A', 'Ranjbar K', 'Ashkani-Esfahani S']","['Student Research Committee, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Molecular Pathology and Cytogenetics Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Stem Cells Technology Research Center, Department of Pharmacology, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran; Thoracic and Vascular Surgery Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211201,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Bosn J Basic Med Sci,Bosnian journal of basic medical sciences,101200947,,IM,,PMC8554700,,,2021/07/14 06:00,2021/07/14 06:00,['2021/07/13 17:18'],"['2021/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/13 17:18 [entrez]']",['10.17305/bjbms.2021.5508 [doi]'],epublish,Bosn J Basic Med Sci. 2021 Dec 1;21(6):672-701. doi: 10.17305/bjbms.2021.5508.,672-701,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Venetoclax with hypomethylating agents is a current standard for older patients; however, recent reports suggest that TP53(mut) confers resistance to venetoclax. The authors investigated the outcomes of patients with TP53(mut) AML who were treated with a 10-day decitabine and venetoclax (DEC10-VEN) (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03404193). METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed AML received decitabine 20 mg/m(2) for 10 days every 4 to 6 weeks for induction, followed by decitabine for 5 days after response. The venetoclax dose was 400 mg daily. TP53(mut) was identified in bone marrow samples using next-generation sequencing, with sensitivity of 5%. Outcomes were analyzed according to European LeukemiaNet 2017 guidelines. RESULTS: Among 118 patients (median age, 72 years; age range, 49-89 years), 63 (53%) had secondary AML, 39 (33%) had AML with complex karyotype, and 35 (30%) had TP53(mut) AML. The median TP53 variant allele frequency was 32% (interquartile range, 16%-65%), 8 patients (23%) had only a single TP53 mutation, 15 (43%) had multiple mutations, and 12 (34%) had mutation and deletion. Outcomes were significantly worse in patients who had TP53(mut) AML compared with those who had wild-type TP53 AML, with an overall response rate of 66% vs 89% (P = .002), a complete response/complete response with incomplete hematologic recovery rate of 57% vs 77% (P = .029), and a 60-day mortality of 26% vs 4% (P < .001), respectively. Patients with TP53(mut) versus wild-type TP53 had shorter overall survival at 5.2 versus 19.4 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 4.67; 95% CI, 2.44-8.93; P < .0001), and shorter relapse-free survival at 3.4 versus 18.9 months (hazard ratio, 4.80; 95% CI, 1.97-11.69; P < .0001), respectively. Outcomes with DEC10-VEN in patients with TP53(mut) AML were comparable to historical results with 10-day decitabine alone. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with TP53(mut) AML have lower response rates and shorter survival with DEC10-VEN.","['Kim, Kunhwa', 'Maiti, Abhishek', 'Loghavi, Sanam', 'Pourebrahim, Rasoul', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'Rausch, Caitlin R', 'Furudate, Ken', 'Daver, Naval G', 'Alvarado, Yesid', 'Ohanian, Maro', 'Sasaki, Koji', 'Short, Nicholas J', 'Takahashi, Koichi', 'Yilmaz, Musa', 'Tang, Guilin', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Konopleva, Marina Y']","['Kim K', 'Maiti A', 'Loghavi S', 'Pourebrahim R', 'Kadia TM', 'Rausch CR', 'Furudate K', 'Daver NG', 'Alvarado Y', 'Ohanian M', 'Sasaki K', 'Short NJ', 'Takahashi K', 'Yilmaz M', 'Tang G', 'Ravandi F', 'Kantarjian HM', 'DiNardo CD', 'Konopleva MY']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Aomori, Japan.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9709-6824', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9892-9832', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4166-5717', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1272-5490', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7103-373X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9140-0610', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2983-2738', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1908-3307', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9003-0390']",['eng'],"['R01CA235622/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'Young Investigator Award/American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center Support Grant CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA235622/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center Support Grant CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20210713,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['TP53', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'decitabine', 'outcome', 'venetoclax']",2021/07/14 06:00,2021/07/14 06:00,['2021/07/13 12:32'],"['2021/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/13 12:32 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33689 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2021 Oct 15;127(20):3772-3781. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33689.

Given the increasing trend of studies on beneficial therapeutic properties of synthetic compounds containing vanadium, the present study sought to use Schiff base oxovanadium complex to reduce the needed concentration of arsenic trioxide. The HL-60 cell line, which is a model of APL, was selected and the effects of arsenic trioxide and Schiff base oxovanadium complex were individually and simultaneously evaluated on the cell viability by the MTT assay. Flow cytometry and Real-time RT-PCR were also performed to investigate the rate of apoptosis and the expression of P53 and P21 genes, respectively. The IC50 of arsenic trioxide and Schiff base oxovanadium complex on Hl-60 cells was 8.37 +/- 0.36 microM and 34.12 +/- 1.52 microg/ml, respectively. At the simultaneous administration of both compounds, the maximum decrease in the cell viability was seen in co-administration of 40 microg/ml of Schiff base oxovanadium complex and 0.001 microM of arsenic trioxide. Real-time RT-PCR indicated that the co-administration of Schiff base oxovanadium complex 40 microg/ml and arsenic trioxide 0.001 microM could increase the expression of P53 and P21 genes by 3.76 +/- 0.19 and 6.57 +/- 1.29 fold change, respectively to the control sample. The flow cytometry studies also indicated that this co-administration could induce apoptosis up to 67% +/- 0.9% significantly higher than the control sample. The use of Schiff base oxovanadium complex could significantly reduce the required dose of arsenic trioxide to induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells.","['Mirjalili, Sara', 'Khaleghian, Ali', 'Kalalinia, Fatemeh']","['Mirjalili S', 'Khaleghian A', 'Kalalinia F']","['Biochemistry department, Faculty of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, 5th Km Damghan Road, P.O.

Currently, there is no specific cure for the management of AD, although natural compounds are showing promising therapeutic potentials because of their safety and easy availability. Herein, we evaluated the neuroprotective properties of kojic acid (KA) in an AD mouse model. Intracerebroventricular injection (i.c.v) of Abeta1-42 (5 muL/5 min/mouse) into wild-type adult mice induced AD-like pathological changes in the mouse hippocampus by increasing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, affecting memory and cognitive functions. Interestingly, oral treatment of kojic acid (50 mg/kg/mouse for 3 weeks) reversed the AD pathology by reducing the expression of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme1 (BACE-1). Moreover, kojic acid reduced oxidative stress by enhancing the expression of nuclear factor erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO1). Also, kojic acid reduced the lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species in the Abeta + kojic acid co-treated mice brains. Moreover, kojic acid decreased neuroinflammation by inhibiting Toll-like receptor 4, phosphorylated nuclear factor-kappaB, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 1-beta (TLR-4, p-NFkappaB, TNFalpha, and IL-1beta, respectively), and glial cells. Furthermore, kojic acid enhanced synaptic markers (SNAP-23, SYN, and PSD-95) and memory functions in AD model mice. Additionally, kojic acid treatment also decreased Abeta expression, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation in vitro in HT-22 mouse hippocampal cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show the neuroprotective effects of kojic acid against an AD mouse model. Our findings could serve as a favorable and alternative strategy for the discovery of novel drugs to treat AD-related neurodegenerative conditions.","['Khan, Amjad', 'Park, Tae Ju', 'Ikram, Muhammad', 'Ahmad, Sareer', 'Ahmad, Riaz', 'Jo, Min Gi', 'Kim, Myeong Ok']","['Khan A', 'Park TJ', 'Ikram M', 'Ahmad S', 'Ahmad R', 'Jo MG', 'Kim MO']","['Division of Applied Life Science (BK 21 Four), College of Natural Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 52828, Republic of Korea.', ""Haemato-Oncology/Systems Medicine Group, Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, MVLS, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK."", 'Division of Applied Life Science (BK 21 Four), College of Natural Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 52828, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Applied Life Science (BK 21 Four), College of Natural Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 52828, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Applied Life Science (BK 21 Four), College of Natural Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 52828, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Applied Life Science (BK 21 Four), College of Natural Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 52828, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Applied Life Science (BK 21 Four), College of Natural Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, 52828, Republic of Korea. mokim@gnu.ac.kr.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2492-5369'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210713,United States,Mol Neurobiol,Molecular neurobiology,8900963,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Kojic acid', 'Neurodegeneration', 'Neuroinflammation', 'Oxidative stress']",2021/07/14 06:00,2021/07/14 06:00,['2021/07/13 12:28'],"['2020/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/13 12:28 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12035-021-02460-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12035-021-02460-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Neurobiol. 2021 Oct;58(10):5127-5140. doi: 10.1007/s12035-021-02460-4.

The study population consisted of 86 consecutive patients with FN who received intensive chemotherapy for hematological malignancy at the adult hematology ward of Kuopio University Hospital. Twenty-three patients (27%) had acute myeloid leukemia, and 63 patients (73%) were autologous stem cell transplant recipients. Serum caspase-cleaved CK-18 fragment M30, C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were measured at the onset of FN (d0), on day 1 (d1), and on day 2 (d2). Eight patients (9%) developed severe sepsis, including three patients with septic shock. Eighteen patients (21%) had a blood culture-positive infection. Serum CK-18 fragment peaked on the first day after fever onset in patients with severe sepsis. Higher CK-18 level was associated with severe sepsis, intensive care unit treatment, and fatal outcome, but not with blood culture positivity. In ROC curve analysis, d1 serum CK-18 fragment predicted severe sepsis with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.767, CRP with an AUC of 0.764, and PCT with an AUC of 0.731. On d2, the best predictive capacity was observed for CRP with an AUC of 0.832. The optimal cutoff of caspase-cleaved CK-18 fragment M30 for predicting severe sepsis was 205 U/L on d1. In hematological patients, serum CK-18 fragment was found to be a potential prognostic marker of severe sepsis at early stages of FN.","['Intke, Carina', 'Korpelainen, Sini', 'Lappalainen, Marika', 'Vanska, Matti', 'Hamalainen, Sari', 'Pulkki, Kari', 'Jantunen, Esa', 'Juutilainen, Auni', 'Purhonen, Anna-Kaisa']","['Intke C', 'Korpelainen S', 'Lappalainen M', 'Vanska M', 'Hamalainen S', 'Pulkki K', 'Jantunen E', 'Juutilainen A', 'Purhonen AK']","['Department of Medicine, Institute of Clinical Medicine/Internal Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital, P.O.B. 100, 70029 KYS, Kuopio, Finland. carina.intke@kuh.fi.', 'Siun Sote - Hospital District of North Carelia, Joensuu, Finland.', 'Department of Medicine, Institute of Clinical Medicine/Internal Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital, P.O.B. 100, 70029 KYS, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seinajoki Central Hospital, Seinajoki, Finland.', 'Department of Medicine, Institute of Clinical Medicine/Internal Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital, P.O.B. 100, 70029 KYS, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Diagnostic Center, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Medicine, Institute of Clinical Medicine/Internal Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital, P.O.B. 100, 70029 KYS, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Siun Sote - Hospital District of North Carelia, Joensuu, Finland.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine/Internal Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine/Internal Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, South Carelia Central Hospital, South Carelia Social and Health Care District (Eksote), Lappeenranta, Finland.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1167-3484', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8182-4452', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7451-4181', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0690-9883', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0271-4368', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2477-142X']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210713,Italy,Clin Exp Med,Clinical and experimental medicine,100973405,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18', 'Febrile neutropenia', 'Non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'Procalcitonin', 'Severe sepsis']",2021/07/14 06:00,2021/07/14 06:00,['2021/07/13 12:27'],"['2021/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/13 12:27 [entrez]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10238-021-00734-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s10238-021-00734-8 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Clin Exp Med. 2021 Jul 13. pii: 10.1007/s10238-021-00734-8. doi: 10.1007/s10238-021-00734-8.,,['(c) 2021.

Cystadenomatosis is an uncommon condition primarily involving the ceruminous and apocrine skin and ear glands. METHODS: This was a retrospective case series. Clinical records from 2011 to 2019 from a tertiary referral hospital in Boston, MA, USA were screened for cases, and case data were re-evaluated and analyzed. The total patient pool contained 65,385 individual cats, of which 797 were referred to the dermatology service. Medical records and biopsy specimens were reviewed; the information collected included signalment, clinical signs, physical examination and diagnostic tests, comorbidities and histopathologic findings. PCR was performed on biopsy specimens to test for papillomavirus DNA. RESULTS: The cystadenomatosis population consisted of 57 cases (7.1% of total cases referred to the dermatology service) with 105 affected ears. Twenty-seven cases (48 ears) were confirmed via histopathology; four cats (7%) exhibited clinically cystic lesions on the periocular, periorbital and perianal regions; only one cat did not have pinnal lesions. Domestic shorthair cats were most often affected. Relative risk for cystadenomatosis was 2.24 times higher in male cats. In 48 cats (84.2%), ears were bilaterally affected. Seven cats (12.3%) had malignant neoplasia, which included: inflamed adenocarcinoma (n = 5); mast cell tumor (n = 1); or squamous cell carcinoma (n = 1). PCR testing on biopsy specimens from 24 cats revealed feline papillomavirus type 2 DNA in only four cats. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cystadenomatosis was more prevalent in senior non-purebred cats, over-represented in male cats and did not appear to be associated with papillomavirus, feline infectious peritonitis, feline immunodeficiency virus/feline leukemia virus status or other identifiable illnesses. Further studies are needed to investigate the causes of cystadenomatosis.","['Loft, Klaus E', 'Soohoo, Julie', 'Simon, Brooke', 'Lange, Christian E']","['Loft KE', 'Soohoo J', 'Simon B', 'Lange CE']","['Dermatology Service, Angell Animal Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'VCA Bay Area Veterinary Specialists & Emergency Hospital San Leandro, CA, USA.', 'Dermatology Service, Angell Animal Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Metabiota Inc, Nanaimo, BC, Canada.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5863-3631'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210713,England,J Feline Med Surg,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,100897329,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Otitis externa', 'apocrine glands', 'ceruminous glands', 'cystadenomatosis', 'cysts', 'periocular cysts']",2021/07/14 06:00,2021/07/14 06:00,['2021/07/13 12:14'],"['2021/07/13 12:14 [entrez]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1098612X211024498 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Feline Med Surg. 2021 Jul 13:1098612X211024498. doi: 10.1177/1098612X211024498.,1098612X211024498,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Medical records of 527 patients were reviewed retrospectively between 2015 and 2019. The patients were examined in terms of demographics, clinical, radiologic, and serologic findings. A lymph node biopsy was performed in selected patients. The risk factors for malignancy were evaluated. RESULTS: Out of 527 children, 26 had neck masses mimicking lymphadenopathy; 501 had lymphadenopathy. The most common location was the anterior cervical region and the median age was 5.7 years. Thirty-nine patients had malignancy (lymphoma in 34, nasopharyngeal carcinoma in 3, leukemia in 1 and neuroblastoma in 1). The risk of malignancy was associated with older age, duration of > 4 weeks, lymph node size > 3 cm, supraclavicular location, presence of systemic symptoms, and hepatosplenomegaly (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001). On laboratory evaluation, anemia, leukocytosis, and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate were found to be associated with malignancy (p < 0.001, p=0.003, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Cervical lymphadenopathies in children are generally benign but patients with persisting cervical lymphadenopathy, adolescent age, accompanying systemic symptoms and abnormal laboratory findings should be considered for an early biopsy.","['Sen, Hilal Susam', 'Ocak, Suheyla', 'Yilmazbas, Pinar']","['Sen HS', 'Ocak S', 'Yilmazbas P']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Health Sciences University, Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Health Sciences University, Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Health Sciences University, Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Turkey,Turk J Pediatr,The Turkish journal of pediatrics,0417505,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes', '*Lymphadenopathy/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology', '*Lymphatic Diseases/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*cervical lymphadenopathy', '*children', '*malignancy', '*reactive lymphoid hyperplasia', '*supraclavicular location']",2021/07/14 06:00,2021/08/20 06:00,['2021/07/13 06:55'],"['2021/07/13 06:55 [entrez]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/20 06:00 [medline]']","['2298 [pii]', '10.24953/turkjped.2021.03.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Turk J Pediatr. 2021;63(3):363-371. doi: 10.24953/turkjped.2021.03.003.,363-371,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the influence of RT modality on the incidence of SMN after craniospinal irradiation (CSI), the authors compared the incidence of SMN in children who had medulloblastoma treated with either photon CSI plus an intensity-modulated RT boost (group I) or passively scattered proton CSI plus a boost (group II). METHODS: From 1996 to 2014, 115 children with medulloblastoma (group I, n = 63; group II, n = 52) received CSI followed by a boost to the tumor bed. Most patients had standard-risk disease (63.5%). The median follow-up was 12.8 years for group I and 8.7 years for group II. RESULTS: The 5-year and 10-year overall survival (OS) rates were 88.8% and 85.1%, respectively, for standard-risk patients and 63.1% and 57.3%, respectively, for high-risk patients, with no OS difference by RT modality (P = .81). Six SMNs were identified (4 in group I, 2 in group II). The 5-year and 10-year SMN incidence rates were 1.0% and 6.9%, respectively (0.0% and 8.0%, respectively, in group I; 2.2% and 4.9%, respectively, in group II; P = .74). Two SMNs occurred in the clinical target volume in the brain, 2 occurred in the exit dose region from the photon spinal field, 1 occurred in the entrance path of a proton beam, and 1 occurred outside the radiation field. There were no reported cases of secondary leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrates no difference in OS or SMN incidence between patients in groups I and II 10 years after RT. LAY SUMMARY: One hundred fifteen children with medulloblastoma received radiotherapy (RT) with either photon craniospinal irradiation (CSI) and an intensity-modulated RT boost (group I; n = 63) or passively scattered proton CSI and a boost (group II;, n = 52). The majority of children had standard-risk disease (63.5%). The 5-year and 10-year overall survival rates were 88.8% and 85.1% for standard-risk patients, respectively, and 63.1% and 57.3% for high-risk patients, respectively, with no difference in overall survival by RT group (P = .81). The 5-year and 10-year second malignant neoplasm incidence rates were 1.0% and 6.9%, respectively, with no difference in second malignant neoplasm incidence according to RT group (P = .74).","['Paulino, Arnold C', 'Ludmir, Ethan B', 'Grosshans, David R', 'Su, Jack M', 'McGovern, Susan L', 'Okcu, M Fatih', 'McAleer, Mary Frances', 'Baxter, Patricia A', 'Mahajan, Anita', 'Chintagumpala, Murali M']","['Paulino AC', 'Ludmir EB', 'Grosshans DR', 'Su JM', 'McGovern SL', 'Okcu MF', 'McAleer MF', 'Baxter PA', 'Mahajan A', 'Chintagumpala MM']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', ""Texas Children's Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', ""Texas Children's Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', ""Texas Children's Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', ""Texas Children's Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', ""Texas Children's Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0269-3045', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5472-5344']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210713,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['intensity-modulated radiation therapy', 'medulloblastoma', 'proton', 'radiotherapy', 'secondary malignant neoplasm']",2021/07/14 06:00,2021/07/14 06:00,['2021/07/13 06:39'],"['2021/05/10 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/13 06:39 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33783 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2021 Oct 15;127(20):3865-3871. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33783.

We investigated the prognostic value of the PTSS in a cohort of patients with MDS who underwent myeloablative CD34-selected TCD transplants. From 2008 to 2018, 109 patients underwent a first TCD-HCT for MDS at our center. We used Cox proportional hazards models and different landmark analyses to evaluate the association of categorized PTSS score risk groups with overall survival (OS). Patients with an intermediate/ high risk PTSS score had decreased OS at day 180 (univariate HR 3.25 [95% CI 1.60, 6.60], p = 0.001) and at day 365 (univariate HR 5.42 [95% CI 2.21, 13.3], p < 0.001) compared to low risk PTSS scores. This association remained significant after adjusting for HCT-CI. PTSS score calculated at day 100 was not associated with OS, even after adjusting for HCT-CI subgroups. In summary, the PTSS predicted survival at day 180 and day 365 in recipients of T-cell-depleted allografts for myelodysplastic syndrome.","['Alarcon Tomas, Ana', 'Whiting, Karissa', 'Maloy, Molly', 'Ruiz, Josel D', 'Devlin, Sean', 'Sanchez-Escamilla, Miriam', 'Yanez, Lucrecia', 'Castillo, Nerea', 'Pennisi, Martina', 'Cho, Christina', 'Shaffer, Brian', 'Castro-Malaspina, Hugo', 'Klimek, Virginia', 'Giralt, Sergio A', 'Tamari, Roni', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel']","['Alarcon Tomas A', 'Whiting K', 'Maloy M', 'Ruiz JD', 'Devlin S', 'Sanchez-Escamilla M', 'Yanez L', 'Castillo N', 'Pennisi M', 'Cho C', 'Shaffer B', 'Castro-Malaspina H', 'Klimek V', 'Giralt SA', 'Tamari R', 'Perales MA']","['Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation, Research Institute of Marques de Valdecilla (IDIVAL), Santander, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation, Research Institute of Marques de Valdecilla (IDIVAL), Santander, Spain.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. peralesm@mskcc.org.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA. peralesm@mskcc.org.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6290-1061', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1944-5053', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5910-4571']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210712,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,,PMC8273566,,,2021/07/14 06:00,2021/07/14 06:00,['2021/07/13 06:22'],"['2020/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/06/10 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/13 06:22 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-021-01392-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-021-01392-w [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2021 Nov;56(11):2749-2754. doi: 10.1038/s41409-021-01392-w.

Many patients, however, fail to receive timely pDLI and have dismal outcomes, which are not taken into consideration. We compared long-term outcomes of 106 patients having T cell MC after day 60 and undergoing allogeneic stem cell allograft for acute leukemia from an unrelated donor (UD), with 111 patients having complete chimerism (CC). Fifty-three (56%) patients received prophylactic pDLI. Thirty-six patients (67%) had a response (RR), 17 (33%) had no response (NR), and fifty-two (54%) did not receive any pDLI (ND). OS was better in MC group as compared to CC (54% vs 43%, p = 0.04), mainly due to reduction in NRM (14% vs 25%, p = 0.05), and all grade acute and chronic GVHD. Within the MC group, response to pDLI was the only significant factor predicting OS, DFS, and relapses with NR and ND having unfavorable outcomes as compared to RR (p = 0.001).

Using CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we identify Chromobox 8 (CBX8) as a negative regulator of K562 cell differentiation into erythrocytes. CBX8 is degraded via proteasomal pathway during K562 cell differentiation, which activates the expression of erythroid differentiation-related genes that are repressed by CBX8 in the complex of PRC1. During the differentiation process, the serine/threonine-protein kinase PIM1 phosphorylates serine 196 on CBX8, which contributes to CBX8 reduction. When CD235A expression levels are analyzed, the result reveals that the knockdown of PIM1 inhibits K562 cell differentiation. We also identify TRIM28 as another interaction partner of CBX8 by proteomic analysis. Intriguingly, TRIM28 maintains protein stability of CBX8 and TRIM28 loss significantly induces proteasomal degradation of CBX8, resulting in an acceleration of erythroid differentiation.

We have reported that, in murine intestinal epithelium with telomere dysfunction, DNA damage-induced activation of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) results in ATM-mediated phosphorylation and activation of the YAP1 transcriptional coactivator, which in turn up-regulates pro-IL-18, a pivotal immune regulator in IBD pathogenesis. Moreover, individuals with germline defects in telomere maintenance genes experience increased occurrence of intestinal inflammation and show activation of the ATM/YAP1/pro-IL-18 pathway in the intestinal epithelium. Here, we sought to determine the relevance of the ATM/YAP1/pro-IL-18 pathway as a potential driver of IBD, particularly older-onset IBD. Analysis of intestinal biopsy specimens and organoids from older-onset IBD patients documented the presence of telomere dysfunction and activation of the ATM/YAP1/precursor of interleukin 18 (pro-IL-18) pathway in the intestinal epithelium. Employing intestinal organoids from healthy individuals, we demonstrated that experimental induction of telomere dysfunction activates this inflammatory pathway. In organoid models from ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients, pharmacological interventions of telomerase reactivation, suppression of DNA damage signaling, or YAP1 inhibition reduced pro-IL-18 production. Together, these findings support a model wherein telomere dysfunction in the intestinal epithelium can initiate the inflammatory process in IBD, pointing to therapeutic interventions for this disease.","['Chakravarti, Deepavali', 'Lee, Rumi', 'Multani, Asha S', 'Santoni, Andrea', 'Keith, Zachery', 'Hsu, Wen-Hao', 'Chang, Kyle', 'Reyes, Laura', 'Rashid, Asif', 'Wu, Chang-Jiun', 'Li, Jun', 'Zhang, Jiexin', 'Shim, Hong Seok', 'Chandra, Krishna', 'Deng, Pingna', 'Spring, Denise J', 'Nielsen, Ole Haagen', 'Riis, Lene Buhl', 'Mayigegowda, Kavya Kelagere', 'Blutt, Sarah E', 'Zhang, Jianhua', 'Younes, Mamoun', 'DuPont, Andrew', 'Thirumurthi, Selvi', 'Vilar, Eduardo', 'Estes, Mary K', 'Colla, Simona', 'Shroyer, Noah F', 'DePinho, Ronald A']","['Chakravarti D', 'Lee R', 'Multani AS', 'Santoni A', 'Keith Z', 'Hsu WH', 'Chang K', 'Reyes L', 'Rashid A', 'Wu CJ', 'Li J', 'Zhang J', 'Shim HS', 'Chandra K', 'Deng P', 'Spring DJ', 'Nielsen OH', 'Riis LB', 'Mayigegowda KK', 'Blutt SE', 'Zhang J', 'Younes M', 'DuPont A', 'Thirumurthi S', 'Vilar E', 'Estes MK', 'Colla S', 'Shroyer NF', 'DePinho RA']","['Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Genetics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Division of Pathology/Lab Medicine, Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Biosciences, Rice University, Houston, TX 77005.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Herlev Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Herlev DK-2730, Denmark.', 'Department of Pathology, Herlev Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Herlev DK-2730, Denmark.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, McGovern Medical School and Memorial Hermann Hospital-Texas Medical Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, McGovern Medical School and Memorial Hermann Hospital-Texas Medical Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Department of Internal Medicine, McGovern Medical School, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030;

Thrombocytopenia, closely followed by symptoms characteristic of gastrointestinal toxicity, have presented as dose-limiting adverse events that may have prevented escalation to higher dose levels required for more robust efficacy. ABBV-744 is a highly selective inhibitor for the second bromodomain of the four BET family proteins. In contrast to the broad antiproliferative activities observed with dual bromodomain BET inhibitors, ABBV-744 displayed significant antiproliferative activities largely although not exclusively in cancer cell lines derived from acute myeloid leukemia and androgen receptor positive prostate cancer. Studies in acute myeloid leukemia xenograft models demonstrated antitumor efficacy for ABBV-744 that was comparable with the pan-BET inhibitor ABBV-075 but with an improved therapeutic index. Enhanced antitumor efficacy was also observed with the combination of ABBV-744 and the BCL-2 inhibitor, venetoclax compared with monotherapies of either agent alone. These results collectively support the clinical evaluation of ABBV-744 in AML (Clinical Trials.gov identifier: NCT03360006).","['Zhang, Lu', 'Cai, Tianyu', 'Lin, Xiaoyu', 'Huang, Xiaoli', 'Bui, Mai H', 'Plotnik, Joshua P', 'Bellin, Richard J', 'Faivre, Emily J', 'Kuruvilla, Vinitha M', 'Lam, Lloyd T', 'Lu, Xin', 'Zha, Zheng', 'Feng, Weiguo', 'Hessler, Paul', 'Uziel, Tamar', 'Zhang, Qi', 'Cavazos, Antonio', 'Han, Lina', 'Ferguson, Debra C', 'Mehta, Gaurav', 'Shanmugavelandy, Sriram S', 'Magoc, Terrance J', 'Rowe, Jenny', 'Goodwin, Neal C', 'Dorritie, Kathleen A', 'Boyiadzis, Michael', 'Albert, Daniel H', 'McDaniel, Keith F', 'Kati, Warren M', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Shen, Yu']","['Zhang L', 'Cai T', 'Lin X', 'Huang X', 'Bui MH', 'Plotnik JP', 'Bellin RJ', 'Faivre EJ', 'Kuruvilla VM', 'Lam LT', 'Lu X', 'Zha Z', 'Feng W', 'Hessler P', 'Uziel T', 'Zhang Q', 'Cavazos A', 'Han L', 'Ferguson DC', 'Mehta G', 'Shanmugavelandy SS', 'Magoc TJ', 'Rowe J', 'Goodwin NC', 'Dorritie KA', 'Boyiadzis M', 'Albert DH', 'McDaniel KF', 'Kati WM', 'Konopleva M', 'Shen Y']","['Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Genomic Research Center, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Cyteir Therapeutics, 128 Spring Street, Lexington, Massachusetts.', 'Genomic Research Center, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', '190 Lisk Drive, Hainesville, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Cyteir Therapeutics, 128 Spring Street, Lexington, Massachusetts.', 'Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, Massachusetts.', 'Champions Oncology, Rockville, Maryland.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas. yu.shen@abbvie.com mkonople@mdanderson.org.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois. yu.shen@abbvie.com mkonople@mdanderson.org.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0266-9571', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1090-0742', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8252-5753', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0863-8573']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20210712,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,,IM,,,,,2021/07/14 06:00,2021/07/14 06:00,['2021/07/13 05:48'],"['2021/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/31 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/13 05:48 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-21-0029 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-21-0029 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2021 Oct;20(10):1809-1819. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-21-0029.

Here, we describe the preclinical development of a novel cell therapy that targets the antigen CLEC12A with a biparatopic bridging protein. Bridging proteins are designed as ""CAR-T cell engagers,"" with a CAR-targeted protein fused to antigen binding domains derived from antibodies. Here, we created a CD19-anti-CLEC12A bridging protein that binds to CAR19 T cells and to the antigen CLEC12A. Biparatopic targeting increases the potency of bridging protein-mediated cytotoxicity by CAR19 T cells. Using CAR19 T cells that secrete the bridging protein we demonstrate potent activity against aggressive leukemic cell lines in vivo This CAR-engager platform is facile and modular, as illustrated by activity of a dual-antigen bridging protein targeting CLEC12A and CD33, designed to counter tumor heterogeneity and antigen escape, and created without the need for extensive CAR T-cell genetic engineering.

CMML cells are uniquely hypersensitive to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and robustly engraft in immunocompromised mice that secrete human cytokines. To leverage these unique biological features, we conducted an integrated human and murine study evaluating ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor that potently downregulates intracellular GM-CSF signaling. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 50 patients with WHO-defined CMML were enrolled in this open-label, multi-institution phase I/II clinical study, with a ruxolitinib dose of 20 mg twice daily studied in phase II. In parallel, 49 patient-derived xenografts (PDX) derived from 13 study participants were generated and randomized to receive ruxolitinib or vehicle control. RESULTS: The most common grade 3/4 treatment-related toxicities observed were anemia (10%) and thrombocytopenia (6%). The clinical overall response rate was 38% by Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (MDS/MPN) International Working Group (IWG) criteria and 43% of patients with baseline splenomegaly achieved a spleen response. Profiling of cytokine levels and somatic mutations at baseline failed to identify predictive biomarkers. PDX models derived from screening samples of study participants recapitulated responses seen in humans, particularly spleen responses, and corroborated ruxolitinib's clinical efficacy in a randomized murine study not feasible in human trials. CONCLUSIONS: Ruxolitinib demonstrated clinical efficacy and an acceptable adverse event profile in patients with CMML, identifying a potential novel therapeutic in this rare malignancy. Furthermore, this study demonstrates proof of concept that PDX modeling can recapitulate responses of patients treated on clinical trial and represents a novel correlative study that corroborates clinical efficacy seen in humans.See related commentary by Shastri and Adrianzen-Herrera, p. 6069.","['Hunter, Anthony M', 'Newman, Hannah', 'Dezern, Amy E', 'Steensma, David P', 'Niyongere, Sandrine', 'Roboz, Gail J', 'Mo, Qianxing', 'Chan, Onyee', 'Gerds, Aaron', 'Sallman, David A', 'Dominguez-Viqueira, William', 'Letson, Christopher', 'Balasis, Maria E', 'Ball, Markus', 'Kruer, Traci', 'Zhang, Hailing', 'Lancet, Jeffrey E', 'List, Alan F', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Komrokji, Rami S', 'Padron, Eric']","['Hunter AM', 'Newman H', 'Dezern AE', 'Steensma DP', 'Niyongere S', 'Roboz GJ', 'Mo Q', 'Chan O', 'Gerds A', 'Sallman DA', 'Dominguez-Viqueira W', 'Letson C', 'Balasis ME', 'Ball M', 'Kruer T', 'Zhang H', 'Lancet JE', 'List AF', 'Sekeres MA', 'Komrokji RS', 'Padron E']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Hematologic Malignancies, H.

Such therapies have already been approved in several blood cancers, such as B-cell leukemia and lymphoma. Despite this progress, a significant proportion of patients experience primary or secondary resistance to CAR T-cell therapy. Here, we review the mechanisms by which CAR T cells eliminate their target and how cancer cells may be insensitive to such killing (here referred to as intrinsic resistance). Recent studies suggest that the activation of apoptosis through death receptor signaling is responsible for a major part of CAR T-cell cytotoxicity in vivo Indeed, cancer cells harboring aberrant apoptotic machinery may be insensitive to CAR T-cell killing. This intrinsic resistance of cancer cells to CAR T-cell killing could be responsible for a significant portion of treatment failure. Finally, we discuss strategies that may be envisioned to overcome such resistance to enhance CAR T-cell efficacy.","['Lemoine, Jean', 'Ruella, Marco', 'Houot, Roch']","['Lemoine J', 'Ruella M', 'Houot R']","['AP-HP, Department of Hematology, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies and Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Hematology, CHU de Rennes, Universite de Rennes, INSERM U1236, Rennes, France. roch.houot@chu-rennes.fr.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5833-6728', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4301-5811', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1729-8213']",['eng'],"['K99 CA212302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA212302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210712,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,IM,,,,,2021/07/14 06:00,2021/07/14 06:00,['2021/07/13 05:48'],"['2021/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/13 05:48 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-21-1559 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-1559 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2021 Dec 1;27(23):6298-6306. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-1559.

The clinical spectrum of this syndrome is so wide that it easily baffles with more common differentials. In this case report, a neonate born to third-degree consanguineous marriage with previous two abortions presented with respiratory difficulty, severe hyperthermia and feeding difficulty, which were daunting challenges to manage due to being refractory to standard line of management. Severe myotonia and gross dysmorphism were challenging dots to connect. Targeted exome sequencing was a ray of hope, which revealed homozygous mutation in the leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor gene on chromosome 5p13, confirming the genetic diagnosis for a fairly common spectrum of symptoms.

However, to date, there are no recommendations on the immunological monitoring of patients treated in real life. The objectives of this workshop were to determine, based on data from the literature and the experience of the centers, the immunological analyses to be carried out in patients treated with CAR-T cells. The recommendations relate to the characterization of the patient's immune cells at the time of apheresis, the characterization of the injected CAR-T cells, as well as the monitoring of the CAR-T cells and other parameters of immune reconstitution in the patient after administration of the treatment. Harmonization of practices will allow clinical-biological correlation studies to be carried out in patients treated in real life with the aim of identifying factors predictive of response and toxicity.

To explore the factors important in LSC-mediated resistance, we use mass spectrometry to screen the factors related to LSC chemoresistance and defined IFN-gamma-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) as a candidate. We found that the GILT expression was upregulated in chemoresistant CD34+ AML cells. Loss of function studies demonstrated that silencing of GILT in AML cells sensitized them to Ara-C treatment both in vitro and in vivo. Further mechanistic findings revealed that the ROS-mediated mitochondrial damage plays a pivotal role in inducing apoptosis of GILT-inhibited AML cells after Ara-C treatment. The inactivation of PI3K/Akt/ nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway, causing reduced generation of antioxidants such as SOD2 and leading to a shifted ratio of GSH/GSSG to the oxidized form, contributed to the over-physiological oxidative status in the absence of GILT. The prognostic value of GILT was also validated in AML patients. Taken together, our work demonstrated that the inhibition of GILT increases AML chemo-sensitivity through elevating ROS level and induce oxidative mitochondrial damage-mediated apoptosis, and inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/NRF2 pathway enhances the intracellular oxidative state by disrupting redox homeostasis, providing a potentially effective way to overcome chemoresistance of AML.","['Niu, Li-Ting', 'Wang, Yu-Qing', 'Wong, Catherine C L', 'Gao, Shuai-Xin', 'Mo, Xiao-Dong', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Niu LT', 'Wang YQ', 'Wong CCL', 'Gao SX', 'Mo XD', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, 100044, China; Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing 100871."", 'Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing 100871,; Center for Precision Medicine Multi-Omics Research, Peking University Health Science Center, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China.; School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing 100191, China; Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034, China.', 'Center for Precision Medicine Multi-Omics Research, Peking University Health Science Center, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China.', ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, 100044, China; Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing 100871,.

Because only hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can self-renew, the size of the hematopoietic system is strictly controlled. In hematopoietic reconstitution experiments, 1 HSC can reconstitute the entire hematopoietic system, whereas 50 multipotent progenitors cannot. This indicates that only HSCs self-renew, whereas non-HSC hematopoietic progenitors are programmed to differentiate or senesce. Oncogenic mutations of the mixed lineage leukemia gene (MLL) overcome this ""programmed differentiation"" by conferring the self-renewing ability to non-HSC hematopoietic progenitors. In leukemia, mutated MLL proteins constitutively activate a broad range of previously transcribed CpG-rich promoters by an MLL-mediated transcriptional activation system. This system promotes self-renewal by replicating an expression profile similar to that of the mother cell in its daughter cells. In this transcriptional activation system, MLL binds to unmethylated CpG-rich promoters and recruits RNA polymerase II. MLL recruits p300/CBP through its transcriptional activation domain, which acetylates histone H3 at lysines 9, 18, and 27. The AF4 family/ENL family/P-TEFb complex (AEP) binds to acetylated H3K9/18/27 to activate transcription. Gene rearrangements of MLL with AEP- or CBP/p300-complex components generate constitutively active transcriptional machinery of this transcriptional activation system, which causes aberrant self-renewal of leukemia stem cells. Inhibitors of the components of this system effectively decrease their leukemogenic potential.","['Yokoyama, Akihiko']",['Yokoyama A'],"['Tsuruoka Metabolomics Laboratory, National Cancer Center, Tsuruoka, Japan.', 'National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5639-8068'],['eng'],"['19H03694/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', 'Yamagata Prefectural Government', 'City of Tsuruoka']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210802,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ELL protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '150826-18-9 (AFF1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (EP300 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.- (Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Self Renewal/genetics/*physiology', 'Cellular Senescence', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/metabolism', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/physiology', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors/metabolism']",PMC8486200,['NOTNLM'],"['leukemia', 'molecular therapy', 'self-renewal', 'transcriptional machinery']",2021/07/13 06:00,2021/10/08 06:00,['2021/07/12 13:14'],"['2021/07/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/08 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/12 13:14 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.15054 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2021 Oct;112(10):3935-3944. doi: 10.1111/cas.15054.

Oblimersen (G3139) is a phosphorothioate 18-mer antisense oligonucleotide directed against the first 6 BCL2 codons. In a phase 1 study of AML patients treated with G3139, cytarabine, and daunorubicin induction with cytarabine consolidation, no antisense-related toxicity was reported, and BCL2 downregulation occurred in patients achieving complete remission. In this phase 3 trial, untreated older AML patients were randomized to cytarabine (100 mg/m2 per day on days 4-10) and daunorubicin (60 mg/m2 per day on days 4-6) followed by cytarabine consolidation (2000 mg/m2 per day on days 4-8) with (arm A) or without (arm B) G3139 (7 mg/m2 per day on days 1-10 [induction] or days 1-8 [consolidation]). A total of 506 patients were enrolled. No differences in toxicity were observed between arms. Estimated overall survival (OS) at 1 year was 43% for arm A and 40% for arm B (1-sided log rank P = .13), with no differences in disease-free (DFS; P = .26) or event-free survival (P = .80). Subgroup analyses showed patients age <70 years in arm A had improved OS by 1 month vs those in arm B (P = .04), and patients with secondary AML in arm A had better DFS vs those in arm B (P = .04). We conclude that addition of G3139 to chemotherapy failed to improve outcomes of older AML patients. However, more effective means of inhibiting BCL2 are showing promising results in combination with chemotherapy in AML.

Despite some evidence about the role of mutant RPS15 (mostly obtained from the analysis of cell lines), the precise impact of RPS15 mutations on the translational program in primary CLL cells remains largely unexplored. Here, using RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling, a technique that involves measuring translational efficiency, we sought to obtain global insight into changes in translation induced by RPS15 mutations in CLL cells. To this end, we evaluated primary CLL cells from patients with wild-type or mutant RPS15 as well as MEC1 CLL cells transfected with mutant or wild-type RPS15. Our data indicate that RPS15 mutations rewire the translation program of primary CLL cells by reducing their translational efficiency, an effect not seen in MEC1 cells. In detail, RPS15 mutant primary CLL cells displayed altered translation efficiency of other ribosomal proteins and regulatory elements that affect key cell processes, such as the translational machinery and immune signaling, as well as genes known to be implicated in CLL, hence highlighting a relevant role for RPS15 in the natural history of CLL.","['Ntoufa, Stavroula', 'Gerousi, Marina', 'Laidou, Stamatia', 'Psomopoulos, Fotis', 'Tsiolas, Georgios', 'Moysiadis, Theodoros', 'Papakonstantinou, Nikos', 'Mansouri, Larry', 'Anagnostopoulos, Achilles', 'Stavrogianni, Niki', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Plevova, Karla', 'Makris, Antonios M', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas']","['Ntoufa S', 'Gerousi M', 'Laidou S', 'Psomopoulos F', 'Tsiolas G', 'Moysiadis T', 'Papakonstantinou N', 'Mansouri L', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Stavrogianni N', 'Pospisilova S', 'Plevova K', 'Makris AM', 'Rosenquist R', 'Stamatopoulos K']","['Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Computer Science, School of Sciences and Engineering, University of Nicosia, Nicosia, Cyprus.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology and HCT Unit, G.

There is no information on medication burden in pediatric cancer patients at the end of life (EOL). OBJECTIVES: To characterize medication burden during the last hospitalization in children dying from cancer. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study based on medical records of 90 children who died from cancer in hospital between 01 January 2010 and 30 December 2018. Demographic and clinical information were collected for the last hospitalization. We compared medication burden (number of medication orders) at hospitalization and at time of death and examined whether changes in medication burden were associated with clinical and demographic parameters. RESULTS: Median medication burden was higher in leukemia/lymphoma patients (6 orders) compared to solid (4 orders) or CNS tumor patients (4 orders, P = 0.006). Overall, the median number of prescriptions per patient did not change until death (P = 0.42), while there was a significant reduction for some medication subgroups (chemotherapy [P = 0.035], steroids [P = 0.010]).Patients dying in the ICU (n=15) had a higher medication burden at death (6 orders) than patients dying on wards (3 orders, P = 0.001). There was a trend for a reduction in medication burden in patients with ""Do not resuscitate"" (DNR) orders (P = 0.055). CONCLUSIONS: Polypharmacy is ubiquitous among pediatric oncology patients at EOL. Disease type and DNR status may affect medication burden and deprescribing during the last hospitalization.","['Tamir, Sharon', 'Kurnik, Daniel', 'Weyl Ben-Arush, Myriam', 'Postovsky, Sergey']","['Tamir S', 'Kurnik D', 'Weyl Ben-Arush M', 'Postovsky S']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Israel,Isr Med Assoc J,The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,100930740,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Steroids)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Critical Pathways/statistics & numerical data', 'Demography', 'Female', 'Health Services Research', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Israel/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', '*Palliative Care/methods/statistics & numerical data', '*Polypharmacy', 'Resuscitation Orders', 'Steroids/*therapeutic use', '*Terminal Care/methods/statistics & numerical data']",,,,2021/07/13 06:00,2021/07/23 06:00,['2021/07/12 09:09'],"['2021/07/12 09:09 [entrez]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Isr Med Assoc J. 2021 Jul;23(7):426-431.,426-431,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prevailing hypothesis regarding pathogenesis of childhood ALL was developed by Greaves, and states that ALL is caused by an abnormal immune response to a common infection. The response arises either due to naivety of the immune system caused by a lack of common childhood infections, or genetic susceptibility due to specific alleles. The former explanation is known as the delayed infection hypothesis. COVID-19 is a new infection that no children in the UK were exposed to prior to 2020. Furthermore, the lockdown measures designed to prevent spread of this virus have also greatly reduced spread of other common infections. It is therefore important to examine the evidence for this hypothesis, and to consider it in the context of the pandemic to determine what effect lockdown measures may have on incidence of ALL in children.","['Lillie, Katy']",['Lillie K'],"['University of Oxford, Medical Sciences Division, Oxford, UK.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5119-3709'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210712,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['COVID-19/*complications/transmission/virology', 'Child', 'Communicable Disease Control/*methods', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/virology', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2/*isolation & purification', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",PMC8441752,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*COVID-19', '*delayed infection hypothesis']",2021/07/13 06:00,2021/09/07 06:00,['2021/07/12 09:09'],"['2021/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/12 09:09 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.29194 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Oct;68(10):e29194. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29194.

The present study aimed to explore the correlation of lncRNA TUG1 with disease risk, disease condition, and prognosis of adult Ph(-) ALL. METHODS: Total 101 adult Ph(-) ALL patients and 40 bone marrow (BM) donors were included, followed by detection of BM monocyte cell lncRNA TUG1 expression by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. According to the quantiles of lncRNA TUG1 expression in Ph(-) ALL patients, these patients were divided into four tiers: tier 1 (ranked in 0%~25%), tier 2 (ranked in 25%~50%), tier 3 (ranked in 50%~75%), and tier 4 (ranked in 75%~100%). RESULTS: LncRNA TUG1 was upregulated in Ph(-) ALL patients compared with healthy donors. Further analysis indicated that in Ph(-) ALL patients, higher lncRNA TUG1 tier was correlated with the presence of central nervous system leukemia, increased white blood cell level, and bone marrow blasts. Furthermore, higher lncRNA TUG1 tier was negatively associated with complete remission (CR) within 4 weeks, total CR, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant achievement. In addition, higher lncRNA TUG1 tier was associated with decreased disease-free survival and overall survival, which was further verified to be an independent factor by Cox's regression analysis. CONCLUSION: lncRNA TUG1 presents potential to be a novel biomarker for disease risk assessment and survival surveillance in Ph(-) ALL management.","['Zeng, Pengyun', 'Chai, Ye', 'You, Chongge', 'Yue, Lingling', 'Wu, Chongyang', 'Chen, Huiling', 'Li, Liangliang', 'Li, Jingjing', 'Liu, Huan', 'Zhang, Yurong', 'Cao, Tingyong', 'Li, Yaru', 'Hu, Wanli']","['Zeng P', 'Chai Y', 'You C', 'Yue L', 'Wu C', 'Chen H', 'Li L', 'Li J', 'Liu H', 'Zhang Y', 'Cao T', 'Li Y', 'Hu W']","['Department of Hematology, Lanzhou University, Second Hospital, Lanzhou, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Lanzhou University, Second Hospital, Lanzhou, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Lanzhou University, Second Hospital, Lanzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Lanzhou University, Second Hospital, Lanzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Lanzhou University, Second Hospital, Lanzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Lanzhou University, Second Hospital, Lanzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Lanzhou University, Second Hospital, Lanzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Lanzhou University, Second Hospital, Lanzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Lanzhou University, Second Hospital, Lanzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Lanzhou University, Second Hospital, Lanzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Lanzhou University, Second Hospital, Lanzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Lanzhou University, Second Hospital, Lanzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Lanzhou University, Second Hospital, Lanzhou, China.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8148-9335'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210712,United States,J Clin Lab Anal,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (TUG1 long noncoding RNA, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/*genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC8373340,['NOTNLM'],"['Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'long non-coding RNA TUG1', 'reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction', 'survival', 'treatment response']",2021/07/13 06:00,2022/01/11 06:00,['2021/07/12 09:05'],"['2020/08/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/12 09:05 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcla.23583 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Lab Anal. 2021 Aug;35(8):e23583. doi: 10.1002/jcla.23583.

First and second-line therapies include purine nucleoside analogues (PNAs) and rituximab, but until recently, limited alternative options were available for patients with two or more relapses. AIM: The aim of this study is to describe our real-life experience with HCL patients in third and fourth-line therapies. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from 49 HCL patients with two or more relapses, including 16 patients with three or more relapses, were collected from the French retrospective HCL cohort covering the period from 1980 until 2011. They were analyzed to assess hematological response, relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) after third (L3) and fourth line (L4). The median age at diagnosis was 53 years. PNAs were the most frequently used treatments. As L3 therapy, 29 patients received PNAs (66%) and 15 (34%) other treatments (rituximab [11%] or interferon [7%] alone or in combination [16%]). The distribution of L4 treatments was similar. The overall hematological response rate (OHRR) after L3 was 97% (complete hematological response 86%) with a 40% five-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), a median RFS of 104 months, and a median OS of 235 months. After L4, the OHRR was 94% with a two-year CIR of fourth relapse of 27%. Eleven secondary cancers (5-year cumulative incidence of 12%) were diagnosed in 10 patients. Patients with >/=2 relapses experience frequent further relapses, with increasingly shorter time to next treatment as the number of treatment lines increases. Furthermore, treatment strategies are associated with substantial toxicities. CONCLUSION: All these points lead to the need for novel treatments.","['Paillassa, Jerome', 'Troussard, Xavier']","['Paillassa J', 'Troussard X']","['Department of Hematology, Academic Hospital of Angers, Angers, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Academic Hospital of Caen, Caen, France.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6863-9992'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210712,United States,Cancer Rep (Hoboken),"Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.)",101747728,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['HCL', 'OS', 'PNA', 'RFS', 'relapses']",2021/07/13 06:00,2021/07/13 06:00,['2021/07/12 06:22'],"['2021/05/26 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/12 06:22 [entrez]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cnr2.1495 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Cancer Rep (Hoboken). 2021 Jul 12:e1495. doi: 10.1002/cnr2.1495.,e1495,['(c) 2021 The Authors.

The incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia was reported in the range of 52.8%-57.7%. However, patients who develop neutropenia with this combination have yet to be formally characterized in the literature as it has impact on the clinical practice setting. AIM: To determine the incidence of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia and identify risk factors for neutropenia among CLL patients treated with the VenG regimen. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, single-center study of all adult patients with a diagnosis of CLL treated with VenG at the University of Colorado Hospital. Demographic information, laboratory data, clinical data, and medication prescriptions were collected from the patients' electronic medical record. RESULTS: A total of 14 patients (73%) developed neutropenia during the course of therapy. The mean time to neutropenia from the start of treatment was 42 days (range 1-131). Our cohort harbored more high risk disease features and more comorbidities (CIRS score of 12). Four patients (28.6%) in the neutropenic group developed infectious complications during therapy and 6 (31%) patients were unable to be dose escalated to the final FDA approved dose of 400 mg. CONCLUSION: Our study cohort had higher incidence of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia occurring in 73% of patients. This could be attributed to a higher rate of comorbidities, high risk features, concomitant interacting medications, and prior chemotherapy. Further studies are warranted to determine if growth factor support is efficacious to achieve dose escalation with this therapy.","['Samuels, Courtney', 'Abbott, Diana', 'Niemiec, Sierra', 'Tobin, Jennifer', 'Falco, Angela', 'Halsema, Keri', 'Kamdar, Manali']","['Samuels C', 'Abbott D', 'Niemiec S', 'Tobin J', 'Falco A', 'Halsema K', 'Kamdar M']","['Blood Disorders Center, University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, USA.', 'Center for Innovative Design and Analysis, Department of Biostatistics and Informatics, University of Colorado-Anschutz, Aurora, Colorado, USA.', 'Center for Innovative Design and Analysis, Department of Biostatistics and Informatics, University of Colorado-Anschutz, Aurora, Colorado, USA.', 'Blood Disorders Center, University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, USA.', 'Blood Disorders Center, University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, USA.', 'Blood Disorders Center, University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, USA.', 'Blood Disorders Center, University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, USA.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2028-0949', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6827-7730']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210712,United States,Cancer Rep (Hoboken),"Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.)",101747728,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'myelosuppression', 'pharmacotherapy', 'toxicity', 'venetoclax']",2021/07/13 06:00,2021/07/13 06:00,['2021/07/12 06:22'],"['2021/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/12 06:22 [entrez]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cnr2.1505 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Cancer Rep (Hoboken). 2021 Jul 12:e1505. doi: 10.1002/cnr2.1505.,e1505,['(c) 2021 The Authors.

However, the long-term clinical and economic impact of using bosutinib versus dasatinib and nilotinib has not been evaluated. The objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of bosutinib compared with dasatinib and bosutinib compared with nilotinib from a US payer perspective. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed using partition survival methods and three health states: progression-free, progression, and death. Trial data (individual patient-level and aggregate-level data) informed the progression-free and overall survival estimates. Costs included drugs and medical resource use. Utility values were obtained from literature. Sensitivity analyses (SAs) included one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs). RESULTS: Comparing bosutinib versus dasatinib resulted in a gain of 0.4 discounted life years, 1.5 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental costs of $28,459 (values in 2020 US dollars), for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $19,811/QALY gained. Comparing bosutinib versus nilotinib resulted in a gain of 0.8 discounted life-years, 1.8 QALYs, and incremental costs of $76,563, for an ICER of $41,932/QALY gained. Drug costs and extrapolation distribution type were the main drivers of the model in the one-way SAs. In the PSAs, bosutinib had >90% and >80% probabilities of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY versus dasatinib and nilotinib, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that compared with dasatinib and nilotinib, bosutinib may represent good value for money for treating 2L CP-CML patients.","['Muresan, B', 'Mamolo, C', 'Cappelleri, J C', 'Postma, M J', 'Heeg, B']","['Muresan B', 'Mamolo C', 'Cappelleri JC', 'Postma MJ', 'Heeg B']","['Ingress-health Netherlands, Weena 316-318, 3012 NJ, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Pfizer Inc, Groton, CT, USA.', 'Pfizer Inc, Groton, CT, USA.', 'Department of Health Sciences, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Economics, Econometrics and Finance, Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Ingress-health Netherlands, Weena 316-318, 3012 NJ, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. bart.heeg@ingress-health.com.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5321-561X'],['eng'],['Pfizer (US)'],['Journal Article'],20210712,New Zealand,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Applied health economics and health policy,101150314,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aniline Compounds', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Nitriles', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Quinolines']",PMC8545733,,,2021/07/13 06:00,2021/11/26 06:00,['2021/07/12 06:07'],"['2021/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/26 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/12 06:07 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40258-021-00666-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s40258-021-00666-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Appl Health Econ Health Policy. 2021 Nov;19(6):929-940. doi: 10.1007/s40258-021-00666-0.

To explore this potential, we have carried out in silico analysis of publicly available ALL datasets to identify genetic biomarkers for childhood BCP-ALL, which could be used either individually or in combination as markers for early detection, risk stratification, and prognosis. Methods: To explore novel genes that show promising clinical and molecular signatures, we examined the cBioPortal online tool for publicly available datasets on lymphoid cancers. Three studies on lymphoblastic and lymphoid leukemia with 1706 patients and 2144 samples of which were identified. Only B-Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma samples (n = 1978) were selected for further analysis. Chromosomal changes were assessed to determine novel genomic loci to analyze clinical and molecular profiles for the leukemia of lymphoid origin using cBioPortal tool. Results: ADAM6 gene homozygous deletions (HOM:DEL) were present in 59.60% of the profiled patients and were associated with poor ten years of overall patients' survival. Moreover, patients with ADAM6 HOM:DEL showed a distinguished clinical and molecular profile with higher Central Nervous System (CNS) sites of relapse. In addition, ADAM6 HOM:DEL was significantly associated with unique microRNAs gene expression patterns. Conclusion: ADAM6 has the potential to be a novel biomarker for the development and progress of BCP- ALL.","['Alsuwaidi, Laila', 'Hachim, Mahmood', 'Senok, Abiola']","['Alsuwaidi L', 'Hachim M', 'Senok A']","['College of Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.', 'College of Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.', 'Center for Genomic Discovery, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.', 'College of Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210625,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,PMC8269160,['NOTNLM'],"['ADAM6', 'acute lymphoid leukemia', 'bioinformactics analysis', 'biomarkers', 'pediatric leukemia']",2021/07/13 06:00,2021/07/13 06:01,['2021/07/12 05:57'],"['2021/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/12 05:57 [entrez]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.706129 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Jun 25;9:706129. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.706129. eCollection 2021.,706129,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Alsuwaidi, Hachim and Senok.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapy resistance significantly contributes towards failure of traditional and targeted treatments, disease relapse and mortality in AML patients. The mechanisms driving therapy resistance in AML are not fully understood, and approaches to overcome therapy resistance are important for curative therapies. To date, most studies have focused on therapy resistant mechanisms inherent to leukaemic cells (e.g., TP53 mutations), overlooking to some extent, acquired mechanisms of resistance through extrinsic processes. In the bone marrow microenvironment (BMME), leukaemic cells interact with the surrounding bone resident cells, driving acquired therapy resistance in AML. Growing evidence suggests that macrophages, highly plastic immune cells present in the BMME, play a role in the pathophysiology of AML. Leukaemia-supporting macrophage subsets (CD163(+)CD206(+)) are elevated in preclinical in vivo models of AML and AML patients. However, the relationship between macrophages and therapy resistance in AML warrants further investigation. In this review, we correlate the potential links between macrophages, the development of therapy resistance, and patient outcomes in AML. We specifically focus on macrophage reprogramming by AML cells, macrophage-driven activation of anti-cell death pathways in AML cells, and the association between macrophage phenotypes and clinical outcomes in AML, including their potential prognostic value. Lastly, we discuss therapeutic targeting of macrophages, as a strategy to circumvent therapy resistance in AML, and discuss how emerging genomic and proteomic-based approaches can be utilised to address existing challenges in this research field.","['Miari, Katerina E', 'Guzman, Monica L', 'Wheadon, Helen', 'Williams, Mark T S']","['Miari KE', 'Guzman ML', 'Wheadon H', 'Williams MTS']","['Charles Oakley Laboratories, Department of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Glasgow Caledonian University, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Cornell University, New York, NY, United States.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."", 'Charles Oakley Laboratories, Department of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Glasgow Caledonian University, Glasgow, United Kingdom.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210624,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,PMC8264427,['NOTNLM'],"['BMME', 'CD163+CD206+', 'M2-like macrophages', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'patient outcomes', 'therapy resistance']",2021/07/13 06:00,2021/07/13 06:01,['2021/07/12 05:57'],"['2021/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/12 05:57 [entrez]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.692800 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Jun 24;9:692800. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.692800. eCollection 2021.,692800,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Miari, Guzman, Wheadon and Williams.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prometastatic stimulus TGF-beta activates RHOJ transcription via megakaryocytic leukemia 1 (MKL1). The underlying epigenetic mechanism is not clear. Here, we report that MKL1 deficiency led to disrupted assembly of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex on the RHOJ promoter in breast cancer cells. This could be partially explained by histone H3K9/H3K27 methylation status. Further analysis confirmed that the H3K9/H3K27 dual demethylase JHDM1D/KDM7A was essential for TGF-beta-induced RHOJ transcription in breast cancer cells. MKL1 interacted with and recruited KDM7A to the RHOJ promoter to cooperatively activate RHOJ transcription. KDM7A knockdown attenuated migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro and mitigated the growth and metastasis of breast cancer cells in nude mice. KDM7A expression level, either singularly or in combination with that of RHOJ, could be used to predict prognosis in breast cancer patients. Of interest, KDM7A appeared to be a direct transcriptional target of TGF-beta signaling. A SMAD2/SMAD4 complex bound to the KDM7A promoter and mediated TGF-beta-induced KDM7A transcription. In conclusion, our data unveil a novel epigenetic mechanism whereby TGF-beta regulates the transcription of the prometastatic small GTPase RHOJ. Screening for small-molecule inhibitors of KDM7A may yield effective therapeutic solutions to treat malignant breast cancers.","['Zhang, Ziyu', 'Chen, Baoyu', 'Zhu, Yuwen', 'Zhang, Tianyi', 'Zhang, Xiaoling', 'Yuan, Yibiao', 'Xu, Yong']","['Zhang Z', 'Chen B', 'Zhu Y', 'Zhang T', 'Zhang X', 'Yuan Y', 'Xu Y']","['Department of Pathology, Jiangxi Maternal and Child Health Hospital, Nanchang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Targeted Invention of Cardiovascular Disease and Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Translational Medicine, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Targeted Invention of Cardiovascular Disease and Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Translational Medicine, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Targeted Invention of Cardiovascular Disease and Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Translational Medicine, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'School of Medicine, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Gynecology, Jiangxi Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital, Nanchang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Targeted Invention of Cardiovascular Disease and Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Translational Medicine, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Targeted Invention of Cardiovascular Disease and Collaborative Innovation Center for Cardiovascular Translational Medicine, Department of Pathophysiology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210623,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,PMC8262595,['NOTNLM'],"['*breast cancer cell', '*epigenetics', '*histone demethylase', '*histone methylation', '*transcriptional regulation']",2021/07/13 06:00,2021/07/13 06:01,['2021/07/12 05:57'],"['2021/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/12 05:57 [entrez]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.664375 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Jun 23;9:664375. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.664375. eCollection 2021.,664375,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhang, Chen, Zhu, Zhang, Yuan, Zhang and Xu.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,['Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Jul 19;9:729416.

The FIP1L1-RARA fusion gene has recently been reported as a novel RARA-associated fusion gene. Objectives: We report a case of de novo myeloid sarcoma (MS) type of APL with FIP1L1-RARA found by next-generation sequencing (NGS) that was not detected by conventional analyze analysis for RARA translocations. Methods: We performed typical morphological, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), conventional tests for PML-RARA dual-fusion translocation probe, high-through sequencing and NGS. Meanwhile, bioinformatics analyses were done by using public repositories, including ONCOMINE, COSMIC, and GeneMANIA analysis. Results: A 28-month-old girl with a complex karyotype that includes 46,XX,t(4;17)(q12;q22)[9]/46,idem,del(16)(q22)[3]/45,idem,-x,-4,-9,-15,del(16)(q2 2),+marl,+mar2,+mar3[7]/46,xx[3], c.38G>A (p.Gly13Asp) in the KRAS gene, and a cryptic insertion of RARA gene into the FIP1L1 gene was diagnosed with APL complicated by the de novo MS. Conclusion: We report a FIP1L1-RARA fusion in a child with APL who presented with an extramedullary tumor in the skull without the classic karyotype using NGS, whom we treated with good results. NGS analysis should be considered for APL variant cases. Further experimental studies to the association between the mutation in KRAS gene and FIP1L1-RARA fusion on the clinical phenotype and progression of APL are needed to identify more effective therapeutic targets for APL.","['Wang, Yongren', 'Rui, Yaoyao', 'Shen, Ying', 'Li, Jian', 'Liu, Poning', 'Lu, Qin', 'Fang, Yongjun']","['Wang Y', 'Rui Y', 'Shen Y', 'Li J', 'Liu P', 'Lu Q', 'Fang Y']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', ""Department of Gastroenterology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210624,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC8264125,['NOTNLM'],"['FIP1L1-RARA fusion', 'KRAS gene', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'bioinformatic analyses', 'myeloid sarcoma', 'next-generation sequencing']",2021/07/13 06:00,2021/07/13 06:01,['2021/07/12 05:56'],"['2021/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/12 05:56 [entrez]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.688203 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Jun 24;11:688203. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.688203. eCollection 2021.,688203,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Wang, Rui, Shen, Li, Liu, Lu and Fang.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) can be described as a BCR-ABL1 (Philadelphia chromosome)-negative myeloproliferative neoplastic disease with various genetic mutations that may directly or indirectly play a role in its pathogenesis. A well-established mutation in CNL is the CSF3R (a cytokine receptor) which has been incorporated into the diagnostic criteria for the disease. However, evidence of other mutations such as SETBP1, ASXL1, and TET2 has also shed more light on the pathogenesis of this condition. Due to the unknown incidence and heterogeneous presentation of the disease, the diagnosis and management are often difficult and lack satisfactory data. The purpose of this review is to yield further insight into a disease that lacks awareness in the medical community. Using PubMed as a database, relevant studies and case reports were reviewed. The data compiled were used to acknowledge the disease in terms of etiology, clinical manifestation, molecular pathogenesis, and available treatment modalities. Though existing treatment modalities have been shown to induce clinical improvement, the outcomes are not reliable, and further research is required to reach a comprehensive ""standard of care"" for the disease.","['Anil, Vishwanath', 'Gosal, Harpreet', 'Kaur, Harsimran', 'Chakwop Ngassa, Hyginus', 'Elmenawi, Khaled A', 'Mohammed, Lubna']","['Anil V', 'Gosal H', 'Kaur H', 'Chakwop Ngassa H', 'Elmenawi KA', 'Mohammed L']","['Internal Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, Emergency Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.', 'Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.', 'Surgery, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.', 'Surgery, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210603,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,,,PMC8253489,['NOTNLM'],"['asxl1', 'chronic neutrophilic leukemia', 'csf3r', 'jak-stat', 'myeloproliferative disorder', 'setbp1']",2021/07/13 06:00,2021/07/13 06:01,['2021/07/12 05:54'],"['2021/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/12 05:54 [entrez]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.15433 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Jun 3;13(6):e15433. doi: 10.7759/cureus.15433. eCollection 2021 Jun.,e15433,"['Copyright (c) 2021, Anil et al.']",,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It describes the simultaneous presence of anemia, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia. Attempts to identify the correct etiology and gauging the severity of pancytopenia will help to determine the management and prognosis of the patients. Objectives To study etio-hematological profile, clinical correlates and outcome of pancytopenia in Indian children Methods This prospective observational study of children with pancytopenia was conducted at a tertiary care center from August 2015 to July 2016. Clinical, hematological and bone marrow studies were performed and patients were followed for one year. The collected data were statistically analyzed. Results Out of 84 cases, the mean age at diagnosis was 70 (70.77+/-4.8) months. Bone marrows showed aplastic changes in 37% and hyperplasia in 14% of patients. In our study, most common causes were aplastic anemia, acute leukemia and nutritional anemia. During the first year of follow-up, 67% pancytopenics survived and 12% succumbed (rest discontinued treatment) with ~26% of aplastic anemia (7/27 cases) and 9% of acute leukemia (2/22 cases) not surviving. Anthropometric status of patients and severity in aplastic anemia were significantly associated (p < 0.05) with outcome. Conclusion The data gathered support a complex picture for pancytopenia in our study population since both benign nutritional deficiencies and malignant hematological neoplasms were common. Bone marrow studies seem to be of salient use in delineating etiology. As the outcome is multifactorial, factors like anthropometry, hematological parameters have a bearing on prognosis.","['Alim, Muniba', 'Verma, Nishant', 'Kumar, Archana', 'Pooniya, Vishal', 'Abdul Rahman, Rafey']","['Alim M', 'Verma N', 'Kumar A', 'Pooniya V', 'Abdul Rahman R']","[""Pediatrics, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, IND."", 'Clinical Hematology, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, IND.', 'Pediatrics, Uttar Pradesh University of Medical Sciences, Etawah, IND.', ""Pediatrics, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, IND."", ""Pediatrics, Era's Lucknow Medical College and Hospital, Lucknow, IND."", ""Pediatrics, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, IND."", ""Pediatrics, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, IND."", 'Pediatric Surgery, Uttar Pradesh University of Medical Sciences, Etawah, IND.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210602,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,,,PMC8253459,['NOTNLM'],"['aplastic anemia', 'etiology', 'hematology', 'pancytopenia', 'pediatrics']",2021/07/13 06:00,2021/07/13 06:01,['2021/07/12 05:54'],"['2021/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/12 05:54 [entrez]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.15382 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Jun 2;13(6):e15382. doi: 10.7759/cureus.15382. eCollection 2021 Jun.,e15382,"['Copyright (c) 2021, Alim et al.']",,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blinatumomab, as a CD3/CD19 bispecific antibody, can yield a profound response via redirecting T cells towards malignant lymphoblasts in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). We aimed to assess the feasibility of blinatumomab in treating patients with HLA loss relapse after haplo-HSCT. Four eligible patients undergoing HLA loss relapse after haplo-HSCT were enrolled in the study. Four patients achieved a complete remission/complete remission with partial he-matologic recovery (CR/CRh) with three minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative response within the first cycle of treatment. Three of the four met a primary endpoint with CR/CRh and MRD-negative response within 2 cycles of treatment. One patient developed new extramedullary sites of skin after the first cycle. Cytokine release syndrome was observed in one patient. Cytopenias, as well as elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, were two common adverse effects during treatment. By redirecting lysis of CD19-positive lymphoblast who losing the incompatible HLA, blinatumomab is a potential strategy to eradicate malignant cells via restoring GVL effects. A randomized clinical trial assessing blinatumomab in patients with HLA loss relapse after HSCT is warranted.","['Wu, Hengwei', 'Cai, Zhen', 'Shi, Jimin', 'Luo, Yi', 'Huang, He', 'Zhao, Yanmin']","['Wu H', 'Cai Z', 'Shi J', 'Luo Y', 'Huang H', 'Zhao Y']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Zhejiang Laboratory for Systems & Precision Medicine, Zhejiang University Medical Center Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Zhejiang Laboratory for Systems & Precision Medicine, Zhejiang University Medical Center Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Zhejiang Laboratory for Systems & Precision Medicine, Zhejiang University Medical Center Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Zhejiang Laboratory for Systems & Precision Medicine, Zhejiang University Medical Center Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Zhejiang Laboratory for Systems & Precision Medicine, Zhejiang University Medical Center Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Zhejiang Laboratory for Systems & Precision Medicine, Zhejiang University Medical Center Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210615,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,,,,PMC8263683,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'HLA loss relapse', 'blinatumomab']",2021/07/13 06:00,2021/07/13 06:01,['2021/07/12 05:53'],"['2021/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/12 05:53 [entrez]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2021 Jun 15;11(6):3111-3122. eCollection 2021.,3111-3122,['AJCR Copyright (c) 2021.'],,,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, several targeted therapies have become available for specific AML populations. To identify potential new therapeutic targets for AML, we analyzed published genome wide CRISPR-based screens to generate a gene essentiality dataset across a panel of 14 human AML cell lines while eliminating common essential genes through integration analysis with core fitness genes among 324 human cancer cell lines and DepMap databases. The key glutathione metabolic enzyme, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), met the selection threshold. Using CRISPR knockout, GCLC was confirmed to be essential for the cell growth, survival, clonogenicity, and leukemogenesis in AML cells but was comparatively dispensable for normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), indicating that GCLC is a potential therapeutic target for AML. In addition, we evaluated the essentiality of GCLC in solid tumors and demonstrated that GCLC represents a synthetic lethal target for ARID1A-deficient ovarian and gastric cancers.","['Lin, Chiou-Hong', 'Vu, John P', 'Yang, Chen-Yen', 'Sirisawad, Mint', 'Chen, Chun-Te', 'Dao, Hung', 'Liu, Jing', 'Ma, Xuan', 'Pan, Chin', 'Cefalu, Joseph', 'Tse, Chris', 'Jackson, Erica', 'Kuo, Hsu-Ping']","['Lin CH', 'Vu JP', 'Yang CY', 'Sirisawad M', 'Chen CT', 'Dao H', 'Liu J', 'Ma X', 'Pan C', 'Cefalu J', 'Tse C', 'Jackson E', 'Kuo HP']","['AbbVie Oncology Discovery Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USA.', 'AbbVie Oncology Discovery Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USA.', 'AbbVie Oncology Discovery Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USA.', 'AbbVie Oncology Discovery Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USA.', 'AbbVie Oncology Discovery Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USA.', 'AbbVie Oncology Discovery Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USA.', 'AbbVie Oncology Discovery Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USA.', 'AbbVie Oncology Discovery Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USA.', 'AbbVie Oncology Discovery Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USA.', 'AbbVie Oncology Discovery Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USA.', 'AbbVie Oncology Discovery North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'AbbVie Oncology Discovery Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USA.', 'AbbVie Oncology Discovery Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USA.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210615,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,,,,PMC8263632,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'CRISPR', 'glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC)', 'glutathione metabolic enzyme', 'synthetic lethality']",2021/07/13 06:00,2021/07/13 06:01,['2021/07/12 05:53'],"['2021/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/12 05:53 [entrez]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2021 Jun 15;11(6):2911-2927. eCollection 2021.,2911-2927,['AJCR Copyright (c) 2021.'],,,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spatial analysis has been previously used for the study of childhood cancer to study the geographical distribution of leukemias. This study aimed to identify the presence of space-time clusters of childhood of cancer excluding leukemia in Colombia between 2014 and 2017. Methods: All incident cancer cases (excluding leukemia) in children under the age of 15 years that had been confirmed by the National Surveillance System of Childhood Cancer between 2014 and 2017 were included. Kulldorf's circular scan test was used to identify clusters using the municipality of residence as the spatial unit of analysis and the year of diagnosis as the temporal unit of analysis. A sensitivity analysis was conducted with different upper limit parameters for the at-risk population in the clusters. Results: A total of 2006 cases of non-leukemia childhood cancer were analyzed, distributed in 432 out of 1,122 municipalities with a mean annual incidence rate of 44 cases per million children under the age of 15. Central nervous system (CNS) tumors were the most frequent type. Two space-time clusters were identified in the central and southwest regions of the country. In the analysis for CNS tumors, a spatial cluster was identified in the central region of the country. Conclusions: The distribution of non-leukemia childhood cancer seems to have a clustered distribution in some Colombian regions that may suggest infectious or environmental factors associated with its incidence although heterogeneity in access to diagnosis cannot be discarded.","['Manrique-Hernandez, Edgar F', 'Rojas Diaz, Marcela Pilar', 'Rodriguez-Villamizar, Laura Andrea']","['Manrique-Hernandez EF', 'Rojas Diaz MP', 'Rodriguez-Villamizar LA']","['Public Health Department, School of Medicine, Universidad Industrial de Santander.

As such CDK6 regulates cell survival or cytokine secretion together with STATs, AP-1 or NF-kappaB. In the hematopoietic system, CDK6 regulates T cell development and promotes leukemia and lymphoma. CDK4/6 kinase inhibitors are FDA approved for treatment of breast cancer patients and have been reported to enhance T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. The involvement of CDK6 in T cell functions remains enigmatic. We here investigated the role of CDK6 in CD8+ T cells, using previously generated CDK6 knockout (Cdk6 (-/-)) and kinase-dead mutant CDK6 (Cdk6 (K43M)) knock-in mice. RNA-seq analysis indicated a role of CDK6 in T cell metabolism and interferon (IFN) signaling. To investigate whether these CDK6 functions are T cell-intrinsic, we generated a T cell-specific CDK6 knockout mouse model (Cdk6 (fl/fl) CD4-Cre). T cell-intrinsic loss of CDK6 enhanced mitochondrial respiration in CD8+ T cells, but did not impact on cytotoxicity and production of the effector cytokines IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha by CD8+ T cells in vitro. Loss of CDK6 in peripheral T cells did not affect tumor surveillance of MC38 tumors in vivo. Similarly, while we observed an impaired induction of early responses to type I IFN in CDK6-deficient CD8+ T cells, we failed to observe any differences in the response to LCMV infection upon T cell-intrinsic loss of CDK6 in vivo. This apparent contradiction might at least partially be explained by the reduced expression of Socs1, a negative regulator of IFN signaling, in CDK6-deficient CD8+ T cells. Therefore, our data are in line with a dual role of CDK6 in IFN signaling; while CDK6 promotes early IFN responses, it is also involved in the induction of a negative feedback loop. These data assign CDK6 a role in the fine-tuning of cytokine responses.","['Klein, Klara', 'Witalisz-Siepracka, Agnieszka', 'Gotthardt, Dagmar', 'Agerer, Benedikt', 'Locker, Felix', 'Grausenburger, Reinhard', 'Knab, Vanessa Maria', 'Bergthaler, Andreas', 'Sexl, Veronika']","['Klein K', 'Witalisz-Siepracka A', 'Gotthardt D', 'Agerer B', 'Locker F', 'Grausenburger R', 'Knab VM', 'Bergthaler A', 'Sexl V']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Physiology and Microbiology, Division Pharmacology, Karl Landsteiner University of Health Sciences, Krems, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Physiology, Pathophysiology and Biophysics, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210624,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*immunology/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus/immunology/physiology', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/immunology']",PMC8264666,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD8+ T cells', '*CDK6', '*anti-tumor response', '*anti-viral response', '*interferon signaling', '*metabolism', '*suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)']",2021/07/13 06:00,2021/09/28 06:00,['2021/07/12 05:47'],"['2021/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/12 05:47 [entrez]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.650977 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Jun 24;12:650977. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.650977. eCollection 2021.,650977,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Klein, Witalisz-Siepracka, Gotthardt, Agerer, Locker,', 'Grausenburger, Knab, Bergthaler and Sexl.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior data have reported that aberrant glucose metabolism by GLUT4 dysfunction in the uterus could be responsible for infertility and increased miscarriage. However, the expression and precise functions of GLUT4 in the endometrium under physiological conditions remain unknown or controversial. In this study, we observed that GLUT4 exhibits a spatiotemporal expression in mouse uterus on pregnant days 1-4; its expression especially increased on pregnant day 4 during the window of implantation. We also determined that estrogen, in conjunction with progesterone, promotes the expression of GLUT4 in the endometrial epithelium in vivo or in vitro. GLUT4 is an important transporter that mediates glucose transport in endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) in vitro or in vivo. In vitro, glucose uptake decreased in mouse EECs when the cells were treated with GLUT4 small interfering RNA (siRNA). In vivo, the injection of GLUT4-siRNA into one side of the mouse uterine horns resulted in an increased glucose concentration in the uterine fluid on pregnant day 4, although it was still lower than in blood, and impaired endometrial receptivity by inhibiting pinopode formation and the expressions of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and integrin alphanubeta3, finally affecting embryonic development and implantation. Overall, the obtained results indicate that GLUT4 in the endometrial epithelium affects embryo development by altering glucose concentration in the uterine fluid. It can also affect implantation by impairing endometrial receptivity due to dysfunction of GLUT4.","['Long, Yun', 'Wang, Yi-Cheng', 'Yuan, Dong-Zhi', 'Dai, Xin-Hua', 'Liao, Lin-Chuan', 'Zhang, Xue-Qin', 'Zhang, Li-Xue', 'Ma, Yong-Dan', 'Lei, Yi', 'Cui, Zhi-Hui', 'Zhang, Jin-Hu', 'Nie, Li', 'Yue, Li-Min']","['Long Y', 'Wang YC', 'Yuan DZ', 'Dai XH', 'Liao LC', 'Zhang XQ', 'Zhang LX', 'Ma YD', 'Lei Y', 'Cui ZH', 'Zhang JH', 'Nie L', 'Yue LM']","['Department of Physiology, West China School of Basic Medical Sciences and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Physiology, Chongqing Three Gorges Medical College, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Physiology, West China School of Basic Medical Sciences and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Physiology, West China School of Basic Medical Sciences and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'West China School of Basic Medical Sciences and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'West China School of Basic Medical Sciences and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Physiology, West China School of Basic Medical Sciences and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Physiology, West China School of Basic Medical Sciences and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Physiology, West China School of Basic Medical Sciences and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Physiology, West China School of Basic Medical Sciences and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Physiology, West China School of Basic Medical Sciences and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Physiology, West China School of Basic Medical Sciences and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Physiology, West China School of Basic Medical Sciences and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Physiology, West China School of Basic Medical Sciences and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210625,Switzerland,Front Physiol,Frontiers in physiology,101549006,,,,PMC8267529,['NOTNLM'],"['embryonic development', 'endometrial epithelium', 'glucose transporter 4', 'implantation', 'uterine receptivity']",2021/07/13 06:00,2021/07/13 06:01,['2021/07/12 05:46'],"['2021/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/12 05:46 [entrez]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphys.2021.674924 [doi]'],epublish,Front Physiol. 2021 Jun 25;12:674924. doi: 10.3389/fphys.2021.674924. eCollection 2021.,674924,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Long, Wang, Yuan, Dai, Liao, Zhang, Zhang, Ma, Lei, Cui,', 'Zhang, Nie and Yue.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly immunosuppressive and deadly malignant tumor with poor responses to immunotherapies. Although CAR-T therapeutic strategies were used for glioma in preclinical trials, the current proliferation activity of CAR-T is not sufficient, and malignant glioma usually recruit immunosuppressive cells to form a tumor microenvironment that hinders CAR-T infiltration, depletes CAR-T, and impairs their efficacy. Moreover, specific environments such as hypoxia and nutritional deficiency can hinder the killing effect of CAR-T, limiting their therapeutic effect. The normal brain lack lymphocytes, but CAR-T usually can recognize specific antigens and regulate the tumor immune microenvironment to increase and decrease pro- and anti-inflammatory factors, respectively. This increases the number of T cells and ultimately enhances anti-tumor effects. CAR-T therapy has become an indispensable modality for glioma due to the specific tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). This review describes the characteristics of CAR-T specific antigen recognition and changing tumor immune microenvironment, as well as ongoing research into CAR-T therapy targeting TAAs in GBM and their potential clinical application.","['Zhu, Guidong', 'Zhang, Qing', 'Zhang, Junwen', 'Liu, Fusheng']","['Zhu G', 'Zhang Q', 'Zhang J', 'Liu F']","['Brain Tumor Research Center, Beijing Neurosurgical Institute, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Beijing Tiantan Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Laboratory of Biomedical Materials, Beijing, China.', 'Shandong Second Provincial General Hospital, Shandong Provincial ENT Hospital, Jinan, China.', 'Brain Tumor Research Center, Beijing Neurosurgical Institute, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Beijing Tiantan Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Laboratory of Biomedical Materials, Beijing, China.', 'Brain Tumor Research Center, Beijing Neurosurgical Institute, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Beijing Tiantan Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Laboratory of Biomedical Materials, Beijing, China.', 'Brain Tumor Research Center, Beijing Neurosurgical Institute, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Beijing Tiantan Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Laboratory of Biomedical Materials, Beijing, China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210624,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC8264285,['NOTNLM'],"['car-t', 'glioblastoma', 'immunotherapy', 'targeted therapy', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor-associated antigen']",2021/07/13 06:00,2021/07/13 06:01,['2021/07/12 05:46'],"['2021/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/12 05:46 [entrez]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2021.661606 [doi]', '661606 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2021 Jun 24;12:661606. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2021.661606. eCollection 2021.,661606,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhu, Zhang, Zhang and Liu.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Physical examination showed hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. A blood count revealed white blood cell count of 38.2 x 10(9)/L with 51.5% blast cells. Bone marrow aspirate showed total cell count of 145 x 10(3)/muL with 80.6% blast cells and negative neutrophil myeloperoxidase staining. Cytogenetic analysis using fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed a 9;22 chromosomal translocation, indicating the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated expression of CD10, CD19, and positive TdT. According to morphology, immunology, cytogenetics, and molecular criteria, the patient was diagnosed as having Philadelphia chromosome-positive lymphoid blast crisis of CML. Based on the ocular findings and hematological abnormalities, the SRD was considered to be ocular involvement secondary to the blast crisis of leukemia. Two months after starting induction therapy, fundus examination and optical coherence tomography showed complete resolution of bilateral SRD and improved vision.

Unveiling the pathway from stem cells to the various lineages helps us understand the blood disorders and develop therapies for them. We have studied the developmental pathway of hematopoiesis for decades and found that myeloid potential is retained just before the differentiation into each lineage of the various lineage progenitors. This uniqueness of myeloid cells might reflect the character of mixed-phenotype leukemia and provide a very important clue in determining the evolutional history of blood cells. Recent studies concerning the differentiation pathways of megakaryocytes and granulocytes as well as the findings on the hemocytes of invertebrates have strongly supported the concept of the uniqueness of myeloid cells and enabled us to propose insights into the evolutional history of blood.

However, the incidence of relapse after allo-HSCT remains high at approximately 40%, and treatment options for patients with ATLL who have relapsed disease after allo-HSCT are limited. Accumulating evidence shows that mogamulizumab or lenalidomide use for relapsed disease even after allo-HSCT might have advantages with effects similar to that of GvATLL.

Although HCT is recommended to be performed after complete remission, there are cases in which HCT is performed in non-remission status. Although the outcomes of HCT for non-remission AML have been very poor, the subjects in these studies had heterogeneous backgrounds in terms of relapsed, refractory, and untreated AML. In this review article, non-remission AML is classified into the following two categories: refractory/relapsed AML and untreated AML. Recent advances in HCT for non-remission AML, such as prognostic factors and pre and postHCT interventions, have been summarized. In the preHCT setting, preHCT tumor burden was confirmed to be the primary prognostic factor. Preconditioning intervention that successfully eliminated blasts in the peripheral blood was associated with better outcomes after HCT. PostHCT maintenance therapy may be one of the treatment options after HCT. Even in untreated AML, lower tumor burden at HCT was associated with superior outcomes after HCT. With the primary significance of tumor control before and after HCT, it is crucial to establish a comprehensive strategy for HCT in the non-remission stage, including preHCT and postHCT interventions.","['Tachibana, Takayoshi']",['Tachibana T'],"['Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center.']",,['jpn'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,,IM,"['*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'Not in remission']",2021/07/13 06:00,2021/07/14 06:00,['2021/07/12 05:37'],"['2021/07/12 05:37 [entrez]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.62.496 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2021;62(5):496-504. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.62.496.,496-504,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The conventional minimal residual disease (MRD) test of the bone marrow has serious limitations regarding invasiveness and applicability. To address this problem, we investigated the utility of a novel MRD test using tumor-derived fragmentary DNA, or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for the identification of patients with high risk of AML/MDS relapse after undergoing myeloablative allo HSCT. We retrospectively collected tumor specimens and available matched serum samples at diagnosis and at 1 and 3 months post-allo HSCT from 53 patients with AML/MDS. After identifying driver mutations in 51 patients using next-generation sequencing, we designed at least one personalized digital polymerase chain reaction assay per case. Diagnostic ctDNA and matched tumor DNA exhibited excellent correlations with variant allele frequencies. Sixteen patients relapsed after a median of 7 months post allo HSCT. Both the mutation persistence in the bone marrow at 1 and 3 months post allo HSCT and the corresponding ctDNA persistence in the matched serum were comparably associated with higher 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse rates. These results demonstrate, for the first time, the utility of ctDNA as a noninvasive prognostic biomarker in patients with AML/MDS who underwent allo HSCT.","['Yokoyama, Kazuaki']",['Yokoyama K'],"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Hospital, The Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo.']",,['jpn'],,['Journal Article'],,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,['0 (Circulating Tumor DNA)'],IM,"['*Circulating Tumor DNA', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/therapy', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Circulating tumor DNA', 'Driver mutation', 'Droplet digital PCR', 'Next-generation sequencing']",2021/07/13 06:00,2021/07/14 06:00,['2021/07/12 05:37'],"['2021/07/12 05:37 [entrez]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.62.486 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2021;62(5):486-495. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.62.486.,486-495,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, childhood cancer survivors are at risk of AKI-chronic kidney disease transition. Thus, early diagnosis of AKI is crucial. This study aimed to elucidate the incidence of AKI in patients undergoing chemotherapy for pediatric ALL/LBL and to compare the usefulness of serum cystatin C (CysC)- and creatinine (Cr)-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as diagnostic measures. Data of 16 patients with ALL/LBL treated with a total of 75 courses of chemotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. CysC- and Cr-based eGFR were measured before and three times per week during therapy. To calculate the eGFR, an equation for Japanese children was used. AKI was diagnosed when eGFR dropped by >/= 25% from the highest eGFR value obtained during the latest 2 weeks since the start of chemotherapy. AKI was graded based on the pediatric Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End Stage Renal Disease scale. All patients developed AKI during chemotherapy; however, more than 90% of the cases were mild and eventually recovered. No significant differences were found in the incidence of AKI between CysC- and Cr-based eGFR (p = 0.104). The median time to AKI diagnosis was significantly shorter in the CysC-based eGFR than in the Cr-based eGFR (8 vs. 17 days, p < 0.001). In this study, all patients with pediatric ALL/LBL could develop mild AKI during treatment. CysC-based eGFR is a more effective measure than Cr-based eGFR for the early diagnosis of AKI.","['Yamazoe, Takashi', 'Akagawa, Shohei', 'Matsuno, Ryosuke', 'Akagawa, Yuko', 'Yamanouchi, Sohsaku', 'Omachi, Taichi', 'Kimata, Takahisa', 'Tsuji, Shoji', 'Kaneko, Kazunari']","['Yamazoe T', 'Akagawa S', 'Matsuno R', 'Akagawa Y', 'Yamanouchi S', 'Omachi T', 'Kimata T', 'Tsuji S', 'Kaneko K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kansai Medical University.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kansai Medical University.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kansai Medical University.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kansai Medical University.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kansai Medical University.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kansai Medical University.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kansai Medical University.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kansai Medical University.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kansai Medical University.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Japan,Tohoku J Exp Med,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,0417355,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cystatin C)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)']",IM,"['*Acute Kidney Injury/diagnosis/etiology', 'Biomarkers', 'Child', 'Creatinine', 'Cystatin C', 'Early Detection of Cancer', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute kidney injury', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'creatinine', 'cystatin C']",2021/07/13 06:00,2022/01/18 06:00,['2021/07/12 05:37'],"['2021/07/12 05:37 [entrez]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1620/tjem.254.163 [doi]'],ppublish,Tohoku J Exp Med. 2021 Jul;254(3):163-170. doi: 10.1620/tjem.254.163.,163-170,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is characterized by a sudden onset of heart failure before or after delivery. Previous studies revealed that the generation of a 16-kDa PRL (prolactin) metabolite, the subsequent upregulation of miR-146a, and the downregulation of the target gene Erbb4 is a common driving factor of PPCM. METHODS: miRNA profiling was performed in plasma of PPCM patients (n=33) and postpartum-matched healthy CTRLs (controls; n=36). Elevated miRNAs in PPCM plasma, potentially targeting ERBB4 (erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4), were overexpressed in cardiomyocytes using lentiviral vectors. Next, cardiac function, cardiac morphology, and PPCM phenotype were investigated after recurrent pregnancies of HZ (heterozygous) cardiomyocyte-specific Erbb4 mice (Erbb4(F/+) alphaMHC-Cre(+), n=9) with their age-matched nonpregnant CTRLs (n=9-10). RESULTS: Here, we identify 9 additional highly conserved miRNAs (miR-199a-5p and miR-199a-3p, miR-145a-5p, miR-130a-3p, miR-135a-5p, miR-221-3p, miR-222-3p, miR-23a-3p, and miR19b-3p) that target tyrosine kinase receptor ERBB4 and are over 4-fold upregulated in plasma of PPCM patients at the time of diagnosis. We confirmed that miR-146a, miR-199a-5p, miR-221-3p, miR-222-3p, miR-23a-3p, miR-130a-5p, and miR-135-3p overexpression decreases ERBB4 expression in cardiomyocytes (-29% to -50%; P<0.05). In addition, we demonstrate that genetic cardiomyocyte-specific downregulation of Erbb4 during pregnancy suffices to induce a variant of PPCM in mice, characterized by left ventricular dilatation (postpartum second delivery: left ventricular internal diameter in diastole, +19+/-7% versus HZ-CTRL; P<0.05), increased atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels (4-fold increase versus HZ-CTRL mice, P<0.001), decreased VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and VE-cadherin levels (-33+/-17%, P=0.07; -27+/-20%, P<0.05 versus HZ-CTRL), and histologically enlarged cardiomyocytes (+20+/-21%, versus HZ-CTRL, P<0.05) but without signs of myocardial apoptosis and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: ERBB4 is essential to protect the maternal heart from peripartum stress. Downregulation of ERBB4 in cardiomyocytes induced by multiple miRNAs in the peripartum period may be crucial in PPCM pathophysiology.

METHODS: EDTA-K2 anticoagulation venous blood was collected for blood routine and morphological analysis of blood cells; bone marrow was extracted for cell morphology, immunophenotype, chromosome karyotype and fusion gene analysis. RESULTS: White blood cell count was 12.3x 10(9)/L, hemoglobin was 73 g/L, and platelet count was 13x 10(9)/L. The morphological analysis of blood cells showed that the size of immature cells was like that of primitive immature lymphocytes, which was circular or irregular and part of them with obvious pseudopodia. The cytoplasm is basophilic with heterogeneous coloration and granules. Nuclear chromatin is fine and even, 1-3 nucleoli can be seen, these immature cells account for about 40%; the morphology of bone marrow cells was consistent with acute leukemia, negative for peroxidase staining, negative for AS-DNCE staining and alpha-NBE staining. Flow cytometry results showed that the protocells account for about 52% and significant expression of megakaryocytes related markers (cCD41+, CD61+, CD36+). Chromosome karyotype is 46, XX, der(3) add(3)(p21)add(3)(q25), add (9)(q22), -13, +mar [4]/46, XX, del(13)(q12q22) [3]/46, XX[3]. The fusion gene WT1 was overexpressed, MLL-PTD and EVI1 were positive. CONCLUSION: Acute megakaryocytic leukemia has unique and complex phenotypic and genetics characteristics.","['Zhao, Liping', 'Chen, Xing', 'Li, Manjiang', 'Deng, Huanliang']","['Zhao L', 'Chen X', 'Li M', 'Deng H']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine/Institute of Medical Genetics, Zhuhai Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital, Zhuhai, Guangdong 519000, China. 1403801042@qq.com.']",,['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,9425197,"['0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (MLL-PTD fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', '*Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/genetics', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Megakaryocytes', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'WT1 Proteins']",,,,2021/07/12 06:00,2021/07/14 06:00,['2021/07/11 21:01'],"['2021/07/11 21:01 [entrez]', '2021/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['940638145 [pii]', '10.3760/cma.j.cn511374-20200826-00625 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2021 Jul 10;38(7):690-693. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn511374-20200826-00625.,690-693,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although measurable residual disease (MRD) kinetics during pretransplant treatment has been recently reported to correlate with patient outcomes, it is unclear whether prognosis is better if the MRD falls below the detection sensitivity soon after induction therapy. We retrospectively analyzed data of 37 Ph + ALL patients who were treated with autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT, allo-SCT) at our institute from 2003 to 2019. Based on MRD kinetics, patients were divided into three groups: early responders (MRD became negative after induction therapy [n = 10, 27.0%]); late responders (MRD remained positive after induction therapy and became negative just before SCT [n = 12, 32.4%]); and poor responders (MRD was positive until just before SCT [n = 15, 40.5%]). The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates for the three groups were 80.0%, 60.0%, and 29.9%, respectively (P = 0.037). The 5-year overall survival rates were not significantly different. The 5-year relapse rates were 0.0%, 31.7%, and 49.5%, respectively (P = 0.045). Non-relapse mortality (NRM) rates were similar among the three groups. Subgroup analysis for the cases that received posttransplantation tyrosine kinase inhibitor maintenance therapy revealed that DFS was similarly dependent on MRD kinetics (P = 0.022). This study clarified that MRD kinetics was a significant prognosticator for DFS and relapse rate in Ph + ALL.","['Hara, Ryujiro', 'Onizuka, Makoto', 'Kikkawa, Eri', 'Shiraiwa, Sawako', 'Harada, Kaito', 'Aoyama, Yasuyuki', 'Ogiya, Daisuke', 'Toyosaki, Masako', 'Suzuki, Rikio', 'Machida, Sinichiro', 'Ohmachi, Ken', 'Ogawa, Yoshiaki', 'Kawada, Hiroshi', 'Matsushita, Hiromichi', 'Ando, Kiyoshi']","['Hara R', 'Onizuka M', 'Kikkawa E', 'Shiraiwa S', 'Harada K', 'Aoyama Y', 'Ogiya D', 'Toyosaki M', 'Suzuki R', 'Machida S', 'Ohmachi K', 'Ogawa Y', 'Kawada H', 'Matsushita H', 'Ando K']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan. ryujirohara@tokai-u.jp.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0324-898X'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210711,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Dasatinib', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Imatinib', 'Measurable residual disease', 'Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2021/07/12 06:00,2021/09/25 06:00,['2021/07/11 21:00'],"['2021/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/11 21:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-021-04587-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-021-04587-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2021 Oct;100(10):2479-2486. doi: 10.1007/s00277-021-04587-9.

The interaction of CD47 with signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha) triggers a ""don't eat me"" signal to the macrophage, inhibiting phagocytosis. Thus, overexpression of CD47 enables tumor cells to escape from immune surveillance via the blockade of phagocytic mechanisms. We report here the development and characterization of CC-90002, a humanized anti-CD47 antibody. CC-90002 is unique among previously reported anti-CD47 bivalent antibodies that it does not promote hemagglutination while maintaining high-affinity binding to CD47 and inhibition of the CD47-SIRPalpha interaction. Studies in a panel of hematological cancer cell lines showed concentration-dependent CC-90002-mediated phagocytosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), lenalidomide-resistant multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines and AML cells from patients. In vivo studies with MM cell line-derived xenograft models established in immunodeficient mice demonstrated significant dose-dependent antitumor activity of CC-90002. Treatment with CC-90002 significantly prolonged survival in an HL-60-disseminated AML model. Mechanistic studies confirmed the binding of CC-90002 to tumor cells and concomitant recruitment of F4-80 positive macrophages into the tumor and an increase in expression of select chemokines and cytokines of murine origin. Furthermore, the role of macrophages in the CC-90002-mediated antitumor activity was demonstrated by transient depletion of macrophages with liposome-clodronate treatment. In non-human primates, CC-90002 displayed acceptable pharmacokinetic properties and a favorable toxicity profile. These data demonstrate the potential activity of CC-90002 across hematological malignancies and provided basis for clinical studies CC-90002-ST-001 (NCT02367196) and CC-90002-AML-001 (NCT02641002).","['Narla, Rama Krishna', 'Modi, Hardik', 'Bauer, Daniel', 'Abbasian, Mahan', 'Leisten, Jim', 'Piccotti, Joseph R', 'Kopytek, Stephan', 'Eckelman, Brendan P', 'Deveraux, Quinn', 'Timmer, John', 'Zhu, Dan', 'Wong, Lilly', 'Escoubet, Laure', 'Raymon, Heather K', 'Hariharan, Kandasamy']","['Narla RK', 'Modi H', 'Bauer D', 'Abbasian M', 'Leisten J', 'Piccotti JR', 'Kopytek S', 'Eckelman BP', 'Deveraux Q', 'Timmer J', 'Zhu D', 'Wong L', 'Escoubet L', 'Raymon HK', 'Hariharan K']","['Bristol Myers Squibb, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA. rama.narla@bms.com.', 'Bristol Myers Squibb, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Bristol Myers Squibb, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Bristol Myers Squibb, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Bristol Myers Squibb, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Bristol Myers Squibb, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Bristol Myers Squibb, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Inhibrx, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Inhibrx, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Inhibrx, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Bristol Myers Squibb, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Bristol Myers Squibb, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Bristol Myers Squibb, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Bristol Myers Squibb, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Artiva Biotherapeutics, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Bristol Myers Squibb, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5181-3376'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210710,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CC-90002', 'IgG4PE', 'Macrophages', 'Multiple myeloma', 'Phagocytosis']",2021/07/12 06:00,2021/07/12 06:00,['2021/07/11 20:59'],"['2021/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/11 20:59 [entrez]', '2021/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00262-021-03010-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00262-021-03010-6 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2021 Jul 10. pii: 10.1007/s00262-021-03010-6. doi: 10.1007/s00262-021-03010-6.,,"['(c) 2021.

Therefore, we performed a landmark study comparing long-term outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients alive and disease-free 2 years after transplantation who received grafts from either CBT or UD. A total of 364 CBT recipients, 2648 UD 10/10 patients and 681 patients given grafts from UD 9/10 were included. Median follow-up was 6.0 years. Five-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) from transplantation was 86% in CBT patients, 84% in UD 10/10 patients (P = 0.36) and 84% in UD 9/10 patients (P = 0.86). On multivariate analysis, donor type had no impact on LFS. Similarly, no impact of donor type was observed on relapse incidence or non-relapse mortality. Factors associated with poorer LFS on multivariate analysis included higher age at transplantation (P < 0.001), male gender (P < 0.001), second complete remission (CR2) versus CR1 (P = 0.05), secondary AML (P = 0.01), antecedent of chronic GVHD (P < 0.001) and poor-risk cytogenetics (P = 0.01).

Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) promotes a dormancy phenotype in breast cancer cells and LIFR loss is correlated with poor patient survival. Herein, we demonstrate that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), which are in phase III clinical trials for breast cancer, epigenetically induced LIFR and activated a pro-dormancy program in breast cancer cells. HDACi slowed breast cancer cell proliferation and reduced primary tumor growth. Primary breast tumors from HDACi-treated patients had increased LIFR levels and reduced proliferation rates compared to pre-treatment levels. Recent Phase II clinical trial data studying entinostat and azacitidine in metastatic breast cancer revealed that induction of several pro-dormancy genes post-treatment was associated with prolonged patient survival. Together, these findings suggest HDACi as a potential therapeutic avenue to promote dormancy, prevent recurrence, and improve patient outcomes in breast cancer.","['Clements, Miranda E', 'Holtslander, Lauren', 'Edwards, Courtney', 'Todd, Vera', 'Dooyema, Samuel D R', 'Bullock, Kennady', 'Bergdorf, Kensey', 'Zahnow, Cynthia A', 'Connolly, Roisin M', 'Johnson, Rachelle W']","['Clements ME', 'Holtslander L', 'Edwards C', 'Todd V', 'Dooyema SDR', 'Bullock K', 'Bergdorf K', 'Zahnow CA', 'Connolly RM', 'Johnson RW']","['Program in Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Vanderbilt Center for Bone Biology, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Vanderbilt Center for Bone Biology, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Program in Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Vanderbilt Center for Bone Biology, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Program in Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Vanderbilt Center for Bone Biology, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Vanderbilt Center for Bone Biology, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Cancer Research@UCC, College of Medicine and Health, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Program in Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA. rachelle.johnson@vumc.org.', 'Vanderbilt Center for Bone Biology, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA. rachelle.johnson@vumc.org.', 'Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA. rachelle.johnson@vumc.org.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2755-9851'],['eng'],"['P30 DK058404/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA068485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UM1 CA186691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA194198/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA070095/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007347/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20210710,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Breast', 'Breast Neoplasms', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Phenotype', '*Receptors, OSM-LIF']",PMC8403155,,,2021/07/12 06:00,2021/12/30 06:00,['2021/07/11 20:56'],"['2020/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/11 20:56 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-021-01931-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-021-01931-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2021 Aug;40(34):5314-5326. doi: 10.1038/s41388-021-01931-1.

Transplant-related mortality remains high despite prominent scientific and technologic improvements. In consideration with the potential impact of patient- and disease-related factors on transplant outcome, this retrospective study was performed to investigate the predictive role of pretransplant HCT-composite risk (HCT-CR) score in allo-HCT recipients. METHODS: A total of 313 patients with acute leukemia (male/female: 192/121; median age, 36 [18-71] years) were included in this study. The study cohort was divided into 2 subgroups based on pretransplant HCT-CR categories. The HCT-CR(lo) group included low-risk patients, and the HCT-CR(int-hi) group consisted of intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk patients. RESULTS: In the whole cohort, overall survival (OS) and 5-year OS were found to be 32.2% and 45.1%, respectively. Probability of OS was significantly better in the HCT-CR(lo) group compared with the HCT-CR(int-hi) group (P < .001). Leukemia-free survival (LFS) and 3-year LFS were 59.5% and 65.1%, respectively. Probability of LFS was better in the HCT-CR(lo) group compared with the HCT-CR(int-hi) group (P = .001). Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and 3-year NRM were estimated to be 38.1% and 27.5%, respectively. Probability of NRM was significantly higher in the HCT-CR(int-hi) group compared with the HCT-CR(lo) group (P = .012). In multivariate analysis, HCT-CR was shown to have significant prognostic impact in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients (P = .023; hazard ratio, 2.613; 95% CI, 1.142-5.982). CONCLUSION: Pretransplant evaluation of patient- and disease-related factors is essential for the accurate prediction of posttransplant survival. Further efforts to evolve current criteria for pretransplant risk assessment would eventuate in better transplant outcomes.","['Yegin, Zeynep Arzu', 'Ozkurt, Zubeyde Nur', 'Dikyar, Asena', 'Kaynar, Lale Aydin', 'Karacaoglu, Ozlem', 'Yagci, Munci']","['Yegin ZA', 'Ozkurt ZN', 'Dikyar A', 'Kaynar LA', 'Karacaoglu O', 'Yagci M']","['Gazi University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey.

Bone marrow microenvironment (BMM), the home of hematopoiesis, has been considered to play a crucial role in both hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. When interrupted by the AML cells, a malignant BMM formed and thus provided a refuge for LSCs and protecting them from the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy. In this review, we summarized the alterations in the bidirectional interplay between hematopoietic cells and BMM in the normal/AML hematopoietic environment, and pointed out the key role of these alterations in pathogenesis and chemotherapy resistance of AML. Finally, we focused on the current potential BMM-targeted strategies together with future prospects and challenges. Accordingly, while further research is necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms behind LSC-BMM interaction, targeting the interaction is perceived as a potential therapeutic strategy to eradicate LSCs and ultimately improve the outcome of AML.","['Yao, Yiyi', 'Li, Fenglin', 'Huang, Jiansong', 'Jin, Jie', 'Wang, Huafeng']","['Yao Y', 'Li F', 'Huang J', 'Jin J', 'Wang H']","[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhejiang Provincial Key Lab of Hematopoietic Malignancy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhejiang Provincial Key Lab of Hematopoietic Malignancy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhejiang Provincial Key Lab of Hematopoietic Malignancy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China. jiej0503@zju.edu.cn."", ""Zhejiang Provincial Key Lab of Hematopoietic Malignancy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China. jiej0503@zju.edu.cn."", ""Zhejiang Laboratory for Systems & Precision Medicine, Zhejiang University Medical Center, Hangzhou, 310000, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China. jiej0503@zju.edu.cn."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China. 1509036@zju.edu.cn."", ""Zhejiang Provincial Key Lab of Hematopoietic Malignancy, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China. 1509036@zju.edu.cn."", ""Zhejiang Laboratory for Systems & Precision Medicine, Zhejiang University Medical Center, Hangzhou, 310000, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China. 1509036@zju.edu.cn.""]",,['eng'],"['No.81800146/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'LQ18H080001/Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province', 'No.81820108004/International Science and Technology Cooperation Programme']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210710,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,,,PMC8272391,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Bone marrow microenvironment', 'Environment-mediated drug resistance', 'Interaction', 'Leukemia stem cell']",2021/07/12 06:00,2021/07/12 06:01,['2021/07/11 20:22'],"['2021/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/11 20:22 [entrez]', '2021/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40164-021-00233-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s40164-021-00233-2 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2021 Jul 10;10(1):39. doi: 10.1186/s40164-021-00233-2.,39,['(c) 2021.

Purine analogues, namely cladribine, now represent the treatment of choice. One hundred and eighty-four patients were followed between 1986 and 2018 and treated according to era-specific guidelines. Responses were classified by combining Consensus Resolution criteria and marrow immunohistochemistry. Patients were grouped according to the number of treatment lines they received. Patients treated first line responded in 86% of cases, with complete response (CR) in 44% of cases. Response rates remained high throughout the first four lines (84%, 81%, 79% for the second line onward, with CR in 38%, 37%, 15% of cases respectively). One hundred and twenty-two patients received cladribine as first line treatment, with a response rate of 86% and a CR rate of 54%. Among the 66 CR patients, 45 (68%) have never received further therapy: 11 patients are in continuous CR between 5 and 10 years after treatment, 14 between 10 and 20 years and three patients at more than 20 years. Median time-to-next treatment (TTNT) for frontline cladribine-treated patients was 8.2 years: partial responders had a significantly shorter median TTNT than CR patients (5.3 years vs median not reached at 25.8 years, p < 0.001). Patients with HCL require subsequent lines of therapy in more than 50% of cases. Purine analogues allow significant response rates when applied first line and upon retreatment. Some patients may enjoy long lasting treatment-free intervals after one course of cladribine.","['Broccoli, Alessandro', 'Argnani, Lisa', 'Nanni, Laura', 'Terragna, Carolina', 'Sabattini, Elena', 'Gabrielli, Giulia', 'Stefoni, Vittorio', 'Pellegrini, Cinzia', 'Casadei, Beatrice', 'Morigi, Alice', 'Lolli, Ginevra', 'Carella, Matteo', 'Coppola, Paolo Elia', 'Zinzani, Pier Luigi']","['Broccoli A', 'Argnani L', 'Nanni L', 'Terragna C', 'Sabattini E', 'Gabrielli G', 'Stefoni V', 'Pellegrini C', 'Casadei B', 'Morigi A', 'Lolli G', 'Carella M', 'Coppola PE', 'Zinzani PL']","['IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Bologna, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Specialistica, Diagnostica e Sperimentale, Universita degli Studi, Bologna, Italy.', 'IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Bologna, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Specialistica, Diagnostica e Sperimentale, Universita degli Studi, Bologna, Italy.', 'IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Bologna, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Specialistica, Diagnostica e Sperimentale, Universita degli Studi, Bologna, Italy.', 'IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Bologna, Italy.', 'IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Bologna, Italy.', 'A.O.U.

The diseases most frequently linked to fragility fractures include leukemia and other cancers, inflammatory disorders, neuromuscular disease, and those treated with osteotoxic drugs (particularly glucocorticoids). The decision to treat a child with secondary osteoporosis is challenged by the fact that fractures are frequent in childhood, even in the absence of risk factors. Furthermore, some children have the potential for medication-unassisted recovery from osteoporosis, obviating the need for bisphosphonate therapy. RECENT FINDINGS: Over the last decade, there have been important advances in our understanding of the skeletal phenotypes, fracture frequencies, and risk factors for bone fragility in children with underlying disorders. With improved knowledge about the importance of fracture characteristics in at-risk children, there has been a shift away from a bone mineral density (BMD)-centric definition of osteoporosis in childhood, to a fracture-focused approach. As a result, attention is now drawn to the early identification of fragility fractures, which includes asymptomatic vertebral collapse. Furthermore, even a single, long bone fracture can represent a major osteoporotic event in an at-risk child. Fundamental biological principles of bone strength development, and the ways in which these go awry in chronic illnesses, form the basis for monitoring and diagnosis of osteoporosis in children with underlying conditions. Overall, the goal of monitoring is to identify early, rather than late, signs of osteoporosis in children with limited potential to undergo medication-unassisted recovery. These are the children who should undergo bisphosphonate therapy, as discussed in part 1 (monitoring and diagnosis) and part 2 (recovery and the decision to treat) of this review.","['Ward, Leanne M']",['Ward LM'],"['Department of Pediatrics, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.

Although the awareness of sleep problems in solid cancer patients is rising, there has been less attention to the issue in hematological cancer patients. The present study assesses the differences in sleep by comparing physical activity and fatigue levels among hematological cancer patients during the onset of chemotherapy. Furthermore, it investigates the relationship between sleep, physical activity, and fatigue through mediation analysis. METHODS: The recruited sample consists of 58 newly diagnosed hematological cancer patients (47.1 +/- 15.4 yrs; 51.7% males). Subjects completed questionnaires assessing sleep (PSQI), physical activity (visual analogue scale), fatigue (MFI-20), anxiety, depression (HADS), and quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) within two weeks from starting treatment. RESULTS: The sample reported more sleep problems in comparison to the German population norm. The classification as good (ca 25%) or bad sleepers (ca 75%) showed less frequent physical activity (p = .04), higher fatigue (p = .032), anxiety (p = .003), depression (p = .011) and pain (p = .011) in bad sleepers. The mediation analysis revealed significant indirect effects of sleep on fatigue through physical activity habits. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the combined action of sleep problems and physical activity on fatigue during the onset of induction chemotherapy. These two parameters could represent meaningful intervention targets to improve a patient's status during chemotherapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered on the WHO trial register (DRKS00007824).","['Castelli, Lucia', 'Elter, Thomas', 'Wolf, Florian', 'Watson, Matthew', 'Schenk, Alexander', 'Steindorf, Karen', 'Bloch, Wilhelm', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Joisten, Niklas', 'Zimmer, Philipp']","['Castelli L', 'Elter T', 'Wolf F', 'Watson M', 'Schenk A', 'Steindorf K', 'Bloch W', 'Hallek M', 'Joisten N', 'Zimmer P']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health, University of Milan, Via Giuseppe Colombo 71, 20133, Milan, Italy.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Duesseldorf, University of Cologne, Kerpener Strasse 62, 50937, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Sports Medicine, Institute of Cardiovascular Research and Sports Medicine, German Sport University Cologne, Am Sportpark Mungersdorf 6, 50933, Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute of Psychology, German Sport University Cologne, Am Sportpark Mungersdorf 6, 50933, Cologne, Germany.', 'Division for Performance and Health (Sports Medicine), Institute for Sport and Sport Science, TU Dortmund University, Otto-Hahn-Strasse, 344227, Dortmund, Germany.', 'Division of Physical Activity, Prevention and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 460, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Sports Medicine, Institute of Cardiovascular Research and Sports Medicine, German Sport University Cologne, Am Sportpark Mungersdorf 6, 50933, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Duesseldorf, University of Cologne, Kerpener Strasse 62, 50937, Cologne, Germany.', 'Division for Performance and Health (Sports Medicine), Institute for Sport and Sport Science, TU Dortmund University, Otto-Hahn-Strasse, 344227, Dortmund, Germany.', 'Division for Performance and Health (Sports Medicine), Institute for Sport and Sport Science, TU Dortmund University, Otto-Hahn-Strasse, 344227, Dortmund, Germany. philipp.zimmer@tu-dortmund.de.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7701-9733', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1786-8853', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9631-4503']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210710,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Exercise', 'Fatigue/epidemiology/etiology', 'Female', '*Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Quality of Life', '*Sleep Wake Disorders/epidemiology/etiology']",PMC8636408,['NOTNLM'],"['Fatigue', 'Hematological cancer', 'Leukemia', 'Physical activity', 'Sleep']",2021/07/11 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/07/10 12:10'],"['2021/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/10 12:10 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-021-06377-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-021-06377-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2022 Jan;30(1):167-176. doi: 10.1007/s00520-021-06377-5.

Several computational methods have been developed to estimate differential networks from gene expression data, but most of them do not consider that gene network rewiring may be driven by the differential expression of individual genes. New differential network analysis methods that simultaneously take account of the changes in gene interactions and changes in expression levels are needed. RESULTS: In this paper, we propose a differential network analysis method that considers the differential expression of individual genes when identifying differential edges. First, two hypothesis test statistics are used to quantify changes in partial correlations between gene pairs and changes in expression levels for individual genes. Then, an optimization framework is proposed to combine the two test statistics so that the resulting differential network has a hierarchical property, where a differential edge can be considered only if at least one of the two involved genes is differentially expressed. Simulation results indicate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. We apply our method to identify the differential networks between the luminal A and basal-like subtypes of breast cancer and those between acute myeloid leukemia and normal samples. Hub nodes in the differential networks estimated by our method, including both differentially and non-differentially expressed genes, have important biological functions.

Early recognition and close monitoring of clinical and psychological problems are essential in planning appropriate interventions and preventing further deterioration. CASE: ePROtect was established as an easy-to-use application for daily self-reporting of symptoms during cancer therapy. ePROtect includes six to eight questions pertaining to seven common symptoms: appetite loss, fatigue, nausea, pain, physical functioning, cognitive impairments and sleep quality. The case of a child diagnosed with Burkitt leukemia developing chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis in home care is presented to show the therapeutic impact of early symptom detection with a daily web-based tool.

However, the supposed increased risk of infection in case of hypogammaglobulinemia has not been confirmed in allo-HSCT. In this study, we assessed the relationship between the gamma globulin level and the risk of infection during the 100 days following the allo-HSCT. METHODS: We gathered the weekly laboratory tests from day 7 to day 100 of 76 allograft patients, giving a total of 1 044 tests. 130 infections were documented clinically, by imaging, or microbiologically. RESULTS: Average gamma globulin levels between D-7 and D100 did not differ between patients with or without infection (642 +/- 232 and 671 +/- 246 mg/dL, respectively, P = .65). Gamma globulin level <400 mg/dl was not associated with the occurrence of infection between the test studied and the next one (aOR 1.33 [0.84-2.15], P = .24).

We analyzed the outcome of 65 patients reported to the registry of the European Working Group (EWOG) of MDS in childhood carrying a germline GATA2 mutation (GATA2(mut)) who had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). At 5 years the probability of overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS) was 75% and 70%, respectively. Non-relapse mortality and relapse equally contributed to treatment failure. There was no evidence of increased incidence of graft-versus-host-disease or excessive rates of infections or organ toxicities. Advanced disease and monosomy 7 (-7) were associated with worse outcome. Patients with refractory cytopenia of childhood (RCC) and normal karyotype showed an excellent outcome (DFS 90%) compared to RCC and -7 (DFS 67%). Comparing outcome of GATA2(mut) with GATA2(wt) patients, there was no difference in DFS in patients with RCC and normal karyotype. The same was true for patients with -7 across morphological subtypes. We demonstrate that HSCT outcome is independent of GATA2 germline mutations in pediatric MDS suggesting the application of standard MDS algorithms and protocols. Our data support considering HSCT early in the course of GATA2 deficiency in young individuals.","['Bortnick, Rachel', 'Wlodarski, Marcin', 'de Haas, Valerie', 'De Moerloose, Barbara', 'Dworzak,

This study aimed to examine whether such occupational exposure increased the risk of childhood cancer in offspring. METHODS: We used the dataset of the Japan Environment and Children's Study, a nationwide birth cohort involving over 100,000 mother-child pairs. Information was obtained via successive questionnaires that were completed until the child turned 1 year of age. The parents were asked whether they occupationally handled medical agents during pregnancy. RESULTS: A total of 26 infants developed neoplasms: neuroblastoma, leukemia, and brain tumor. The incidence of neuroblastoma was significantly higher in infants whose mothers were exposed to radiation (3/2142: 140.1 per 100,000 population) than in those who were not (12/90,384: 13.3 per 100,000 population). Multivariable regression analyses revealed a close association between maternal irradiation and the development of neuroblastoma (adjusted incident rate ratio: 10.68 [95% confidence interval: 2.9838.27]). CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated, for the first time, a potential association between maternal occupational exposure and the occurrence of neuroblastoma in offspring. Further studies involving the large pediatric cancer registries are needed to confirm these preliminary results. IMPACT: Healthcare workers are often exposed to hazardous agents and are at risk for adverse health consequences that affect not only themselves but also their infants. This study examined the association between such occupational exposure and offspring's cancers that developed until the age of 1 year. Maternal exposure to ionizing radiation was associated with infantile neuroblastoma in offspring. Further studies involving the large pediatric cancer registries are needed to confirm these preliminary results.","['Koga, Yuhki', 'Sanefuji, Masafumi', 'Toya, Syunichiro', 'Oba, Utako', 'Nakashima, Kentaro', 'Ono, Hiroaki', 'Yamamoto, Shunsuke', 'Suzuki, Maya', 'Sonoda, Yuri', 'Ogawa, Masanobu', 'Yamamoto, Hiroyuki', 'Kusuhara, Koichi', 'Ohga, Shouichi']","['Koga Y', 'Sanefuji M', 'Toya S', 'Oba U', 'Nakashima K', 'Ono H', 'Yamamoto S', 'Suzuki M', 'Sonoda Y', 'Ogawa M', 'Yamamoto H', 'Kusuhara K', 'Ohga S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan. yuuki-k@pediatr.med.kyushu-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Research Center for Environment and Developmental Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Research Center for Environment and Developmental Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Research Center for Environment and Developmental Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Research Center for Environment and Developmental Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan.', ""Regional Center for Japan Environment and Children's Study, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Research Center for Environment and Developmental Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0056-9988'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210709,United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,,IM,,,,,2021/07/11 06:00,2021/07/11 06:00,['2021/07/10 06:12'],"['2021/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/10 06:12 [entrez]', '2021/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41390-021-01634-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41390-021-01634-z [pii]']",aheadofprint,Pediatr Res. 2021 Jul 9. pii: 10.1038/s41390-021-01634-z. doi: 10.1038/s41390-021-01634-z.,,['(c) 2021.

Here, we explore expression patterns and prognostic relevance of circular RNAs (circRNAs), a group of endogenous non-coding RNA molecules, in MCL. We profiled the circRNA expression landscape using RNA-sequencing and explored the prognostic potential of 40 abundant circRNAs in samples from the Nordic MCL2 and MCL3 clinical trials, using NanoString nCounter Technology. We report a circRNA-based signature (circSCORE) developed in the training cohort MCL2 that is highly predictive of time to progression (TTP) and lymphoma-specific survival (LSS). The dismal outcome observed in the large proportion of patients assigned to the circSCORE high-risk group was confirmed in the independent validation cohort MCL3, both in terms of TTP (HR 3.0; P = 0.0004) and LSS (HR 3.6; P = 0.001). In Cox multiple regression analysis incorporating MIPI, Ki67 index, blastoid morphology and presence of TP53 mutations, circSCORE retained prognostic significance for TTP (HR 3.2; P = 0.01) and LSS (HR 4.6; P = 0.01). In conclusion, circRNAs are promising prognostic biomarkers in MCL and circSCORE improves identification of high-risk disease among younger patients treated with cytarabine-containing chemoimmunotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant.","['Dahl, Mette', 'Husby, Simon', 'Eskelund, Christian W', 'Besenbacher, Soren', 'Fjelstrup, Soren', 'Come, Christophe', 'Ek, Sara', 'Kolstad, Arne', 'Raty, Riikka', 'Jerkeman, Mats', 'Geisler, Christian H', 'Kjems, Jorgen', 'Kristensen, Lasse S', 'Gronbaek, Kirsten']","['Dahl M', 'Husby S', 'Eskelund CW', 'Besenbacher S', 'Fjelstrup S', 'Come C', 'Ek S', 'Kolstad A', 'Raty R', 'Jerkeman M', 'Geisler CH', 'Kjems J', 'Kristensen LS', 'Gronbaek K']","['Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre, Copenhagen University, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Biology, DanStem, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre, Copenhagen University, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Biology, DanStem, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre, Copenhagen University, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine (MOMA), Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (iNANO), Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre, Copenhagen University, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Biology, DanStem, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Immunotechnology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Division of Oncology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (iNANO), Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark. lasse@biomed.au.dk.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark. kirsten.groenbaek@regionh.dk.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre, Copenhagen University, Copenhagen, Denmark. kirsten.groenbaek@regionh.dk.', 'Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Biology, DanStem, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. kirsten.groenbaek@regionh.dk.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5322-0136', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1455-1738', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5229-4440', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1388-4912', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4509-6707', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5980-7939', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1535-9601']",['eng'],"['223-A13071-18-S68/Kraeftens Bekaempelse (Danish Cancer Society)', 'NNF17CC0027852/Novo Nordisk Fonden (Novo Nordisk Foundation)']",['Journal Article'],20210709,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,,,,,2021/07/11 06:00,2021/07/11 06:00,['2021/07/10 06:11'],"['2020/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/19 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/11 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/10 06:11 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-021-01311-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-021-01311-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2022 Jan;36(1):177-188. doi: 10.1038/s41375-021-01311-4.

The cause of relapse is thought to be from the persistence of leukemia initiating cells (LIC's) following treatment. Here we assessed RNA based changes in LICs from matched patient diagnosis and relapse samples using single-cell RNA sequencing. Previous studies on AML progression have focused on genetic changes at the DNA mutation level mostly in bulk AML cells and demonstrated the existence of DNA clonal evolution. Here we identified in LICs that the phenomenon of RNA clonal evolution occurs during AML progression. Despite the presence of vast transcriptional heterogeneity at the single cell level, pathway analysis identified common signaling networks involving metabolism, apoptosis and chemokine signaling that evolved during AML progression and become a signature of relapse samples. A subset of this gene signature was validated at the protein level in LICs by flow cytometry from an independent AML cohort and functional studies were performed to demonstrate co-targeting BCL2 and CXCR4 signaling may help overcome therapeutic challenges with AML heterogeneity. It is hoped this work will facilitate a greater understanding of AML relapse leading to improved prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies to target LIC's.","['Stetson, L C', 'Balasubramanian, Dheepa', 'Ribeiro, Susan Pereira', 'Stefan, Tammy', 'Gupta, Kalpana', 'Xu, Xuan', 'Fourati, Slim', 'Roe, Anne', 'Jackson, Zachary', 'Schauner, Robert', 'Sharma, Ashish', 'Tamilselvan, Banumathi', 'Li, Samuel', 'de Lima, Marcos', 'Hwang, Tae Hyun', 'Balderas, Robert', 'Saunthararajah, Yogen', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw', 'LaFramboise, Thomas', 'Barnholtz-Sloan, Jill S', 'Sekaly, Rafick-Pierre', 'Wald, David N']","['Stetson LC', 'Balasubramanian D', 'Ribeiro SP', 'Stefan T', 'Gupta K', 'Xu X', 'Fourati S', 'Roe A', 'Jackson Z', 'Schauner R', 'Sharma A', 'Tamilselvan B', 'Li S', 'de Lima M', 'Hwang TH', 'Balderas R', 'Saunthararajah Y', 'Maciejewski J', 'LaFramboise T', 'Barnholtz-Sloan JS', 'Sekaly RP', 'Wald DN']","['Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA.', 'Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA. dnw@case.edu.', 'Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA. dnw@case.edu.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center and Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center, Cleveland, OH, USA. dnw@case.edu.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6609-7587', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3655-8279', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8568-4522', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6668-7269', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9757-1031', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8695-1178']",['eng'],"['P30 CA043703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA094186/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA043703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20210709,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['63231-63-0 (RNA)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Clonal Evolution/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA/*genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA/methods', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Whole Exome Sequencing/methods']",,,,2021/07/11 06:00,2021/11/18 06:00,['2021/07/10 06:11'],"['2020/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/18 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/10 06:11 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-021-01338-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-021-01338-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Oct;35(10):2799-2812. doi: 10.1038/s41375-021-01338-7.

In addition, truncating mutations in the remaining allele of this gene can lead to BIRC3 biallelic inactivation, which has been shown to be a marker for reduced survival in CLL. Nevertheless, the biological mechanisms by which these lesions could contribute to del(11q) CLL pathogenesis and progression are partially unexplored. We implemented the CRISPR/Cas9-editing system to generate isogenic CLL cell lines harboring del(11q) and/or BIRC3 mutations, modeling monoallelic and biallelic BIRC3 loss. Our results reveal that monoallelic BIRC3 deletion in del(11q) cells promotes non-canonical NF-kappaB signaling activation via RelB-p52 nuclear translocation, being these effects allelic dose-dependent and therefore further enhanced in del(11q) cells with biallelic BIRC3 loss. Moreover, we demonstrate ex vivo in primary cells that del(11q) cases including BIRC3 within their deleted region show evidence of non-canonical NF-kappaB activation which correlates with high BCL2 levels and enhanced sensitivity to venetoclax. Furthermore, our results show that BIRC3 mutations in del(11q) cells promote clonal advantage in vitro and accelerate leukemic progression in an in vivo xenograft model. Altogether, this work highlights the biological bases underlying disease progression of del(11q) CLL patients harboring BIRC3 deletion and mutation.","['Quijada-Alamo, Miguel', 'Hernandez-Sanchez, Maria', 'Rodriguez-Vicente, Ana-Eugenia', 'Perez-Carretero, Claudia', 'Rodriguez-Sanchez, Alberto', 'Martin-Izquierdo, Marta', 'Alonso-Perez, Veronica', 'Garcia-Tunon, Ignacio', 'Bastida, Jose Maria', 'Vidal-Mancenido, Maria Jesus', 'Galende, Josefina', 'Aguilar, Carlos', 'Queizan, Jose Antonio', 'Gonzalez-Gascon Y Marin, Isabel', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jose-Angel', 'Benito, Rocio', 'Ordonez, Jose Luis', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus-Maria']","['Quijada-Alamo M', 'Hernandez-Sanchez M', 'Rodriguez-Vicente AE', 'Perez-Carretero C', 'Rodriguez-Sanchez A', 'Martin-Izquierdo M', 'Alonso-Perez V', 'Garcia-Tunon I', 'Bastida JM', 'Vidal-Mancenido MJ', 'Galende J', 'Aguilar C', 'Queizan JA', 'Gonzalez-Gascon Y Marin I', 'Hernandez-Rivas JA', 'Benito R', 'Ordonez JL', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM']","['University of Salamanca, IBSAL, IBMCC, CSIC, Cancer Research Center, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'University of Salamanca, IBSAL, IBMCC, CSIC, Cancer Research Center, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.', 'Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA.', 'University of Salamanca, IBSAL, IBMCC, CSIC, Cancer Research Center, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'University of Salamanca, IBSAL, IBMCC, CSIC, Cancer Research Center, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'University of Salamanca, IBSAL, IBMCC, CSIC, Cancer Research Center, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'University of Salamanca, IBSAL, IBMCC, CSIC, Cancer Research Center, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'University of Salamanca, IBSAL, IBMCC, CSIC, Cancer Research Center, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'University of Salamanca, IBSAL, IBMCC, CSIC, Cancer Research Center, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Virgen Blanca, Leon, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital del Bierzo, Ponferrada, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Santa Barbara, Soria, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital General de Segovia, Segovia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor.

Because Down syndrome leukemogenesis initiates during fetal development, we characterized the cellular and developmental context of preleukemic initiation and leukemic progression using gene editing in human disomic and trisomic fetal hematopoietic cells and xenotransplantation. GATA binding protein 1 (GATA1) mutations caused transient preleukemia when introduced into trisomy 21 long-term hematopoietic stem cells, where a subset of chromosome 21 microRNAs affected predisposition to preleukemia. By contrast, progression to leukemia was independent of trisomy 21 and originated in various stem and progenitor cells through additional mutations in cohesin genes. CD117(+)/KIT proto-oncogene (KIT) cells mediated the propagation of preleukemia and leukemia, and KIT inhibition targeted preleukemic stem cells.","['Wagenblast, Elvin', 'Araujo, Joana', 'Gan, Olga

However, there are substantial barriers-including limited tumor homing, lack of retention of function within a suppressive tumor microenvironment, and antigen heterogeneity/escape-to using this technology to effectively treat solid tumors. A multiplexed engineering approach is needed to equip effector T cells with synthetic countermeasures to overcome these barriers. This, in turn, necessitates combinatorial use of lentiviruses because of the limited payload size of current lentiviral vectors. Accordingly, there is a need for cell-surface human molecular constructs that mark multi-vector cotransduced T cells, to enable their purification ex vivo and their tracking in vivo. To this end, we engineered a cell surface-localizing polypeptide tag based on human HER2, designated HER2t, that was truncated in its extracellular and intracellular domains to eliminate ligand binding and signaling, respectively, and retained the membrane-proximal binding epitope of the HER2-specific mAb trastuzumab. We linked HER2t to CAR coexpression in lentivirally transduced T cells and showed that co-transduction with a second lentivirus expressing our previously described EGFRt tag linked to a second CAR efficiently generated bispecific dual-CAR T cells. Using the same approach, we generated T cells expressing a CAR and a second module, a chimeric cytokine receptor. The HER2txEGFRt multiplexing strategy is now being deployed for the manufacture of CD19xCD22 bispecific CAR T-cell products for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (NCT03330691).","['Johnson, Adam J', 'Wei, Jia', 'Rosser, James M', 'Kunkele, Annette', 'Chang, Cindy A', 'Reid, Aquene N', 'Jensen, Michael C']","['Johnson AJ', 'Wei J', 'Rosser JM', 'Kunkele A', 'Chang CA', 'Reid AN', 'Jensen MC']","[""Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, Washington."", ""Seattle Children's Therapeutics, Seattle, Washington."", ""Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, Washington."", ""Seattle Children's Therapeutics, Seattle, Washington."", ""Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, Washington."", ""Seattle Children's Therapeutics, Seattle, Washington."", ""Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, Washington."", ""Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, Washington."", ""Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, Washington."", ""Seattle Children's Therapeutics, Seattle, Washington."", ""Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, Washington. michael.jensen@seattlechildrens.org."", ""Seattle Children's Therapeutics, Seattle, Washington."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8406-5412'],['eng'],['R01 CA136551/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210709,United States,Cancer Immunol Res,Cancer immunology research,101614637,,IM,,PMC8415133,,,2021/07/11 06:00,2021/07/11 06:00,['2021/07/10 05:40'],"['2020/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/03/24 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/03/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/11 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/10 05:40 [entrez]']","['2326-6066.CIR-20-0470 [pii]', '10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-20-0470 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Res. 2021 Sep;9(9):1047-1060. doi: 10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-20-0470.

Briefly, priming blood NK cells with recombinant human (rh)IL-12, rhIL-15, and rhIL-18 (12/15/18) results in memory-like NK cell differentiation and enhanced responses against cancer. However, the lack of available, scalable Good Manufacturing Process (GMP)-grade reagents required to advance this approach beyond early-phase clinical trials is limiting. To address this challenge, we developed a novel platform centered upon an inert tissue factor scaffold for production of heteromeric fusion protein complexes (HFPC). The first use of this platform combined IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 receptor engagement (HCW9201), and the second adds CD16 engagement (HCW9207). This unique HFPC expression platform was scalable with equivalent protein quality characteristics in small- and GMP-scale production. HCW9201 and HCW9207 stimulated activation and proliferation signals in NK cells, but HCW9207 had decreased IL-18 receptor signaling. RNA sequencing and multidimensional mass cytometry revealed parallels between HCW9201 and 12/15/18. HCW9201 stimulation improved NK cell metabolic fitness and resulted in the DNA methylation remodeling characteristic of memory-like differentiation. HCW9201 and 12/15/18 primed similar increases in short-term and memory-like NK cell cytotoxicity and IFNgamma production against leukemia targets, as well as equivalent control of leukemia in NSG mice. Thus, HFPCs represent a protein engineering approach that solves many problems associated with multisignal receptor engagement on immune cells, and HCW9201-primed NK cells can be advanced as an ideal approach for clinical GMP-grade memory-like NK cell production for cancer therapy.","['Becker-Hapak, Michelle K', 'Shrestha, Niraj', 'McClain, Ethan', 'Dee, Michael J', 'Chaturvedi, Pallavi', 'Leclerc, Gilles M', 'Marsala, Lynne I', 'Foster, Mark', 'Schappe, Timothy', 'Tran, Jennifer', 'Desai, Sweta', 'Neal, Carly C', 'Pence, Patrick', 'Wong, Pamela', 'Wagner, Julia A', 'Russler-Germain, David A', 'Zhu, Xiaoyun', 'Spanoudis, Catherine M', 'Gallo, Victor L', 'Echeverri, Christian A', 'Ramirez, Laritza L', 'You, Lijing', 'Egan, Jack O', 'Rhode, Peter R', 'Jiao, Jin-An', 'Muniz, Gabriela J', 'Jeng, Emily K', 'Prendes, Caitlin A', 'Sullivan, Ryan P', 'Berrien-Elliott, Melissa M', 'Wong, Hing C', 'Fehniger, Todd A']","['Becker-Hapak MK', 'Shrestha N', 'McClain E', 'Dee MJ', 'Chaturvedi P', 'Leclerc GM', 'Marsala LI', 'Foster M', 'Schappe T', 'Tran J', 'Desai S', 'Neal CC', 'Pence P', 'Wong P', 'Wagner JA', 'Russler-Germain DA', 'Zhu X', 'Spanoudis CM', 'Gallo VL', 'Echeverri CA', 'Ramirez LL', 'You L', 'Egan JO', 'Rhode PR', 'Jiao JA', 'Muniz GJ', 'Jeng EK', 'Prendes CA', 'Sullivan RP', 'Berrien-Elliott MM', 'Wong HC', 'Fehniger TA']","['Washington University School of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Saint Louis, Missouri.', 'HCW Biologics Inc., Miramar, Florida.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Saint Louis, Missouri.', 'HCW Biologics Inc., Miramar, Florida.', 'HCW Biologics Inc., Miramar, Florida.', 'HCW Biologics Inc., Miramar, Florida.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Saint Louis, Missouri.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Saint Louis, Missouri.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Saint Louis, Missouri.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Saint Louis, Missouri.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Saint Louis, Missouri.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Saint Louis, Missouri.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Saint Louis, Missouri.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Saint Louis, Missouri.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Saint Louis, Missouri.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Saint Louis, Missouri.', 'HCW Biologics Inc., Miramar, Florida.', 'HCW Biologics Inc., Miramar, Florida.', 'HCW Biologics Inc., Miramar, Florida.', 'HCW Biologics Inc., Miramar, Florida.', 'HCW Biologics Inc., Miramar, Florida.', 'HCW Biologics Inc., Miramar, Florida.', 'HCW Biologics Inc., Miramar, Florida.', 'HCW Biologics Inc., Miramar, Florida.', 'HCW Biologics Inc., Miramar, Florida.', 'HCW Biologics Inc., Miramar, Florida.', 'HCW Biologics Inc., Miramar, Florida.', 'HCW Biologics Inc., Miramar, Florida.', 'Wugen, Inc., Saint Louis, Missouri.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Saint Louis, Missouri.', 'HCW Biologics Inc., Miramar, Florida.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Saint Louis, Missouri. tfehnige@wustl.edu.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3673-5370', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3424-9256', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5339-1218', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6856-2603', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1009-2247', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0563-4235', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8230-5523', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4067-4021', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9423-7567', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7319-9159']",['eng'],"['P50 CA171963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CA167540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA205239/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA091842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007088/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20210709,United States,Cancer Immunol Res,Cancer immunology research,101614637,,IM,,PMC8416787,,,2021/07/11 06:00,2021/07/11 06:00,['2021/07/10 05:40'],"['2020/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/03/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/11 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/10 05:40 [entrez]']","['2326-6066.CIR-20-1002 [pii]', '10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-20-1002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Res. 2021 Sep;9(9):1071-1087. doi: 10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-20-1002.

We report a case of a young adult on the Cancer and Leukaemia Group B 10403 treatment protocol for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. She has previously completed the induction and consolidation phases with good tolerance then started on Capizzi methotrexate during the interim maintenance phase. Few days after receiving one intermediate dose of methotrexate, she developed severe multiorgan toxicities including pancytopaenia and several dermatologic toxicities. The patient underwent extensive diagnostic workup, with all results negative, pointing eventually towards severe methotrexate toxicity. This case highlights the broad spectrum of toxicities that can occur even with low doses of methotrexate. Capizzi methotrexate therapy implies no leucovorin therapy, hence putting patients at risk for multiorgan toxicity. Our experience reinforces the importance of close monitoring for patients receiving methotrexate, regardless of dose, and the prompt administration of high-dose leucovorin once toxicity suspected.","['Caldito, Elena G', 'Pescatore, Jay M', 'Elsebaie, Maha']","['Caldito EG', 'Pescatore JM', 'Elsebaie M']","['Medicine, John H Stroger Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Medicine, John H Stroger Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois, USA jay.mark.pescatore@gmail.com.', 'Medicine, John H Stroger Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1821-6566'],['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20210708,England,BMJ Case Rep,BMJ case reports,101526291,"['Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/adverse effects', '*Methotrexate/adverse effects', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Young Adult']",PMC8268895,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer intervention', 'dermatology', 'haematology (drugs and medicines)', 'malignant disease and immunosuppression', 'skin']",2021/07/11 06:00,2021/07/14 06:00,['2021/07/10 05:39'],"['2023/07/08 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/07/10 05:39 [entrez]', '2021/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['14/7/e243153 [pii]', '10.1136/bcr-2021-243153 [doi]']",epublish,BMJ Case Rep. 2021 Jul 8;14(7). pii: 14/7/e243153. doi: 10.1136/bcr-2021-243153.,,"['(c) BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2021.

The aim of this paper was to develop a novel alpha-amyrin-loaded nanocapsule for intestinal delivery and evaluate, preliminarily, its cytotoxic ability against leukemic cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five nanocapsule formulations were designed by the solvent displacement-evaporation method. Poly-epsilon-caprolactone, Eudragit(R) E100, and Kollicoat(R) Mae 100 P were used as film-former materials. Particle size, polydispersity index (PdI), zeta potential, and the pH of all formulations were measured. The cytotoxic potential of the nanocapsules was evaluated in vitro using different leukemic lineages RESULTS: Nanocapsules coated with Kollicoat(R) Mae 100 P presented the smallest particle size (130 nm), the lowest zeta-potential (-38 mV), and the narrowest size distribution (PdI = 0.100). The entrapment efficiency was 65.47%, while the loading capacity was 2.40%. Nanocapsules release 100% of alpha-amyrin in 40 min (pH 7.4), by using a possible mechanism of swelling-diffusion. The formulation showed excellent on-shelf physicochemical stability during one year. Additionally, nanocapsules produced a selective cytotoxic effect on a human leukemia lineage Kasumi-1, an acute myeloid leukemia cell line, and produced cell death by apoptosis CONCLUSION: alpha-amyrin-loaded nanocapsules appear to be a promising nanoformulation that could be used against leukemia.","['Neto, Serafim Florentino', 'Prada, Ariadna Lafourcade', 'Achod, Leonardo Domingo Rosales', 'Torquato, Heron Fernandes Vieira', 'Lima, Caue Santos', 'Paredes-Gamero, Edgar Julian', 'Silva de Moraes, Maria Oneide', 'Lima, Emerson Silva', 'Sosa, Edgar Hernandez', 'de Souza, Tatiane Pereira', 'Amado, Jesus Rafael Rodriguez']","['Neto SF', 'Prada AL', 'Achod LDR', 'Torquato HFV', 'Lima CS', 'Paredes-Gamero EJ', 'Silva de Moraes MO', 'Lima ES', 'Sosa EH', 'de Souza TP', 'Amado JRR']","['Laboratory of Innovation and Development in Pharmaceutical Technology (LIDETEF), Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universidade Federal do Amazonas, Av.

It is a widely used anticancer medicine in clinics. Unfortunately, high doses or long-term etoposide treatment can induce therapy-related leukemia. The mechanism by which etoposide induces secondary hematopoietic malignancies is still unclear. In this article, we review the potential mechanisms of etoposide induced therapy-related leukemia. Etoposide related leukemogenesis is known to depend on reactive oxidative metabolites of etoposide, notably etoposide quinone, which interacts with cellular proteins such as topoisomerases II (TOP2), CREB-binding protein (CREBBP), and T-Cell Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (TCPTP). CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 metabolize etoposide to etoposide catechol, which readily oxidizes to etoposide quinone. As a poison of TOP2 enzymes, etoposide and its metabolites induce DNA double-stranded breaks (DSB), and the accumulation of DSB triggers cell apoptosis. If the cell survives, the DSB gives rise to the likelihood of faulty DNA repair events. The gene translocation could occur in mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene, which is well-known in leukemogenesis. Recently, studies have revealed that etoposide metabolites, especially etoposide quinone, can covalently bind to cysteines residues of CREBBP and TCPTP enzymes, . This leads to enzyme inhibition and further affects histone acetylation and phosphorylation of the JAK-STAT pathway, thus putatively altering the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). In brief, current studies suggest that etoposide and its metabolites contribute to etoposide therapy-related leukemia through TOP2 mediated DSB and impairs specific enzyme activity, such as CREBBP and TCPTP.","['Zhang, Wenchao', 'Gou, Panhong', 'Dupret, Jean-Marie', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Rodrigues-Lima, Fernando']","['Zhang W', 'Gou P', 'Dupret JM', 'Chomienne C', 'Rodrigues-Lima F']","['Universite de Paris, BFA, UMR 8251, CNRS, Paris F-75013, France.

To critically appraise it, we performed an umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy and safety of therapeutic interventions for pediatric malignancies. Fourteen publications (68 meta-analyses, 31,496 participants) were eligible. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was investigated at most. Substantial heterogeneity was detected in 10 associations, with limited indications for small-study effects and excess-significance bias. The most concrete evidence pertained to the use of methotrexate and vincristine-prednisone pulses for ALL, improving event-free survival. Evidence regarding other cancers was relatively weak. Conclusively, we found few small meta-analyses focusing mainly on ALL. Randomized evidence stemming from adult populations still seems to serve as valuable indirect evidence backup. More randomized evidence and individual patient data meta-analyses are needed to increase certainty and precision in the care of pediatric cancer patients.","['Lavasidis, Georgios', 'Markozannes, Georgios', 'Panagiotou, Orestis A', 'Trikalinos, Nikolaos A', 'Petridou, Eleni Th', 'Voorhies, Kirsten', 'Ntzani, Evangelia E']","['Lavasidis G', 'Markozannes G', 'Panagiotou OA', 'Trikalinos NA', 'Petridou ET', 'Voorhies K', 'Ntzani EE']","['Evidence-based Medicine Unit, Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology, University of Ioannina School of Medicine, University Campus, 45110, Ioannina, Greece; Department of Pediatrics, Klinikum Stadt Soest, Senator-Schwartz-Ring 8, 59494, Soest, Germany; Department of Ophthalmology, Marienhospital Osnabruck, Bischofsstrasse 1, 49074, Osnabruck, Germany.

In countries with a high prevalence of BLV, minimizing economic losses is challenging; thus, research into various countermeasures is important for improving BLV control. Because anti-BLV drugs have not been developed, the present study explored a promising chemical compound with anti-BLV activity. Initially, screening of a chemical compound library revealed that violaceoid E (vioE), which is isolated from fungus, showed antiviral activity. Further analysis demonstrated that the antiviral effect of vioE inhibited transcriptional activation of BLV. Cellular thermal shift assay and pulldown assays provided evidence for a direct interaction between vioE and the viral transactivator protein, Tax. These data indicate that interference with Tax-dependent transcription could be a novel target for development of anti-BLV drugs. Therefore, it is suggested that vioE is a novel antiviral compound against BLV.","['Murakami, Hironobu', 'Murakami-Kawai, Makoto', 'Kamisuki, Shinji', 'Hisanobu, Shibasaki', 'Tsurukawa, Yukine', 'Uchiyama, Jumpei', 'Sakaguchi, Masahiro', 'Tsukamoto, Kenji']","['Murakami H', 'Murakami-Kawai M', 'Kamisuki S', 'Hisanobu S', 'Tsurukawa Y', 'Uchiyama J', 'Sakaguchi M', 'Tsukamoto K']","['Laboratory of Animal Health II, School of Veterinary Medicine, Azabu University, 1-17-71 Fuchinobe, Chuo-ku, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, 252-5201, Japan; Center for Human and Animal Symbiosis Science, Azabu University, 1-17-71 Fuchinobe, Chuo-ku, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, 252-5201, Japan.

Patients receive a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-enriched donor cell infusion also containing immune cells, which may have a beneficial effect by eliminating residual neoplastic cells. However, the effect that donor innate immune cells may have on the donor HSCs has not been deeply explored. Here, we evaluate the influence of donor natural killer (NK) cells on HSC fate, concluded that NK cells negatively affect HSC frequency and function, and identified interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) as a potential mediator. Interestingly, improved HSC fitness was achieved by NK cell depletion from murine and human donor infusions or by blocking IFNgamma activity. Thus, our data suggest that suppression of inflammatory signals generated by donor innate immune cells can enhance engraftment and hematopoietic reconstitution during HSCT, which is particularly critical when limited HSC numbers are available and the risk of engraftment failure is high.","['Lobo de Figueiredo-Pontes, Lorena', 'Adamcova, Miroslava K', 'Grusanovic, Srdjan', 'Kuzmina, Maria', 'Aparecida Lopes, Izabela', 'Fernandes de Oliveira Costa, Amanda', 'Zhang, Hong', 'Strnad, Hynek', 'Lee, Sanghoon', 'Moudra, Alena', 'Jonasova, Anna T', 'Zidka, Michal', 'Welner, Robert S', 'Tenen, Daniel G', 'Alberich-Jorda, Meritxell']","['Lobo de Figueiredo-Pontes L', 'Adamcova MK', 'Grusanovic S', 'Kuzmina M', 'Aparecida Lopes I', 'Fernandes de Oliveira Costa A', 'Zhang H', 'Strnad H', 'Lee S', 'Moudra A', 'Jonasova AT', 'Zidka M', 'Welner RS', 'Tenen DG', 'Alberich-Jorda M']","['Hematology Division, Department of Medical Images, Hematology, and Clinical Oncology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP 14048-900, Brazil.', 'Department of Hemato-oncology, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague 142 00, Czech Republic; Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Pediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, University Hospital Motol, Prague 150 06, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hemato-oncology, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague 142 00, Czech Republic; Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Pediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, University Hospital Motol, Prague 150 06, Czech Republic; Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague 128 00, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hemato-oncology, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague 142 00, Czech Republic; Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague 128 00, Czech Republic.', 'Hematology Division, Department of Medical Images, Hematology, and Clinical Oncology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP 14048-900, Brazil.', 'Hematology Division, Department of Medical Images, Hematology, and Clinical Oncology, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP 14048-900, Brazil.', 'Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Genomics and Bioinformatics, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague 142 00, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Systems Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', '1(st) Department of Medicine - Department of Haematology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague and General University Hospital, Prague 120 00, Czech Republic.', '1(st) Department of Medicine - Department of Haematology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague and General University Hospital, Prague 120 00, Czech Republic.', 'Orthopaedic Department CLPA-Mediterra, Prague 190 00, Czech Republic; 3(rd) Medical Faculty, Charles University, Prague 100 00, Czech Republic.', 'Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Medicine, Division Hematology/Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.', 'Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Cancer Science Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117599, Singapore.

Patients with TNBC have a very poor prognosis because the disease often metastasizes. New treatment approaches addressing drivers of metastasis and tumor growth are crucial to improving patient outcomes. Developing targeted gene therapy is thus a high priority for TNBC patients. PEA15 (phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes, 15 kDa) is known to bind to ERK, preventing ERK from being translocated to the nucleus and hence blocking its activity. The biological function of PEA15 is tightly regulated by its phosphorylation at Ser104 and Ser116. However, the function and impact of phosphorylation status of PEA15 in the regulation of TNBC metastasis and in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are not well understood. METHODS: We established stable cell lines overexpressing nonphosphorylatable (PEA15-AA) and phospho-mimetic (PEA15-DD) mutants. To dissect specific cellular mechanisms regulated by PEA15 phosphorylation status, we performed RT-PCR immune and metastasis arrays. In vivo mouse models were used to determine the effects of PEA15 phosphorylation on tumor growth and metastasis. RESULTS: We found that the nonphosphorylatable mutant PEA15-AA prevented formation of mammospheres and expression of EMT markers in vitro and decreased tumor growth and lung metastasis in in vivo experiments when compared to control, PEA15-WT and phosphomimetic PEA15-DD. However, phosphomimetic mutant PEA15-DD promoted migration, mesenchymal marker expression, tumorigenesis, and lung metastasis in the mouse model. PEA15-AA-mediated inhibition of breast cancer cell migratory capacity and tumorigenesis was the partial result of decreased expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8). Further, we identified that expression of IL-8 was possibly mediated through one of the ERK downstream molecules, Ets-1. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that PEA15 phosphorylation status serves as an important regulator for PEA15's dual role as an oncogene or tumor suppressor and support the potential of PEA15-AA as a therapeutic strategy for treatment of TNBC.","['Park, Jihyun', 'Tacam, Moises J', 'Chauhan, Gaurav', 'Cohen, Evan N', 'Gagliardi, Maria', 'Iles, Lakesla R', 'Ueno, Naoto T', 'Battula, Venkata L', 'Sohn, Yoo-Kyoung', 'Wang, Xiaoping', 'Kim, Hak-Sung', 'Krishnamurthy, Savitri', 'Fowlkes, Natalie W', 'Green, Morgan M', 'Bartholomeusz, Geoffrey A', 'Tripathy, Debu', 'Reuben, James M', 'Bartholomeusz, Chandra']","['Park J', 'Tacam MJ', 'Chauhan G', 'Cohen EN', 'Gagliardi M', 'Iles LR', 'Ueno NT', 'Battula VL', 'Sohn YK', 'Wang X', 'Kim HS', 'Krishnamurthy S', 'Fowlkes NW', 'Green MM', 'Bartholomeusz GA', 'Tripathy D', 'Reuben JM', 'Bartholomeusz C']","['Section of Translational Breast Cancer Research, Department of Breast Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Section of Translational Breast Cancer Research, Department of Breast Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Section of Translational Breast Cancer Research, Department of Breast Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Section of Translational Breast Cancer Research, Department of Breast Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Section of Translational Breast Cancer Research, Department of Breast Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Section of Translational Breast Cancer Research, Department of Breast Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Section of Translational Breast Cancer Research, Department of Breast Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine & Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine & Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Breast Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Section of Translational Breast Cancer Research, Department of Breast Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. chbartho@mdanderson.org.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5806-1557'],['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA016672/Foundation for the National Institutes of Health', 'R00CA139006/Foundation for the National Institutes of Health', '111411-15/University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center']",['Journal Article'],20210709,Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (PEA15 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', '*Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8', 'Mice', '*Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/genetics']",PMC8357760,['NOTNLM'],"['EMT', 'Ets-1', 'IL-8', 'PEA15', 'Triple-negative breast cancer']",2021/07/10 06:00,2021/08/14 06:00,['2021/07/09 12:23'],"['2020/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/09 12:23 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10549-021-06316-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s10549-021-06316-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2021 Sep;189(2):333-345. doi: 10.1007/s10549-021-06316-2.

Blood samples were collected and drug concentrations were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Population pharmacokinetic analysis and Monte-Carlo simulations were performed using NONMEM software, and safety analyses were assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.0 (NCT03844360). RESULTS: Twenty pediatric patients (3.3-14.4 years of age) were included, and a total of 40 dasatinib concentrations were available for population pharmacokinetic analysis. The mean (standard deviation) of the estimated area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to steady state (AUCss) of dasatinib 60 and 80 mg/m(2) was 366.1 (146.6) ng.h/mL and 425.3 (150.7) ng.h/mL, respectively. The majority of adverse events were grade 1/2 in severity, including thrombocytopenia, rash, and pain in the extremities. The estimated cumulative incidence of complete remission and complete molecular response were 95.0% and 75.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The population pharmacokinetics of orally administered dasatinib were evaluated in pediatric CBF-AML patients. The AUCss of dasatinib (80 mg/m(2)) in CBF-AML pediatric patients was similar to those of dasatinib (100 mg) in adult patients. Dasatinib is well-tolerated in pediatric patients with CBF-AML.","['Yang, Fan', 'Zhang, Li', 'Zhao, Bei-Bei', 'Zhang, Jing-Liao', 'Liu, Xi-Ting', 'Li, Xue', 'Tang, Bo-Hao', 'Zhou, Yue', 'Yang, Xin-Mei', 'van den Anker, John', 'Zhu, Xiao-Fan', 'Zhao, Wei']","['Yang F', 'Zhang L', 'Zhao BB', 'Zhang JL', 'Liu XT', 'Li X', 'Tang BH', 'Zhou Y', 'Yang XM', 'van den Anker J', 'Zhu XF', 'Zhao W']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Clinical Trial Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Shandong Engineering and Technology Research Center for Pediatric Drug Development, Shandong Medicine and Health Key Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacy, Jinan, China.', ""Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Children's National Hospital, Washington, DC, USA."", 'Departments of Pediatrics, Pharmacology and Physiology, Genomics and Precision Medicine, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.', ""Department of Paediatric Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, University Children's Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland."", 'Department of Pediatrics, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, Tianjin, 300020, China. xfzhu@ihcams.ac.cn.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China. zhao4wei2@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Clinical Trial Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Shandong Engineering and Technology Research Center for Pediatric Drug Development, Shandong Medicine and Health Key Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacy, Jinan, China. zhao4wei2@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, No.44, Wenhua West Road, Jinan, Shandong, China. zhao4wei2@hotmail.com.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1830-338X'],['eng'],"['81670112/National Nature Science Foundation of China', '81770175/National Nature Science Foundation of China', '81890992/National Nature Science Foundation of China', '8190011827/National Nature Science Foundation of China', '2017ZX09304029-002/National Science and Technology Major Project', '2018RC310019/Non-profit Central Research Institute Fund of Chinese Academy of', 'Medical Sciences']",['Journal Article'],20210709,Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,,IM,,,,,2021/07/10 06:00,2021/07/10 06:00,['2021/07/09 07:13'],"['2021/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/09 07:13 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40262-021-01054-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s40262-021-01054-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 2022 Jan;61(1):71-81. doi: 10.1007/s40262-021-01054-6.

In adults, those fractures are usually associated with poor bone quality, however, this is not the case in children. It is a fracture that requires emergent intervention to prevent devastating skin and soft-tissue-related complications. Case Report: We report a case of a 9-year-old female who had a displaced calcaneal tuberosity fracture with heel skin impending compromise, after a fall at an indoor gymnastic facility. The child had a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, diagnosed at age 4, she was in remission at the time of injury. In the present report, besides reporting a rare injury among the pediatric population, we also describe the operative management, the post-operative course, and we review the literature. Conclusion: Pediatric calcaneal tuberosity fractures, although rare, can lead to devastating complications if not addressed promptly, and should be treated in an expedited fashion.","['Saleh, Ehab S', 'Elabd, Ahmed']","['Saleh ES', 'Elabd A']","['Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine, Rochester, Michigan.', ""Department of Orthopedic Surgery and Rehabilitation, Texas Children's Hospital, Texas.""]",,['eng'],,['Case Reports'],,India,J Orthop Case Rep,Journal of orthopaedic case reports,101641392,,,,PMC8241249,['NOTNLM'],"['Pediatric', 'calcaneal tuberosity', 'skin compromise']",2021/07/10 06:00,2021/07/10 06:01,['2021/07/09 07:00'],"['2021/07/09 07:00 [entrez]', '2021/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.13107/jocr.2021.v11.i02.2072 [doi]', 'JOCR-11-25 [pii]']",ppublish,J Orthop Case Rep. 2021 Mar;11(3):25-28. doi: 10.13107/jocr.2021.v11.i02.2072.,25-28,['Copyright: (c) Indian Orthopaedic Research Group.'],,,,['Conflict of Interest: Nil'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ibrutinib is a novel bruton kinase (BTK) inhibitor increasingly used in CLL treatment. Ibrutinib has significant side effects such as atrial fibrillation, bleeding, diarrhea, and infections. However, TLS is reported rarely with ibrutinib treatment. This report focuses on a 69-year-old female patient diagnosed with relapsed CLL who developed grade 4 TLS after ibrutinib monotherapy. The patient developed TLS on the third day of ibrutinib treatment necessitating discontinuation of the treatment and initiation of hemodialysis and supportive care. Ibrutinib treatment was re-initiated at a daily dose of 140 mg therapy after an interval of seven days, and then any additional side effect was not seen. Tumor lysis syndrome secondary to ibrutinib has been reported in an increasing number of cases. There is currently no information on managing adverse effects of TLS attributed to ibrutinib. Consequently, ibrutinib treatment of this patient was not terminated, and restarted after a short interval. It must not be forgotten that TLS secondary to ibrutinib treatment may be rarely seen, and can be life-threatening. Treatment with ibrutinib should be initiated in consideration of this side effect, and the development of complication of TLS may not necessitate discontinuation of ibrutinib treatment.","['Ozturk, Erman', 'Erdogan Ozunal, Isil']","['Ozturk E', 'Erdogan Ozunal I']","['Istanbul Medeniyet University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Goztepe Prof Dr Suleyman Yalcin City Hospital, Department of Hematology, Istanbul, Turkey.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1559-8047', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5289-7134']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210618,Turkey,Medeni Med J,Medeniyet medical journal,101676811,,,,PMC8226401,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Ibrutinib', 'Tumor lysis syndrome']",2021/07/10 06:00,2021/07/10 06:01,['2021/07/09 06:59'],"['2021/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/09 06:59 [entrez]', '2021/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5222/MMJ.2021.56424 [doi]'],ppublish,Medeni Med J. 2021;36(2):176-179. doi: 10.5222/MMJ.2021.56424.

Methods: In our study, seven R/R DLBCL patients reached stable disease (SD) or progression of disease (PD) after their anti-CD19-CAR T cell therapy. Only three in all the six R/R B-ALL patients obtained complete response (CR)/CR with incomplete count recovery (Cri) in their anti-CD19-CAR T cell therapy, but they relapsed again in the following three, six and one months. Then, all these thirteen R/R DLBCL and B-ALL patients received anti-CD22 CAR-T cell salvage therapy because their disease did not reach CR or progressed again. Results: Four R/R DLBCL patients obtained CR, while two R/R DLBCL patients achieved PR and one patient achieved SD. But only two R/R B-ALL patients obtained Cri in their anti-CD22 CAR-T cell salvage therapy. The overall survival (OS) of R/R DLBCL patients after the anti-CD22 CAR-T cell therapy was 6.142+/-3.395 months until August 31, 2020. There was no different of the median expansion peaks of the two kinds of CAR T cells (P=0.920). The time of anti-CD22-CAR T cell proportion peak days was later than that of the time of anti-CD19-CAR T cell peak days post infusion (P=0.022). Their cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was graded 2-4 in their anti-CD19-CAR T cell therapy, while the notable CRS was graded 1-2 in their anti-CD22-CAR T cell therapy. But there was no difference in the CRS and the immune effect or cell associated neurotoxic syndrome (ICANS) grades in the two kinds of therapies. And there was no difference in the hematological toxicity grades in the two kinds of therapies. Conclusion: The anti-CD22-CAR T cell salvage therapy is highly effective in R/R DLBCL patients than in R/R B-ALL patients who failed in anti-CD19-CAR T cell therapy before. We need to expand the number of R/R DLBCL or B-ALL patients and continue to observe.

We identified that inhibition of Thioredoxin Reductase (TrxR) is a promising strategy for AML and report a highly potent and specific inhibitor of TrxR, S-250. Both pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of TrxR impairs the growth of human AML in mouse models. We found that TrxR inhibition leads to a rapid and marked impairment of metabolism in leukemic cells subsequently leading to cell death. TrxR was found to be a major and direct regulator of metabolism in AML cells through impacts on both glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Studies revealed that TrxR directly regulates GAPDH leading to a disruption of glycolysis and an increase in flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The combined inhibition of TrxR and the PPP led to enhanced leukemia growth inhibition.

Using a well-established ex vivo protocol of canonical T-cell receptor signaling, we generated genome-wide chromatin maps of naive T-cells from pediatric donors in quiescent or recently activated states. We identified thousands of individual chromatin accessibility peaks that are associated with T-cell activation, the majority of which were annotated intronic and intergenic enhancer regions. A core set of 3268 gene promoters underwent chromatin remodeling and concomitant changes in gene expression in response to activation, and were enriched in multiple pathways controlling cell cycle regulation, metabolism, inflammatory response genes and cell survival. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was among those factors that gained the highest accessibility and expression, in addition to IL2-STAT5 dependent chromatin remodeling in the T-cell activation response. Using publicly available data we found the chromatin response was far more dynamic at 24-h compared with 72-h post-activation. In total 546 associations were reproduced at both time-points with similar strength of evidence and directionality of effect. At the pathways level, the IL2-STAT5, KRAS signalling and UV response pathways were replicable at both time-points, although differentially modulated from 24 to 72 h post-activation.","['Iqbal, Muhammad Munir', 'Serralha, Michael', 'Kaur, Parwinder', 'Martino, David']","['Iqbal MM', 'Serralha M', 'Kaur P', 'Martino D']","[""Telethon Kids Institute, Northern Entrance, Perth Children's Hospital, 15 Hospital Avenue, Nedlands, Perth, WA, 6009, Australia."", ""Telethon Kids Institute, Northern Entrance, Perth Children's Hospital, 15 Hospital Avenue, Nedlands, Perth, WA, 6009, Australia."", 'UWA School of Agriculture and Environment, The University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Nedlands, Perth, WA, 6009, Australia.', ""Telethon Kids Institute, Northern Entrance, Perth Children's Hospital, 15 Hospital Avenue, Nedlands, Perth, WA, 6009, Australia.

We selected 238 NPM1(mut) patients with available NGS information on 112 genes related to blood diseases using the chi2 and Mann-Whitney U tests and a multivariable logistic model to analyze the correlation between genomic alterations and clinicopathologic parameters. Compared with the NPM1(mut)/FLT3-ITD((-)) group, the NPM1(mut)/FLT3-ITD((+)) group presented borderline frequent M5 morphology [78/143 (54.5%) vs. 64/95 (67.4%); P = 0.048], higher CD34- and CD7-positive rates (CD34: 20.6% vs. 47.9%, P < 0.001; CD7: 29.9% vs. 61.5%, P < 0.001) and a lack of favorable-/adverse-risk karyotypes (6.4% vs. 0%; P = 0.031). In the entire NPM1(mut) cohort, 240 NPM1 mutants were identified, of which 10 (10/240, 4.2%) were missense types. When confining the analysis to the 205 cases with NPM1(mut) insertions/deletions-type and normal karyotype, multivariable logistic analysis showed that FLT3-ITD was positively correlated with CD34 and CD7 expressions (OR = 5.29 [95% CI 2.64-10.60], P < 0.001; OR = 3.47 [95% CI 1.79-6.73], P < 0.001, respectively). Ras-pathway mutations were positively correlated with HLA-DR expression (OR = 4.05 [95% CI 1.70-9.63], P = 0.002), and KRAS mutations were negatively correlated with MPO expression (OR = 0.18 [95% CI 0.05-0.62], P = 0.007). DNMT3A-R882 was positively correlated with CD7 and HLA-DR expressions (OR = 3.59 [95% CI 1.80-7.16], P < 0.001; OR = 13.41 [95% CI 4.56-39.45], P < 0.001, respectively). DNMT3A mutation was negatively correlated with MPO expression (OR = 0.35 [95% CI 1.48-8.38], P = 0.004). TET2/IDH1 mutations were negatively correlated with CD34 and CD7 expressions (OR = 0.26 [95% CI 0.11-0.62], P = 0.002; OR = 0.30 [95% CI 0.14-0.62], P = 0.001, respectively) and positively correlated with MPO expression (OR = 3.52 [95% CI 1.48-8.38], P = 0.004). In conclusion, NPM1(mut) coexisting mutations in signaling pathways (FLT3-ITD and Ras-signaling pathways) and methylation modifiers (DNMT3A and TET2/IDH1) are linked with the expressions of CD34, CD7, HLA-DR and MPO, thereby providing a mechanistic explanation for the immunophenotypic heterogeneity of this AML entity.","['Wang, Biao', 'Yang, Bin', 'Wu, Wei', 'Liu, Xuan', 'Li, Haiqian']","['Wang B', 'Yang B', 'Wu W', 'Liu X', 'Li H']","[""Department of Hematology, Changzhou First People's Hospital (The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University), Changzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Changzhou First People's Hospital (The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University), Changzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Changzhou First People's Hospital (The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University), Changzhou, China."", 'Blood Research Laboratory, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Changzhou First People's Hospital (The Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University), Changzhou, China. lhz0125@163.com.""]",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5887-7142'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210708,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Female', 'Genotype', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin']",PMC8268444,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'FLT3-ITD', 'Immunophenotype', 'NPM1', 'Next-generation sequencing']",2021/07/10 06:00,2021/11/03 06:00,['2021/07/09 05:44'],"['2020/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/09 05:44 [entrez]', '2021/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-021-08455-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-021-08455-7 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2021 Jul 8;21(1):788. doi: 10.1186/s12885-021-08455-7.,788,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genomics is useful to elucidate the mutational landscape but remains limited in the prediction of therapeutic outcome and identification of targets for resistance. Dysregulation of phosphorylation-based signaling pathways is a hallmark of cancer, and therefore, kinase-inhibitors are playing an increasingly important role as targeted treatments. Untargeted phosphoproteomics analysis pipelines have been published but show limitations in inferring kinase-activities and identifying potential biomarkers of response and resistance. METHODS: We developed a phosphoproteomics workflow based on titanium dioxide phosphopeptide enrichment with subsequent analysis by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). We applied a novel Kinase-Activity Enrichment Analysis (KAEA) pipeline on differential phosphoproteomics profiles, which is based on the recently published SetRank enrichment algorithm with reduced false positive rates. Kinase activities were inferred by this algorithm using an extensive reference database comprising five experimentally validated kinase-substrate meta-databases complemented with the NetworKIN in-silico prediction tool. For the proof of concept, we used human myeloid cell lines (K562, NB4, THP1, OCI-AML3, MOLM13 and MV4-11) with known oncogenic drivers and exposed them to clinically established kinase-inhibitors. RESULTS: Biologically meaningful over- and under-active kinases were identified by KAEA in the unperturbed human myeloid cell lines (K562, NB4, THP1, OCI-AML3 and MOLM13). To increase the inhibition signal of the driving oncogenic kinases, we exposed the K562 (BCR-ABL1) and MOLM13/MV4-11 (FLT3-ITD) cell lines to either Nilotinib or Midostaurin kinase inhibitors, respectively. We observed correct detection of expected direct (ABL, KIT, SRC) and indirect (MAPK) targets of Nilotinib in K562 as well as indirect (PRKC, MAPK, AKT, RPS6K) targets of Midostaurin in MOLM13/MV4-11, respectively. Moreover, our pipeline was able to characterize unexplored kinase-activities within the corresponding signaling networks. CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated a novel KAEA pipeline for the analysis of differential phosphoproteomics MS profiling data. We provide translational researchers with an improved instrument to characterize the biological behavior of kinases in response or resistance to targeted treatment. Further investigations are warranted to determine the utility of KAEA to characterize mechanisms of disease progression and treatment failure using primary patient samples.","['Hallal, Mahmoud', 'Braga-Lagache, Sophie', 'Jankovic, Jovana', 'Simillion, Cedric', 'Bruggmann, Remy', 'Uldry, Anne-Christine', 'Allam, Ramanjaneyulu', 'Heller, Manfred', 'Bonadies, Nicolas']","['Hallal M', 'Braga-Lagache S', 'Jankovic J', 'Simillion C', 'Bruggmann R', 'Uldry AC', 'Allam R', 'Heller M', 'Bonadies N']","['Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department for BioMedical Research (DBMR), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department for BioMedical Research (DBMR), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department for BioMedical Research (DBMR), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Interfaculty Bioinformatics Unit and Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Interfaculty Bioinformatics Unit and Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department for BioMedical Research (DBMR), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department for BioMedical Research (DBMR), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department for BioMedical Research (DBMR), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.

And some clinical trials have also confirmed the excellent efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors on lymphoma. However, the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors on leukemia remains unclear. Main body: To understand the connection between PD-1/PD-L1 and leukemia better, this review concentrates on the up-regulated expression of PD-1/PD-L1 and the PD-1/PD-L1 blockade trials in participants with leukemia. PD-1/PD-L1 signal performs momentously negative immunoregulation of cancer, which can inhibit the activation of cytotoxic T cells and involve in the immune escape in tumors. Activated PD-1/PD-L1 may transduce negative intracellular signals to block the mitotic cycle and the development of T-cells. Several pathways are involved in these critical biochemical processes, including MAPK, Calcium, PI3K/AKT, and so on. Lately, PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies have illustrated unprecedented curative effects in the field of Hodgkin's lymphoma and some solid tumors. Specimens from patients with leukemia demonstrated the elevated level of PD-1/PD-L1 in T lymphocytes. This finding inspired hematologists to use PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors for subjects suffering from leukemia. Some clinical trials implied that PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors could help patients fight against leukemia. However, other researchers reported the opposite results. CONCLUSIONS: PD-1/PD-L1 is upregulated in leukemia, but the results regarding PD-1/PD-L1 blockade are mixed and more clinical trials are needed to be conducted.","['Xing, Kai', 'Zhou, Pan', 'Li, Jiaojiao', 'Liu, Miao', 'Zhang, Wei Emma']","['Xing K', 'Zhou P', 'Li J', 'Liu M', 'Zhang WE']","['Department of Pediatrics, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China.', 'Hubei Medical Devices, Quality Supervision and Test Institute, Wuhan 430075, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China.', 'School of Computer Science, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia.

In fact, most of these studies have not involved patients with advanced haematologic cancer (HC), which are known to be associated with significant physical and psychological symptoms. In Hong Kong, an Early Integrated Palliative Care (EIPC) collaboration involving both Heamatology unit of Queen Mary Hospital (QMH) and the Palliative Medical Unit of Grantham Hospital (GH) has been started since early 2018 as a better way to improve the service gap. The HC patients failed 2 or more lines of cancer treatment are identified during the joint round and hematology clinic. Some of these patients will be referred to our PC services. Our joint PC clinic has multidisciplinary input from palliative care physicians, hematologists, and clinical psychologists. The clinic program is well coordinated and structured. The HC patients are initially seen by the parent team for disease treatment and then by GH PC team for symptom control and psychosocial care. METHODS: This was a retrospective study with a review of the clinical charts and electronic healthcare records of all patients who attended the Hematology PC clinic from June 2018 to September 2020. For the inclusion criteria, patients were found eligible if they had prospectively completed Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) assessments for at least the initial and follow-up visits within a range of >/=7 days and </=60 days of the first visit. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients ultimately agreed to the referral. The mean age was 70.5 (12.5) years old. Twenty-five patients (66%) had myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); 10 (26%) had acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Around 50-60% of patients reported significant symptoms of fatigue, anxiety, drowsiness, and anorexia; 42% of patients had significantly depressed moods while 37% had pain. There were significant symptom improvements for pain, depression, and anxiety after follow-up visits. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that our EIPC program resulted in a significant reduction in some of the important symptom item scores, including pain, anorexia, anxiety, and depression, after the follow-up visits.","['Chan, Kwok Ying', 'Gill, Harinder', 'Chan, Thomas Sau Yan', 'Li, Cho Wing', 'Tsang, Kwok Wai', 'Au, Ho Yan', 'Wong, Chi Yan', 'Hui, Chun Him']","['Chan KY', 'Gill H', 'Chan TSY', 'Li CW', 'Tsang KW', 'Au HY', 'Wong CY', 'Hui CH']","['Palliative Medical Unit, Grantham Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China; Department of medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Palliative Medical Unit, Grantham Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Palliative Medical Unit, Grantham Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Palliative Medical Unit, Grantham Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Palliative Medical Unit, Grantham Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Palliative Medical Unit, Grantham Hospital, Hong Kong, China.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Ann Palliat Med,Annals of palliative medicine,101585484,,IM,"['Aged', '*Hematology', 'Hong Kong', 'Humans', '*Neoplasms', '*Palliative Care', 'Retrospective Studies']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Early palliative care (early PC)', '*haematology palliative care', '*symptom burden']",2021/07/10 06:00,2021/07/13 06:00,['2021/07/09 05:32'],"['2021/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/09 05:32 [entrez]', '2021/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.21037/apm-21-276 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Palliat Med. 2021 Jun;10(6):6316-6324. doi: 10.21037/apm-21-276.,6316-6324,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also preliminarily explored the relationship between NFAT2 and miR-20a-5p in naive T cells. These results suggest that NFAT2 and miR-20a are crucial for regulating functional CD8(+) T cells. Additionally, their alteration may be related to CD8(+) T cell dysfunction in CML patients; thus, NFAT2 and miR-20a-5p may be considered potential targets for revising T cell function in leukemia immunotherapy.","['Zhang, Yikai', 'Wu, Jialu', 'Zeng, Chengwu', 'Xu, Ling', 'Wei, Wei', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Zhang Y', 'Wu J', 'Zeng C', 'Xu L', 'Wei W', 'Li Y']","['Depart of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China; Guangzhou Municipality Tianhe Nuoya Bio-engineering Co.

Further analysis showed that circPVT1 could bind directly to miR-30e and contributed to the activate the Notch signaling by regulating miR-30e/DLL4 pathway. The levels of circPVT1 were obviously related to cumulative relapse rate and 5-year survival rate.

Its composition is influenced by seasonal, climatic and phytogeographic conditions. Further variability derives from the extraction methods. Multi Dynamic Extraction Method (MED) has been recently proposed to improve extracts reproducibility. Here, the cytotoxic/anticancer activity of three MED extracts of poplar-type propolis was assayed on human promyelocytic leukaemia HL60, human monocytic leukaemia THP-1, human osteosarcoma MG63, murine fibroblast L929 and human mesenchymal cells (hMSCs). As far as we are aware of, MG63 cells have never been challenged with propolis before, while few studies have so far addressed the effects of propolis on non-tumor cell lines. Consistent results were observed for all propolis preparations. The extracts turned out mildly cytotoxic toward cancer cells, in particular osteosarcoma cells (IC50: 81.9-86.7 microg/ml). Nonetheless, cytotoxicity was observed also in non-tumor L929 cells, with an even lower IC50. hMSCs demonstrated the lowest sensitivity to propolis (IC50: 258.3-287.2 microg/ml). In THP-1 cells, extracts were found to stimulate apoptosis caspase 3/7 activity. The IC50 values observed with osteosarcoma and leukaemia cells do not support a relevant cytotoxicity (as the figures abundantly exceeded 30 microg/ml), despites some selective activity exhibited with HL60 cells. The results confirm the validity of the extraction method, emphasizing the need to assess the selectivity of the interaction with cancer cells when screening for anticancer-drug candidates.","['Campoccia, Davide', 'Ravaioli, Stefano', 'Santi, Spartaco', 'Mariani, Valentina', 'Santarcangelo, Cristina', 'De Filippis, Anna', 'Montanaro, Lucio', 'Arciola, Carla Renata', 'Daglia, Maria']","['Campoccia D', 'Ravaioli S', 'Santi S', 'Mariani V', 'Santarcangelo C', 'De Filippis A', 'Montanaro L', 'Arciola CR', 'Daglia M']","[""Laboratorio di Patologia delle Infezioni Associate all'Impianto, IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, via di Barbiano 1/10, 40136 Bologna, Italy.

However, IFN-gamma-producing Th1 cells were not induced by NLRP3-activated BMDCs in the presence of the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 or anti-IL-1beta antibody in vitro unless exogenous IL-1beta was replenished. This inhibitory effect on Th1 differentiation was also observed in Nlrp3(-/-) mice or anti-IL-1beta antibody-treated mice. Notably, elevated Th1 cell levels promoted apoptosis and inhibited proliferation in leukemia cells via IFN-gamma secretion in vitro and in vivo.

In a diagnostic set-up, especially for hematological malignancies, the comprehensive analysis of all SVs in a given sample still requires a combination of cytogenetic techniques, including karyotyping, FISH, and CNV microarrays. We hypothesize that the combination of these classical approaches could be replaced by optical genome mapping (OGM). Samples from 52 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of a hematological malignancy, divided into simple (<5 aberrations, n = 36) and complex (>/=5 aberrations, n = 16) cases, were processed for OGM, reaching on average: 283-fold genome coverage. OGM called a total of 918 high-confidence SVs per sample, of which, on average, 13 were rare and >100 kb. In addition, on average, 73 CNVs were called per sample, of which six were >5 Mb. For the 36 simple cases, all clinically reported aberrations were detected, including deletions, insertions, inversions, aneuploidies, and translocations. For the 16 complex cases, results were largely concordant between standard-of-care and OGM, but OGM often revealed higher complexity than previously recognized. Detailed technical comparison with standard-of-care tests showed high analytical validity of OGM, resulting in a sensitivity of 100% and a positive predictive value of >80%. Importantly, OGM resulted in a more complete assessment than any previous single test and most likely reported the most accurate underlying genomic architecture (e.g., for complex translocations, chromoanagenesis, and marker chromosomes). In conclusion, the excellent concordance of OGM with diagnostic standard assays demonstrates its potential to replace classical cytogenetic tests as well as to rapidly map novel leukemia drivers.","['Neveling, Kornelia', 'Mantere, Tuomo', 'Vermeulen, Susan', 'Oorsprong, Michiel', 'van Beek, Ronald', 'Kater-Baats, Ellen', 'Pauper, Marc', 'van der Zande, Guillaume', 'Smeets, Dominique', 'Weghuis, Daniel Olde', 'Stevens-Kroef, Marian J P L', 'Hoischen, Alexander']","['Neveling K', 'Mantere T', 'Vermeulen S', 'Oorsprong M', 'van Beek R', 'Kater-Baats E', 'Pauper M', 'van der Zande G', 'Smeets D', 'Weghuis DO', 'Stevens-Kroef MJPL', 'Hoischen A']","['Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen 6500 HB, the Netherlands; Radboud Institute of Health Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen 6500 HB, the Netherlands; Radboud Institute of Medical Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands; Laboratory of Cancer Genetics and Tumor Biology, Cancer and Translational Medicine Research Unit and Biocenter Oulu, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen 6500 HB, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen 6500 HB, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen 6500 HB, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen 6500 HB, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen 6500 HB, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen 6500 HB, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen 6500 HB, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen 6500 HB, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen 6500 HB, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen 6500 HB, the Netherlands; Radboud Institute of Medical Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands; Department of Internal Medicine and Radboud Center for Infectious Diseases, Radboud University Medical Center, 6532 GA Nijmegen, the Netherlands.

CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic editing techniques in combination with viral reconstitution are powerful tools that now enable the investigation of the exact molecular mechanisms that govern T cell signalling, especially the impact of protein-protein interactions, protein modifications, or cancer-associated gain- or loss-of-function mutations. As exemplified by the CARD11 gene encoding a key regulator of NF-kappaB signalling in T cells, we describe here the detailed workflow for the generation of CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (KO) Jurkat T cells and the subsequent reconstitution using a lentiviral transduction protocol.

The low sensitivity of the conventional methods, low tumor burden in some patients, and the need for bone marrow sampling are some of the diagnostic challenges on the way of proper detection of APL. Given these, we aimed to compare the efficacy of extracellular vesicles (EVs), as a diagnostic tool, with the existing methods. RT-PCR, qPCR, and flow cytometry were applied on EVs and their corresponding associated cellular component collected from 18 APL new cases, 23 patients with minimal residual disease (MRD), and NB4 cell line. RT-PCR results were positive in both cellular and vesicular components of all new cases, NB4 cells, and EVs in contrary to MRD cases. Normalized copy numbers (NCN) of PML-RARalpha were 5100 and 3950 for cell and EVs, respectively (p < 0.05). There was a significant difference in the NCN of PML-RARalpha between cells and EVs in BM samples. Investigating the effect of storage at room temperature revealed that PML-RARalpha level was retained near to the baseline level in EVs, but there was a significant reduction in its copy number in the cellular component during 7 days. Taken together, given to the acceptable stability, EVs could be introduced as a non-invasive liquid biopsy that alongside existing methods could remarkably change the paradigm of APL diagnostic approaches.","['Barzegar, Mohieddin', 'Farsani, Mehdi Allahbakhshian', 'Rafiee, Mohammad', 'Amiri, Vahid', 'Parkhihdeh, Sayeh', 'Rad, Fariba', 'Mohammadi, Mohammad Hossein']","['Barzegar M', 'Farsani MA', 'Rafiee M', 'Amiri V', 'Parkhihdeh S', 'Rad F', 'Mohammadi MH']","['Laboratory Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Science, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Darband St, Qods Sq, Tehran, Iran.', 'Laboratory Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Science, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Darband St, Qods Sq, Tehran, Iran.', 'HSCT Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Laboratory Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Science, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Darband St, Qods Sq, Tehran, Iran.', 'Laboratory Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Science, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Darband St, Qods Sq, Tehran, Iran.', 'HSCT Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, School of Allied Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran.', 'Laboratory Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Science, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Darband St, Qods Sq, Tehran, Iran.

Two different approaches have been used for the assessment of MRD by multiparametric flow cytometry that include the ""Leukemia Associated Aberrant Immunophenotype (LAIP)"" and ""Difference from Normal (DFN)"" approach. In this retrospective study, we analyzed 539 samples obtained from 281 patients of which 258 were paired samples and the remaining 23 samples were from post-induction time point only, to explore the utility of baseline immunophenotype (IPT) for MRD assessment. Single-tube 10-color panel was used both at diagnosis and MRD time points. Out of 281 patients, 31.67% (n = 89) were positive and 68.32% (n = 192) were negative for MRD. Among 258 paired diagnostic and follow-up samples, baseline IPT was required in only 9.31% (24/258) cases which included cases with hematogone pattern and isolated dim to negative CD10 expression patterns. Comparison of baseline IPT with post-induction MRD positive samples showed a change in expression of at least one antigen in 94.04% cases. Although the immunophenotypic change in expression of various antigens is frequent in post-induction samples of B-ALL, it does not adversely impact the MRD assessment. In conclusion, the baseline IPT is required in less than 10% of B-ALL, specifically those with hematogone pattern and/or dim to negative expression of CD10. Hence, a combination of DFN and LAIP approach is recommended for reliable MRD assessment.","['Das, Nupur', 'Gupta, Ritu', 'Gupta, Sanjeev Kumar', 'Bakhshi, Sameer', 'Seth, Rachna', 'Kumar, Chandan', 'Rai, Sandeep', 'Singh, Saroj', 'Prajapati, Vijay Kumar', 'Gogia, Ajay', 'Sahoo, Ranjit Kumar', 'Sharma, Atul', 'Kumar, Lalit']","['Das N', 'Gupta R', 'Gupta SK', 'Bakhshi S', 'Seth R', 'Kumar C', 'Rai S', 'Singh S', 'Prajapati VK', 'Gogia A', 'Sahoo RK', 'Sharma A', 'Kumar L']","['Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr B.R.

It belongs to the amidohydrolase class adherent to the family of serine-reliant beta-lactamases and the penicillin-binding proteins due to its higher affinity to polymerize and modify peptidoglycan synthesis. However, based on the catalytic proficiency, L-glutaminase is characterized as a proteolytic endopeptidase that cleaves peptide linkage and emancipates various byproducts, viz. ammonia along with glutamate. L-glutamine is considered the key amino acid reportedly involved in multiple metabolic pathways such as nitrogen metabolism. The present review is focused on the recent development and aspects concomitant to the biotechnological applicability of L-glutaminase predominantly from the marine habitat. Additionally, a majority of L-glutaminases finds application in cancer therapy as therapeutic agents, especially for acute lymphocytic leukaemia. The in vitro studies have been effective against various human cancer cell lines. L-glutaminase enhances the growth of probiotic bacteria. Apart from all these applications, it is suitably applicable in fermented foods as a flavour enhancer especially the umami flavour and content. Marine habitats have largely been exploited for their bio-catalytic potential but very scarcely for therapeutic enzymes. Some of the reports of such marine bacterial isolates from Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Vibrio sp. are in the domain, but none highlights the therapeutic applications predominantly as anticancer and anti-proliferative agents. KEY POINTS: The exploration of marine habitats along the Gujarat coasts mainly for bacteria secreting L-glutaminase is scarcely reported, and even more scarce are the amidohydrolases from these marine niches as compared to their terrestrial counterparts. Microbial sourced amidohydrolase has wide bio-applicability that includes food, cosmetics and therapeutics especially as anticancer/anti-proliferative agent making it of immense biotechnological significance.","['Patel, Nidhi Y', 'Baria, Dhritiksha M', 'Yagnik, Shivani M', 'Rajput, Kiransinh N', 'Panchal, Rakesh R', 'Raval, Vikram H']","['Patel NY', 'Baria DM', 'Yagnik SM', 'Rajput KN', 'Panchal RR', 'Raval VH']","['Department of Microbiology and Biotechnology, University School of Sciences, Gujarat University, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, 380 009, India.', 'Department of Microbiology and Biotechnology, University School of Sciences, Gujarat University, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, 380 009, India.', 'Department of Microbiology and Biotechnology, University School of Sciences, Gujarat University, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, 380 009, India.', 'Department of Microbiology and Biotechnology, University School of Sciences, Gujarat University, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, 380 009, India.', 'Department of Microbiology and Biotechnology, University School of Sciences, Gujarat University, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, 380 009, India.', 'Department of Microbiology and Biotechnology, University School of Sciences, Gujarat University, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, 380 009, India. vikramhraval@gmail.com.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5451-3491', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9783-0104', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4712-605X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8669-8347', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8715-8553', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8912-1850']",['eng'],['UGC-BSR Startup grant No.F.30-521/2020 (BSR)/University Grants Commission'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20210708,Germany,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,8406612,"['0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.2 (Glutaminase)']",IM,"['Amidohydrolases', '*Bacillus', 'Ecosystem', '*Glutaminase', 'Glutamine', 'Humans']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-cancer', 'Biotechnological potential', 'Gujarat coasts', 'L-Glutaminase', 'Marine enzymes', 'Probiotic bacteria', 'Umami taste']",2021/07/09 06:00,2021/07/21 06:00,['2021/07/08 12:24'],"['2021/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/08 12:24 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00253-021-11416-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00253-021-11416-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2021 Jul;105(13):5325-5340. doi: 10.1007/s00253-021-11416-6.

However, after reactive causes have been excluded, a workup for primary (clonal) neutrophilic disorders, such as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative overlap syndromes, should be pursued. Except for chronic myeloid leukemia, which is defined by the presence of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, and the classic Ph chromosome-negative MPNs (polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis), clonal neutrophilic neoplasms historically have been challenging to diagnose and classify. The 2016 revised World Health Organization classification of these disorders has been based mainly on clinicopathologic features. However, recent discoveries of the molecular alterations underlying these disorders have served to supplement our knowledge of their morphologic and clinical features, opening new therapeutic avenues. In this review, we discuss the diagnostic approach, prognostic features, and treatments of neutrophilic myeloid neoplasms, with a focus on chronic neutrophilic leukemia, atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.","['Schwede, Matthew', 'Gotlib, Jason', 'Shomali, William']","['Schwede M', 'Gotlib J', 'Shomali W']","['Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine/Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, California.', 'Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine/Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, California.', 'Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine/Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, California.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Disease Management', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Prognosis']",,,,2021/07/09 06:00,2021/07/30 06:00,['2021/07/08 12:17'],"['2021/07/08 12:17 [entrez]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2021 Jul;19(7):450-459.,450-459,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the regulation of B7-H6 by tumor therapeutics remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the regulation of B7-H6 by all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), a terminal differentiation inducer of tumor cells that is extensively used for clinical leukemia therapy. METHODS: We investigated the role of NKp30:B7-H6 axis in NK cell-mediated tumor lysis against leukemia cells and the influence of atRA treatment on the cytotoxicity of NK cells using NK cell lines (NK92 and NKG) and leukemia cell lines (U-937 and THP-1). We evaluated the effect of atRA treatment on the expression of B7-H6 using real-time PCR, flow cytometry and western blotting. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knockdown B7-H6 expression and siRNA to knockdown c-Myc in U-937 cells to evaluate the role of B7-H6 and c-Myc in atRA-induced tumor resistance against NK cells. RESULTS: NK cell-mediated U-937 cell lysis was mainly dependent on NKp30/B7-H6 interaction. Blockade of B7-H6 by monoclonal antibody significantly impaired NK cytotoxicity. atRA treatment induced U-937 resistance to NK cell cytotoxicity by reducing B7-H6 expression, and showed no effect on NK cytotoxicity against B7-H6 knockdown U-937 cells. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone deacetylase (HDAC), were not responsible for atRA-mediated B7-H6 down-regulation as inhibitors of these pathways could not restore B7-H6 mRNA expression. On the other hand, atRA treatment reduced c-Myc expression, which in turn inhibited the transcription of B7-H6 on leukemia cells. CONCLUSION: atRA treatment promotes tumor cell resistance against NK cell-mediated lysis by down-regulating B7-H6 expression via the c-Myc signaling pathway, suggesting that more attention needs to be paid to the immunological adverse effects in the clinical use of atRA treatment.","['Cao, Guoshuai', 'Cheng, Ying', 'Zheng, Xiaodong', 'Wei, Haiming', 'Tian, Zhigang', 'Sun, Rui', 'Sun, Haoyu']","['Cao G', 'Cheng Y', 'Zheng X', 'Wei H', 'Tian Z', 'Sun R', 'Sun H']","['Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, the CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, 230027, P.

Paired analysis of clonotypic repertoires showed a minimal overlap with donor expansions. Rarefied and hyperexpanded clonotypic patterns were hallmarks of T cell reconstitution and influenced clinical outcomes. Donor and pretransplant TCR diversity as well as divergence of class I human leukocyte antigen genotypes were major predictors of recipient TCR repertoire recovery. Complementary determining region 3-based specificity spectrum analysis indicated a predominant expansion of pathogen- and tumor-associated clonotypes in the late post-allo-HCT phase, while autoreactive clones were more expanded in the case of graft-versus-host disease occurrence.

The antibody that only bound to part of the epitope was absorbed and removed. ELISA and Western blotting were performed to determine the antibody titer and specificity. Results The rabbit serum background was low before immunization. The titer of the polyclonal antibody reached 1:32 000 after immunization, which met the experimental requirements. Western blotting showed that the antibody could specifically recognize the b3a2 subtype fusion protein of BCR-ABL. Conclusion The experiment has prepared the specific rabbit polyclonal antibody against BCR-ABL b3a2 subtype.","['Li, Xiangning', 'Qu, Jiayao', 'Jiang, Jing', 'Wang, Li', 'Luo, Dixian', 'Li, Jia', 'Duan, Lili', 'He, Rongzhang', 'Hu, Zheng']","['Li X', 'Qu J', 'Jiang J', 'Wang L', 'Luo D', 'Li J', 'Duan L', 'He R', 'Hu Z']","[""Translational Medicine Institute, Chenzhou Hospital Affiliated to University of South China, Chenzhou 423000; National & Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for High-Through Molecular Diagnosis Technology, Chenzhou Municipal First People's Hospital, Chenzhou 423000, China."", ""Translational Medicine Institute, Chenzhou Hospital Affiliated to University of South China, Chenzhou 423000; First School of Clinical Medicine, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510000; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Shenzhen 518000, China."", ""Translational Medicine Institute, Chenzhou Hospital Affiliated to University of South China, Chenzhou 423000; National & Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for High-Through Molecular Diagnosis Technology, Chenzhou Municipal First People's Hospital, Chenzhou 423000, China."", 'Translational Medicine Institute, Chenzhou Hospital Affiliated to University of South China, Chenzhou 423000; First School of Clinical Medicine, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510000, China.', ""Translational Medicine Institute, Chenzhou Hospital Affiliated to University of South China, Chenzhou 423000; National & Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for High-Through Molecular Diagnosis Technology, Chenzhou Municipal First People's Hospital, Chenzhou 423000; First School of Clinical Medicine, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510000, China."", ""Translational Medicine Institute, Chenzhou Hospital Affiliated to University of South China, Chenzhou 423000; National & Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for High-Through Molecular Diagnosis Technology, Chenzhou Municipal First People's Hospital, Chenzhou 423000, China."", ""Translational Medicine Institute, Chenzhou Hospital Affiliated to University of South China, Chenzhou 423000; National & Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for High-Through Molecular Diagnosis Technology, Chenzhou Municipal First People's Hospital, Chenzhou 423000, China."", ""Translational Medicine Institute, Chenzhou Hospital Affiliated to University of South China, Chenzhou 423000; National & Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for High-Through Molecular Diagnosis Technology, Chenzhou Municipal First People's Hospital, Chenzhou 423000, China."", ""Translational Medicine Institute, Chenzhou Hospital Affiliated to University of South China, Chenzhou 423000; National & Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for High-Through Molecular Diagnosis Technology, Chenzhou Municipal First People's Hospital, Chenzhou 423000; First School of Clinical Medicine, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510000, China. *Corresponding author, E-mail: hu48005@163.com.""]",,['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi,Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,101139110,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Peptides)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Antibodies', 'Blotting, Western', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Peptides', 'Rabbits']",,,,2021/07/09 06:00,2021/07/10 06:00,['2021/07/08 08:42'],"['2021/07/08 08:42 [entrez]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/10 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2021 Aug;37(8):746-751.,746-751,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preclinical studies have shown a potential anti-leukemic action on childhood B-ALL cells. The study involved 65 children with acute leukemia [59 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 6 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)] and 27 healthy controls. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we aimed to determine the IL-23 levels in the peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) of patients at diagnosis and at the end of the induction therapy (EIT). PB IL-23 levels were lower in leukemia patients compared to the healthy controls. In all acute leukemia patients, IL-23 levels were significantly lower at diagnosis both in PB (P = .015) and in BM (P = .037) compared to the PB and BM concentrations at the EIT. The same pattern was present in both subgroups of ALL and AML patients. The high leukemic burden at diagnosis was related with lower IL-23 levels, which were increased with the disease remission. Considering the anti-leukemic potential of this cytokine, the elevation of the IL-23 concentration at the disease remission indicates a beneficial role of IL-23 in paediatric acute leukemia.","['Zampogiannis, Archontis', 'Piperi, Christina', 'Baka, Margarita', 'Zoi, Iliana', 'Papavassiliou, Athanasios G', 'Moschovi, Maria']","['Zampogiannis A', 'Piperi C', 'Baka M', 'Zoi I', 'Papavassiliou AG', 'Moschovi M']","['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit, Medical School, ""Agia Sophia"" Children\'s Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, ""P&A Kyriakou"" Children\'s Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit, Medical School, ""Agia Sophia"" Children\'s Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5605-6685', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5803-4527']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210708,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,,IM,,PMC8335666,['NOTNLM'],"['*IL-23', '*acute leukemia', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*children']",2021/07/09 06:00,2021/07/09 06:00,['2021/07/08 07:08'],"['2021/06/17 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/08 07:08 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.16772 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2021 Aug;25(15):7426-7435. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.16772.

We aimed to evaluate the spectrum of local microorganisms that cause bloodstream infections (BSI) and their AMR patterns in an Egyptian institution treating children with cancer. METHODS: We conducted a single-centre, retrospective, study on children with confirmed primary, hospital-acquired, BSIs over one year. The microbiological examination of blood samples was done according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The antibiotic sensitivity test was done using VITEK(R) 2 system. RESULTS: We retrieved the data of 607 children with a median age of 5 (0.25-18) years old. The most encountered diagnosis was acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (40%). Most identified microorganisms were gram-negative bacilli, mainly Escherichia coli (27.8%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.2%). Gram-negative bacilli showed high resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam, levofloxacin, and meropenem. The lowest resistance rates for Gram-negative bacilli isolates were noted for colistin and tigecycline. Similarly, the gram-positive cocci showed high resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam, cefoxitin, and clindamycin; and low resistance regarding vancomycin and linezolid. CONCLUSION: Resistance proportions (pattern) were similar to those reported in other countries with a higher distribution of E coli and a growing resistance to levofloxacin. Further investigation of the predisposing factors and the development of more effective strategies for the prevention of BSI should be a significant public health priority.","['Elseady, Naema Salah Mohamed', 'Khamis, Nagwa Abdel Ghani Ahmed', 'AbdelGhani, Sameh', 'Rabea, Hoda Mohamed', 'Elanany, Mervat Gaber', 'Nashat Alsheshtawi, Khaled', 'Abdelrahim, Mohamed E A']","['Elseady NSM', 'Khamis NAGA', 'AbdelGhani S', 'Rabea HM', 'Elanany MG', 'Nashat Alsheshtawi K', 'Abdelrahim MEA']","['Infection Prevention and Control Unit, 57357 Children Cancer Hospital, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Beni-Suef University, Beni-Suef, Egypt.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacy Department, Beni-Suef University, Beni-Suef, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Microbiology Unit 57357 - Children Cancer Hospital, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Research Department, 57357 Children Cancer Hospital, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pharmacy Department, Beni-Suef University, Beni-Suef, Egypt.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1542-1265', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0227-8404']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210717,England,Int J Clin Pract,International journal of clinical practice,9712381,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Bacteremia/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Escherichia coli', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', '*Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,2021/07/09 06:00,2021/09/22 06:00,['2021/07/08 07:07'],"['2021/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/22 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/08 07:07 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijcp.14617 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Pract. 2021 Oct;75(10):e14617. doi: 10.1111/ijcp.14617.

The optimal dosage and duration of FA rescue remain controversial. This study was designed to investigate, whether a shorter duration of FA rescue in the setting of rapid HD-MTX clearance is associated with increased toxicity. METHODS: We reviewed the files of 44 children receiving a total of 350 HD-MTX courses during treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia according to the NOPHO ALL-2000 protocol. Following a 5 g/m2 HD-MTX infusion, pharmacokinetically guided FA rescue commenced at hour 42. As per local guidelines, the patients received only one or two 15 mg/m(2) doses of FA in the case of rapid MTX clearance (serum MTX </= 0.2 mumol/L at hour 42 or hour 48, respectively). Data on MTX clearance, FA dosing, inpatient time, and toxicities were collected. RESULTS: Rapid MTX clearance was observed in 181 courses (51.7%). There was no difference in the steady-state MTX concentration, nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, neutropenic fever, or neurotoxicity between courses followed by rapid MTX clearance and those without. One or two doses of FA after rapid MTX clearance resulted in a 7.8-h shorter inpatient time than if a minimum of three doses of FA would have been given. CONCLUSION: A pharmacokinetically guided FA rescue of one or two 15 mg/m(2) doses of FA following HD-MTX courses with rapid MTX clearance results in a shorter hospitalization without an increase in toxic effects.","['Niinimaki, Riitta', 'Aarnivala, Henri', 'Banerjee, Joanna', 'Pokka, Tytti', 'Vepsalainen, Kaisa', 'Harila-Saari, Arja']","['Niinimaki R', 'Aarnivala H', 'Banerjee J', 'Pokka T', 'Vepsalainen K', 'Harila-Saari A']","['Department of Children and Adolescents, Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.', 'PEDEGO Research Unit, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.', 'Department of Children and Adolescents, Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland. henri.aarnivala@oulu.fi.', 'PEDEGO Research Unit, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland. henri.aarnivala@oulu.fi.', 'Children and Adolescents Hospital, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Children and Adolescents, Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.""]","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0190-5664', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2025-3676', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2767-5828']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210708,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,"['Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/adverse effects', '*Methotrexate/adverse effects', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",PMC8636410,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Folinic acid', 'Methotrexate', 'Toxicity']",2021/07/09 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/07/08 06:51'],"['2021/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/08 06:51 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-021-06395-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-021-06395-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2022 Jan;30(1):127-133. doi: 10.1007/s00520-021-06395-3.

In this study, we evaluated the mechanisms involved in the anti-cancer efficacy of BA in U937 human myeloid leukemia cells. BA exerted a significant cytotoxic effect on U937 cells through blocking cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and inducing apoptosis, and that the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels increased after treatment with BA. The down-regulation of cyclin A and cyclin B1, and up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 revealed the G2/M phase arrest mechanism of BA. In addition, BA induced the cytosolic release of cytochrome c by reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential with an increasing Bax/Bcl-2 expression ratio. BA also increased the activity of caspase-9 and -3, and subsequent degradation of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. However, quenching of ROS by N-acetyl-cysteine, an ROS scavenger, markedly abolished BA-induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis, indicating that the generation of ROS plays a key role in inhibiting the proliferation of U937 cells by BA treatment. Taken together, our results provide a mechanistic rationale that BA exhibits anti-cancer properties in U937 leukemia cells through ROS-dependent induction of cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and apoptosis.","['Park, Cheol', 'Jeong, Jin-Woo', 'Han, Min Ho', 'Lee, Hyesook', 'Kim, Gi-Young', 'Jin, Soojung', 'Park, Jung-Ha', 'Kwon, Hyun Ju', 'Kim, Byung Woo', 'Choi, Yung Hyun']","['Park C', 'Jeong JW', 'Han MH', 'Lee H', 'Kim GY', 'Jin S', 'Park JH', 'Kwon HJ', 'Kim BW', 'Choi YH']","['College of Liberal Studies, Dong-Eui University, Busan, Republic of Korea.', 'Nakdonggang National Institute of Biological Resources, Sangju, Republic of Korea.', 'National Marine Biodiversity Institute of Korea, Seocheon, Republic of Korea.', 'Anti-Aging Research Center, Dong-eui University, Busan, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Dong-eui University College of Korean Medicine, Busan, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Marine Life Sciences, Jeju National University, Jeju, Republic of Korea.', 'Core-Facility Center for Tissue Regeneration, Dong Eui University, Busan, Republic of Korea.', 'Core-Facility Center for Tissue Regeneration, Dong Eui University, Busan, Republic of Korea.', 'Biopharmaceutical Engineering Major, Dong-eui University, Busan, Republic of Korea.', 'Core-Facility Center for Tissue Regeneration, Dong Eui University, Busan, Republic of Korea.', 'Biopharmaceutical Engineering Major, Dong-eui University, Busan, Republic of Korea.', 'Biopharmaceutical Engineering Major, Dong-eui University, Busan, Republic of Korea.', 'Anti-Aging Research Center, Dong-eui University, Busan, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Dong-eui University College of Korean Medicine, Busan, Republic of Korea.', 'Core-Facility Center for Tissue Regeneration, Dong Eui University, Busan, Republic of Korea.']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4906-0410', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7549-4514', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4293-7630', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3546-9370', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6878-0790', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0890-3963', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9559-3018', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1375-0906', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7940-1074', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1454-3124']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210423,England,Anim Cells Syst (Seoul),Animal cells and systems,101478641,,,,PMC8118407,['NOTNLM'],"['Betulinic acid', 'G2/M arrest', 'ROS', 'apoptosis', 'leukemia cells']",2021/07/09 06:00,2021/07/09 06:01,['2021/07/08 06:41'],"['2021/07/08 06:41 [entrez]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/19768354.2021.1915380 [doi]', '1915380 [pii]']",epublish,Anim Cells Syst (Seoul). 2021 Apr 23;25(2):119-127. doi: 10.1080/19768354.2021.1915380. eCollection 2021.,119-127,"['(c) 2021 The Author(s).

The study aimed to generate a prediction model to identify intermediate risk AML patients with an inferior survival. We performed targeted next generation sequencing analysis for 121 patients with 2017 European LeukemiaNet-defined intermediate risk AML, revealing 122 mutated genes, with 24 genes mutated in > 10% of patients. A prognostic nomogram characterized by white blood cell count >/=10x10(9)/L at diagnosis, mutated DNMT3A and genes involved in signaling pathways was developed for 110 patients who were with clinical outcomes. Two subgroups were identified: intermediate low risk (ILR; 43.6%, 48/110) and intermediate high risk (IHR; 56.4%, 62/110).

For this, RNA sequencing was performed. Early growth response 3 gene (Egr3) was one of the most highly upregulated genes in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL2H3) cells stimulated by antigen. The role of Egr3 in allergic inflammation has not been studied extensively. Egr3 was necessary for passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) and passive systemic anaphylaxis (PSA). Egr3 promoter sequences contained potential binding site for NF-kappaB p65. NF-kappaB p65 directly regulated Egr3 expression and mediated allergic inflammation in vitro. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) is known to be involved in allergic airway inflammation. HDAC6 promoter sequences contained potential binding site for EGR3. EGR3 showed binding to promoter sequences of HDAC6. EGR3 was necessary for increased expression of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) in antigen-stimulated RBL2H3 cells. HDAC6 mediated allergic inflammation in vitro and PSA. TargetScan analysis predicted that miR-182-5p was a negative regulator of EGR3. Luciferase activity assay confirmed that miR-182-5p was a direct regulator of EGR3. MiR-182-5p mimic inhibited allergic inflammation both in vitro and in vivo. Cytokine array showed that HDAC6 was necessary for increased interleukin-27 (IL-27) expression in BALB/C mouse model of PSA. Antigen stimulation did not affect expression of EBI3, another subunit of IL-27 in RBL2H3 cells or BALB/C mouse model of PCA or PSA. IL-27 receptor alpha was shown to be able to bind to HDAC6. IL-27 p28 mediated allergic inflammation in vitro, PCA, and PSA. Mouse recombinant IL-27 protein promoted features of allergic inflammation in an antigen-independent manner. HDAC6 was necessary for tumorigenic and metastatic potential enhanced by PSA. PSA enhanced the metastatic potential of mouse melanoma B16F1 cells in an IL-27-dependent manner. Experiments employing culture medium and mouse recombinant IL-27 protein showed that IL-27 mediated and promoted cellular interactions involving B16F1 cells, lung macrophages, and mast cells during allergic inflammation. IL-27 was present in exosomes of antigen-stimulated RBL2H3 cells. Exosomes from antigen-stimulated RBL2H3 cells enhanced invasion of B16F1 melanoma cells in an IL-27-dependemt manner. These results present evidence that EGR3-HDAC6-IL-27 axis can regulate allergic inflammation by mediating cellular interactions.","['Kwon, Yoojung', 'Kim, Misun', 'Kim, Youngmi', 'Jeong, Myeong Seon', 'Jung, Hyun Suk', 'Jeoung, Dooil']","['Kwon Y', 'Kim M', 'Kim Y', 'Jeong MS', 'Jung HS', 'Jeoung D']","['Department of Biochemistry, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea.', 'Institute of New Frontier Research, College of Medicine, Hallym University, Chuncheon, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea.', 'Chuncheon Center, Korea Basic Science Institute, Chuncheon, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210621,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Egr3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-27)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '144516-98-3 (Early Growth Response Protein 3)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 6)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Communication/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Early Growth Response Protein 3/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Histone Deacetylase 6/*metabolism', 'Hypersensitivity/complications/etiology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-27/*metabolism', 'Melanoma, Experimental', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Rats', '*Signal Transduction']",PMC8257050,['NOTNLM'],"['*EGR3', '*HDAC6', '*IL-27', '*MiR-182-5p', '*allergic inflammation', '*cellular interactions']",2021/07/09 06:00,2021/10/26 06:00,['2021/07/08 06:40'],"['2021/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/08 06:40 [entrez]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.680441 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Jun 21;12:680441. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.680441. eCollection 2021.,680441,"['Copyright (c) 2021 Kwon, Kim, Kim, Jeong, Jung and Jeoung.']",,,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results: A 51-year-old woman had progressive swelling of periorbita for one month. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a well-defined, mild enhanced mass indenting the adjacent right lateral rectus muscle and the globe. Biopsy from anterior orbitotomy revealed an orbital myeloid sarcoma. Bone marrow study showed concurrent myelofibrosis. Although the orbital lesion subsided remarkably under aggressive chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the leukemic transformation was noticed in the third month following the initial presentation. Conclusion: This case demonstrated that myeloid sarcoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of orbital diseases, with or without involvement of hematological disorders. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment as for AML are crucial as the prognosis is usually poor for adult orbital MS.","['Chen, Nancy', 'Lin, Chia-Shuen', 'Hsu, Yung-Hsiang', 'Huang, Wei-Han', 'Huang, Chin-Te', 'Lee, Yuan-Chieh']","['Chen N', 'Lin CS', 'Hsu YH', 'Huang WH', 'Huang CT', 'Lee YC']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Hualien, Taiwan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Hualien, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Hualien, Taiwan.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Hualien, Taiwan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Hualien, Taiwan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Hualien, Taiwan.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7649-2246', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8486-8549']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210630,New Zealand,Int Med Case Rep J,International medical case reports journal,101566269,,,,PMC8256097,['NOTNLM'],"['JAK2 mutation', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'myelofibrosis', 'myeloid sarcoma']",2021/07/09 06:00,2021/07/09 06:01,['2021/07/08 06:38'],"['2021/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/08 06:38 [entrez]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/IMCRJ.S310230 [doi]', '310230 [pii]']",epublish,Int Med Case Rep J. 2021 Jun 30;14:443-448. doi: 10.2147/IMCRJ.S310230. eCollection 2021.,443-448,['(c) 2021 Chen et al.'],,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presenting symptoms of APL DS are diverse, and rare symptoms are easy to be misdiagnosed. Therefore, it is very crucial to identify DS from uncommon signs to avoid delay in treatment. Case Presentation: Here, we report a patient of APL who developed severe abdominal pain during ATRA and ATO therapy, with increasing leukocyte count. Organic diseases were firstly excluded, and empiric treatment for DS was adopted. The abdominal pain was gradually relieved and the patient eventually achieved complete remission. Conclusion: This case history suggests that APL DS may manifest as severe abdominal pain, and the early identification of DS and immediate treatment could improve the prognosis of patients.","['Yan, Haimeng', 'He, Donghua', 'Huang, Weijia', 'Chen, Fei', 'He, Jingsong', 'Cai, Zhen', 'Zhao, Yi']","['Yan H', 'He D', 'Huang W', 'Chen F', 'He J', 'Cai Z', 'Zhao Y']","[""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Haining People's Hospital, Haining, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhejiang Laboratory for Systems & Precision Medicine, Zhejiang University Medical Center, Hangzhou, 311121, People's Republic of China."", ""Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",,['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210630,New Zealand,J Pain Res,Journal of pain research,101540514,,,,PMC8256376,['NOTNLM'],"['abdominal pain', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'all-trans-retinoic acid', 'arsenic trioxide', 'case report', 'differentiation syndrome']",2021/07/09 06:00,2021/07/09 06:01,['2021/07/08 06:37'],"['2021/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/08 06:37 [entrez]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/JPR.S305192 [doi]', '305192 [pii]']",epublish,J Pain Res. 2021 Jun 30;14:1981-1984. doi: 10.2147/JPR.S305192. eCollection 2021.,1981-1984,['(c) 2021 Yan et al.'],,,,"['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest related to this', 'report.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MET exon 14 alterations are identified in 3-4% of NSCLCs and MET gene amplification and high protein expression are associated with a poor prognosis. The French recommendations only authorize the use of capmatinib and crizotinib if the mutation concerns exon 14. However, several different types of mutation in exon 14 of MET and its flanking introns can induce a jump in exon 14, activate the MET gene and thus be sensitive to anti-MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Case Summary: This case concerns a 76-year-old Caucasian male with a medical history including idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), atrial fibrillation, arterial hypertension, obesity (BMI 36kg/m2), and a 5-10 pack-per-year smoking history. A left upper lobe pulmonary nodule of 12.4 mm was discovered in March 2019. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin AUC 5 and vinorelbine 25.00 mg/m2. At the end of the adjuvant treatment, the patient was in complete remission for 5 months. In February 2020, the CT scan revealed a mediastinal lymph node progression. A complementary molecular analysis was realized on the initial surgical specimen. A c.3082+3A>T mutation in the MET gene was identified. This mutation confers susceptibility to anti-MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Treatment with crizotinib was initiated with an initial dose of 250 mg/day for 15 days and then increased to 250 mg twice a day. After 7 months of treatment with crizotinib, the disease was still stable according to RECIST 1.1. Conclusion: We report here the original case of a patient presenting a lung adenocarcinoma with an intron 14 mutation and having a durable TKI response.","['Leyrat, Brice', 'Durando, Xavier', 'Veyssiere, Hugo', 'Bernadach, Maureen']","['Leyrat B', 'Durando X', 'Veyssiere H', 'Bernadach M']","[""Departement d'Oncologie Medicale, Centre Jean Perrin, Clermont-Ferrand, 63011, France."", 'Universite Clermont Auvergne, UFR Medecine, Clermont-Ferrand, 63000, France.', ""Departement d'Oncologie Medicale, Centre Jean Perrin, Clermont-Ferrand, 63011, France."", 'Universite Clermont Auvergne, UFR Medecine, Clermont-Ferrand, 63000, France.', 'Universite Clermont Auvergne, INSERM, U1240 Imagerie Moleculaire et Strategies Theranostiques, Centre Jean Perrin, Clermont-Ferrand, 63011, France.', 'Division de Recherche Clinique, Delegation Recherche Clinique et Innovation, Centre de Lutte contre le Cancer, Centre Jean Perrin, Clermont-Ferrand Cedex 1, 63011, France.', ""Centre d'Investigation Clinique, UMR501, Clermont-Ferrand, 63011, France."", 'Universite Clermont Auvergne, INSERM, U1240 Imagerie Moleculaire et Strategies Theranostiques, Centre Jean Perrin, Clermont-Ferrand, 63011, France.', 'Division de Recherche Clinique, Delegation Recherche Clinique et Innovation, Centre de Lutte contre le Cancer, Centre Jean Perrin, Clermont-Ferrand Cedex 1, 63011, France.', ""Centre d'Investigation Clinique, UMR501, Clermont-Ferrand, 63011, France."", ""Departement d'Oncologie Medicale, Centre Jean Perrin, Clermont-Ferrand, 63011, France."", 'Universite Clermont Auvergne, INSERM, U1240 Imagerie Moleculaire et Strategies Theranostiques, Centre Jean Perrin, Clermont-Ferrand, 63011, France.', 'Division de Recherche Clinique, Delegation Recherche Clinique et Innovation, Centre de Lutte contre le Cancer, Centre Jean Perrin, Clermont-Ferrand Cedex 1, 63011, France.', ""Centre d'Investigation Clinique, UMR501, Clermont-Ferrand, 63011, France.""]","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6035-3172', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2202-7362']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210629,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC8254586,['NOTNLM'],"['MET intron 14 mutation', 'crizotinib', 'next-generation sequencing', 'non-small-cell lung cancer']",2021/07/09 06:00,2021/07/09 06:01,['2021/07/08 06:37'],"['2021/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/08 06:37 [entrez]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S312889 [doi]', '312889 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2021 Jun 29;14:3949-3958. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S312889. eCollection 2021.,3949-3958,['(c) 2021 Leyrat et al.'],,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No reported data exist regarding the efficacy of anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibition in VCCC. We report on a patient with chemotherapy-refractory recurrent VCCC, who was found to have high tumor programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS), and subsequently experienced a durable partial response (PR), after treatment with off-label fifth-line pembrolizumab. Case Presentation: A forty-year-old Filipino woman presented to our center with recurrent VCCC that had progressed on multiple prior lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy. She had a large 25 cm fungating left groin tumor causing marked lower limb lymphedema, pain and limited mobility. PD-L1 CPS by immunohistochemistry was 45. She was treated with off-label pembrolizumab monotherapy and had a dramatic clinical, biochemical and radiological partial response. The progression-free survival of this patient's VCCC after treatment with pembrolizumab, defined as the time from initiation of pembrolizumab until disease progression (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1)), was 8 months. While receiving pembrolizumab, she was diagnosed with concurrent secondary myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts (MDS-EB), thought to be related to her prior exposure to multiple lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy. This eventually progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), leading to her demise. Overall survival from time of initiation of pembrolizumab till death was 16 months. Conclusion: Pembrolizumab was active in this patient with chemotherapy-refractory VCCC which harbored high PD-L1 CPS. Further studies to determine the role of immune check-point blockade in the treatment of VCCC are warranted.","['Sachdeva, Manavi', 'Ngoi, Natalie Y L', 'Lim, Diana', 'Poon, Michelle L M', 'Thian, Yee Liang', 'Lim, Yi Wan', 'Lim, Siew Eng', 'Tong, Pearl', 'Lum, Jeffrey H Y', 'Ng, Joseph', 'Ilancheran, Arunachalam', 'Domingo, Efren J', 'Low, Jeffrey J H', 'Tan, David S P']","['Sachdeva M', 'Ngoi NYL', 'Lim D', 'Poon MLM', 'Thian YL', 'Lim YW', 'Lim SE', 'Tong P', 'Lum JHY', 'Ng J', 'Ilancheran A', 'Domingo EJ', 'Low JJH', 'Tan DSP']","['Department of Medicine, National University Health System Singapore, Singapore, 119074, Singapore.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, Singapore, 119228, Singapore.', 'Department of Pathology, National University Health System Singapore, Singapore, 119074, Singapore.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, Singapore, 119228, Singapore.', 'Department of Diagnostic Imaging, National University Health System Singapore, Singapore, 119074, Singapore.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, Singapore, 119228, Singapore.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, Singapore, 119228, Singapore.', 'Division of Gynecology-Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National University Hospital Singapore, Singapore, 119074, Singapore.', 'Department of Pathology, National University Health System Singapore, Singapore, 119074, Singapore.', 'Division of Gynecology-Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National University Hospital Singapore, Singapore, 119074, Singapore.', 'Division of Gynecology-Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National University Hospital Singapore, Singapore, 119074, Singapore.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of the Philippines College of Medicine, Philippine General Hospital, Manila, 1000, Metro Manila, Philippines.', 'Division of Gynecology-Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National University Hospital Singapore, Singapore, 119074, Singapore.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, Singapore, 119228, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 117599, Singapore.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2071-0715', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4823-5151', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1992-7389', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9087-5262']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210629,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC8254584,['NOTNLM'],"['clear cell carcinoma', 'immune check-point blockade', 'immunotherapy', 'vulvar cancer']",2021/07/09 06:00,2021/07/09 06:01,['2021/07/08 06:37'],"['2021/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/08 06:37 [entrez]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S309661 [doi]', '309661 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2021 Jun 29;14:3921-3928. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S309661. eCollection 2021.,3921-3928,['(c) 2021 Sachdeva et al.'],,,,"['Dr David SP Tan reports grants from National Medical Research Council, Singapore,', 'during the conduct of the study; personal fees from Merck Sharp Dohme (MSD),', 'grants from Astra Zeneca, Bayer, Karyopharm Therapeutics, Merck Serono, and', 'Roche, outside the submitted work.

We previously reported that the phosphatase calcineurin (Cn) is required for LIC (leukemia Initiating Capacity) potential of T-ALL pointing to Cn as an interesting therapeutic target. Calcineurin inhibitors have however unwanted side effect. NFAT transcription factors play crucial roles downstream of calcineurin during thymocyte development, T cell differentiation, activation and anergy. Here we elucidate NFAT functional relevance in T-ALL. Using murine T-ALL models in which Nfat genes can be inactivated either singly or in combination, we show that NFATs are required for T-ALL LIC potential and essential to survival, proliferation and migration of T-ALL cells. We also demonstrate that Nfat genes are functionally redundant in T-ALL and identified a node of genes commonly deregulated upon Cn or NFAT inactivation, which may serve as future candidate targets for T-ALL.","['Catherinet, Claire', 'Passaro, Diana', 'Gachet, Stephanie', 'Medyouf, Hind', 'Reynaud, Anne', 'Lasgi, Charlene', 'Ghysdael, Jacques', 'Tran Quang, Christine']","['Catherinet C', 'Passaro D', 'Gachet S', 'Medyouf H', 'Reynaud A', 'Lasgi C', 'Ghysdael J', 'Tran Quang C']","['Institut Curie, UMR3348, Orsay, France.', 'CNRS UMR3348, Centre Universitaire, Orsay, France.', 'University Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France.', 'PSL Research University, Paris, France.', 'Institut Curie, UMR3348, Orsay, France.', 'CNRS UMR3348, Centre Universitaire, Orsay, France.', 'University Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France.', 'PSL Research University, Paris, France.', 'Institut Curie, UMR3348, Orsay, France.', 'CNRS UMR3348, Centre Universitaire, Orsay, France.', 'University Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France.', 'PSL Research University, Paris, France.', 'Institut Curie, UMR3348, Orsay, France.', 'CNRS UMR3348, Centre Universitaire, Orsay, France.', 'University Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France.', 'PSL Research University, Paris, France.', 'Institut Curie, UMR3348, Orsay, France.', 'CNRS UMR3348, Centre Universitaire, Orsay, France.', 'University Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France.', 'PSL Research University, Paris, France.', 'Cytometry Platform, Institut Curie, Orsay, France.', 'Institut Curie, UMR3348, Orsay, France.', 'CNRS UMR3348, Centre Universitaire, Orsay, France.', 'University Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France.', 'PSL Research University, Paris, France.', 'INSERM U1278, Centre Universitaire, Orsay, France.', 'Institut Curie, UMR3348, Orsay, France.', 'CNRS UMR3348, Centre Universitaire, Orsay, France.', 'University Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France.', 'PSL Research University, Paris, France.', 'INSERM U1278, Centre Universitaire, Orsay, France.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0491-9949', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1003-2626']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210707,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Calcineurin Inhibitors)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcineurin/metabolism', 'Calcineurin Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism']",PMC8263285,,,2021/07/09 06:00,2021/11/24 06:00,['2021/07/08 06:35'],"['2021/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/08 06:35 [entrez]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0254184 [doi]', 'PONE-D-21-03642 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2021 Jul 7;16(7):e0254184. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0254184. eCollection 2021.,e0254184,,,,,"['CTQ and JG have research agreements with Servier and Autolus Ltd.

Accounting for known KIR-KIRL interactions may identify donors with optimal NK cell-mediated alloreactivity and GVL. A retrospective study of 2359 donor-recipient pairs (DRP) who underwent unrelated donor (URD) HCT for AML was performed. KIR-KIRL combinations were determined and associations with clinical outcomes examined. Relapse risk was reduced in DRP with both higher inhibitory KIR-KIRL (iKIR) and missing KIRL (mKIR) scores, with HR 0.86 (P = 0.01) & HR 0.84 (P = 0.02) respectively. The iKIR and mKIR score components were summed to give a maximal inhibitory KIR ligand (IM-KIR) score for each donor, which if it was 5, as opposed to <5, was also associated with a lower relapse risk, SHR 0.8 (P = 0.004). All IM = 5 donors possess KIR Haplotype B/x. Transplant-related mortality was increased among those with IM-KIR = 5, HR, 1.32 (P = 0.01). In a subset analysis of those transplanted with 8/8 HLA-matched DRP, anti-thymocyte globulin recipients with IM-KIR = 5, had a lower relapse rate HR, 0.61 (p = 0.001). This study demonstrates that HLA-matched unrelated donors with the highest inhibitory KIR content confer relapse protection, albeit with increased TRM. These donors all have KIR haplotype B. Clinical trials utilizing donors with a higher iKIR content in conjunction with novel strategies to reduce TRM should be considered for URD HCT in recipients with AML to optimize clinical outcomes.","['Krieger, Elizabeth', 'Qayyum, Rehan', 'Keating, Armand', 'Toor, Amir']","['Krieger E', 'Qayyum R', 'Keating A', 'Toor A']","['Department of Pediatrics, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, VA, USA.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA. amir.toor@vcuhealth.org.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3086-8014', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5317-8433']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210707,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,,,,,2021/07/09 06:00,2021/07/09 06:00,['2021/07/08 06:31'],"['2020/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/06/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/08 06:31 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-021-01393-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-021-01393-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2021 Nov;56(11):2714-2722. doi: 10.1038/s41409-021-01393-9.

The aim of this study was to identify potential causes of the reported limited efficacy from CAR-T therapies against AML. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We generated CAR-T cells targeting Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and evaluated their killing activity against AML cells. We examined the impacts of modulating mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling in CAR-T cells in terms of CXCR4 levels. We examined the effects of a rapamycin pretreatment of EpCAM CAR-T cells (during ex vivo expansion) and assessed the in vivo antitumor efficacy of rapamycin-pretreated EpCAM CAR-T cells (including CXCR4 knockdown cells) and CD33 CAR-T cells in leukemia xenograft mouse models. RESULTS: EpCAM CAR-T exhibited killing activity against AML cells but failed to eliminate AML cells in bone marrow. Subsequent investigations revealed that aberrantly activated mTORC1 signaling in CAR-T cells results in decreased bone marrow infiltration and decreased the levels of the rapamycin target CXCR4. Attenuating mTORC1 activity with the rapamycin pretreatment increased the capacity of CAR-T cells to infiltrate bone marrow and enhanced the extent of bone marrow AML cell elimination in leukemia xenograft mouse models. CXCR4 knockdown experiments showed that CXCR4 contributes to the enhanced bone marrow infiltration capacity of EpCAM CAR-T cells and the observed reduction in bone marrow AML cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a potential cause for the limited efficacy of CAR-T reported from current AML clinical trials and illustrates an easy-to-implement pretreatment strategy, which enhances the anti-AML efficacy of CAR-T cells.See related commentary by Maiti and Daver, p. 5739.","['Nian, Zhigang', 'Zheng, Xiaohu', 'Dou, Yingchao', 'Du, Xianghui', 'Zhou, Li', 'Fu, Binqing', 'Sun, Rui', 'Tian, Zhigang', 'Wei, Haiming']","['Nian Z', 'Zheng X', 'Dou Y', 'Du X', 'Zhou L', 'Fu B', 'Sun R', 'Tian Z', 'Wei H']","['Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, The CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Institute of Immunology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, The CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China. ustcwhm@ustc.edu.cn ustczxh@ustc.edu.cn.', 'Institute of Immunology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, The CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Institute of Immunology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, The CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Institute of Immunology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, The CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Institute of Immunology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, The CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Institute of Immunology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, The CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Institute of Immunology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.', 'Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, The CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China. ustcwhm@ustc.edu.cn ustczxh@ustc.edu.cn.', 'Institute of Immunology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210707,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,IM,,,,,2021/07/09 06:00,2021/07/09 06:00,['2021/07/08 05:50'],"['2021/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/26 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/08 05:50 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-21-0452 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-0452 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2021 Nov 1;27(21):6026-6038. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-0452.

LncRNAs deregulation was linked to the development and progression of various cancer types, such as acute leukemias. In this context, lncRNAs were also evaluated as a novel class of biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Here, we analyzed TEX41 in childhood B cell acute lymphoid leukemia (B-ALL). METHODS: Total RNA was extracted from pediatric B-ALL patients (at diagnosis and after induction of therapy) and from healthy subjects. Total RNA was also extracted from different leukemia cell line models. The expression level of TEX41 was evaluated by q-RT-PCR. Also, the dataset deposited by St. Jude Children's Research Hospital was consulted. Furthermore, the silencing of TEX41 in RS4;11 cell line was obtained by 2'-Deoxy, 2'Fluroarabino Nucleic Acids (2'F-ANAs) Oligonucleotides, and the effect on cell proliferation was evaluated. Cell cycle progression and its regulators were analyzed by flow cytometry and immunoblotting. RESULTS: We exploited the St Jude Cloud database and found that TEX41 is a lncRNA primarily expressed in the case of B-ALL (n = 79) while its expression levels are low/absent for T-cell ALL (n = 25) and acute myeloid leukemia (n = 38). The association of TEX41 with B-ALL was confirmed by real-time PCR assays. TEX41 disclosed increased expression levels in bone marrow from patients with B-ALL at diagnosis, while its expression levels became low or absent when retested in Bone Marrow cells of the same patient after 1 month of induction therapy. Also, silencing experiments performed on RS4;11 cells showed that TEX41 downregulation impaired in vitro leukemic cell growth determining their arrest in the G2-M phase and the deregulation of cell cycle proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that TEX41 is an upregulated lncRNA in the case of B-ALL and this feature makes it a novel potential biomarker for the diagnosis of this leukemia subtype in pediatric patients. Finally, TEX41 expression seems to be critical for leukemic proliferation, indeed, silencing experiments targeting TEX41 mRNA in the RS4;11 cell line hampered in vitro cell growth and cell cycle progression, by inducing G2-M arrest as confirmed propidium iodide staining and by the upregulation of p53 and p21 proteins.","['Orlandella, Francesca Maria', 'Smaldone, Giovanni', 'Salvatore, Giuliana', 'Vitagliano, Luigi', 'Cianflone, Alessandra', 'Parasole, Rosanna', 'Beneduce, Giuliana', 'Menna, Giuseppe', 'Salvatore, Marco', 'Mirabelli, Peppino']","['Orlandella FM', 'Smaldone G', 'Salvatore G', 'Vitagliano L', 'Cianflone A', 'Parasole R', 'Beneduce G', 'Menna G', 'Salvatore M', 'Mirabelli P']","['IRCCS, SDN, Via E.

Laboratory spontaneous tumour lysis syndrome was defined as the presence of >/=2 of each of hyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperuricaemia and hyperphosphatemia prior to administration of chemotherapy when alternative diagnoses had been excluded. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Of 108 children, of median age 7.7 years, where boys outnumbered girls 2:1, high-grade, malignancy included Burkitt's lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute myeloid leukaemia and Burkitt's leukaemia, with 14 suffering with laboratory spontaneous tumour lysis syndrome. Hypocalcaemia was its most common electrolyte imbalance; and four children died prior to commencement of chemotherapy.

METHODS: We performed next-generation sequencing on bone marrow aspiration samples of 59 patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts-2, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and treated with decitabine or azacitidine as a frontline therapy. RESULTS: A single gene with the most common mutations was TP53 (14 of 59 patients), and mutations in RAS pathway-related genes including KRAS, NRAS, FLT3, PTPN11, CBL, and KIT were found in 28.8% of patients. The overall response rate to HMAs was 33.9%. Predictive factors for a poor response were an age >75 years (p = 0.007), 3 or more gene mutations (p = 0.004), mutations in RAS pathway-related genes (p = 0.033), and a mutated NRAS gene (p = 0.042). An age >75 years (hazard ratio 2.946), diagnosis of AML (hazard ratio 2.915), and mutations in NRAS (hazard ratio 4.440) were identified as poor prognostic factors for survival. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, mutations in RAS pathway-related genes were predictors of a poor response to HMAs. Particularly, mutated NRAS was associated with inferior survival rates.","['Park, Hee Sue', 'Son, Bo Ra', 'Shin, Kyeong Seob', 'Byeon, Seonggyu', 'Kim, Hee Kyung', 'Yang, Yaewon', 'Jeong, Yusook', 'Han, Hye Sook', 'Lee, Ki Hyeong', 'Kwon, Jihyun']","['Park HS', 'Son BR', 'Shin KS', 'Byeon S', 'Kim HK', 'Yang Y', 'Jeong Y', 'Han HS', 'Lee KH', 'Kwon J']","['Laboratory Medicine, Chungbuk National University College of Medicine, Cheongju, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory Medicine, Chungbuk National University Hospital, Cheongju, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory Medicine, Chungbuk National University College of Medicine, Cheongju, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory Medicine, Chungbuk National University Hospital, Cheongju, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory Medicine, Chungbuk National University College of Medicine, Cheongju, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory Medicine, Chungbuk National University Hospital, Cheongju, Republic of Korea.', 'Internal Medicine, Chungbuk National University College of Medicine, Cheongju, Republic of Korea.', 'Internal Medicine, Chungbuk National University Hospital, Cheongju, Republic of Korea.', 'Internal Medicine, Chungbuk National University College of Medicine, Cheongju, Republic of Korea.', 'Internal Medicine, Chungbuk National University Hospital, Cheongju, Republic of Korea.', 'Internal Medicine, Chungbuk National University College of Medicine, Cheongju, Republic of Korea.', 'Internal Medicine, Chungbuk National University Hospital, Cheongju, Republic of Korea.', 'Internal Medicine, Chungbuk National University College of Medicine, Cheongju, Republic of Korea.', 'Internal Medicine, Chungbuk National University Hospital, Cheongju, Republic of Korea.', 'Internal Medicine, Chungbuk National University College of Medicine, Cheongju, Republic of Korea.', 'Internal Medicine, Chungbuk National University Hospital, Cheongju, Republic of Korea.', 'Internal Medicine, Chungbuk National University College of Medicine, Cheongju, Republic of Korea.', 'Internal Medicine, Chungbuk National University Hospital, Cheongju, Republic of Korea.', 'Internal Medicine, Chungbuk National University College of Medicine, Cheongju, Republic of Korea.', 'Internal Medicine, Chungbuk National University Hospital, Cheongju, Republic of Korea.']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210707,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Decitabine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Genetic mutation', 'Hypomethylating agent', 'Myelodysplastic syndrome', 'Next-generation sequencing']",2021/07/08 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/07/07 20:14'],"['2021/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/07/07 20:14 [entrez]']","['000516793 [pii]', '10.1159/000516793 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2021;144(6):649-659. doi: 10.1159/000516793.

AYAs are a unique group who face a significant therapeutic disadvantage when treated with the adult regimen, as evident with lower remission rates, whereas the opposite is true in children. A recent study by EUROCARE-5 showed a marked decrease with age in 5 years relative to survival outcomes based on cancer registries of 27 European countries: 85.8% for patients 0-14 years of age and a decreased 62.2% and 52.8% for patients 15-19 and 20-39 years, respectively. There is growing evidence demonstrating that the pediatric ALL treatment regimen is effective and beneficial when treating AYAs. Treatment of ALL in AYAs around the world is showing improved remission rates with therapeutic advancements and increasing amount of data available with updated clinical trials and regimens. The addition of l-asparaginase into adult treatment regimens has significantly increased the remission rates. This administration to AYAs is more difficult but shows a positive benefit in comparison with the toxicity ratio. This review article will discuss the controversy of AYA patients diagnosed with ALL treated with pediatric or adult protocols and their perspectives in Poland and will focus on ALL etiology, epidemiology, and prognostic factors with comparison of compliance of medications between both populations of patients.","['Derwich, Katarzyna', 'Brzezinski, Adam', 'Karpenko, Corrinna', 'Morar, Vanisha', 'Atukoralalage, Udani']","['Derwich K', 'Brzezinski A', 'Karpenko C', 'Morar V', 'Atukoralalage U']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Transplantology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7239-4035'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210707,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Poland', 'leukemia', 'regimen', 'remission', 'treatment protocols']",2021/07/08 06:00,2021/07/08 06:00,['2021/07/07 17:15'],"['2021/07/07 17:15 [entrez]', '2021/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jayao.2021.0033 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2021 Jul 7. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2021.0033.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
