One of the most important late effects is the development of secondary malignancy. We encountered a girl with neuroblastoma who developed acute monoblastic leukemia as a secondary malignancy, 32 months after starting treatment for the primary tumor at the age of 4 years and 10 months. For the primary tumor, she had received cyclophosphamide, ifosphamide, etoposide, epirubicin, cisplatin, and vincristine during a period of 20 months; no radiotherapy was given. Cytogenetic analysis of the leukemic cells showed no specific changes, but a rearrangement of the mixed lineage leukemia gene (chromosome 11q23 translocation) was subsequently found by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The survival time after onset of the secondary malignancy was brief. The leukemogenic hazards of cancer treatment should be weighed against their therapeutic benefits.","['Jaing, T H', 'Yang, C P', 'Hung, I J']","['Jaing TH', 'Yang CP', 'Hung IJ']","[""Department of Medicine, Chang Gung Children's Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Singapore,J Formos Med Assoc,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,9214933,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis']",1999/11/27 00:00,1999/11/27 00:01,['1999/11/27 00:00'],"['1999/11/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Formos Med Assoc. 1999 Oct;98(10):688-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vitamin B6 has been reported to be an antiaggregative agent, although its mechanism is not well known. To understand the molecular mechanism of vitamin B6 on antiaggregation, we analyzed the effects of various forms of vitamin B6 on the expression of human GPIIb promoter using chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) as the reporter gene. The GPIIb promoter region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cloned into pBLCAT3 to drive the CAT reporter gene and transfected into human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells. Transient expression of the GPIIb promoter was determined after transfected cells were treated with 1 microM pyridoxine (PN), pyridoxal (PL), pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP), or 4-deoxypyridoxine (4-dex) for 48 h. Our results show that the GPIIb promoter activity was down-regulated to 54, 35 and 63% in the presence of PN, PL and PLP, respectively, as compared to an untreated control whose promoter activity was 100%. However, no adverse effect on GPIIb promoter was detected by 4-dex, which is an antagonist of vitamin B6. The down-regulation effect of vitamin B6 on GPIIb promoter activity may lead to a reduction of GPIIb protein expression and thus be detrimental to platelet aggregation.","['Chang, S J', 'Chuang, H J', 'Chen, H H']","['Chang SJ', 'Chuang HJ', 'Chen HH']","['Department of Biology, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan. sjchang@mail.ncku.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (Tokyo),Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,0402640,IM,"['Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Pyridoxal/pharmacology', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate/pharmacology', 'Pyridoxine/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/11/27 00:00,1999/11/27 00:01,['1999/11/27 00:00'],"['1999/11/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (Tokyo). 1999 Aug;45(4):471-9. doi: 10.3177/jnsv.45.471.,,,['10.3177/jnsv.45.471 [doi]'],"['0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex)', '3THM379K8A (Pyridoxal)', '5V5IOJ8338 (Pyridoxal Phosphate)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'KV2JZ1BI6Z (Pyridoxine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their identification may clarify the mechanisms of the conversion from fetal to adult globin production and lead to new approaches to reversing or retarding the gamma- to beta-globin gene switch. To explore this hypothesis, K562 erythroleukemia cells were induced to differentiate with 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mM sodium butyrate and gene expression was studied after 24, 48, and 72 h. Erythroid differentiation was verified by benzidine staining and by measuring the activity of a transduced A gamma-globin gene promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene. Using differential display polymerase chain reaction (PCR), total mRNA extracted from induced cells at each time point of induction was reverse transcribed in the presence of A, G, and C anchored primers and 16 arbitrary primers, calculated to amplify approximately 50% of expressed genes. Amplified mRNAs from induced and uninduced cells were separated in polyacrylamide gels and compared. More than 110 cDNA fragments which appeared to represent either up- or downregulated mRNA species in induced K562 cells were identified. Sixty-four of these fragments had more than 95% homology to known GenBank sequences. Seventeen fragments with characteristics of transcription factors were cloned. These include differentiation-related gene-1 (drg-1), PAX 3/forkhead transcription factor, HZF2 which is a Kruppel-related zinc finger protein, three helix-loop-helix proteins (heir-1, Id3, and GOS8), alpha-NAC transcriptional coactivator, LIM domain protein, and trophoblast hypoxia regulating factor. Differential expression of all 17 fragments over 72 h was confirmed by reverse Northern dot blot analysis, semiquantitative PCR using nested primers, and Northern analysis. Erythroid maturation in induced K562 cells is associated with differential expression of numerous genes. Some encode transcription factors that could effect the initiation of HbF synthesis. Almost half of the differentially expressed clones contained cDNAs of unidentified open reading frames and these are the object of continued study.","['Plonczynski, M', 'Hardy, C L', 'Safaya, S', 'Harrell, A', 'McCoy, L', 'Brinson, A', 'Agwarangbo, L', 'Steinberg, M H']","['Plonczynski M', 'Hardy CL', 'Safaya S', 'Harrell A', 'McCoy L', 'Brinson A', 'Agwarangbo L', 'Steinberg MH']","['G.V.

These potent biologic response modifiers carry a number of systemic and local side effects. These cytokines are usually administered subcutaneously, and recent studies have described the occurrence of inflammation or necrosis at the site of injection. OBJECTIVE: We report a case of cutaneous necrosis at the sites of interferon injections in a 35-year-old man treated for chronic myeloid leukemia with high, daily doses of interferon alfa. In addition, we review the existing literature on interferon-induced cutaneous necrosis and discuss preventive strategies. CONCLUSION: Cutaneous inflammation or necrosis at interferon injection sites is not uncommon. Although interferon beta-1b is most commonly responsible for this complication, it is now increasingly reported with interferon alfa. It appears to be secondary to the proinflammatory effects of these cytokines or to their unmasking of a subtle hypercoagulable state.","['Sasseville, D', 'Ghamdi, W A', 'Khenaizan, S A']","['Sasseville D', 'Ghamdi WA', 'Khenaizan SA']","['The Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine, Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Cutan Med Surg,Journal of cutaneous medicine and surgery,9614685,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Injections, Subcutaneous/adverse effects', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', '*Necrosis', 'Skin/*drug effects/pathology']",1999/11/27 00:00,1999/11/27 00:01,['1999/11/27 00:00'],"['1999/11/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cutan Med Surg. 1999 Oct;3(6):320-3. doi: 10.1177/120347549900300610.,,,['10.1177/120347549900300610 [doi]'],['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand how primer length and sequence affect generation and utilization of the PPT, we employed short hybrid substrates containing or lacking the PPT to evaluate cleavage, extension, and binding by reverse transcriptase. Substrates containing RNAs with the correct 3' end for initiation of plus-strand synthesis were extended equally well by reverse transcriptase, but primer length affected susceptibility to RNase H cleavage. RNA substrates with 3' ends extending beyond the plus-strand initiation site were extended poorly but were specifically cleaved to generate the correct 3' end for initiation of plus-strand synthesis. Substrates containing RNAs lacking the PPT were cleaved nonspecifically and extended inefficiently. Specific cleavages to generate the plus-strand primer and 5'-end-directed cleavages were kinetically favored over cleavages that destroyed the PPT primer or degraded other short RNA fragments. The PPT was not intrinsically resistant to cleavage by the isolated RNase H domain, and the isolated polymerase domain extended RNA primers containing the PPT sequence irrespective of the primer 3' end. These results provide insights into how reverse transcriptase generates and selectively utilizes the PPT primer for initiation of plus-strand DNA synthesis.","['Schultz, S J', 'Zhang, M', 'Kelleher, C D', 'Champoux, J J']","['Schultz SJ', 'Zhang M', 'Kelleher CD', 'Champoux JJ']","['Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195-7242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/genetics/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Templates, Genetic', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1999/11/27 00:00,1999/11/27 00:01,['1999/11/27 00:00'],"['1999/11/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Dec 3;274(49):34547-55. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.49.34547.,,,"['10.1074/jbc.274.49.34547 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)53360-9 [pii]']","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",['R37 CA51605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Samples were collected between 1996 and 1997 from wildcat populations in France, Switzerland, and Germany.

From the low prevalence of FCoV, FCV, FHV and FPV infections and from the fact that the European wildcats live solitarily, it was concluded that these viral infections do not spread readily within a population. Therefore, it may be assumed that release into the wild of European wildcats bred in captivity would not bring about a high risk of introducing of these viral infections to the free-ranging wildcats.

The ELISA was useful for screening a large number of samples, whereas WB was important for detecting the antibody response against the individual BLV-proteins. Different types of positive serological reactions were discerned in WB, that correlated with reactions of sera in AGIDT and ELISA. The most important antigen in WB and ELISA was the BLV protein p24, whereas the BLV glycoproteins gp51 and gp30 were of special importance in AGIDT.

METHODS: EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: a case series. SETTING: hospital laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: six children aged 13-14 yr, successfully treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and other types of neoplasms, were compared with 11 normal volunteer children. INTERVENTIONS: three of the sample underwent 12 weeks training at 70-85% of maximal heart rate; the remaining three provided initial and final test data only. MEASURES: mood state (Piers-Harris test), anthropometric data, maximal oxygen intake, response to 30 min exercise challenges at anaerobic threshold, and standard immune measures (differential count, cytolytic activity, and mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation) at rest, during and following submaximal exercise. RESULTS: A low maximal oxygen intake, excess of body fat, and high anxiety scores all improved with training. Children who were still receiving chemotherapy showed low resting CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+ and CD25+ counts and reduced PHA-induced proliferation. Acute exercise and training caused further impairment of immune responses, although changes remained insufficient to cause concern for health. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise therapy is beneficial following treatment of cancer, but should be prescribed individually, with a careful monitoring of immune responses.","['Shore, S', 'Shepard, R J']","['Shore S', 'Shepard RJ']","['Graduate Programme in Exercise Sciences, University of Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,J Sports Med Phys Fitness,The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness,0376337,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Exercise/*physiology', '*Exercise Therapy', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/*therapy']",1999/11/26 00:00,1999/11/26 00:01,['1999/11/26 00:00'],"['1999/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Sports Med Phys Fitness. 1999 Sep;39(3):240-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a readily available technique that can rapidly detect tumor-specific chromosomal rearrangements, even in small biopsy specimens. We present cases depicting the importance of including molecular diagnostic studies in the routine evaluation of pediatric solid tumors. PROCEDURE: We used RT-PCR to detect chimeric transcripts specific for major pediatric solid tumors, including peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET), alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS), and desmoplastic small round-cell tumor (DSRCT). We reviewed six recent cases in which the initial diagnosis was changed by the results of RT-PCR. RESULTS: Highly unusual or nonspecific clinical and/or histopathologic findings led to the initial diagnoses of neuroblastoma in three patients and DSRCT, leukemia, and carcinoma in one patient each. The final diagnoses after RT-PCR studies were pPNET in three patients, ARMS in two patients, and DSRCT in one patient. RT-PCR results led to early corrections in the diagnosis in two patients, but four patients received treatment not considered optimal for the neoplasms ultimately diagnosed, including three who, despite presenting with localized tumors that have a >70% cure rate with standard therapy, have died or are dying of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular genetic studies on solid tumors can clarify the diagnosis in seemingly straightforward as well as in overtly problematic cases. These diagnostic distinctions are now critical as disease-specific and risk-directed therapies have emerged.","['Kushner, B H', 'LaQuaglia, M P', 'Cheung, N K', 'Kramer, K', 'Hamelin, A C', 'Gerald, W L', 'Ladanyi, M']","['Kushner BH', 'LaQuaglia MP', 'Cheung NK', 'Kramer K', 'Hamelin AC', 'Gerald WL', 'Ladanyi M']","['Department of Human Genetics, Pathology, Pediatrics, and Surgery, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. kushnerb@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis', 'Carcinoma/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma, Alveolar/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Sarcoma, Small Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",1999/11/26 00:00,1999/11/26 00:01,['1999/11/26 00:00'],"['1999/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1999 Dec;33(6):530-5. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199912)33:6<530::aid-mpo2>3.0.co;2-j.,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199912)33:6<530::AID-MPO2>3.0.CO;2-J [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199912)33:6<530::aid-mpo2>3.0.co;2-j [doi]']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: We examined the mRNA expression of the FLT3 gene by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 64 children with AML, and further abnormal transcripts were cloned and sequenced. RESULTS: An unexpected longer product was found in seven patients (11%) by RT-PCR of the FLT3 gene. Sequence analysis of these abnormal products revealed the presence of tandemly duplicated fragments in all seven patients. Three factors were identified to be associated with high incidence of FLT3/ITD; older patients (> or = 10 years) (P = 0.049), high WBC count (> or = 50,000/microl) at presentation (P = 0.002), and M3 in FAB subtypes (P = 0.002). Induction failure was observed in 3 (43%) of 7 patients with FLT3/ITD. Only FLT3/ITD was identified as a significant risk factor for induction failure by univariate analysis (P = 0.013), although it was not significant by multivariate analysis (P = 0.11). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of event-free survival rate at 5 years was 14% for patients with FLT3/ITD, which was significantly lower in comparison with 69% for patients without FLT3/ITD (P = 0.003). This finding was also identified by multivariate analysis (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, FLT3/ITD was observed in 11% of childhood AML and identified to be associated with poor prognosis.

This interaction is the molecular target of differentiation therapy for acute promyelocytic leukaemia, wherein retinoic acid dissociates corepressor from leukaemogenic receptor fusion proteins. Binding of ligand to NRs induces a conformation that attracts coactivator proteins containing an Leu-x-x-Leu-Leu motif (the 'NR box'). Here we show that N-CoR and SMRT contain sequences that are similar to the NR box and are repeated in each of two NR interaction domains. We show that this CoRNR ('corner') box is required for NR interaction, and that CoRNR box peptides specifically block corepressor interaction in vitro and repression in vivo. Sequences flanking the CoRNR box determine NR specificity. Thus, the key feature of hormone action, differential recognition of unliganded and liganded NRs by coactivators and corepressors, is due to very subtle differences between CoRNR and NR boxes. The molecular mechanisms of repression and activation by NRs are thus linked in an unexpected manner.","['Hu, X', 'Lazar, M A']","['Hu X', 'Lazar MA']","['Department of Medicine, The Penn Diabetes Center, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Thyroid Hormone/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1999/11/26 09:00,2001/03/23 10:01,['1999/11/26 09:00'],"['1999/11/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/23 10:01 [medline]', '1999/11/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1999 Nov 4;402(6757):93-6. doi: 10.1038/47069.,,,['10.1038/47069 [doi]'],"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2)', '0 (Receptors, Thyroid Hormone)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antitumor activity of TT2 has been compared to that of daunomycin (DAU), a clinically valuable anthracycline antibiotic which is structurally different from TT2 but also contains a quinone moiety. TT2 inhibits the proliferation (IC50: 300 nM at day 2 and 150 nM at day 4) and viability (IC50: 250 nM at day 2 and 100 nM at day 4) of L1210 cells to the same maximal degree as DAU, suggesting that the cytostatic and cytotoxic activities of TT2 are a combination of drug concentration and duration of drug exposure. Since TT2 does not increase the mitotic index of L1210 cells at 24 h like vincristine, it is unlikely to be an antimitotic drug that disrupts microtubule dynamics. Like DAU, a 1.5-3 h pretreatment with TT2 is sufficient to inhibit the rates of DNA, RNA and protein syntheses determined over 30-60 min periods of pulse-labeling in L1210 cells in vitro (IC50: 6 microM). In contrast to DAU, which is inactive, a 15 min pretreatment with TT2 has the advantage of also inhibiting the cellular transport of nucleosides occuring over a 30 s period in vitro (IC50: 6 microM), suggesting that TT2 prevents the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA because it rapidly blocks the uptake of [3H]thymidine by the tumor cells. After 24 h, TT2 induces as much DNA cleavage as camptothecin and DAU, two anti-cancer drugs producing DNA strand breaks and known to respectively inhibit DNA topoisomerase I and II activities. Interestingly, the abilities of TT2 to block nucleoside transport, inhibit DNA synthesis and induce DNA fragmentation are irreversible upon drug removal, suggesting that this compound may rapidly interact with various molecular targets in cell membranes and nuclei to disrupt the functions of nucleoside transporters and nucleic acids, and trigger long-lasting antitumor effects which persist after cessation of drug treatment. Because inhibition of nucleoside transport is highly unusual among DNA-damaging drugs, the use of bifunctional TTs with antileukemic activity in the nM range in vitro might provide a considerable advantage in polychemotherapy to potentiate the action of antimetabolites and sensitize multidrug-resistant tumor cells.","['Perchellet, E M', 'Magill, M J', 'Huang, X', 'Brantis, C E', 'Hua, D H', 'Perchellet, J P']","['Perchellet EM', 'Magill MJ', 'Huang X', 'Brantis CE', 'Hua DH', 'Perchellet JP']","['Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan 66506-4901, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Bridged-Ring Compounds/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Nucleosides/*metabolism', 'Quinones/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/11/26 00:00,1999/11/26 00:01,['1999/11/26 00:00'],"['1999/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1999 Sep;10(8):749-66.,,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged-Ring Compounds)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Quinones)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the possibilities of maintaining the therapeutic potential of marrow allografting in the absence of GVHD is to intensify the conditioning regimen administered pre-T-cell depleted BMT in order to compensate for the loss of GVH related graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect. In order to do so we used a preparative regimen consisting of three alkylating agents-Busulfan (BU), Thiotepa (TTP) and Cyclophosphamide (CY)-for T-cell depleted allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) instead of the standard BU-CY protocol. The effect of this intensified regimen was investigated in 30 consecutive leukemia patients who underwent T-cell depleted SCT from HLA identical siblings. Sixteen of the patients were males and 14 females, of median age 24 (5-43) years. Fourteen patients had acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), ten acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), four chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and two myelodysplastic syndrome. The conditioning regimen consisted of BU 4 mg/kg x 4 days (-8 to -5), TTP 5 mg/kg x 2 days (-4 and -3), and CY 60 mg/kg x 2 days (-2 and -1). Engraftment was normal, with WBC >1.0x10(9)/l at day +18 (10-32), ANC >0.5x10(9)/l at day +21 (9-33) and platelets >25x10(9)/l at day +30 (14-69). Regimen related toxicity (RRT) was moderate and transplant related complications comparable to other conventional conditioning protocols. Overall survival and disease free survival (DFS) at 60 months follow up was 50%. Only three patients (10%), with ALL, relapsed and subsequently died. From the current data it would appear that TTP does not significantly improve BMT outcome in patients with leukemia, when compared to the standard BU-CY conditioning. However, our results with the BU-TTP-CY combination followed by T-cell depleted allogeneic SCT could provide the basis for a prospective randomized study comparing this protocol with the standard BU-CY regimen.","['Rosales, F', 'Naparstek, E', 'Varadi, G', 'Or, R', 'Slavin, S', 'Nagler, A']","['Rosales F', 'Naparstek E', 'Varadi G', 'Or R', 'Slavin S', 'Nagler A']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and The Cancer Immunotherapy and Immunobiology Research Center, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thiotepa/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1999/11/26 00:00,1999/11/26 00:01,['1999/11/26 00:00'],"['1999/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1999 Oct;23(10):947-52. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00112-5.,,,"['S0145-2126(99)00112-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00112-5 [doi]']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reh was found to express a high basal level of Bcl-2 but was lacking of Bax protein expression. Treatment with bryostatin 1 induced a down-regulation in Bcl-2 protein that was not accompanied by an obvious Bax protein induction or apoptosis. These results suggest that a decreased level of Bcl-2 alone in this cell line is not sufficient for apoptosis induction. In an effort to identify the mechanism whereby apoptosis could be induced in this ALL model, we treated Reh cells with three microtubule inhibitors: dolastatin 10, auristatin PE and vincristine, in the presence and absence of bryostatin 1. When used alone, only dolastatin 10 induced apoptosis that was detected morphologically, and by flow cytometry. Western blots revealed that dolastatin 10-induced apoptosis was accompanied by the induction of Bax protein and the reduction in Bcl-2 protein. Auristatin PE and vincristine induced both Bax and Bcl-2 protein, leaving the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio constant. Reh cells pretreated for 24 h with bryostatin 1 followed by dolastatin 10, auristatin PE or vincristine showed significant apoptosis which was accompanied by Bcl-2 protein down regulation and Bax protein up regulation. We conclude that: (1) expression of bax is necessary for apoptosis-induction in this model; (2) a decrease in Bcl-2 level alone is not sufficient and might not be necessary for apoptosis-induction; and (3) the ratio of Bax:Bcl-2 plays a critical role in susceptibility to apoptosis in Reh cells. The results from this study should prove useful in guiding the clinical application of these novel agents in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Wall, N R', 'Mohammad, R M', 'Al-Katib, A M']","['Wall NR', 'Mohammad RM', 'Al-Katib AM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bryostatins', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Macrolides', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1999/11/26 00:00,1999/11/26 00:01,['1999/11/26 00:00'],"['1999/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1999 Oct;23(10):881-8. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00108-3.,,,"['S0145-2126(99)00108-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00108-3 [doi]']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'DQC51A0WQH (soblidotin)']",['P30 CA22453-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the importance of human T-cell leukemia virus-I (HTLV-I) Tax protein to stimulate NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, thus preventing apoptosis. Jurkat cells and JPX-9 cells in which the inducible Tax expression plasmid vector was stably transfected were used in the present study. Both Jurkat and Tax(-) JPX-9 cells had small amounts of basal nuclear NF-kappaB activity. The addition of NF-kappaB inhibitors suppressed NF-kappaB nuclear translocation of the cells, thus inducing apoptosis. Sequential activation of caspases from caspase-8 to caspase-3 was shown during this process. NF-kappaB nuclear translocation in JPX-9 cells was stimulated through Tax expression, and both the activation of caspases and apoptosis induced by NF-kappaB inhibitors were significantly suppressed in the Tax(+) JPX-9 cells. The expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and Bcl-x was not changed among Jurkat, Tax(-) JPX-9, and Tax(+) JPX-9 cells in the presence or absence of NF-kappaB inhibitors.

In contrast, their response to M-CSF is strongly reduced and, surprisingly, ICSBP(-/-) colonies formed in the presence of M-CSF are mostly of granulocytic morphology. This disproportional differentiation toward cells of the granulocytic lineage in vitro parallels the expansion of granulocytes in ICSBP(-/-) mice and correlates with a 4-fold reduction of M-CSF receptor expressing cells in bone marrow. Cell transfer studies showed an intrinsic leukemogenic potential and long-term reconstitution capability of ICSBP(-/-) progenitors.

Culture of fetal liver cells sorted for high and low levels of beta galactosidase activity from SCL(lacZ/w) heterozygous embryos indicated that there was a correlation between the level of SCL expression and the frequency of hematopoietic progenitor cells.","['Elefanty, A G', 'Begley, C G', 'Hartley, L', 'Papaevangeliou, B', 'Robb, L']","['Elefanty AG', 'Begley CG', 'Hartley L', 'Papaevangeliou B', 'Robb L']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, the Cooperative Research Centre for Cellular Growth Factors and the Rotary Bone Marrow Research Laboratories, Victoria, Australia. elefanty@wehi.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Blood Vessels/embryology/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Hematopoietic System/embryology/*physiology', '*Lac Operon', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue/embryology/*physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",1999/11/26 00:00,1999/11/26 00:01,['1999/11/26 00:00'],"['1999/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Dec 1;94(11):3754-63.,,,['S0006-4971(20)36691-X [pii]'],"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The phenotype includes developmental defects, bone marrow failure, and cell cycle abnormalities. At least eight complementation groups (A-H) exist, and although three of the corresponding complementation group genes have been cloned, they lack recognizable motifs, and their functions are unknown. We have isolated a binding partner for the Fanconi anemia group C protein (FANCC) by yeast two-hybrid screening. We show that the novel gene, FAZF, encodes a 486 amino acid protein containing a conserved amino terminal BTB/POZ protein interaction domain and three C-terminal Kruppel-like zinc fingers. FAZF is homologous to the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein, which has been shown to act as a transcriptional repressor by recruitment of nuclear corepressors (N-CoR, Sin3, and HDAC1 complex). Consistent with a role in FA, BTB/POZ-containing proteins have been implicated in oncogenesis, limb morphogenesis, hematopoiesis, and proliferation. We show that FAZF is a transcriptional repressor that is able to bind to the same DNA target sequences as PLZF. Our data suggest that the FAZF/FANCC interaction maps to a region of FANCC deleted in FA patients with a severe disease phenotype. We also show that FAZF and wild-type FANCC can colocalize in nuclear foci, whereas a patient-derived mutant FANCC that is compromised for nuclear localization cannot. These results suggest that the function of FANCC may be linked to a transcriptional repression pathway involved in chromatin remodeling.","['Hoatlin, M E', 'Zhi, Y', 'Ball, H', 'Silvey, K', 'Melnick, A', 'Stone, S', 'Arai, S', 'Hawe, N', 'Owen, G', 'Zelent, A', 'Licht, J D']","['Hoatlin ME', 'Zhi Y', 'Ball H', 'Silvey K', 'Melnick A', 'Stone S', 'Arai S', 'Hawe N', 'Owen G', 'Zelent A', 'Licht JD']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR 97201, USA. hoatlinm@OHSU.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",1999/11/26 00:00,1999/11/26 00:01,['1999/11/26 00:00'],"['1999/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Dec 1;94(11):3737-47.,,,['S0006-4971(20)36689-1 [pii]'],"['0 (ABTB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FANCC protein, human)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']","['CA59938/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL56045/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA73762/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been associated with angiogenesis, growth, dissemination, metastasis, and poor outcome in solid tumors. To assess cellular VEGF levels and their prognostic significance in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we used a radioimmunoassay (RIA) to quantify VEGF levels in stored samples obtained before treatment from 99 patients with newly diagnosed AML treated at the MD Anderson Cancer Center from 1996 to 1998. Outcome in the 99 patients was representative of that observed in all patients seen at this institution with this diagnosis during these years, but the 99 patients had higher white blood cell (WBC) and blast counts than the other patients. Results of the RIA were confirmed by Western blot. There was a relationship between increasing VEGF levels and shorter survival (P =.01), as well as shorter disease-free survival, both from start of treatment and from complete response (CR) date. In contrast, there was no relationship between VEGF level and WBC or blast count, or between VEGF level and such established prognostic factors as age, cytogenetics, performance status, or presence of an antecedent hematologic disorder, and multivariate analysis indicated that VEGF was still prognostic for the above outcomes after accounting for these factors, as well as treatment. Our results suggest that at least in AML patients with higher WBC and blast counts, cellular VEGF level is an independent predictor of outcome.","['Aguayo, A', 'Estey, E', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Mansouri, T', 'Gidel, C', 'Keating, M', 'Giles, F', 'Estrov, Z', 'Barlogie, B', 'Albitar, M']","['Aguayo A', 'Estey E', 'Kantarjian H', 'Mansouri T', 'Gidel C', 'Keating M', 'Giles F', 'Estrov Z', 'Barlogie B', 'Albitar M']","['Departments of Leukemia and Laboratory Medicine, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030-4095, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/mortality', 'Lymphokines/*blood', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",1999/11/26 00:00,1999/11/26 00:01,['1999/11/26 00:00'],"['1999/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Dec 1;94(11):3717-21.,,['Blood. 2000 Nov 15;96(10):3656-7.

One goal of the German randomized CML Studies I and II, which compare IFN +/- chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone, was the analysis of whether treatment with IFN as compared to chemotherapy had an influence on the outcome after BMT. One hundred ninety-seven (23%) of 856 Ph/bcr-abl-positive CML patients were transplanted. One hundred fifty-two patients transplanted in first chronic phase were analyzed: 86 had received IFN, 46 hydroxyurea, and 20 busulfan. Forty-eight patients (32%) had received transplants from unrelated donors. Median observation time after BMT was 4.7 (0.7 to 13.5) years. IFN and chemotherapy cohorts were compared with regard to transplantation risks, duration of treatments, interval from discontinuation of pretransplant treatment to BMT, conditioning therapy, graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis and risk profiles at diagnosis and transplantation, and IFN cohorts also with regard to performance and resistance to IFN. Outcome of patients receiving related or unrelated transplants pretreated with IFN, hydroxyurea, or busulfan was not significantly different. Five-year survival after transplantation was 58% for all patients (57% for IFN, 60% for hydroxyurea and busulfan patients). The outcome within the IFN group was not different by duration of prior IFN therapy more or less than 5 months, 1 year, or 2 years. In contrast, a different impact was observed in IFN-pretreated patients depending on the time of discontinuation of IFN before transplantation. Five-year survival was 46% for the 50 patients who received IFN within the last 90 days before BMT and 71% for the 36 patients who did not (P =.0057). Total IFN dosage had no impact on survival after BMT. We conclude that outcome after BMT is not compromised by pretreatment with IFN if it is discontinued at least 3 months before transplantation. Clear candidates for early transplantation should not be pretreated with IFN.","['Hehlmann, R', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Kolb, H J', 'Hasford, J', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Heimpel, H', 'Siegert, W', 'Finke, J', 'Ehninger, G', 'Holler, E', 'Berger, U', 'Pfirrmann, M', 'Muth, A', 'Zander, A', 'Fauser, A A', 'Heyll, A', 'Nerl, C', 'Hossfeld, D K', 'Loffler, H', 'Pralle, H', 'Queisser, W', 'Tobler, A']","['Hehlmann R', 'Hochhaus A', 'Kolb HJ', 'Hasford J', 'Gratwohl A', 'Heimpel H', 'Siegert W', 'Finke J', 'Ehninger G', 'Holler E', 'Berger U', 'Pfirrmann M', 'Muth A', 'Zander A', 'Fauser AA', 'Heyll A', 'Nerl C', 'Hossfeld DK', 'Loffler H', 'Pralle H', 'Queisser W', 'Tobler A']","['III.

The mechanisms that direct the tissue localization of B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) are unknown. We found that CLL B cells express functional CXCR4 receptors for the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), as demonstrated by receptor endocytosis, calcium mobilization, and actin polymerization assays. Moreover, CLL B cells displayed chemotaxis to this chemokine that could be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against CXCR4, pertussis toxin, or Wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor. That this chemotaxis may be involved in the homing of CLL cells is argued by studies in which CLL B cells were cocultured with a murine marrow stromal cell line that secretes SDF-1. Within 2 hours, CLL B cells spontaneously migrated beneath such stromal cells in vitro (pseudoemperipolesis). This migration could be inhibited by pretreatment of CLL B cells with anti-CXCR4 MoAbs, SDF-1alpha, or pertussis-toxin. Furthermore, we noted strong downmodulation of CXCR4 on CLL B cells that migrated into the stromal cell layer. These findings demonstrate that the chemokine receptor CXCR4 on CLL B cells plays a critical role for heterotypic adherence to marrow stromal cells and provide a new mechanism to account for the marrow infiltration by neoplastic B cells.","['Burger, J A', 'Burger, M', 'Kipps, T J']","['Burger JA', 'Burger M', 'Kipps TJ']","['Department of Medicine, the Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0663, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Cell Movement', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/11/26 00:00,1999/11/26 00:01,['1999/11/26 00:00'],"['1999/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Dec 1;94(11):3658-67.,,,['S0006-4971(20)36679-9 [pii]'],"['0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",['5 R37CA49870-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

To analyze the expression and function of SIRPs, we prepared soluble recombinant fusion proteins of the extracellular regions of SIRPalpha1 and SIRPalpha2, as well as a variety of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against these domains. The antibodies reacted predominantly with monocytes, granulocytes, dendritic cells, and their precursors, as well as with bone marrow CD34(+), AC133(+), CD90(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. In contrast, SIRP expression was absent or significantly reduced on the majority of myeloid blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Functional studies showed that the extracellular domains of SIRPalpha1 and SIRPalpha2 support adhesion of a number of primary hematopoietic cells and cell lines. This interaction could be blocked by 4 of 7 SIRPalpha1-reactive MoAbs. In addition, SIRPalpha1 and SIRPalpha2 competed for the same cell binding site, suggesting a common widely expressed SIRP ligand. In an approach to identify this molecule, MoAbs were generated against the SIRP-binding cell line CCRF-CEM, and MoAb CC2C6 was selected because of its capacity to inhibit cell binding to SIRPalpha1. Further analysis showed that this antibody recognized CD47, a ubiquitously expressed plasma membrane protein previously implicated in integrin function, host defense action, and neutrophil migration. In this study, we identify CD47 as the extracellular ligand for human SIRP and show that these two counterreceptors are involved in cellular adhesion.","['Seiffert, M', 'Cant, C', 'Chen, Z', 'Rappold, I', 'Brugger, W', 'Kanz, L', 'Brown, E J', 'Ullrich, A', 'Buhring, H J']","['Seiffert M', 'Cant C', 'Chen Z', 'Rappold I', 'Brugger W', 'Kanz L', 'Brown EJ', 'Ullrich A', 'Buhring HJ']","['University of Tubingen, the Department of Internal Medicine II, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', '*Antigens, Differentiation', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'CD47 Antigen', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', '*Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules/*biosynthesis', '*Receptors, Immunologic', 'Signal Transduction']",1999/11/26 00:00,1999/11/26 00:01,['1999/11/26 00:00'],"['1999/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Dec 1;94(11):3633-43.,,,['S0006-4971(20)36676-3 [pii]'],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CD47 Antigen)', '0 (CD47 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1)', '0 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (SIRPA protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet a century of study has not revealed the inducing molecules. Using a standard model of induction, we found that ureteric bud cells secrete factors that convert kidney mesenchyme to epithelia that, remarkably, then form nephrons. Purification and sequencing of one such factor identified it as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LIF acted on epithelial precursors that we identified by the expression of Pax2 and Wnt4. Other IL-6 type cytokines acted like LIF, and deletion of their shared receptor reduced nephron development. In situ, the ureteric bud expressed LIF, and metanephric mesenchyme expressed its receptors. The data suggest that IL-6 cytokines are candidate regulators of mesenchymal to epithelial conversion during kidney development.","['Barasch, J', 'Yang, J', 'Ware, C B', 'Taga, T', 'Yoshida, K', 'Erdjument-Bromage, H', 'Tempst, P', 'Parravicini, E', 'Malach, S', 'Aranoff, T', 'Oliver, J A']","['Barasch J', 'Yang J', 'Ware CB', 'Taga T', 'Yoshida K', 'Erdjument-Bromage H', 'Tempst P', 'Parravicini E', 'Malach S', 'Aranoff T', 'Oliver JA']","['Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA. jmb4@columbia.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Embryonic Induction', 'Epithelium/*embryology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Kidney Tubules/embryology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Ligands', 'Lymphokines/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mesoderm/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Nephrons/*embryology', 'PAX2 Transcription Factor', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Ureter/cytology/*embryology', 'Wnt Proteins', 'Wnt4 Protein']",1999/11/26 00:00,1999/11/26 00:01,['1999/11/26 00:00'],"['1999/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell. 1999 Nov 12;99(4):377-86. doi: 10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81524-x.,,,"['S0092-8674(00)81524-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81524-x [doi]']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Il6st protein, rat)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (PAX2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Pax2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Wnt4 Protein)', '0 (Wnt4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Wnt4 protein, rat)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1998, the Ministry of Health, under considerable pressure from the public, decided to promote studies to evaluate its efficacy. METHODS: Follow-up was conducted for cancer patients previously treated during the years 1971-1997 by Dr. Di Bella and registered in his archive. Identified cases were searched in cancer registries for diagnostic confirmation, date of diagnosis, and follow-up. Survival was compared with that in individually matched cancer cases derived from a pool of Italian cancer registries (the ITACARE data base). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were produced for all adult cancer patients as well as for children with leukemia and, in the matched analysis, for patients with cancer at the major anatomic sites and for all cancer patients combined. The homogeneity of survival curves between the two groups was tested by means of the log rank test. RESULTS: After several exclusions, 314 patients were entered into the study. Follow-up was completed for 79%. Only four patients received Di Bella Multitherapy (MDB) as their only anticancer therapy. Of these, only 1 is still alive 2 years after diagnosis. Five-year survival rates for children with leukemia and adult cancer patients were both 29.4%. Five-year survival was significantly lower in comparison with ITACARE cases for patients with childhood leukemia, breast carcinoma, and adult leukemia, and for all cancer patients combined. Twenty-seven MDB patients survived 10 years or longer after diagnosis. In only three cases was this long survival unexpected. CONCLUSIONS: The results for this series did not give any evidence that MDB improved the survival of the cancer patients.

Sequential phase II trials by the cancer and leukemia group B.,1985-91,"BACKGROUND: The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) conducted sequential Phase II multicenter trials to evaluate the activity of edatrexate alone (E) or with leucovorin rescue (EL) in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (CALGB Protocol 9131). METHODS: Twenty patients were accrued to the E portion of the study and received edatrexate, 80 mg/m(2), intravenously over 20-30 minutes weekly. After a protocol amendment precipitated by excessive toxic events with E, 40 patients were enrolled in the EL arm and received the same dose of edatrexate with leucovorin, 15 mg orally, every 6 hours for 4 doses beginning 24 hours after edatrexate. Eligibility criteria included a CALGB performance status of 0-2 and no prior chemotherapy. A central pathology review was performed. Of the 58 patients included in this analysis (20 receiving E and 38 receiving EL), 36 had epithelial cell type and 22 had mixed or sarcomatous cell types. There were 31 patients with measurable disease and 27 with evaluable disease. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 25% for E (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 9-49%) and 16% for EL (95% CI, 6-31%). There was a 5% complete response [CR] rate, a 10% partial response [PR] rate, and a 10% regression [R] rate for E and a 0% CR rate, a 3% PR rate, and a 13% R rate for EL. The median survival duration from study entry was 9.6 months and 6.6 months, respectively, for E and EL; 1-year survival was 50% and 32%, respectively, for E and EL. There were four early deaths with the E regimen (including two from neutropenic sepsis) and one early death with the EL regimen (from progressive disease). Principal toxicities included mu cositis, myelosuppression, and rash, which were less frequent with leucovorin rescue. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate antitumor activity has been observed with both regimens. Leucovorin rescue ameliorated the mucosal, hematologic, and dermatologic toxicities of edatrexate, but also may have reduced its efficacy.","['Kindler, H L', 'Belani, C P', 'Herndon, J E 2nd', 'Vogelzang, N J', 'Suzuki, Y', 'Green, M R']","['Kindler HL', 'Belani CP', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Suzuki Y', 'Green MR']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Aminopterin/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mesothelioma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Pleural Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Failure']",1999/11/26 09:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/11/26 09:00'],"['1999/11/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/11/26 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1999 Nov 15;86(10):1985-91.,,,['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19991115)86:10<1985::AID-CNCR15>3.0.CO;2-H [pii]'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'JT4X6Z1HRR (edatrexate)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)']","['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['Copyright 1999 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was performed to investigate the relevance of cytoplasmic signaling and cytoskeletal assembly to integrin-mediated adhesion induced by chemokines. Adhesion of T cells induced by chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha and MIP-1beta was inhibited by pertussis toxin, wortmannin, and cytochalasin B, suggesting that both G protein-sensitive phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activation and cytoskeletal assemblies are involved. The chemokine-induced T cell adhesion could be mimicked by expression of small G proteins, fully activated H-RasV12, or H-RasV12Y40C mutant, which selectively binds to PI 3-kinase, in T cells, inducing activated form of LFA-1alpha and LFA-1-dependent adhesion to ICAM-1. H-Ras expression also induced F-actin polymerization which colocalized with profilin in T cells. Adult T cell leukemia (ATL) cells spontaneously adhered to ICAM-1, which depended on endogenous MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta through activation of G protein-sensitive PI 3-kinase. H-Ras signal pathway, leading to PI 3-kinase activation, also induced active configuration of LFA-1 and LFA-1-mediated adhesion of ATL cells, whereas expression of a dominant-negative H-Ras mutant failed to do. Profilin-dependent spontaneous polymerization of F-actin in ATL cells was reduced by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In this paper we propose that H-Ras-mediated activation of PI 3-kinase can be involved in induction of LFA-1-dependent adhesion of T cells, which is relevant to chemokine-mediated signaling, and that profilin may form an important link between chemokine- and/or H-Ras-mediated signals and F-actin polymerization, which results in triggering of LFA-1 on T cells or leukemic T cells.","['Tanaka, Y', 'Minami, Y', 'Mine, S', 'Hirano, H', 'Hu, C D', 'Fujimoto, H', 'Fujii, K', 'Saito, K', 'Tsukada, J', 'van Kooyk, Y', 'Figdor, C G', 'Kataoka, T', 'Eto, S']","['Tanaka Y', 'Minami Y', 'Mine S', 'Hirano H', 'Hu CD', 'Fujimoto H', 'Fujii K', 'Saito K', 'Tsukada J', 'van Kooyk Y', 'Figdor CG', 'Kataoka T', 'Eto S']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan, School of Medicine, Kitakyushu, Japan.

PKA has been suggested as a potential target for cancer therapy. The goal of the present study was to evaluate an anti-PKA antisense oligonucleotide (mixed-backbone oligonucleotide) as a therapeutic approach to human cancer treatment. The identified oligonucleotide inhibited the growth of cell lines of human colon cancer (LS174T, DLD-1), leukemia (HL-60), breast cancer (MCF-7, MDA-MB-468), and lung cancer (A549) in a time-, concentration-, and sequence-dependent manner. In a dose-dependent manner, the oligonucleotide displayed in vivo antitumor activity in severe combined immunodeficient and nude mice bearing xenografts of human cancers of the colon (LS174T), breast (MDA-MB-468), and lung (A549). The routes of drug administration were intraperitoneal and oral. Synergistic effects were found when the antisense oligonucleotide was used in combination with the cancer chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin. The pharmacokinetics of the oligonucleotide after oral administration of (35)S-labeled oligonucleotide into tumor-bearing mice indicated an accumulation and retention of the oligonucleotide in tumor tissue. This study further provides a basis for clinical studies of the antisense oligonucleotide targeted to the RIalpha subunit of PKA (GEM 231) as a cancer therapeutic agent used alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy.","['Wang, H', 'Cai, Q', 'Zeng, X', 'Yu, D', 'Agrawal, S', 'Zhang, R']","['Wang H', 'Cai Q', 'Zeng X', 'Yu D', 'Agrawal S', 'Zhang R']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Pharmacology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL 35294-0019, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase RIalpha Subunit', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/11/26 00:00,1999/11/26 00:01,['1999/11/26 00:00'],"['1999/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Nov 23;96(24):13989-94. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.24.13989.,,,['10.1073/pnas.96.24.13989 [doi]'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase RIalpha Subunit)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (PRKAR1A protein, human)', '0 (Prkar1a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",['R01 CA 80698/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC24178,,,,,,,,,,

In human leukemia HL-60/S or HL-60/doxorubicin (DOX)0.05 cells, the levels of topo IIalpha- or beta-protein were similar in either asynchronous exponential or synchronized cultures. Although topo IIalpha was hypophosphorylated in HL-60/DOX0.05 compared with HL-60/S cells, both overall and site-specific hyperphosphorylation of topo IIbeta was apparent in HL-60/DOX0.05 compared with HL-60/S cells. The phosphorylation of topo IIalpha and not beta was enhanced in the S and G(2) + M phases of HL-60/S cells. In contrast, an increase in the phosphorylation of topo IIbeta compared with alpha was apparent in the G(1) and S phases of HL-60/DOX0.05 cells. The cytotoxicity and depletion of topo IIalpha or beta in cells treated with drug for 1 h revealed that mole-for-mole, amsacrine was 2-fold more effective than etoposide in killing HL-60/S or HL-60/DOX0.05 cells and in depleting the beta versus alpha topo II protein. Present results demonstrate that: 1) hyperphosphorylation of topo IIbeta in HL-60/DOX0.05 cells may be a compensatory consequence of the hypophosphorylation of topo IIalpha to maintain normal topo II function during proliferation, and 2) enhanced sensitivity of HL-60/S or HL-60/DOX0.05 cells to amsacrine may be due to the preferential interaction and depletion of topo IIbeta.","['Grabowski, D R', 'Holmes, K A', 'Aoyama, M', 'Ye, Y', 'Rybicki, L A', 'Bukowski, R M', 'Ganapathi, M K', 'Hickson, I D', 'Ganapathi, R']","['Grabowski DR', 'Holmes KA', 'Aoyama M', 'Ye Y', 'Rybicki LA', 'Bukowski RM', 'Ganapathi MK', 'Hickson ID', 'Ganapathi R']","['Experimental Therapeutics Program, Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Amsacrine/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', '*DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/drug effects/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation']",1999/11/26 00:00,1999/11/26 00:01,['1999/11/26 00:00'],"['1999/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1999 Dec;56(6):1340-5. doi: 10.1124/mol.56.6.1340.,,,['10.1124/mol.56.6.1340 [doi]'],"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']","['CA35531/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74939/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective cross sectional study. SETTING: Paediatric oncology centres at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children and the Royal Marsden Hospital. SUBJECTS: Survivors of childhood leukaemia who received cranial irradiation, were in continuous first remission, and had reached final height. An unirradiated group of patients from the United Kingdom acute lymphoblastic leukaemia XI trial was also included; these patients were in continuous first remission and had been followed for at least four years from diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body mass index standard deviation score (BMI z score) at final height for irradiated patients and at most recent follow up for unirradiated patients. Regression analysis was used to examine the effect on BMI z score of sex, age at diagnosis, and the dose of radiation received. RESULTS: For cranially irradiated patients, an increase in the BMI z score at final height was associated with female sex and lower radiation dose, but not with age at diagnosis. Severe obesity, defined as a BMI z score of > 3 at final height, was only present in girls who received 18-20 Gy irradiation and had a prevalence of 8%. Both male and female unirradiated patients had raised BMI z scores at latest follow up and there was no association with age at diagnosis.

The homologation of the lactone E-ring reinforces the stability of the lactone, thus reducing considerably its conversion into a carboxylate form which is inactive. We have recently shown that hCPT is much more active than the parent compound against a variety of tumor cells in vitro and in xenograft models, suggesting that a highly reactive lactone is not essential for topoisomerase I-mediated anticancer activity [Lesueur-Ginot et al. (1999) Cancer Res. 59, 2939-2943]. In the present study, we provide further evidence that hCPT has superior topoisomerase I inhibition capacities to CPT. In particular, we show that replacement of the camptothecin lactone E-ring with a homologous seven-membered lactone ring changes the sequence-specificity of the drug-induced DNA cleavage by topoisomerase I. Both CPT and hCPT stimulate the cleavage by topoisomerase I at T( downward arrow)G sites, but in addition, hCPT stabilizes cleavage at specific sites containing the sequence AAC( downward arrow)G. At low drug concentrations, the cleavage at the T( downward arrow)G sites and at the hCPT-specific C( downward arrow)G sites is more pronounced and more stable with hCPT than with CPT. The in vitro data were confirmed in cells. Higher levels of protein-DNA complexes were detected in P388 leukemia cells treated with hCPT than those treated with CPT. Immunoblotting experiments revealed that endogenous topoisomerase I was efficiently trapped onto DNA by hCPT in cells. Finally, the use of a leukemia cell line resistant to CPT provided evidence that topoisomerase I is involved in the cytotoxicity of hCPT. Altogether, the results show that the beta-hydroxylactone ring of hCPT plays an important and positive role in the poisoning of topoisomerase I. An explanation is proposed to account for such remarkable changes in the sequence specificity of topoisomerase I cleavage consequent to the modification of the lactone. The study sheds new light on the importance of the lactone ring of camptothecins for the stabilization of topoisomerase I-DNA complexes.","['Bailly, C', 'Lansiaux, A', 'Dassonneville, L', 'Demarquay, D', 'Coulomb, H', 'Huchet, M', 'Lavergne, O', 'Bigg, D C']","['Bailly C', 'Lansiaux A', 'Dassonneville L', 'Demarquay D', 'Coulomb H', 'Huchet M', 'Lavergne O', 'Bigg DC']","['INSERM U-524, Laboratoire de Pharmacologie Antitumorale du Centre Oscar Lambret, IRCL, France. bailly@lille.inserm.fr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*chemistry', 'DNA, Superhelical/*chemistry/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemistry/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Leukemia P388', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/11/26 00:00,1999/11/26 00:01,['1999/11/26 00:00'],"['1999/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1999 Nov 23;38(47):15556-63. doi: 10.1021/bi990947h.,,,"['bi990947h [pii]', '10.1021/bi990947h [doi]']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Superhelical)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', 'CW4115HGT9 (homocamptothecin)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to these ""exogenous topoisomerase II poisons,"" DNA lesions such as abasic sites act as ""endogenous poisons"" of the enzyme. Drugs and lesions are believed to stimulate DNA scission by altering the structure of the double helix within the cleavage site of the enzyme. However, the structural alterations that enhance cleavage are unknown. Since abasic sites are an intrinsic part of the genetic material, they represent an attractive model to assess DNA distortions that lead to altered topoisomerase II function. Therefore, the structure of a double-stranded dodecamer containing a tetrahydrofuran apurinic lesion at the +2 position of a topoisomerase II DNA cleavage site was determined by NMR spectroscopy. Three major features distinguished the apurinic structure ( = 0.095) from that of wild-type ( = 0.077). First, loss of base stacking at the lesion collapsed the major groove and reduced the distance between the two scissile phosphodiester bonds. Second, the apurinic lesion induced a bend that was centered about the topoisomerase II cleavage site. Third, the base immediately opposite the lesion was extrahelical and relocated to the minor groove. All of these structural alterations have the potential to influence interactions between topoisomerase II and its DNA substrate.","['Cline, S D', 'Jones, W R', 'Stone, M P', 'Osheroff, N']","['Cline SD', 'Jones WR', 'Stone MP', 'Osheroff N']","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville Tennessee 37232-0146, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/metabolism', 'Apurinic Acid/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Base Sequence/drug effects', '*DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*chemistry/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Deoxyribose/chemistry', 'Furans/chemistry', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Intercalating Agents/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation/drug effects', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Solutions', '*Transcription Factors']",1999/11/26 00:00,1999/11/26 00:01,['1999/11/26 00:00'],"['1999/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1999 Nov 23;38(47):15500-7. doi: 10.1021/bi991750s.,,,"['bi991750s [pii]', '10.1021/bi991750s [doi]']","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Solutions)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '11002-22-5 (Apurinic Acid)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '3N8FZZ6PY4 (tetrahydrofuran)', '533-67-5 (Deoxyribose)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']","['CA55678/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM53960/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'RR05805/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Insertion of an endogenous long terminal repeat into the first coding exon of the gene resulted in the enhanced production of an altered akt protein, RL-akt, and creation of the tumor rejection antigen peptide pRL1. In this study, we constructed an RL-akt-expressing vector to investigate the transforming ability and anti-apoptotic activity of RK-akt in NIH/3T3 cells. RL-akt-expressing clones formed more colonies than did c-akt-expressing clones in soft agar and exhibited increased saturation density, a lower serum requirement for growth, and tumorigenicity on athymic nude mice. Immunoblot analysis of subcellular protein distribution showed that a considerable proportion of RL-akt was distributed in the membrane fraction. Thus, RL-akt expressed in NIH/3T3 cells appeared to behave like the v-akt oncoprotein. Furthermore, the RL-akt gene conferred resistance to the apoptosis induced by the calcium ionophore A23187 and by ultraviolet irradiation of NIH/3T3 cells. These findings indicate that the RL-akt gene is able to transform cells and exerts an anti-apoptotic effect on recipient cells, thereby implicating the gene in leukemogenesis of RL(male symbol)1 cells.","['Tanino, M', 'Matsuo, M', 'Uenaka, A', 'Tsukuda, K', 'Ouchida, M', 'Nakayama, E', 'Shimizu, K']","['Tanino M', 'Matsuo M', 'Uenaka A', 'Tsukuda K', 'Ouchida M', 'Nakayama E', 'Shimizu K']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Okayama University Medical School, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/pathology', 'Plasmids', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transfection', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 1999 Dec;26(4):286-97.,,,['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2744(199912)26:4<286::AID-MC7>3.0.CO;2-U [pii]'],"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

While microglia cells appear to be the major target cells within the brain parenchyma for neurovirulent MuLV, degenerating neurons do not express retroviral gene products. In order to protect rats from neuronal damage we treated retrovirally infected rats once with monoamine oxidase (MAO) B inhibitor Selegiline which--under different conditions--exerts neuroprotective effects. Unexpectedly, when administered at 17 days post-infection (d.p.i.) a single intraperitoneal dose of Selegilin (1 mg/kg bodyweight) significantly shortened the incubation period for neurological disease. In contrast, Selegiline given in a lower dosage (0.05 mg/kg bodyweight) and/or at a different time point (13 d.p.i.) at the low (0.05 mg/kg bodyweight) and the high dose (1.0 mg/kg bodyweight) had no effect on the outcome of neurological disease. Animals treated with Selegiline (1.0 mg/kg bodyweight at 17 d.p.i.) contained higher amounts of viral loads in the CNS, higher numbers of brain cells expressing major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, and exhibited inhibition of MAO-B in comparison to untreated yet infected (control) animals. Supposedly, Selegiline activated the major target cell population of the CNS for MuLV-NT40, microglia, with the consequence of enhanced susceptibility for retroviral infection and triggered endogenous mechanism(s) involved in the pathogenesis of retroviral neurodegeneration.","['Czub, M', 'Czub, S', 'Gosztonyi, G', 'Koutsilieri, E', 'Sopper, S', 'Muller, J G', 'Gerlach, M', 'Riederer, P', 'ter Meulen, V']","['Czub M', 'Czub S', 'Gosztonyi G', 'Koutsilieri E', 'Sopper S', 'Muller JG', 'Gerlach M', 'Riederer P', 'ter Meulen V']","['Institut fur Virologie, Universitat Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurovirol,Journal of neurovirology,9508123,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Brain/metabolism/virology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases/metabolism/prevention & control/*virology', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Retroviridae Infections/metabolism/prevention & control/*virology', 'Selegiline/*toxicity', 'Tumor Virus Infections/metabolism/prevention & control/*virology']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurovirol. 1999 Oct;5(5):458-64. doi: 10.3109/13550289909045374.,,,['10.3109/13550289909045374 [doi]'],"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '2K1V7GP655 (Selegiline)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

During 120-h continuous exposure, HNSCC cell lines A253 and FaDu are equally MTX sensitive (EC50 equals approximately 15nM); AG337 is less potent (EC50 approximately equals 1 microM). A253 is intrinsically resistant to 24-h intermittent MTX exposure (EC50 equals approximately 17 microM; FaDu, EC50 equals approximately 0.3 microM); both HNSCC cell lines are resistant to 24-h AG337 exposure (EC50 >100 microM). CCRF-CEM shows MTX (EC50 =14 nM) and AG337 (EC50 equals approximately 0.6 microM) sensitivity in continuous exposure similar to HNSCC; however, AG337 retains potency against CCRF-CEM cells in intermittent exposure (24-h, EC50 equals approximately 2 microM; 6-h, EC50 equals approximately 48 microM). The reduced folate leucovorin (LV) at > or = 0.1 microM fully protects from growth inhibition by continuous MTX exposure, but growth inhibition by AG337 is reversed only slightly by < or = 100 microM LV. Thymidine fully protects A253 and FaDu against growth inhibition by AG337, while hypoxanthine alone is without effect, suggesting inhibition is TS-specific. CCRF-CEM sublines with acquired MTX-resistance resulting from DHFR overexpression, defective MTX transport, or defective MTX polyglutamylation retain full sensitivity to AG337 in continuous exposure (all EC50 =0.4 microM). These data indicate that AG337 may be useful in therapy of tumors that have acquired resistance to MTX by most common mechanisms.","['McGuire, J J', 'Canestrari, J G', 'Nagel, G S']","['McGuire JJ', 'Canestrari JG', 'Nagel GS']","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fetal Blood/metabolism', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine/pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leucovorin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Thymidine Phosphorylase/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1999 Dec;15(6):1245-50. doi: 10.3892/ijo.15.6.1245.,,,['10.3892/ijo.15.6.1245 [doi]'],"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 2.4.2.4 (Thymidine Phosphorylase)', 'K75ZUN743Q (nolatrexed)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']","['CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA65755/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

IVIg treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia induced a reduction in the total number of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. Regression of Kaposi's sarcoma was also noted in an HIV patient treated with IVIg. The aim of this study was to determine whether F(ab')2 prepared from IVIg binds to cellular structures of different tumor tissues. Biotinylated F(ab')2 was prepared from 3 different preparations of IVIg and from affinity purified IgG from a patient with multiple myeloma. Direct immunohistochemistry using a streptavidin peroxidase staining method was performed on biopsy samples of 18 different tumor tissues. Positive staining of the cytoplasm, cell membrane and nuclear membrane of several types of malignant tumors by F(ab')2 from IVIg was immunohistochemically demonstrated. Nuclear staining of tumor cells by IVIg was rare. IVIg bound to different tumors of epithelial origin, especially colon carcinoma, breast carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Malignant tumors of mesenchymal origin such as leiomyosarcoma have also demonstrated positive staining by IVIg. IVIg contains antibodies to the cytoplasm, nuclear membrane and cell membrane of different malignant tumors especially of epithelial origin. This binding might provide a basis for the assumption that IVIg treatment of cancer patients may induce antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity response against tumors, and implies that it can be potentially beneficial as adjuvant treatment of malignant diseases.","['Bar-Dayan, Y', 'Barshack, I', 'Blank, M', 'Goldberg, I', 'Levy, Y', 'Kopolovic, J', 'Fishman, P', 'Shoenfeld, Y']","['Bar-Dayan Y', 'Barshack I', 'Blank M', 'Goldberg I', 'Levy Y', 'Kopolovic J', 'Fishman P', 'Shoenfeld Y']","['Department of Medicine and Research Unit of Autoimmune Diseases, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Breast Neoplasms/immunology', 'Cell Membrane/*immunology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/immunology', 'Cytoplasm/*immunology', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/analysis/immunology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lung Neoplasms/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology', 'Melanoma/immunology', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Envelope/*immunology', 'Osteosarcoma/immunology', 'Thymoma/immunology']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1999 Dec;15(6):1091-6. doi: 10.3892/ijo.15.6.1091.,,,['10.3892/ijo.15.6.1091 [doi]'],"['0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neither isoform is expressed in EL4. Guanine nucleotide-independent PLD activity is present in membranes from all cells expressing PLD2. In PC12K cells, which express only PLD2, treatment with nerve growth factor causes neurite outgrowth and increases expression of PLD2 mRNA and protein within 6-12 h.

We have recently shown that ADF/hTRX protects the lung and the heart from ischemia-reperfusion induced injury. To elucidate mechanisms of the protective effect, a hypoxia-reoxygenation (H-R) injury model was developed using a murine endothelial cell line, cultured in a thiol-free medium. In this condition, cells became much more vulnerable to H-R injury. The viability of cells decreased significantly after 1 h of hypoxic incubation followed by 1 h of reoxygenation. The injury was reduced by ADF/hTRX (100 microM) or NAC (10 mM). These two agents also demonstrated an additive protective effect. When cells were cultured in thiol-free medium for 2 h in a normoxic condition, intracellular hydrogen peroxide production was increased, which was associated with a decrease in glutathione level. NAC (10 mM) attenuated these changes whereas ADF/hTRX (100 microM) did not. These results suggest that although both ADF/hTRX and NAC protected cells from H-R injury, the underlying mechanisms are different. Because the cytoprotective effect of ADF/hTRX occurs in the thiol-free condition, it must be mediated via a novel mechanism other than enhancing thiol uptake. The additive cytoprotective effect between ADF/hTRX and NAC suggests that we should combine these two agents clinically.","['Isowa, N', 'Yoshimura, T', 'Kosaka, S', 'Liu, M', 'Hitomi, S', 'Yodoi, J', 'Wada, H']","['Isowa N', 'Yoshimura T', 'Kosaka S', 'Liu M', 'Hitomi S', 'Yodoi J', 'Wada H']","['Department of Thoracic Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', '*Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', '*Cytoprotection', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endothelium/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasm Proteins/pharmacology', 'Oxidants/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Oxygen/*metabolism', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*physiology', 'Thioredoxins/*pharmacology']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2000 Jan;182(1):33-40. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(200001)182:1<33::AID-JCP4>3.0.CO;2-5.,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(200001)182:1<33::AID-JCP4>3.0.CO;2-5 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(200001)182:1<33::AID-JCP4>3.0.CO;2-5 [doi]']","['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

This peptide, the hydrophobic amino-terminus of p15E, has been proven to be fusogenic and to promote the formation of highly curved, intermediate structures on the lamellar liquid-crystal to inverse hexagonal phase transition pathway. The FeLV peptide produces marked effects on the thermotropic mesomorphic behaviour of MeDOPE, a phospholipid with an intermediate spontaneous radius of curvature. The peptide is shown to reduce the lamellar repeat distance of the membrane prior to the onset of an inverted cubic phase. This suggests that membrane thinning may play a role in peptide-induced membrane fusion and strengthens the link between the fusion pathway and inverted cubic phase formation.

Among 107 patients diagnosed with CML between 1982 and 1997, 72 CP cases evaluable for long-term follow-up included 13 patients treated with BU alone, 18 with HU alone, and 41 with IFN-based therapy. Complete cytogenetic response (CCR) was achieved in 4/41 IFN cases (10%), and partial or minimal cytogenetic response occurred in 18/41 IFN cases (44%). In contrast, no cytogenetic response (NCR) was achieved in any BU or HU case. IFN treatment for 6 to 60 months was needed to achieve CCR. Overall survival curves revealed that the IFN group had significantly better survival than BU and HU groups (p=0.008 and 0.04, respectively). A significant correlation was found between karyotypic findings and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses in IFN-treated cases (r=0.739, p=0.0001). In some cases, however, the two methods showed discrepancy; BCR/ABL-positive cells represented only 20-75% of interphase bone marrow cells in NCR cases, although all metaphases examined were positive for the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). A discrepancy was also seen in CCR cases; up to 22% of cells assessed were BCR/ABL-positive. These findings suggest that IFN is a useful therapy for CML in CP, and may have a suppressive effect on the CML clone even in NCR cases. The results also indicate that a combination of FISH and cytogenetic analyses may provide more detailed information for evaluating the efficacy of IFN than conventional cytogenetics alone.","['Itoh, T', 'Tamura, S', 'Takemoto, Y', 'Kakishita, E']","['Itoh T', 'Tamura S', 'Takemoto Y', 'Kakishita E']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 663-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aneuploidy', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', '*Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Survival Rate']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 1999 Dec;4(6):659-63. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.4.6.659.,,,['10.3892/ijmm.4.6.659 [doi]'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous work from our laboratory has shown that active Fes exists as a large oligomeric complex in vitro. However, when Fes is expressed in mammalian cells, its kinase activity is tightly repressed. The Fes unique N-terminal sequence has two regions with strong homology to coiled-coil-forming domains often found in oligomeric proteins. Here we show that disruption or deletion of the first coiled-coil domain upregulates Fes tyrosine kinase and transforming activities in Rat-2 fibroblasts and enhances Fes differentiation-inducing activity in myeloid leukemia cells. Conversely, expression of a Fes truncation mutant consisting only of the unique N-terminal domain interfered with Rat-2 fibroblast transformation by an activated Fes mutant, suggesting that oligomerization is essential for Fes activation in vivo. Coexpression with the Fes N-terminal region did not affect the transforming activity of v-Src in Rat-2 cells, arguing against a nonspecific suppressive effect. Taken together, these findings suggest a model in which Fes activation may involve coiled-coil-mediated interconversion of monomeric and oligomeric forms of the kinase. Mutation of the first coiled-coil domain may activate Fes by disturbing intramolecular coiled-coil interaction, allowing for oligomerization via the second coiled-coil domain. Deletion of the second coiled-coil domain blocks fibroblast transformation by an activated form of c-Fes, consistent with this model. These results provide the first evidence for regulation of a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase by coiled-coil domains.","['Cheng, H', 'Rogers, J A', 'Dunham, N A', 'Smithgall, T E']","['Cheng H', 'Rogers JA', 'Dunham NA', 'Smithgall TE']","['Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mutagenesis', 'Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src)/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Dec;19(12):8335-43. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.12.8335.,,,['10.1128/MCB.19.12.8335 [doi]'],"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FES protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes)']","['R01 CA058667/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58667/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC84918,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to their restricted biological action in vivo, however, most homeodomain factors exhibit promiscuous DNA binding properties in vitro, suggesting a requirement for additional cofactors that enhance target site selectivity. In this regard, the pbx family of homeobox genes has been found to heterodimerize with and thereby augment the DNA binding activity of certain hox proteins on a subset of potential target sites. Here we examine the transcriptional properties of a forced hox-pbx heterodimer containing the pancreas-specific orphan homeobox factor pdx fused to pbx-1a. Compared to the pdx monomer, the forced pdx-pbx1a dimer, displayed 10- to 20-fold-higher affinity for a consensus hox-pbx binding site but was completely unable to bind a hox monomer recognition site. The pdx-pbx dimer stimulated target gene expression via an N-terminal trans-activation domain in pdx that interacts with the coactivator CREB binding protein. The pdx-pbx dimer was also found to repress transcription via a C-terminal domain in pbx-1a that associates with the corepressors SMRT and NCoR. The transcriptional properties of the pdx-pbx1 complex appear to be regulated at the level of alternative splicing; a pdx-pbx polypeptide containing the pbx1b isoform, which lacks the C-terminal extension in pbx1a, was unable to repress target gene expression via NCoR-SMRT. Since pbx1a and pbx1b are differentially expressed in endocrine versus exocrine compartments of the adult pancreas, our results illustrate a novel mechanism by which pbx proteins may modulate the expression of specific genetic programs, either positively or negatively, during development.","['Asahara, H', 'Dutta, S', 'Kao, H Y', 'Evans, R M', 'Montminy, M']","['Asahara H', 'Dutta S', 'Kao HY', 'Evans RM', 'Montminy M']","['Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Dec;19(12):8219-25. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.12.8219.,,,['10.1128/MCB.19.12.8219 [doi]'],"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NCOR1 protein, human)', '0 (NCOR2 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 protein)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)']","['R01 DK049777/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P0I54418/PHS HHS/United States', 'R0IDK49777/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC84906,,,,,,,,,,

The activity of these enzymes was evaluated in vivo, using a stable episomal system that employs plasmids as targets for DNA methylation in human cells. De novo methylation of a subset of the CpG sites on the stable episomes is detected in human cells overexpressing the murine Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b1 protein. This de novo methylation activity is abolished when the cysteine in the P-C motif, which is the catalytic site of cytosine methyltransferases, is replaced by a serine. The pattern of methylation on the episome is nonrandom, and different regions of the episome are methylated to different extents. Furthermore, Dnmt3a also methylates the sequence methylated by Dnmt3a on the stable episome in the corresponding chromosomal target. Overexpression of human DNMT1 or murine Dnmt3b does not lead to the same pattern or degree of de novo methylation on the episome as overexpression of murine Dnmt3a. This finding suggests that these three enzymes may have different targets or requirements, despite the fact that weak de novo methyltransferase activity has been demonstrated in vitro for all three enzymes. It is also noteworthy that both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b proteins coat the metaphase chromosomes while displaying a more uniform pattern in the nucleus.

PCAF activity has been shown strongly associated with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. In this report, we present evidence for a HAT-independent transcription function that is activated in the presence of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax protein. In vitro and in vivo GST-Tax pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that there is a direct interaction between Tax and PCAF, independent of p300/CBP. PCAF can be recruited to the HTLV-1 Tax responsive element in the presence of Tax, and PCAF cooperates with Tax in vivo to activate transcription from the HTLV-1 LTR over 10-fold. Point mutations at Tax amino acid 318 (TaxS318A) or 319 to 320 (Tax M47), which have decreased or no activity on the HTLV-1 promoter, are defective for PCAF binding. Strikingly, the ability of PCAF to stimulate Tax transactivation is not solely dependent on the PCAF HAT domain. Two independent PCAF HAT mutants, which knock out acetyltransferase enzyme activity, activate Tax transactivation to approximately the same level as wild-type PCAF. In contrast, p300 stimulation of Tax transactivation is HAT dependent. These studies provide experimental evidence that PCAF contains a coactivator transcription function independent of the HAT activity on the viral long terminal repeat.","['Jiang, H', 'Lu, H', 'Schiltz, R L', 'Pise-Masison, C A', 'Ogryzko, V V', 'Nakatani, Y', 'Brady, J N']","['Jiang H', 'Lu H', 'Schiltz RL', 'Pise-Masison CA', 'Ogryzko VV', 'Nakatani Y', 'Brady JN']","['Virus Tumor Biology Section, Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression, Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Acetyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Response Elements', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors']",1999/11/24 09:00,2000/03/25 09:00,['1999/11/24 09:00'],"['1999/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '1999/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Dec;19(12):8136-45. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.12.8136.,,,['10.1128/MCB.19.12.8136 [doi]'],"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP-associated factor)']",,,PMC84898,,['Mol Cell Biol 2000 Mar;20(5):1897'],,,,,,,,

Phosphorylation of IkappaB by IKK leads to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, resulting in the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. The oncogenic protein Tax, encoded by human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1), stimulates IKK activity to result in constitutive nuclear levels of NF-kappaB. In an attempt to gain insights into the mechanism by which Tax mediates constitutive activation of the NF-kappaB pathway, we analyzed the chromatographic distribution of IKK proteins using cellular extracts prepared from three T lymphocytes either lacking or containing Tax. IKK kinase activity and the distribution of proteins in the IKK complex were characterized. In extracts prepared from cells containing Tax, the activity of both IKKalpha and IKKbeta present in the 700-kDa IKK complex were increased. Surprisingly, cell lines expressing Tax also contained an additional peak of IKKbeta, but not IKKalpha activity, that migrated at 300 kDa rather than at 700 kDa. We noted that extracts containing Tax had extremely low levels of IkappaBbeta, but not IkappaBalpha, and contained predominantly a truncated form of the MAP3K MEKK1. These results suggest that Tax may target several components of the NF-kappaB pathway leading to constitutive activation of this important regulator of cellular gene expression.","['Li, X H', 'Murphy, K M', 'Palka, K T', 'Surabhi, R M', 'Gaynor, R B']","['Li XH', 'Murphy KM', 'Palka KT', 'Surabhi RM', 'Gaynor RB']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Simmons Cancer Center, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75235-8594, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Cadmium/pharmacology', 'Cell Extracts/chemistry', 'Chromatography/methods', '*Cyclin-Dependent Kinases', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*physiology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', '*MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology/virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Nov 26;274(48):34417-24. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.48.34417.,,,"['10.1074/jbc.274.48.34417 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)53548-7 [pii]']","['0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKE protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (NF-kappa B kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior cross-linking experiments have revealed that Tax makes restricted contact with this DNA at two symmetric positions, 14 nucleotides apart on opposite strands of the DNA. Tax lacks a conventional DNA binding domain, and the sequences in Tax that are in contact with DNA have not been previously identified. Analysis of cross-linked peptides now shows that the contact occurs between Tax residues 89 and 110, corresponding to a protease-sensitive linker joining two protein structural domains. The linker assumes a protease-resistant conformation in the cross-linked complex. Point mutations within the linker prevent cross-linking and interfere with Tax function.

Here, we report the purification of human recombinant COOH-terminal His-tagged sPLA(2)-X, the preparation of its antibody, and the purification of native sPLA(2)-X. The affinity-purified sPLA(2)-X protein migrated as various molecular species of 13-18 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and N-glycosidase F treatment caused shifts to the 13- and 14-kDa bands. NH(2)-terminal amino acid sequencing analysis revealed that the 13-kDa form is a putative mature sPLA(2)-X and the 14-kDa protein possesses a propeptide of 11 amino acid residues attached at the NH(2) termini of the mature protein. Separation with reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography revealed that N-linked carbohydrates are not required for the enzymatic activity and pro-sPLA(2)-X has a relatively weak potency compared with the mature protein. The mature sPLA(2)-X induced the release of arachidonic acid from phosphatidylcholine more efficiently than other human sPLA(2) groups (IB, IIA, IID, and V) and elicited a prompt and marked release of arachidonic acid from human monocytic THP-1 cells compared with sPLA(2)-IB and -IIA with concomitant production of prostaglandin E(2). A prominent release of arachidonic acid was also observed in sPLA(2)-X-treated human U937 and HL60 cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of human lung preparations revealed its expression in alveolar epithelial cells. These results indicate that human sPLA(2)-X is a unique N-glycosylated sPLA(2) that releases arachidonic acid from human myeloid leukemia cells more efficiently than sPLA(2)-IB and -IIA.","['Hanasaki, K', 'Ono, T', 'Saiga, A', 'Morioka, Y', 'Ikeda, M', 'Kawamoto, K', 'Higashino, K', 'Nakano, K', 'Yamada, K', 'Ishizaki, J', 'Arita, H']","['Hanasaki K', 'Ono T', 'Saiga A', 'Morioka Y', 'Ikeda M', 'Kawamoto K', 'Higashino K', 'Nakano K', 'Yamada K', 'Ishizaki J', 'Arita H']","['Shionogi Research Laboratories, Shionogi and Co., Ltd., Sagisu 5-12-4, Fukushima-ku, Osaka 553-0002, Japan. kohji.hanasaki@shionogi.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Arachidonic Acid/*metabolism', 'Arachidonic Acids/pharmacology', 'CHO Cells', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Dinoprostone/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids/metabolism', 'Group II Phospholipases A2', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Lung/enzymology', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/immunology/pharmacology', 'Phospholipases A/genetics/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Nov 26;274(48):34203-11. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.48.34203.,,,"['10.1074/jbc.274.48.34203 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)53519-0 [pii]']","['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '00XIW1CR0F (arachidonyltrifluoromethane)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Group II Phospholipases A2)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We referred to this protein as ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD). The ASC gene was mapped on chromosome 16p11.2-12.

Concern persists that the risk is increased when 6MP is used. We report our experience with malignant tumors developing over 27 yr of treating IBD patients with 6MP. METHODS: A total of 591 patients with IBD treated with 6MP between 1969 and 1997 were followed or traced until present to identify all malignant tumors and blood dyscrasias that had developed to determine the type, distribution, and duration of the IBD, the dose and duration of 6MP therapy, the concurrent versus previous use of 6MP, the incidence and probable relationship of 6MP to specific neoplasms, and whether the 6MP had been effective in treatment. RESULTS: A total of 550 patients (93%) fulfilled the criteria for follow-up; these included 380 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 170 with ulcerative colitis (UC). Twenty-five patients had developed neoplasms (16 of 380 CD and nine of 170 UC) (p = 0.66). In half of the cases, the goal of therapy had been achieved with 6MP. In 10 patients, the neoplasm was diagnosed while the patients were taking 6MP (40%) and in 15, many years after the 6MP had been terminated (60%). The incidence of neoplasms (25 of 550) was 2.7/1000 patient-years of follow-up. The most common neoplasms were found in the bowel (eight of 550, 1.6%; five CD, and three UC), and breast (three, 0.5%; two CD, and one UC). Non-Hodgkins lymphomas occurred in two patients with CD; one was cerebral and the other abdominal. One patient with CD developed leukemia. The duration of 6MP therapy ranged from 5 months to 22 yr, with a mean of 5 yr. The dose of 6MP ranged from a quarter of a tablet/day (12.5 mg) to 100 mg/day, with the majority in a range from 50 to 75 mg/day. CONCLUSION: In no instance could a neoplasm be attributed to the use of 6MP. The incidence of colon cancer is not greater than that with long standing colitis. Suspicion of a relationship between 6MP and leukemia/lymphoma persists, but the incidence is low. This must be weighed against the improved quality of life due to 6MP for patients with IBD.","['Korelitz, B I', 'Mirsky, F J', 'Fleisher, M R', 'Warman, J I', 'Wisch, N', 'Gleim, G W']","['Korelitz BI', 'Mirsky FJ', 'Fleisher MR', 'Warman JI', 'Wisch N', 'Gleim GW']","['Department of Medicine, Lenox Hill Hospital and The New York University School of Medicine, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Gastroenterol,The American journal of gastroenterology,0421030,IM,"['Abdominal Neoplasms', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Brain Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Breast Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Colitis, Ulcerative/drug therapy', 'Crohn Disease/drug therapy', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/*drug therapy', 'Intestinal Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Gastroenterol. 1999 Nov;94(11):3248-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1572-0241.1999.01530.x.,,,"['S0002-9270(99)00589-4 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1572-0241.1999.01530.x [doi]']","['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In general, response rates were higher with combination regimens, but their impact on survival is unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis of 25 trials involving a total of 5,156 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer randomized to a single-agent arm versus a combination arm. The results showed that combination chemotherapy produced a nearly twofold increase in response rate and a modestly improved 1-year survival rate compared with single-agent chemotherapy. However, toxicity was significantly increased, with a 3.6-fold increase in treatment-related mortality. In a subset analysis of trials using either a platinum analog or vinorelbine as single agents and as a component of the combination regimen, the difference was no longer statistically significant, suggesting that more active single agents provide similar survival with less toxicity than combination regimens. Based on these results, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B initiated a large randomized trial comparing paclitaxel with paclitaxel + carboplatin in stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer patients. The trial will be able to detect a 30% difference in survival.

The authors evaluated in PBPC concentrates the content of cell parameters needed for transplantation. In the subsequent part of the trial they mention the times of engraftment after autologous transplantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: The authors evaluated parameters of 26 separations of PBPC in 11 haematooncological patients with a good effect of mobilisation therapy and with concentration of CD 34+ cells higher than 20 x 10(3)/ml of peripheral blood. The separations of PBPC were implemented on the Cobe Spectra and Baxter CS 3000 Plus equipment under a standard regime with processing of 12 l blood, i.e. 2.7 total blood volumes of the patients. In the mentioned group of patients already from one separation an adequate amount of CD 34+ cells for their transplantation was obtained. Transplantation doses were prepared on average from two separations and amounted as regards MNC/kg, CD 34+ cells/kg and CFU-GM/kg to 4.3 x 10(8), 17.1 x 10(6) and 2.5 x 10(4). The assembled parameters correspond to, or in some parameters exceed, recommended amounts for their transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: In well mobilised patients under the regime of standard separations adequate amounts of progenitor cells for their autologous transplantation were obtained. Transplantation doses were prepared from two collections. Investigation of pre-separation concentration of CD 34+ cells in the peripheral blood is a reliable indicator for starting PBPC separation. Early post-transplantation results indicate the time of engraftment 10 days on average and minor need of substitution therapy with blood products.","['Gasova, Z', 'Ludvikova, Z', 'Kucerova, I', 'Marinov, I', 'Hruba, A', 'Trneny, M', 'Slaby, J']","['Gasova Z', 'Ludvikova Z', 'Kucerova I', 'Marinov I', 'Hruba A', 'Trneny M', 'Slaby J']","['Ustav hematologie a krevni transfuze, Praha.']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,IM,"['Adult', '*Blood Component Removal', 'Breast Neoplasms/therapy', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Male']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 1999 Jun 7;138(12):369-73.,,,,,,,,,,,Separace hemopoetickych progenitorovych bunek z periferni krve (PBPC) u pacientu s hematoonkologickymi malignitami.,,,,,,

NPY did not activate phospholipase D, determined as a phosphatidylethanol formation, or protein kinase C (PKC) determined enzymatically as a translocation to the plasma membrane. However, NPY caused a rapid (already maximal after 30 s) and concentration-dependent (maximum at 10-100 nM) activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) as assessed by immunoblotting with epitope-specific, antiphosphotyrosine antibodies and in some cases enzymatically. ERK activation by 100 nM NPY was abolished by the Y(1) NPY receptor antagonist BIBP 3226 (1 microM), pertussis toxin treatment (100 ng ml(-1) overnight), the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase inhibitor PD 98059 (100 microM), and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (100 nM). Whereas the PKC inhibitor staurosporine (3 microM) inhibited ERK activation by NPY, the chemically distinct PKC inhibitors calphostin C (3 microM), Go 6976 (3 microM), and bisindolylmaleimide I (3 microM) did not. NPY did not activate other MAPK such as jun N-terminal kinase or p38 MAPK. We conclude that NPY does not activate phospholipase D, PKC, jun N-terminal kinase, or p38 MAPK in HEL cells. However, NPY activates ERK by a pathway involving Y(1) receptors, pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, whereas PKC may not be involved. Staurosporine may have PKC-independent effects on ERK activation.","['Keffel, S', 'Schmidt, M', 'Bischoff, A', 'Michel, M C']","['Keffel S', 'Schmidt M', 'Bischoff A', 'Michel MC']","['Department of Medicine, University of Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,IM,"['Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Space/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neuropeptide Y/*pharmacology', 'Phospholipase D/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1999 Dec;291(3):1172-8.,,,,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neuropeptide Y)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the first trial using an alpha-particle emitter in humans. The linear energy transfer of alpha particles is several hundredfold greater than that of beta emissions. The range in tissue is approximately 60-90 microm. METHODS: The activity administered to patients ranged from 0.6 to 1.6 GBq. Patient imaging was initiated at the start of each injection. Thirty 1-min images followed by ten 3-min images were collected in dynamic mode; a 20% photopeak window centered at 440 keV was used. Blood samples were collected until 3 h postinjection and counted in a gamma counter. Contours around the liver and spleen were drawn on the anterior and posterior views and around a portion of the spine on the posterior views. No other organs were visualized. RESULTS: The percentage injected dose in the liver and spleen volumes increased rapidly over the first 10-15 min to a constant value for the remaining hour of imaging, yielding a very rapid uptake followed by a plateau in the antibody uptake curves. The kinetic curves were integrated to yield cumulated activity. The mean energy emitted per nuclear transition for 213Bi and its daughters, adjusted by a relative biologic effectiveness of 5 for alpha emissions, was multiplied by the cumulated activity to yield the absorbed dose equivalent. Photon dose to the total body was determined by calculating a photon-absorbed fraction. The absorbed dose equivalent to liver and spleen volumes ranged from 2.4 to 11.2 and 2.9 to 21.9 Sv, respectively. Marrow (or leukemia) mean dose ranged from 6.6 to 12.2 Sv. The total-body dose (photons only) ranged from 2.2 x 10(-4) to 5.8 x 10(-4) Gy. CONCLUSION: This study shows that patient imaging of 213Bi, an alpha-particle emitter, labeled to HuM195 is possible and may be used to derive pharmacokinetics and dosimetry. The absorbed dose ratio between marrow, liver and spleen volumes and the whole body for 213Bi-HuM195 is 1000-fold greater than that commonly observed with beta-emitting radionuclides used for radioimmunotherapy.","['Sgouros, G', 'Ballangrud, A M', 'Jurcic, J G', 'McDevitt, M R', 'Humm, J L', 'Erdi, Y E', 'Mehta, B M', 'Finn, R D', 'Larson, S M', 'Scheinberg, D A']","['Sgouros G', 'Ballangrud AM', 'Jurcic JG', 'McDevitt MR', 'Humm JL', 'Erdi YE', 'Mehta BM', 'Finn RD', 'Larson SM', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Department of Medical Physics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Alpha Particles', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', '*Bismuth', 'Gamma Cameras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnostic imaging/*radiotherapy', 'Mice', '*Radioimmunotherapy', '*Radioisotopes', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Radiotherapy Dosage']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Nucl Med. 1999 Nov;40(11):1935-46.,,['J Nucl Med. 2000 Sep;41(9):1596.

Temporal central nervous system remission was induced by intrathecal chemotherapy only. However, 2 months later, multiple focal mass lesions had developed in the brain. ATRA (45 mg/m2) was restarted together with multiple intrathecal injections of anticancer drugs, and a third remission was achieved. It is conceivable that the incorporation of ATRA in induction chemotherapy is related to the development of this rather rare complication of APL.

In addition, 51 cases of vocal fold leukoplakia and approximately 700 cases of vocal fold polyp and polypoid vocal fold were diagnosed. As mentioned in previous reports, examinations of this type present both definite benefits and deficiencies. Many problems still remain. Examples of these are the small absolute numbers of examinees, the rather heavy burden placed upon the examining doctor, and the low incidence of laryngeal cancer in female patients. Laryngeal cancer is predominantly a male disease, but female patients should not be excluded from receiving screening examinations. In recent years, many thyroid tumors have been detected in female patients.

Further studies found 14 clonal chromosome aberrations in cells from 11 patients (21.2%); clones observed in the cells from 2 of these patients had high frequencies of chromosome abnormalities. In one case, 68 to 100% of the cells analyzed had a large partial loss in the short arm of chromosome 1 and a translocation between the short arms of chromosomes 2 and 3 [46,XY,1p-,t(2p+;3p-)]. The cells from the other patient contained a clone with partial loss of both the short and long arms of chromosome 5 (46,XX,5p-,5q-). The frequency of this clone has been constant for the last 15 years (6-24%). We also analyzed bone marrow mononuclear cells from 17 of the patients for mutations of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene (formerly known as p53). However, no mutation was found in any of the cells, including those from the 2 patients with abnormal clones.

Their derivation requires both epidemiological data and organ doses calculated from the volume of Thorotrast injected and a knowledge of its pattern of deposition within the body. However, accumulating evidence suggests that the organ partition of (232)Th that has commonly been used for dosimetry (i.e. liver:spleen:red bone marrow: others tissues = 59:29:9:3) is inaccurate. In the present study, the organ distribution of (232)Th has been recalculated using a revised averaging method and both published data and our own unpublished data. For the three major organs of deposition (liver, spleen and bone marrow), activity concentration data were selected from 27 published papers and data sets including 140 newly compiled Japanese cases. For organs of minor storage, both published data for 38 German and 24 Japanese autopsy cases and new data were used. The revised estimate of the relative partition of (232)Th among the above organs was 53:14:25:8. It follows that doses calculated to date are essentially correct for the liver but are too high for the spleen and about three times too low for the red bone marrow. This suggests that the risk of alpha-particle-induced leukemia, per unit of alpha-particle dose, in Thorotrast patients is about three times lower than previously thought.","['Ishikawa, Y', 'Humphreys, J A', 'Collier, C G', 'Priest, N D', 'Kato, Y', 'Mori, T', 'Machinami, R']","['Ishikawa Y', 'Humphreys JA', 'Collier CG', 'Priest ND', 'Kato Y', 'Mori T', 'Machinami R']","['Department of Pathology, The Cancer Institute, 1-37-1 Kami-ikebukuro, Toshima-ku, Tokyo 170-8455, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Thorium/*pharmacokinetics', 'Thorium Dioxide/*pharmacokinetics', 'Tissue Distribution']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 1999 Dec;152(6 Suppl):S102-6.,,,,"['60YU5MIG9W (Thorium)', '9XA7X17UQC (Thorium Dioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of the patients, most of them treated in the years 1948-1975, received one series of 10 weekly intravenous injections of about 1 MBq of (224)Ra each. This dose leads to a mean absorbed dose due to alpha-particle radiation of 0.56 Gy to the marrow-free skeleton of a 70- kg man (mean bone surface dose of about 5 Gy).

By the end of 1998, 649 patients in the exposed group and 762 control patients had died. Among other observations, it is of particular interest that 13 cases of leukemia in the exposed group have been observed. This is a highly significant excess (P < 0.001) compared to a standard population, but only a marginally significant excess in comparison to the seven cases observed in the control group. Subclassification of the leukemias shows a clear preponderance of the myeloid leukemias in the exposed group (8 cases observed compared to 1.7 cases expected, P < 0.001), whereas in the control group the observed cases are within the expected range for myeloid leukemia (3 cases observed compared to 2.2 cases expected, P = 0.3).

The patients suffered from ankylosing spondylitis, tuberculosis and in a few cases from other diseases. The ""Spiess study"" (study I) follows up the health of 899 of these patients; it includes most of the patients who were treated with high doses (mean bone surface dose: 30 Gy, mean specific activity: 0.66 MBq/kg), and nearly all of those treated under the age of 21 years. The most striking consequence of the (224)Ra injections was the occurrence of 56 malignant bone tumors. They appeared in a temporal wave that peaked around 8 years after exposure. A new analysis was recently performed, because a reassessment of the dosimetry resulted in changed bone surface doses, especially for the patients treated at younger ages. Averaged over all ages at exposure, the estimated risk coefficient is in general agreement with earlier analyses. However, there is now an increase in bone tumor risk that is significantly greater for younger ages at exposure. The earlier finding of an inverse protraction factor is confirmed. During the most recent years of follow-up, a significant excess of nonskeletal solid malignancies has become manifest. In 1998, a significant increase of breast cancer incidence, of soft tissue malignancies, of thyroid carcinomas, and of liver, kidney and bladder cancer was found. An eightfold increased risk of mammary cancers in those treated at a young age is particularly striking. Equally notable are two cases of breast cancer in male patients. To identify potential confounders, a control group of tuberculosis patients not treated with (224)Ra was established.

This pattern of up-regulation was apparently different from that of another immediate early gene, c-fos. EAT, an anti-apoptotic molecule, was strongly up-regulated in the non-ischemic region. In contrast, the expression of c-fos was induced in both ischemic and non-ischemic regions, and was higher in the ischemic region. Apoptosis of cardiomyocytes is currently thought to significantly contribute to acute myocardial infarction.

It is presumed that one or more tumor suppressor genes are localized on 6q. By means of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we attempted to detect and delineate deletions of 6q in leukemias and lymphomas. We performed FISH on 148 cases of lymphoma and acute leukemia using a panel of 36 YAC probes distributed from 6q12 to 6q27 and a centromeric probe of chromosome 6 as internal control. Deletions of 6q that included a 7-cM commonly deleted region in 6q21 were detected in 59 patients who had B- and T-cell low-grade and high-grade NHL and ALL. FISH with two YAC probes flanking this region was performed on an additional 97 cases of NHL and leukemia. Deletions in 6q21 were detected in an additional 21 cases. In five cases of high-grade B- and T-cell NHL and ALL, the deletion breakpoints were located within the commonly deleted region. To define the deletion breakpoints exactly and to narrow this region further, FISH was performed with six additional YAC probes that have been physically localized within this region. A 3-cM (4-5 Mb) commonly deleted region in 6q21 was delineated. Our study suggests that this commonly deleted region harbors a putative tumor suppressor gene involved in the pathogenesis of both low-grade and high-grade NHL and ALL.

Sequence analysis of the fusion region of the amplified cDNAs allowed us to determine the specificity of these fragments in both patients. This analysis showed two new hybrid transcripts that were 53 and 306 base pairs (bp) longer than that expressed by the NB4 cell line (PML breakpoint within intron 6), and are the result of the direct joining of RARA exon 3 with PML exon 7a (patient 2) or the 5' portion of PML exon 7b (patient 1), respectively. In patient 1, RT-PCR analysis of the reciprocal RARA/PML junction showed a smaller transcript than that expected in bcr1 cases, while in patient 2 no amplified fragment was obtained.

The patients comprised a control group with no evidence of hematologic disease and four disease case groups: 1) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), refractory anemia, refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia; 2) acute myelogenous leukemia; 3) myeloproliferative disorder (MPD), chronic granulocytic leukemia, and polycythemia vera; and 4) B-cell lymphoma/leukemia. The frequency of cells with Y loss increased with age and was significantly greater in cases than in controls, but it was not correlated with survival or with prior therapy. The frequency of cases with a -Y clone was 6.3% of male karyotypes and represented 16.4% of all abnormal male cytogenetic reports. Much of the difference between cases and controls appears to be accounted for by a greater frequency of cases with > 75% Y loss. A value of 81% chromosome Y loss maximized the combined sensitivity (28%) and specificity (100%) for predicting disease status, but a 75% cutoff provided the best estimate of disease risk. Even in older males, if > 75% of metaphase cells are 45,X,-Y, they probably represent a disease-associated clonal population, and it is possible that the critical genetic change is not visible through the microscope. This observation is true for MDS, MPD, B-cell disease, and especially acute myelogenous leukemia. The prognostic association of Y chromosome loss for survival appears to be neutral or favorable.

Hyperthermia sufficient to stimulate production of heat shock proteins was used to stimulate the cells. Hyperthermia significantly enhances the effect of CMV IE gene products on the expression of HIV-1 and TNF-alpha.

Uptake was detected within minutes with efficiencies approaching 100% in cell lines and freshly obtained peripheral blood mononuclear cells. After 24 h, avidin was barely detectable on the surface of the nucleated cells. In marked contrast, fluorescent avidin remained exclusively on the external membrane of erythrocytes after 24 h. To investigate biotin-mediated endocytosis for the delivery of DNA, we prepared polyethylenimine-avidin (PEI-avidin) conjugates. Surface biotinylation significantly increased the transfection efficiencies of PEI-avidin condensed plasmid DNA coding green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the level of transferrin-receptor targeted gene delivery (15-20% GFP positive cells in culture after 48 h).

Surprisingly, an IFN-independent requirement for STAT1 was also found, specifically in T lymphocytes, where MHC class I expression was not fully accounted for by IFN signaling. This IFN-independent pathway maintained tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 in T but not B lymphocytes even in the absence of IFN receptors. Interestingly, interleukin (IL)-7 selectively activated STAT1 and induced MHC class I in mature T but not B cells. These loss of function studies demonstrate an essential role of endogenous IFN and activated STAT1 for constitutive MHC class I expression in normal mice and define IL-7-dependent but IFN-independent regulation of STAT1 restricted to T lymphocytes.","['Lee, C K', 'Gimeno, R', 'Levy, D E']","['Lee CK', 'Gimeno R', 'Levy DE']","['Department of Pathology and Kaplan Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, MHC Class I', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*analysis', 'Interferons/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1999 Nov 15;190(10):1451-64. doi: 10.1084/jem.190.10.1451.,,,['10.1084/jem.190.10.1451 [doi]'],"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']","['P30CA16087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI28900/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2195695,,,,,,,,,,

The principal pathogenetic features of MDS are clonal evolution, ineffective hematopoiesis (apoptosis), and reduced cellular maturation. T-cell-mediated myelosupression may add to disease development in some patients. The disease is progressive and, for the majority of patients, the aim of treatment will be to improve blood values and quality of life. A minority of patients could be cured by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, which results in an overall disease-free survival of about 40%. The value of autologous stem-cell transplantation is currently being investigated in clinical trials; this treatment may be found to be beneficial for some MDS patients. High-dose chemotherapy may lead to significant improvement and complete remission in about 50% of treated patients, but remission duration is usually short. Low-dose chemotherapy may also be used to improve peripheral blood values. Several new low-dose treatments are being tested at present. Growth factors can be used to improve both ineffective hematopoiesis and cytopenia. The value of treatment with growth factors alone for granulocytopoiesis is uncertain, whereas treatment for impaired erythropoiesis using erythropoietin alone or erythropoietin in combination with other growth factors seems more promising. Subgroups of MDS in which T-cell-mediated myelosuppression are present may respond favorably to cyclosporin A or antithymoglobulin. Antiapoptotic agents such as amifostine may improve blood values in some patients with MDS, but the value of this treatment is not yet clear. Increasing pathogenetic knowledge and better use of predictive models have resulted in some progress in MDS treatment. In the future, more effective treatments may result from further insights into the biology of the disease, the discovery of new therapeutic approaches, and the search for better ways to use existing therapeutic options.","['Hellstrom-Lindberg, E']",['Hellstrom-Lindberg E'],"['Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge University Hospital, Sweden. eva.hellstrom-lindberg@medhs.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1999 Oct;70(3):141-54.,,,,,,,,140,,,,,,,,,

No previous studies of electrical workers in the construction industry have been conducted. METHODS: Our study evaluated the mortality patterns of 31,068 U.S. members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers who primarily worked in the construction industry and died 1982-1987. RESULTS: Comparison to the U.S. population by using the NIOSH life table showed significantly elevated proportionate mortality for many causes. Excess mortality for leukemia (proportionate mortality ratio (PMR)=115) and brain tumors (PMR=136) is similar to reports of electrical workers with occupational exposure to electric and magnetic fields in the electric utility or manufacturing industry. Excess deaths due to melanoma skin cancer (PMR=123) are consistent with findings of other PCB-exposed workers. A significantly elevated PMR was observed for the diseases caused by asbestos: lung cancer (PMR=117), asbestosis (PMR=247), and malignant mesothelioma (PMR=356) and from fatal injuries, particularly electrocutions (PMR=1180). The findings of statistically significant excess deaths for prostate cancer (PMR=107), musculoskeletal disease (PMR=130), suicide (PMR=113), and disorders of the blood-forming organs (PMR=141) were unexpected. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that more detailed investigations of occupational risk factors and evaluation of preventive practices are needed to prevent excess mortality in this hazardous occupation.

In the case of L6 (b2a2) mRNA, it is difficult to cleave the abnormal mRNA specifically because the mRNA includes no sequences that can be cleaved efficiently by conventional hammerhead ribozymes near the BCR-ABL junction. We recently succeeded in designing a novel maxizyme, which specifically cleaves BCR-ABL fusion mRNA, as a result of the formation of a dimeric structure. As an extension of our molecular engineering of maxizymes, as well as to improve their potential utility, we examined whether an analogous conformational change could be induced within a single molecule when two maxizymes were connected via a linker sequence. An active conformation was achieved by binding of the construct to the BCR-ABL junction in trans, with part of the linker sequence then acting as an antisense modulator in cis (within the complex) to adjust the overall structure. Results of studies in vitro in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) (but not in its absence) suggested that a certain kind of connected maxizyme (cMzB) might be able to undergo a desired conformational change and, indeed, studies in vivo confirmed this prediction. Therefore, we successfully created a fully functional, connected maxizyme and, moreover, we found that the activity and specificity of catalytic RNAs in vivo might be better estimated if their reactions are monitored in vitro in the presence of CTAB.","['Hamada, M', 'Kuwabara, T', 'Warashina, M', 'Nakayama, A', 'Taira, K']","['Hamada M', 'Kuwabara T', 'Warashina M', 'Nakayama A', 'Taira K']","['Institute of Applied Biochemistry, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennoudai, Tsukuba Science City, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,IM,"['Allosteric Regulation', 'Base Sequence', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'RNA, Catalytic/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1999 Nov 12;461(1-2):77-85. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(99)01367-8.,,,"['S0014-5793(99)01367-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(99)01367-8 [doi]']","['0 (RNA, Catalytic)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Outcome was compared with that of patients with small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)/B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) treated at SBH during the same period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-six patients with newly diagnosed IMC were identified. Patients were subclassified (using the Kiel classification) as having lymphoplasmacytoid (n =92), lymphoplasmacytic (n = 24), polymorphous (n = 9), or undetermined (n = 1) IMC. Six patients (5%) had stage I to IIE disease; the rest had advanced disease. Treatment was given according to disease stage. Seven patients were managed expectantly. RESULTS: Eighty-two (69%) of 119 patients responded to treatment, but complete remission was seen in only 15 (13%) of 119. Treatment failed in 29 (24%) of 119 patients. There were three treatment-related deaths; five patients were not assessable for response. When survival of patients with IMC was compared with that of patients with B-CLL/SLL, a significant difference was found (P <. 01); this difference was maintained when only patients in whom the diagnosis was based on lymph node biopsy were considered (P =.01). A comparison of the three IMC subgroups showed that there was a trend (P =.06) toward a difference between B-CLL/SLL and the lymphoplasmacytoid subtype. CONCLUSION: Patients diagnosed with IMC are generally older and present with advanced disease. Conventional therapies usually result in incomplete responses of short duration. Overall, these results support the proposed World Health Organization reclassification of IMC to include lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma (Kiel classification) as a variant of B-CLL/SLL.","['Papamichael, D', 'Norton, A J', 'Foran, J M', 'Mulatero, C', 'Mathews, J', 'Amess, J A', 'Bradburn, M', 'Lister, T A', 'Rohatiner, A Z']","['Papamichael D', 'Norton AJ', 'Foran JM', 'Mulatero C', 'Mathews J', 'Amess JA', 'Bradburn M', 'Lister TA', 'Rohatiner AZ']","[""Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) Department of Medical Oncology, Departments of Histopathology and Haematology, St Bartholomew's Hospital, West Smithfield, London, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', '*Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Sep;17(9):2847-53. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.9.2847.,,,['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.9.2847 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred ten newly diagnosed patients > or = 60 years of age with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were treated. All patients received cytarabine by continuous infusion for 7 days at 100 mg/m(2)/d. The starting dose of daunorubicin was 30 mg/m(2)/d for 3 days. Etoposide was administered at a dose of 100 mg/m(2)/d for 3 days, except in the last cohort administered ADEP, who received 60 mg/m(2). PSC-833 was given intravenously with a loading dose of 1.5 mg/kg over 2 hours and a simultaneous continuous infusion of 10 mg/kg/d continued until 24 hours after the last dose of daunorubicin or etoposide. RESULTS: There was no toxicity attributed to the PSC-833. Dose-limiting toxicity was primarily gastrointestinal (diarrhea, mucositis in the ADEP group). The estimated maximum-tolerated doses, calculated using a logistic regression model, were daunorubicin 40 mg/m(2)/d for 3 days with etoposide 60 mg/m(2) for 3 days in the ADEP group and daunorubicin 60 mg/m(2)/d for 3 days and etoposide 100 mg/m(2)/d for 3 days in the ADE group. Twenty-one (48%) of 44 patients achieved complete remission with ADE, compared with 29 (44%) of 66 patients treated with ADEP. CONCLUSION: It is necessary to decrease the doses of daunorubicin and etoposide when they are administered with PSC-833, presumably because of the effect of the modulator on the pharmacokinetics of these agents. A phase III trial comparing the regimens derived from this phase I trial has recently begun.","['Lee, E J', 'George, S L', 'Caligiuri, M', 'Szatrowski, T P', 'Powell, B L', 'Lemke, S', 'Dodge, R K', 'Smith, R', 'Baer, M', 'Schiffer, C A']","['Lee EJ', 'George SL', 'Caligiuri M', 'Szatrowski TP', 'Powell BL', 'Lemke S', 'Dodge RK', 'Smith R', 'Baer M', 'Schiffer CA']","['Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Cyclosporins/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Sep;17(9):2831-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.9.2831.,,,['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.9.2831 [doi]'],"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DAV regimen']","['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with MDSs and 27 with CMML were enrolled. They were either previously untreated (66%) or had received only biologic agents (14%) or chemotherapy with or without biologic agents (20%). Treatment consisted of topotecan 1.25 mg/m(2) by continuous intravenous infusion daily for 5 days and cytarabine 1. 0 g/m(2) by infusion over 2 hours daily for 5 days. Prophylaxis included antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral agents. At a median follow-up of 7 months, all 86 patients were assessable for response and toxicity. RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was observed in 48 patients (56%; 61% with MDSs, 44% with CMML; P =.15). Similar CR rates were observed for patients with good-risk and poor-risk MDS (70% and 56%, respectively). The treatment effectively induced CR in patients with a poor-prognosis karyotype involving chromosomes 5 and 7 (CR, 71%) and secondary MDSs (CR, 72%). Fifty-four patients received one induction course, 25 patients received two, and the rest received more than two. The median number of continuation courses was two. The median overall duration of CR was 34 weeks (50 weeks for MDSs and 33 weeks for CMML). The median survival was 60 weeks for MDS and 44 weeks for CMML patients. CR and survival durations were longer in patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB). Grade 3 or 4 mucositis or diarrhea was observed in three patients each. Fever was observed in 63%, and infections in 49% of patients. Six patients (7%) died during induction therapy. CONCLUSION: Topotecan and cytarabine induced high CR rates in unselected patients with MDSs and CMML, particularly among patients with poor-prognosis cytogenetics and secondary MDSs. Topotecan-cytarabine is an active induction regimen in MDS and CMML patients, is well tolerated, and is associated with a low mortality rate.","['Beran, M', 'Estey, E', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Cortes, J', 'Koller, C A', 'Giles, F J', 'Kornblau, S', 'Andreeff, M', 'Vey, N', 'Pierce, S R', 'Hayes, K', 'Wong, G C', 'Keating, M', 'Kantarjian, H']","['Beran M', 'Estey E', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cortes J', 'Koller CA', 'Giles FJ', 'Kornblau S', 'Andreeff M', 'Vey N', 'Pierce SR', 'Hayes K', 'Wong GC', 'Keating M', 'Kantarjian H']","['Departments of Leukemia and Molecular Hematology, and Division of Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. mberan@notes.mdacc.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Topotecan/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Sep;17(9):2819-30. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.9.2819.,,,['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.9.2819 [doi]'],"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Use of high-dose ara-C is hampered, however, by a noticeable toxicity, particularly to the CNS. We investigated the usefulness of CNS perfusion imaging with technetium-99m ((99m)Tc)-hexamethyl-propylene-amine oxime (HMPAO) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) concurrent to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to specifically assess the effects of standard- and high-dose ara-C in children with AL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six perfusion studies using (99m)Tc-HMPAO SPECT were performed in 12 children (age range, 4 to 15 years) with AL after induction therapy, which consisted of a standard-dose ara-C, immediately after consolidation with high-dose ara-C, and later during follow-up (range, 6 to 44 months). The chemotherapy-related adverse events were monitored and correlated to SPECT and MRI. RESULTS: After the induction phase, all children were neurologically normal on MRI. On SPECT imaging, four children displayed a slightly heterogeneous perfusion. After high-dose ara-C (4 to 36 g/m(2)), five children had regressive neurologic signs of potential toxic origin. Of these five children, only one had an abnormal MRI scan, whereas all patients showed evidence of diffuse cerebral and/or cerebellar heterogeneous perfusion on SPECT. The seven other patients without any neurologic symptoms had normal MRI scans; SPECT was normal for three patients and abnormal for four patients. On follow-up, for four children who had presented with clinical neurologic toxicity, SPECT improved in three patients and remained unchanged in one patients. In two of these four children, delayed abnormalities (T2 white matter hypersignal and cerebellar atrophy) appeared on MRI scans. CONCLUSION: In our series, diffuse heterogeneous brain hypoperfusion is often the sole early objective imaging feature identified by SPECT of high-dose ara-C neurotoxicity, where MRI still demonstrates normal pictures.","['Vera, P', 'Rohrlich, P', 'Stievenart, J L', 'Elmaleh, M', 'Duval, M', 'Bonnin, F', 'Bok, B', 'Vilmer, E']","['Vera P', 'Rohrlich P', 'Stievenart JL', 'Elmaleh M', 'Duval M', 'Bonnin F', 'Bok B', 'Vilmer E']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Charles Nicolle University Hospital, Henri Becquerel Center, Rouen, France. pierre.vera@rouen.fnclcc.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Brain/diagnostic imaging/*drug effects', 'Brain Diseases/chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Cerebellum/diagnostic imaging/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Drug Monitoring/methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Neurologic Examination', '*Radiopharmaceuticals', '*Technetium Tc 99m Exametazime', '*Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Sep;17(9):2804-10. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.9.2804.,,,['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.9.2804 [doi]'],"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '3B744AG22N (Technetium Tc 99m Exametazime)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of treatment with chemotherapy have been disappointing to date, with no trials demonstrating a benefit with respect to survival duration. Corticosteroids and mitoxantrone each have been shown to be active agents in this disease. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate an advantage of mitoxantrone and hydrocortisone (M+H) over hydrocortisone alone with respect to survival duration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred forty-two patients with HRPC were randomized to receive either M+H or hydrocortisone alone. Patients were monitored for survival, time to disease progression, time to treatment failure, response, and quality-of-life (QOL) parameters. RESULTS: Treatment in both arms was well tolerated. Although there was a delay in time to treatment failure and disease progression in favor of M+H over hydrocortisone alone, there was no difference in overall survival (12.3 months for M+H v 12.6 months for hydrocortisone alone). There was an indication that QOL was better with M+H, in particular with respect to pain control. CONCLUSION: M+H generated more frequent responses and a delay in both time to treatment failure and disease progression compared with hydrocortisone alone. In addition, there was a possible benefit of M+H with respect to pain control over hydrocortisone alone. No improvement in survival was observed. Although M+H could be viewed as a palliative option for patients with HRPC, new drugs and novel strategies are needed to improve survival for this disease.","['Kantoff, P W', 'Halabi, S', 'Conaway, M', 'Picus, J', 'Kirshner, J', 'Hars, V', 'Trump, D', 'Winer, E P', 'Vogelzang, N J']","['Kantoff PW', 'Halabi S', 'Conaway M', 'Picus J', 'Kirshner J', 'Hars V', 'Trump D', 'Winer EP', 'Vogelzang NJ']","['Lank Center for Genitourinary Oncology and Breast Oncology Center, Department of Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115-6084, USA. philipvkantoff@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Aged', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Pain/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Quality of Life', 'Treatment Failure']",1999/11/24 09:00,2000/04/25 09:00,['1999/11/24 09:00'],"['1999/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '1999/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Aug;17(8):2506-13. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.8.2506.,,['J Clin Oncol. 1999 Dec;17(12):3856-60.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From September 1992 to June 1997, 26 consecutive adults with newly diagnosed untreated B-ALL received hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (Hyper-CVAD). Their median age was 58 years (range, 17 to 79 years), and 46% were > or = 60 years. Patients received Hyper-CVAD alternated with courses of high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and prophylactic antibiotics were administered for all eight planned courses. CNS prophylaxis alternated intrathecal methotrexate and cytarabine on days 2 and 7 of each course. RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was obtained in 21 patients (81%). There were five induction deaths (19%). The median time to CR was 22 days (range, 15 to 89 days); 70% achieved CR within 4 weeks. The 3-year survival rate was 49% (+/- 11%); the 3-year continuous CR rate was 61% (+/- 11%). Twelve CR patients (57%) were in continuous CR at a median follow-up of 3+ years (range, 13+ months to 6.5+ years). Characteristics predicting for worse survival were age > or = 60 years, poor performance status, anemia, thrombocytopenia, peripheral blasts, and increased lactate dehydrogenase level. The 3-year survival rate was 77% for 14 patients younger than 60 years and 17% for 12 patients > or = 60 years (P <.01). Regression analysis identified older age, anemia, and presence of peripheral blasts as independent factors associated with shorter survival. Patients could be stratified according to (1) no or one adverse feature, (2) two adverse features, and (3) all adverse features. The 3-year survival rates were 89%, 47%, and 0%, respectively (P <.01). CONCLUSION: Hyper-CVAD is effective in adult B-ALL.

These complications raise the possibility of an increase in secondary malignancies in patients whose disease already places them at greater risk. The purpose of the present study was to assess the frequency of second tumors in patients with CLL who are treated with fludarabine and in patients with HCL who are treated with DCF and CdA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the long-term follow-up data for 2,014 patients treated on National Cancer Institute Group C protocols with fludarabine for relapsed and refractory CLL and with DCF and CdA for HCL using a Second Cancer Report. The numbers of observed and expected secondary tumors were compared. RESULTS: Median follow-up periods for the DCF (n = 409), fludarabine (n = 724), and CdA (n = 979) studies were 6.9, 7.4, and 5.1 years, respectively. The 111 malignancies were most commonly lymphoma (25 patients), prostate (19), lung (15), colorectal (nine), bladder (six), and breast (six), but also CNS, stomach, ovary, head and neck, melanoma, sarcoma, testicular, and myeloid leukemias. Compared with age-adjusted 1994 Surveillance and Epidemiology End-Results rates for the general population, the observed/expected frequencies for DCF, fludarabine, and CdA were 1.43 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93 to 2.10), 1.65 (95% CI, 1.04 to 2.47), and 1.50 (95% CI, 1.14 to 1.93), respectively, indicating a significant (at P =.05) increase in risk for patients treated on the latter two protocols compared with a normal population. However, these values are consistent with the increase already associated with these diseases. CONCLUSION: Despite their immunosuppression, nucleoside analogs can be safely administered to patients with CLL or HCL without a significantly increased risk of secondary malignancies.","['Cheson, B D', 'Vena, D A', 'Barrett, J', 'Freidlin, B']","['Cheson BD', 'Vena DA', 'Barrett J', 'Freidlin B']","['The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. chesonb@ctep.nci.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Pentostatin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Aug;17(8):2454-60. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.8.2454.,,,['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.8.2454 [doi]'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mucositis and gastrointestinal toxicity were prospectively evaluated in 202 recipients of high-dose therapy and autologous or allogeneic stem-cell rescue. Of 10 outcome variables, three were selected as end points: the peak value for the University of Nebraska Oral Assessment Score (MUCPEAK), the duration of parenteral nutritional support, and the peak daily output of diarrhea. Potential covariates included patient age, sex, diagnosis, treatment protocol, transplantation type, stem-cell source, and rate of neutrophil recovery. The three selected end points were also examined for correlation with blood infections and transplant-related mortality. RESULTS: A diagnosis of leukemia, use of total body irradiation, allogeneic transplantation, and delayed neutrophil recovery were associated with increased oral mucositis and longer parenteral nutritional support. No factors were associated with diarrhea. Also, moderate to severe oral mucositis (MUCPEAK > or = 18 on a scale of 8 to 24) was correlated with blood infections and transplant-related mortality: 60% of patients with MUCPEAK > or = 18 had positive blood cultures versus 30% of patients with MUCPEAK less than 18 (P =.001); 24% of patients with MUCPEAK > or = 8 died during the transplantation procedure versus 4% of patients with MUCPEAK less than 18 (P =.001). CONCLUSION: Gastrointestinal toxicity is a major cause of transplant-related morbidity and mortality, emphasizing the need for corrective strategies. The peak oral mucositis score and the duration of parenteral nutritional support are useful indices of gastrointestinal toxicity because these end points are correlated with clinically significant events, including blood infections and treatment-related mortality.","['Rapoport, A P', 'Miller Watelet, L F', 'Linder, T', 'Eberly, S', 'Raubertas, R F', 'Lipp, J', 'Duerst, R', 'Abboud, C N', 'Constine, L', 'Andrews, J', 'Etter, M A', 'Spear, L', 'Powley, E', 'Packman, C H', 'Rowe, J M', 'Schwertschlag, U', 'Bedrosian, C', 'Liesveld, J L']","['Rapoport AP', 'Miller Watelet LF', 'Linder T', 'Eberly S', 'Raubertas RF', 'Lipp J', 'Duerst R', 'Abboud CN', 'Constine L', 'Andrews J', 'Etter MA', 'Spear L', 'Powley E', 'Packman CH', 'Rowe JM', 'Schwertschlag U', 'Bedrosian C', 'Liesveld JL']","['University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY. arapopo@umcc01.umcc.ab.umd.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Databases, Factual', 'Diarrhea/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Mucosa/*drug effects', '*Parenteral Nutrition', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced/classification/*etiology']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Aug;17(8):2446-53. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.8.2446.,,,['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.8.2446 [doi]'],['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were studied at the Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The initial dose of gemcitabine was 20 mg/m(2) by 30-minute intravenous infusion each Monday and Thursday for 5 weeks concurrent with 50.4 Gy of radiation to the pancreas. Gemcitabine doses were escalated in 20-mg/m(2) increments in successive cohorts of three to six additional patients until dose-limiting toxicity was observed. RESULTS: The dose-limiting toxicities at 60 mg/m(2) given twice-weekly were nausea/vomiting, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Twice-weekly gemcitabine at a 40-mg/m(2) dose was well tolerated. Of the eight patients eligible for a minimum follow-up of 12 months, three remain alive, one of whom has no evidence of disease progression. CONCLUSION: A dose of twice-weekly gemcitabine at 40 mg/m(2) produced mild thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, nausea, and vomiting when delivered with concurrent radiation to the upper abdomen in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. These data suggest this regimen is well tolerated and may possess significant activity. These data and other observations have resulted in a phase II Cancer and Leukemia Group B study to ascertain the efficacy of this treatment regimen in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.","['Blackstock, A W', 'Bernard, S A', 'Richards, F', 'Eagle, K S', 'Case, L D', 'Poole, M E', 'Savage, P D', 'Tepper, J E']","['Blackstock AW', 'Bernard SA', 'Richards F', 'Eagle KS', 'Case LD', 'Poole ME', 'Savage PD', 'Tepper JE']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center, Winston-Salem, NC 27516, USA. ablackst@wfubmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy']",1999/11/24 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['1999/11/24 09:00'],"['1999/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '1999/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Jul;17(7):2208-12. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.7.2208.,,['J Clin Oncol. 1999 Nov;17(11):3692.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A quality-adjusted survival analysis, using the quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity (Q-TWiST) method, was applied to Pediatric Oncology Group Trial 8821, which compared randomized assignment with intensive consolidation chemotherapy (CC) or autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). Nonrandomized assignment to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo BMT) on the basis of availability of a matched related donor was also evaluated. A 25-patient cohort provided data for modeling chronic graft-versus-host disease. The Q-TWiST analysis was performed based on the intent-to-treat principle. RESULTS: As previously reported, the 3-year event-free survival was not significantly different between the randomized arms (CC v ABMT). At a median follow-up of 5 years (of the censoring distribution), the CC group had less time in toxicity (TOX) and more time without symptoms or toxicity (TWiST), relapse-free time, and alive time than patients assigned to ABMT (none of these were statistically significant). Compared with the CC group, allo BMT patients spent more time in TOX (P <.001), more time in TWiST (P =.06), and had more relapse-free time (P =.03) and time alive (P =.07). Allo BMT was superior to ABMT with greater time in TWiST (P =.02), relapse-free time (P =.01), and time alive P =.002). CONCLUSION: The Q-TWiST analysis is a powerful decision aid in choosing among alternative therapies. Prospective information on patient preferences will facilitate future trials evaluating treatment outcomes. Refinements in the Q-TWiST method could be included to further enhance the power of this patient care decision-making tool.","['Parsons, S K', 'Gelber, S', 'Cole, B F', 'Ravindranath, Y', 'Ogden, A', 'Yeager, A M', 'Chang, M', 'Shuster, J', 'Weinstein, H J', 'Gelber, R D']","['Parsons SK', 'Gelber S', 'Cole BF', 'Ravindranath Y', 'Ogden A', 'Yeager AM', 'Chang M', 'Shuster J', 'Weinstein HJ', 'Gelber RD']","[""Children's Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA. parsons@al.tch.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data', '*Decision Support Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/*therapy', '*Quality of Life', 'Survival Analysis', 'United States/epidemiology']",1999/11/24 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['1999/11/24 09:00'],"['1999/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '1999/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Jul;17(7):2144-52. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.7.2144.,,,['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.7.2144 [doi]'],['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],"['CA23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six hundred four patients entered onto a randomized clinical trial were allocated to receive TAM 20 mg/d for 4 years or TAM 20 mg/d for 4 years plus EPI 50 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 8 every 4 weeks for six cycles. Analysis was performed according to allocated treatment, with all randomized patients included (intention to treat), irrespective of eligibility status. RESULTS: After a median follow-up period of 5.7 years, an improvement in relapse-free survival (RFS) was observed for the TAM and EPI-treated patients, compared with those who received TAM alone. The unadjusted hazard ratio was 0.72 (95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.96), with a corresponding reduction in the odds of recurrence of 27.9% (SD, 12. 3), which was statistically significant (P =.023). Adjustment for prognostic and/or predictive factors did not materially affect the hazard ratio. No difference was observed in terms of overall survival (reduction in odds of death, 11.9% [SD, 16.3]; P =.46). Combined chemohormonal treatment was associated with a higher incidence of acute side effects but without a clear increase in long-term cardiotoxicity. Twelve nonbreast second malignancies, including five hematologic malignancies (two of which were cases of acute myelogenous leukemia), were observed. CONCLUSION: The data show that combined chemohormonal treatment reduces the risk of relapse in postmenopausal patients with node-positive breast cancer. No evidence was found, however, for an improvement in overall survival. The size of benefit observed for both outcomes was consistent with that reported in the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group overview. The trial presented here, however, provides the first report of an improvement in RFS associated with the provision of a single cytotoxic drug in addition to prolonged TAM.","['Wils, J A', 'Bliss, J M', 'Marty, M', 'Coombes, G', 'Fontaine, C', 'Morvan, F', 'Olmos, T', 'Perez-Lopez, F R', 'Vassilopoulos, P', 'Woods, E', 'Coombes, R C']","['Wils JA', 'Bliss JM', 'Marty M', 'Coombes G', 'Fontaine C', 'Morvan F', 'Olmos T', 'Perez-Lopez FR', 'Vassilopoulos P', 'Woods E', 'Coombes RC']","['Laurentius Hospital, Roermond, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Epirubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'London/epidemiology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology', 'Paris/epidemiology', 'Postmenopause', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survival Rate', 'Tamoxifen/*administration & dosage']",1999/11/24 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['1999/11/24 09:00'],"['1999/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '1999/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Jul;17(7):1988-98. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.7.1988.,,,['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.7.1988 [doi]'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Italian Cooperative Study Group on Chronic Myeloid Leukemia and Italian Group for Bone Marrow Transplantation.,1858-68,"PURPOSE: To monitor treatment results and survival in chronic myeloid leukemia after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) and the introduction of interferon alpha (IFNalpha). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Disease course was monitored in 840 patients younger than 56 years who were registered onto prospective studies between 1984 and 1991 and were assigned to conventional chemotherapy (CHT) or IFNalpha therapy. One hundred twenty of these patients received allogeneic bone marrow in the chronic phase from an HLA-identical sibling without T-cell depletion (standard alloBMT). RESULTS: Patient distribution by risk and by presenting features was the same in the transplantation and nontransplantation cohorts, but age was different (median, 32 v 42 years). Results were analyzed by age and by Sokal's relative risk. Among low-risk patients, 10-year survival rates with standard alloBMT versus IFNalpha therapy versus CHT were 57% v 49% (P =.76) v 25% (P =.001), respectively, and among patients at higher risk, rates were 54% v 17% (P =.01) v 12% (P =. 001). Among patients < or = 32 years old, the 10-year survival rates were 65% v 35% (P =.05) v 24% (P =.001), respectively, but for patients older than 32 years, 10-year survival rates were 46% for standard alloBMT versus 31% for IFNalpha therapy (P =.62) versus 16% for conventional CHT (P =.05). The data did not change when the calculations were based on the transplantations that were performed within 1 year of diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Any policy of standard alloBMT was associated with significantly longer survival compared with conventional CHT, irrespective of age and risk. When the comparison was made with IFNalpha therapy, a policy of standard alloBMT, including early transplantation, was found to increase survival only in those patients who were younger or at intermediate or high risk.",,,,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Survival Rate']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Jun;17(6):1858-68.,,,,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a significant proportion of patients with ALL who undergo HSCT relapse. For this reason, we prospectively evaluated a preparative regimen that included total body irradiation (TBI), thiotepa (TT), and cyclophosphamide (CY) in patients with high-risk ALL in first complete remission (CR) and in children with ALL in second CR. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty children (median age, 9 years; range, 1 to 18 years) with ALL in first or second CR who underwent allogeneic HSCT from HLA-identical siblings were conditioned with a combination of fractionated TBI, TT (10 mg/kg), and CY (120 mg/kg over 2 days). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine administered intravenously at a dose of 1 to 3 mg/kg/d for the first 21 days and subsequently orally at a dose of 6 mg/kg/d. RESULTS: All assessable patients were engrafted, with a median time of 11 and 24 days for neutrophil and platelet recovery, respectively. The preparative regimen was well tolerated. Only one patient died as a result of regimen-related causes. Eight patients relapsed at a median time of 8 months after transplantation (range, 3 to 9 months), and this determined a cumulative probability of relapse of 23%. Twenty-six of 40 patients (65%) are alive and in complete hematologic remission, with a median observation time of 36 months (range, 14 to 57 months), which results in a disease-free survival (DFS) at 3 years of 65%. The 13 patients who underwent transplantation in first CR had a DFS of 85%, whereas the 27 patients who underwent HSCT in second CR had a DFS of 56%. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that TT is an effective cytotoxic drug that can be safely added to the classical TBI-CY regimen. Because of its cell cycle-independent action, good CNS diffusion, and limited extramedullary toxicity, TT may contribute to increasing the percentage of children with ALL who are successfully cured with allogeneic BMT.","['Zecca, M', 'Pession, A', 'Messina, C', 'Bonetti, F', 'Favre, C', 'Prete, A', 'Cesaro, S', 'Porta, F', 'Mazzarino, I', 'Giorgiani, G', 'Rondelli, R', 'Locatelli, F']","['Zecca M', 'Pession A', 'Messina C', 'Bonetti F', 'Favre C', 'Prete A', 'Cesaro S', 'Porta F', 'Mazzarino I', 'Giorgiani G', 'Rondelli R', 'Locatelli F']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Pavia, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy. m.zecca@smatteo.pv.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications/epidemiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Nuclear Family', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Thiotepa/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods/mortality', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Jun;17(6):1838-46. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.6.1838.,,,['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.6.1838 [doi]'],"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-three patients received adjuvant treatment with four cycles of doxorubicin 75 mg/m(2) as an intravenous bolus every 21 days, followed by three cycles of cyclophosphamide 3,000 mg/m(2) every 14 days with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients were assessable, and all but two completed all planned chemotherapy. There was no treatment-related mortality. The most common toxicity was neutropenic fever, which occurred in 39% of patients. Median disease-free survival is 66 months (95% confidence interval, 34 to 98 months), and median overall survival has not yet been reached. At 5 years of follow-up, the disease-free survival is 51.7%, and overall survival is 60.0%. There is no long-term treatment-related toxicity, and no cases of acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome have been observed. CONCLUSION: Our pilot study of doxorubicin followed by cyclophosphamide demonstrates the safety and feasibility of the sequential dose-dense plan. Long-term follow-up, although noncomparative, is promising. However, this regimen is associated with a higher incidence of toxicity (and also higher costs) than the standard dose and schedule of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, and therefore it should not be used as conventional therapy in the absence of demonstrated improvement of outcome. Randomized trials testing the dose-dense approach have been completed but not yet reported. Because the sequential plan can decrease overlapping toxicities, it is an appropriate platform for the addition of newer active agents, such as taxanes or monoclonal antibodies.","['Hudis, C', 'Fornier, M', 'Riccio, L', 'Lebwohl, D', 'Crown, J', 'Gilewski, T', 'Surbone, A', 'Currie, V', 'Seidman, A', 'Reichman, B', 'Moynahan, M', 'Raptis, G', 'Sklarin, N', 'Theodoulou, M', 'Weiselberg, L', 'Salvaggio, R', 'Panageas, K S', 'Yao, T J', 'Norton, L']","['Hudis C', 'Fornier M', 'Riccio L', 'Lebwohl D', 'Crown J', 'Gilewski T', 'Surbone A', 'Currie V', 'Seidman A', 'Reichman B', 'Moynahan M', 'Raptis G', 'Sklarin N', 'Theodoulou M', 'Weiselberg L', 'Salvaggio R', 'Panageas KS', 'Yao TJ', 'Norton L']","['Breast Cancer Medicine Service, Division of Solid Tumor Oncology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. hudisc@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Pilot Projects', 'Survival Analysis']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Apr;17(4):1118. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.4.1118.,,,['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.4.1118 [doi]'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']","['CM-07311/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50-CA68425/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

While it is obvious that most patients with CLL have typical mature B cells, a number of variants such as splenic lymphoma villous lymphocytes, mantle cell leukemia, and prolymphocytic leukemia need to be considered in the differential diagnosis. This can be established by immunophenotype studies and morphology. Cytogenetic abnormalities are emerging as being of interest, with abnormalities in chromosomes 11 and 17 having major prognostic significance. Immune disregulation is complicated in that along with hypergammaglobulinemia and T-cell dysfunction, the emergence of antibodies directed against hematopoietic cells causes autoimmune hemolytic anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. A number of prognostic factors are emerging as being more influential in prognosis and stage, such as serum beta2-microglobulin and soluble CD23. Apoptosis dysregulation is a major feature of CLL, and while no clear pattern has emerged, abnormal levels of bcl2 are common in CLL and bcl2 to bax ratios are also commonly disturbed. Bcl1 levels are commonly increased. Treatment has changed radically. The purine analogs have been demonstrated to be the most active group of drugs in CLL. Combinations of purine analogs, such a fludarabine or 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, with alkylating agents are emerging as new treatments. The most recent development has been the emergence of two monoclonal antibodies, rituximab (Rituxan; IDEC Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA, and Genentech, Inc, San Francisco, CA; directed against CD20) and Campath-1H (directed against CD52 in CLL). The activity of rituximab in lymphoma has been less prominent in small lymphocytic lymphoma (the lymphomatous counterpart of CLL) and this has led to dose escalation studies in CLL with a good level of response. Campath-1H is emerging as another major antibody with marked effect against disease, particularly in the blood and bone marrow. Autologous, allogeneic, and mini-transplant are also being explored extensively. The prognosis for patients with CLL is changing as these new treatments become available.","['Keating, M J']",['Keating MJ'],"['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, IgE']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1999 Oct;26(5 Suppl 14):107-14.,,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",,,,65,,,,,,,,,

CD52 is a 21- to 28-kd nonmodulating cell surface glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked glycoprotein that is abundantly expressed (up to 5 x 10(5) molecules per cell) on most normal and malignant lymphocytes and monocytes. Its functions are unknown. CD52 is an excellent target for complement-mediated lysis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. A series of rat and genetically reshaped human CD52 antibodies has been assessed for the ability to deplete lymphocytes in vivo to induce immunosuppression and for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. CD52 antibodies that activate both complement and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity consistently deplete lymphocytes from blood, spleen, and bone marrow but are less effective against lymph node disease or extranodal masses. CD52 antibodies provide effective therapy for chronic leukemias, such as T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and some subtypes of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, that may be resistant to conventional chemotherapy. For example, most patients with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, including those with large tumor burdens and high peripheral white blood cell counts, will enter complete remission using the antibody CAMPATH-1H without any evidence of tumor lysis. In contrast, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, CD52 antibodies may be more effective in the setting of minimal residual disease and may allow harvesting of uncontaminated stem cells. Further experiments to enhance the activity of CD52 antibodies in sites refractory to antibody alone are currently being undertaken.","['Dyer, M J']",['Dyer MJ'],"['Institute of Cancer Research-Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Glycoproteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1999 Oct;26(5 Suppl 14):52-7.,,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Cd52 protein, rat)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",,,,28,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the feasibility of genetic modification of these progenitors for gene marking and/ or gene therapy strategies, cells from patients with newly-diagnosed AML were cocultured with retroviral producer cells and then placed in colony (AML-CFC) assays, LTC, and injected intravenously into NOD/SCID mice. Southern blotting demonstrated transfer of the neo(r) gene to 30% to 80% of leukemic blasts when cells were cultured for 48 hours in the presence of IL-3 and steel factor (SF) prior to 48-hour coculture with viral producers. Three of six retrovirally-infected AML samples showed both engraftment in NOD/SCID mice and the presence of the neo(r) transgene in mouse tissues 8-15 weeks after injection of transduced cells. Thirteen weeks after injection of one of these samples, >80% of cells from mouse bone marrow were the progeny of two retrovirally-transduced AML progenitors. Four of the remaining five samples showed markedly reduced ability to engraft in mice after retroviral infection. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that the loss of engraftment potential took place within 24 hours of culture initiation in the absence of retroviral producers and regardless of the cytokines present. Interestingly, the majority of AML-CFC or AML LTC-IC survived the 24-hour culture period. A retroviral vector containing the murine cell surface marker heat stable antigen (HSA), which allows purification of transduced cells on immunomagnetic columns, was used to obtain an enriched population of gene-modified AML cells following an infection protocol that eliminated the 48 hours of prestimulation in IL-3 and SF and reduced coculture with viral producers to 10-36 hours. These modifications failed to improve engraftment of the infected cells. In addition, in these experiments more than 10 hours of cocultivation with viral producer cells was necessary to achieve gene transfer and expression in AML LTC-IC. These data demonstrate that although retroviral-mediated gene transfer can be achieved to AML progenitors, including NOD/SL-IC, improved culture conditions will be required before substantial numbers of such transduced primitive progenitors can be obtained. In addition, the difference in the ability of AML LTC-IC and NOD/SL-IC to survive ex vivo suggests that these assays may detect different populations of cells or that changes are induced in vitro in primitive cells which can only be detected in the mouse assay.","['Ailles, L E', 'Humphries, R K', 'Thomas, T E', 'Hogge, D E']","['Ailles LE', 'Humphries RK', 'Thomas TE', 'Hogge DE']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/genetics/pathology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/*pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Transduction, Genetic']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 Nov;27(11):1609-20. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00099-5.,,,"['S0301472X99000995 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00099-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared occupation and industry information from death certificates to company work histories for 793 electric utility workers who died from brain cancer (n=143), leukemia (n=156), lung cancer (n=246, randomly sampled), and non-cancer causes (n=248, randomly sampled). Nearly 75% of death certificates correctly indicated utility industry employment and of those, 48% matched the longest held occupation derived from company work histories. Hence, only 36% matched on both industry and occupation. We computed odds ratios relating occupations involving magnetic field exposure to brain cancer and leukemia both for the occupation listed on the death certificate and for the longest-held occupation based on company records in order to examine the impact of exposure misclassification based on reliance on the death certificate information. For brain cancer, the odds ratio was 1.2 based on death certificates and 1.7 based on company work history, suggesting some attenuation due to misclassification. For leukemia, death certificate information yielded an odds ratio of 0.9, whereas company work histories yielded an odds ratio of 1.3. Although work histories are limited to the period of employment in a specific company, these data suggest that there is substantial misclassification in use of death certificate information on industry and occupation of utility workers, as found in other industries. The limited quality of occupation and industry information on death certificates argues against relying on such information to evaluate modest associations with mortality.","['Andrews, K W', 'Savitz, D A']","['Andrews KW', 'Savitz DA']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Bioelectromagnetics,Bioelectromagnetics,8008281,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology/mortality', 'Cause of Death', 'Confidence Intervals', '*Death Certificates', '*Electricity', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/mortality', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Odds Ratio', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Social Class', 'United States/epidemiology']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bioelectromagnetics. 1999 Dec;20(8):512-8. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1521-186x(199912)20:8<512::aid-bem5>3.0.co;2-m.,,['Bioelectromagnetics. 2000 Jul;21(5):411.

The T-cell leukemogenic property of Moloney MuLV has been mapped to the U3 enhancer region of the viral promoter. However, we now describe a mutant Moloney MuLV which can induce the rapid development of a uniquely broad panel of leukemic cell types. This mutant Moloney MuLV with synonymous differences (MSD1) was obtained by introduction of nucleotide substitutions at positions 1598, 1599, and 1601 in the capsid gene which maintained the wild-type (WT) coding potential. Leukemias were observed in all MSD1-inoculated animals after a latency period that was shorter than or similar to that of WT Moloney MuLV. Importantly, though, only 56% of MSD1-induced leukemias demonstrated the characteristic thymoma phenotype observed in all WT Moloney MuLV leukemias. The remainder of MSD1-inoculated animals presented either with bona fide clonal erythroid or myelomonocytic leukemias or, alternatively, with other severe erythroid and unidentified disorders. Amplification and sequencing of U3 and capsid-coding regions showed that the inoculated parental MSD1 sequences were conserved in the leukemic spleens. This is the first report of a replication-competent MuLV lacking oncogenes which can rapidly lead to the development of such a broad range of leukemic cell types. Moreover, the ability of MSD1 to transform erythroid and myelomonocytic lineages is not due to changes in the U3 viral enhancer region but rather is the result of a cis-acting effect of the capsid-coding gag sequence.","['Audit, M', 'Dejardin, J', 'Hohl, B', 'Sidobre, C', 'Hope, T J', 'Mougel, M', 'Sitbon, M']","['Audit M', 'Dejardin J', 'Hohl B', 'Sidobre C', 'Hope TJ', 'Mougel M', 'Sitbon M']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier (IGMM), IFR24, CNRS-UMR5535, and Universite Montpellier II, F-34293 Montpellier Cedex 5, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Capsid/*genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Products, gag/*genetics/physiology', 'Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/classification/pathology/*virology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/classification/pathology/*virology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Retroviridae Infections/pathology/*virology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Tumor Virus Infections/pathology/*virology']",1999/11/13 00:00,1999/11/13 00:01,['1999/11/13 00:00'],"['1999/11/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/13 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Dec;73(12):10472-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.12.10472-10479.1999.,,,['10.1128/JVI.73.12.10472-10479.1999 [doi]'],"['0 (Gene Products, gag)']",['AI 35477/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC113102,,,,,,,,,,

At very early times after infection, the IE1 protein localizes to and subsequently disrupts PODs, whereas the IE2 protein localizes within or adjacent to PODs. This process appears to be required for efficient viral gene expression and DNA replication. We have investigated the initiation of viral DNA replication compartment formation by studying the localization of viral IE proteins, DNA replication proteins, and the PML protein during productive infection. Localization of IE2 adjacent to PODs between 2 and 6 h after infection was confirmed by confocal microscopy of human fibroblasts (HF cells) infected with both wild-type HCMV(Towne) and with an IE1-deletion mutant HCMV(CR208) that fails to disrupt PODs. In HCMV(Towne)-infected HF cells at 24 to 48 h, IE2 also accumulated in newly formed viral DNA replication compartments containing the polymerase processivity factor (UL44), the single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB; UL57), the UL112-113 accessory protein, and newly incorporated bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Double labeling of the HCMV(CR208)-infected HF cells demonstrated that formation of viral DNA replication compartments initiates within granular structures that bud from the periphery of some of the PODs and subsequently coalesce into larger structures that are flanked by PODs. In transient DNA transfection assays, both the N terminus (codons 136 to 290) and the C terminus (codons 379 to 579) of IE2 exon 5, but not the central region between them, were found to be necessary for both the punctate distribution of IE2 and its association with PODs. Like IE2, the UL112-113 accessory replication protein was also distributed in a POD-associated pattern in both DNA-transfected and virus-infected cells beginning at 6 h. Furthermore, when all six replication core machinery proteins (polymerase complex, SSB, and helicase-primase complex) were expressed together in the presence of UL112-113, they also accumulated at POD-associated sites, suggesting that the UL112-113 protein (but not IE2) may play a role in recruitment of viral replication fork proteins into the periphery of PODs. These results show that (i) subsequent to accumulating at the periphery of PODs, IE2 is incorporated together with the core proteins into viral DNA replication compartments that initiate from the periphery of PODs and then grow to fill the space between groups of PODs, and (ii) the UL112-113 protein appears to have a key role in assembling and recruiting the core replication machinery proteins in the initial stages of viral replication compartment formation.","['Ahn, J H', 'Jang, W J', 'Hayward, G S']","['Ahn JH', 'Jang WJ', 'Hayward GS']","['Molecular Virology Laboratories, Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure/*virology', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', '*DNA Replication', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Time Factors', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Vero Cells', '*Viral Envelope Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",1999/11/13 00:00,1999/11/13 00:01,['1999/11/13 00:00'],"['1999/11/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/13 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Dec;73(12):10458-71. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.12.10458-10471.1999.,,,['10.1128/JVI.73.12.10458-10471.1999 [doi]'],"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ICP36 protein, Cytomegalovirus)', '0 (IE2 protein, Cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (UL115 protein, Human herpesvirus 5)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein H, Cytomegalovirus)', '0 (glycoprotein H, Human cytomegalovirus)', '0 (glycoprotein O, cytomegalovirus)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']","['R01 AI024576/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI24576/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC113101,,,,,,,,,,

A major pathogenic determinant is the transcriptional enhancer comprising several transcription factor binding sites, among which are three identical sites for nuclear factor 1 (NF1). We have investigated the pathogenic properties of NF1 site enhancer mutants of SL3-3. Two different mutants carrying a 3-bp mutation either in all three NF1 sites or in the central site alone were constructed and assayed in inbred NMRI mice. The wild type and both mutants induced lymphomas in all mice, with a mean latency period of 9 weeks. However, there was a considerable difference in osteopetrosis induction. Wild-type SL3-3 induced osteopetrosis in 11% of the mice (2 of 19), and the triple NF1 site mutant induced osteopetrosis in none of the mice (0 of 19), whereas the single NF1 site mutant induced osteopetrosis in 56% (10 of 18) of the mice, as determined by X-ray analysis. A detailed histological examination of the femurs of the mice was carried out and found to support this diagnosis. Thus, the NF1 sites of SL3-3 are major determinants of osteopetrosis induction, without determining lymphomagenesis. This conclusion was further supported by evaluation of the bone pathogenicity of other SL3-3 enhancer variants, the lymphomagenicity of which had been examined previously. This evaluation furthermore strongly indicated that the core sites, a second group of transcription factor binding sites in the viral enhancer, are necessary for the osteopetrosis induction potential of SL3-3.","['Ethelberg, S', 'Tzschaschel, B D', 'Luz, A', 'Diaz-Cano, S J', 'Pedersen, F S', 'Schmidt, J']","['Ethelberg S', 'Tzschaschel BD', 'Luz A', 'Diaz-Cano SJ', 'Pedersen FS', 'Schmidt J']","['Institute of Molecular Virology, GSF-National Research Center for Environment and Health, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Variation', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Lymphoma/pathology/*virology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'NFI Transcription Factors', 'Osteoblasts/cytology', 'Osteopetrosis/pathology/*virology', 'Retroviridae Infections/pathology/*virology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Virus Infections/pathology/*virology']",1999/11/13 00:00,1999/11/13 00:01,['1999/11/13 00:00'],"['1999/11/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/13 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Dec;73(12):10406-15. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.12.10406-10415.1999.,,,['10.1128/JVI.73.12.10406-10415.1999 [doi]'],"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NFI Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (transcription factor nuclear factor 1)']",,,PMC113096,,,,,,,,,,

No effective treatment for HAM/TSP has been described so far. We report a 10-fold reduction in viral DNA for five patients with HAM/TSP during treatment with the reverse transcriptase inhibitor lamivudine. In one patient with recent-onset HAM/TSP, the reduction in viral DNA was associated with a fall in the frequency of CTLs specific to two peptides in the immunodominant viral antigen Tax. The half-life of peripheral blood mononuclear cell populations was estimated from changes in viral DNA copy number, CTL frequency, reduction in CD25 expression, and the loss of dicentric chromosomes following radiation-induced damage. Each of these four different techniques indicated a cellular half-life of approximately 3 days consistent with continuous lymphocyte replication and destruction.

Replacement of tryptophan 142 by alanine or serine resulted in misfolding. However, replacement by methionine (W142M) allowed correct folding of the majority of glycoprotein molecules. W142M virus showed a marked reduction in virus binding and was almost noninfectious, suggesting that tryptophan 142 is involved in receptor binding. In contrast, W142Y virus containing a replacement of tryptophan 142 with an aromatic residue (tyrosine) was as efficient as wild-type virus in infection and binding of cells expressing the wild-type receptor. However, W142Y virus was 100-fold less efficient than wild-type virus in infection of cells expressing a mutant receptor containing tryptophan instead of the critical tyrosine. These results strongly support tryptophan 142 being an essential residue on the virus envelope protein that interacts directly with the critical hydrophobic residue at position 235 of the ecotropic receptor. Tryptophan 142 forms one side of a shallow hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the envelope protein, suggesting that it might comprise the complete putative binding site for tyrosine 235. We discuss the implications of our findings with respect to two models of the envelope protein trimer. Interestingly, both models place tryptophan 142 at the interface between adjacent subunits of the trimer.","['Zavorotinskaya, T', 'Albritton, L M']","['Zavorotinskaya T', 'Albritton LM']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Tennessee-Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38163, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Alanine/genetics/physiology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Methionine/genetics', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phenylalanine/genetics', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tryptophan/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Tyrosine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism/physiology']",1999/11/13 00:00,1999/11/13 00:01,['1999/11/13 00:00'],"['1999/11/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/13 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Dec;73(12):10164-72. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.12.10164-10172.1999.,,,['10.1128/JVI.73.12.10164-10172.1999 [doi]'],"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']","['R01 AI033410/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI33410/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC113069,,,,,,,,,,

Tax(1) is a 40-kDa phosphoprotein, predominantly localized in the nucleus of the host cell, which functions to transactivate both viral and cellular promoters. It seems likely that HTLV-1, through expression of the viral regulatory protein Tax(1), provides some initial alteration in cell metabolism predisposing the development of ATL. Here, we demonstrate that HTLV-1 infection in T-cell lines and patient samples causes overexpression of an early G(1) cyclin, cyclin D2. The transcriptional up-regulation of the cyclin D2 gene is due to activation of Tax on the cyclin D2 gene. More important, we find that overexpression of cyclin D2 is accompanied by acquisition of new partners such as cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2), cdk4, and cdk6 in infected cells. This is in contrast to uninfected T cells, where cyclin D2 associates only with cdk6. Functional effects of these cyclin-cdk complexes in infected cells are shown by hyperphosphorylation of Rb and histone H1, indicators of active progression into S phase as well as changes in cellular chromatin and transcription machinery. These studies link HTLV-1 infection with changes of cellular cyclin gene expression, hence providing clues to development of T-cell leukemia.","['Santiago, F', 'Clark, E', 'Chong, S', 'Molina, C', 'Mozafari, F', 'Mahieux, R', 'Fujii, M', 'Azimi, N', 'Kashanchi, F']","['Santiago F', 'Clark E', 'Chong S', 'Molina C', 'Mozafari F', 'Mahieux R', 'Fujii M', 'Azimi N', 'Kashanchi F']","['Department Biochemistry, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Cyclin D2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Up-Regulation']",1999/11/13 00:00,1999/11/13 00:01,['1999/11/13 00:00'],"['1999/11/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/13 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Dec;73(12):9917-27. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.12.9917-9927.1999.,,,['10.1128/JVI.73.12.9917-9927.1999 [doi]'],"['0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (Ccnd2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']","['R01 AI043894/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI42524/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI43894/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'RR13969/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC113041,,,,,,,,,,

We wished to obtain transcriptional targeting in endothelial cells as part of an antivasculature approach to cancer treatment and have achieved specificity by using the promoter for human prepro-endothelin-1. In particular, we have inserted this heterologous promoter within the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR), replacing all viral upstream transcriptional regulatory sequences, to generate a hybrid LTR with precise fusion at the TATA box for initiation of transcription at the viral start site. Reverse transcription and integration resulted in duplication of this hybrid promoter in the 5' LTR of the provirus for transcription of the internal transgene. An important feature of our vectors is the absence of a selectable marker gene or additional promoters to avoid potential complications of silencing or interference and because selection will be inappropriate for clinical application. This vector design showed endothelial cell specificity of beta-galactosidase expression when tested on a panel of human cell lines and primary breast microvascular endothelial cells, matching the specificity of expression of the endogenous promoter. Such simplified vectors exhibiting transcriptional specificity are likely to be useful for the development of a gene therapy approach to targeting tumor vasculature.","['Jager, U', 'Zhao, Y', 'Porter, C D']","['Jager U', 'Zhao Y', 'Porter CD']","['Chester Beatty Laboratories, Institute of Cancer Research, London SW3 6JB, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Endothelin-1', 'Endothelins/*genetics', '*Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Precursors/*genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/11/13 00:00,1999/11/13 00:01,['1999/11/13 00:00'],"['1999/11/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/13 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Dec;73(12):9702-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.12.9702-9709.1999.,,,['10.1128/JVI.73.12.9702-9709.1999 [doi]'],"['0 (Endothelin-1)', '0 (Endothelins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)']",,,PMC113016,,,,,,,,,,

MEASUREMENTS: A detailed history of smoking habit, respiratory symptoms, and diseases was recorded directly from the patients with the aid of their parents. A complete physical examination and lung function testing (lung volumes and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide [DLCO]) were performed in all subjects. RESULTS: No patient reported acute or chronic respiratory symptoms or diseases. In group A patients, lung function was in the normal range, except for three subjects in whom there was an isolated impairment of DLCO.

This inhibition is associated with phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha), a key regulatory mechanism of protein translation. Three mammalian eIF2alpha kinases have been identified: the interferon-inducible double-stranded RNA-dependent kinase (PKR), the heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), and the very recently discovered PERK/PEK. We find that all of these eIF2alpha kinases can be activated by quercetin and genistein, indicating redundant roles of the eIF2alpha kinases.

In murine embryonic stem (ES) cells, which remain undifferentiated when cultured in the presence of LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor), little metabolism of exogenously added retinol takes place. After LIF removal, ES cells metabolize exogenously added retinol to 4-hydroxyretinol and 4-oxoretinol and concomitantly differentiate. The conversion of retinol to 4-oxoretinol is a high-capacity reaction because most of the exogenous retinol is metabolized rapidly, even when cells are exposed to physiological ( approximately 1 microM) concentrations of retinol in the medium. No retinoic acid or 4-oxoRA synthesis from retinol was detected in ES cells cultured with or without LIF. The cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP26 (retinoic acid hydroxylase) is responsible for the metabolism of retinol to 4-oxoretinol, and CYP26 mRNA is greatly induced (>15-fold) after LIF removal. Concomitant with the expression of CYP26, differentiating ES cells grown in the absence of LIF activate the expression of the differentiation marker gene FGF-5 whereas the expression of the stem cell marker gene FGF-4 decreases. The strong correlation between the production of polar metabolites of retinol and the differentiation of ES cells upon removal of LIF suggests that one important action of LIF in these cells is to prevent retinol metabolism to biologically active, polar metabolites such as 4-oxoretinol.","['Lane, M A', 'Chen, A C', 'Roman, S D', 'Derguini, F', 'Gudas, L J']","['Lane MA', 'Chen AC', 'Roman SD', 'Derguini F', 'Gudas LJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, 1300 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology', '*Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid 4-Hydroxylase', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Vitamin A/*analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis/*metabolism']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Nov 9;96(23):13524-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.23.13524.,,,['10.1073/pnas.96.23.13524 [doi]'],"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', '62702-55-0 (4-oxoretinol)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Retinoic Acid 4-Hydroxylase)']",['R01CA77509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC23981,,,,,,,,,,

Epo receptor (EpoR) signaling is crucial for normal erythroid development, as evidenced by the properties of Epo(-/-) and EpoR(-/-) mice, which contain a normal number of fetal liver erythroid progenitors but die in utero from a severe anemia attributable to the absence of red cell maturation. Here we show that two constitutively active cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases, P210(BCR-ABL) and v-SRC, can functionally replace the EpoR and support full proliferation, differentiation, and maturation of fetal liver erythroid progenitors from EpoR(-/-) mice. These protein tyrosine kinases can also partially complement the myeloid growth factors IL-3, IL-6, and Steel factor, which are normally required in addition to Epo for erythroid development. Additionally, BCR-ABL mutants that lack residues necessary for transformation of fibroblasts or bone marrow cells can fully support normal erythroid development. These results demonstrate that activated tyrosine kinase oncoproteins implicated in tumorigenesis and human leukemia can functionally complement for cytokine receptor signaling pathways to support normal erythropoiesis in EpoR-deficient cells. Moreover, terminal differentiation of erythroid cells requires generic signals provided by activated protein tyrosine kinases and does not require a specific signal unique to a cytokine receptor.","['Ghaffari, S', 'Wu, H', 'Gerlach, M', 'Han, Y', 'Lodish, H F', 'Daley, G Q']","['Ghaffari S', 'Wu H', 'Gerlach M', 'Han Y', 'Lodish HF', 'Daley GQ']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Nine Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Lineage', 'DNA Primers', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/physiology', 'Interleukin-3/physiology', 'Interleukin-6/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src)/*physiology', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Nov 9;96(23):13186-90. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.23.13186.,,,['10.1073/pnas.96.23.13186 [doi]'],"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src))']","['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'P01 HL032262/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA76418-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 32262/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC23922,,,,,,,,,,

Contrary to most common insertion sites implicated in mouse T cell lymphomagenesis, retroviral insertional mutagenesis of Frat1 constitutes a relatively late event in M-MuLV-induced tumor development, suggesting that proviral activation of Frat1 contributes to progression of T cell lymphomas rather than their genesis. To substantiate this notion we have generated transgenic mice that overexpress Frat1 in various organs, including lymphoid tissues. Frat1 transgenic mice develop focal glomerulosclerosis and a nephrotic syndrome, but they do not exhibit an increased incidence of spontaneous lymphomas. Conversely, these mice are highly susceptible to M-MuLV-induced lymphomagenesis, and Frat1/Pim1 bitransgenic animals develop lymphomas with increased frequency compared to Pim1 transgenic littermates. These data support a role for Frat1 in tumor progression.","['Jonkers, J', 'Weening, J J', 'van der Valk, M', 'Bobeldijk, R', 'Berns, A']","['Jonkers J', 'Weening JJ', 'van der Valk M', 'Bobeldijk R', 'Berns A']","['Division of Molecular Genetics and Center of Biomedical Genetics, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Carrier Proteins', 'Disease Progression', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glomerulosclerosis, Focal Segmental/*genetics/pathology', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/pathogenicity', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nephrotic Syndrome/*genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Oct 28;18(44):5982-90. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202995.,,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1202995 [doi]'],"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Frat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Pim1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immature hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+/33-/13-) did not express Bcl-2 but Bcl-XL, the majority of CD34 cells expressed Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and BAD, and normal promyelocytes (CD34-/33+) lacked expression of both Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, while leukemic CD34+progenitors and promyelocytes expressed these anti-apoptotic proteins. In AML, Bcl-2 expression was higher on CD34+ than on all AML cells, however, expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL did not predict achievement of complete remission. Surprisingly, low Bcl-2 content was associated with poor survival in a group of patients with poor prognosis cytogenetics. The anti-apoptotic BAD protein was found to be expressed in AML, but was phosphorylated in 41/42 samples. Phosphorylation was found at both sites, Ser 112 and Ser 136. During induction chemotherapy, Bcl-2 levels of CD34 cells increased significantly. In the context of evidence for small numbers of leukemic CD34+ cells expressing very high levels of Bcl-2 prior to therapy, this finding is interpreted as a survival advantage of Bcl-2 overexpressing progenitors and rapid elimination of cells with low Bcl-2. Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL were both expressed in minimal residual disease cells.

At first, the sensitive and P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-related resistant cell lines were tested to induce apoptosis by a non-P-gp transported drug, such as cytosine arabinoside (ara-C). It was demonstrated that ara-C induces apoptosis in sensitive as well as in P-gp-related resistant cell lines, as expected. Furthermore, the role of bcl-2 and bcl-xL apoptosis inhibitors as well as bax expression (apoptosis inducer) in human sensitive leukemic cell lines (CCRF-CEM and HL-60) as compared to their resistant variants such as CCRF-CEM/ACT400, CCRF-CEM/VCR1000, HL-60/IDA40, HL-60/DNR250 was evaluated. In addition to the P-gp-related resistance, a possible multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) and the lung resistance protein (LRP)-related resistance were assessed by flow cytometry using the monoclonal antibodies 4E3.16, MRPr1 and LRP56. Furthermore, the function of P-gp was determined with the rhodamine-123 (R-123) accumulation test. Bcl-2 and bax were analyzed by both flow cytometry and ECL Western blot, bcl-xL by ECL-Western blot alone. Comparison of the two sensitive cell lines demonstrated different bcl-2, bax and bcl-xL patterns. The common characteristic was the increased expression of one of the apoptosis inhibitor proteins, such as bcl-2 or bcl-xL. The sensitive CCRF-CEM showed a high bax level, where a decrease of about 75% in resistant variants was measured. Compared to their sensitive counterpart HL-60, a low bax expression was analyzed, which increased in the resistant variant. The common characteristic of all resistant cell lines was the decreased expression of bax compared to bcl-2 or bcl-xL. In the P-gp-related resistant HL-60/DNR250 only an increase in bcl-xL was seen, whereas in the LRP-expressing as well as P-gp and MRP negative resistant HL-60/IDA40 both apoptotic inhibitor proteins bcl-2 and bcL-xL showed maximum increase, compared to the other resistant cell lines. The P-gp-related resistant cell lines CCRF-CEM/ACT400 and CCRF-CEM/VCR1000 also showed an increased expression of both bcl-2 and bcl-xL. Summarizing these results, it was shown that the examined sensitive human leukemic cell lines and their resistant variants demonstrated a different pattern of markers for preventing and promoting apoptosis. An association between P-gp and possible LRP-expressing leukemic cells as well as apoptosis-preventing markers (bcl-2, bcl-xL) seems to exist. The clinical relevance of the coexpression of various resistance mechanisms remains to be confirmed in large leukemia patient groups.","['Nuessler, V', 'Stotzer, O', 'Gullis, E', 'Pelka-Fleischer, R', 'Pogrebniak, A', 'Gieseler, F', 'Wilmanns, W']","['Nuessler V', 'Stotzer O', 'Gullis E', 'Pelka-Fleischer R', 'Pogrebniak A', 'Gieseler F', 'Wilmanns W']","['Klinikum Grosshadern, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik III, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/metabolism', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/analysis', 'Annexin A5/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Nov;13(11):1864-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401571.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401571 [doi]'],"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (major vault protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cell lines are widely used, well characterized and they differ in their sensitivities to topo II inhibitors. Despite the fact that HL-60 cells are p53-negative, they are much more sensitive than KG-1 cells. Three different topo II inhibitors with distinct molecular ways of action have been used. Daunorubicin and aclarubicin are DNA intercalators that secondarily interact with topo II; etoposide, on the other hand, directly binds to the enzyme. In contrast to daunorubicin, which induces protein-associated DNA double-strand breaks due to the blockage of topo II action, aclarubicin inhibits the access of DNA by topo II. No correlation could be established between the drug-induced DNA damage and apoptosis. In fact, the amount and pattern of DNA damage examined with the 'comet assay' was characteristic for each drug in both cell lines. The DNA binding of daunorubicin was slightly higher in HL-60 cells, but there was no notable variance between the cell lines for aclarubicin. The most striking difference could be found for the nuclear topo II activity, which was about half in KG-1 cells and, additionally, less than 1% of the nuclear topo II activity was bound to the DNA in KG-1 cells when compared to HL-60 cells. This fraction of topo II interacts with the inhibitors; subsequently these findings might well explain the variance in the cellular sensitivity. Additional factors are alterations of the apoptotic pathways, eg loss of p53 in HL-60 cells. Although we found no differences in the quantity of DNA damage between the cell lines after drug treatment, the quality of DNA damage appeared to be distinct for each topo II inhibitor. The morphological appearance of the comet tails after treatment was characteristic for each drug. Further studies are necessary to decide whether these in vitro data are compatible with the clinical situation.","['Gieseler, F', 'Bauer, E', 'Nuessler, V', 'Clark, M', 'Valsamas, S']","['Gieseler F', 'Bauer E', 'Nuessler V', 'Clark M', 'Valsamas S']","['University Hospital, Klinik fur Allgemeine Innere Medizin, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Aclarubicin/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/*genetics', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Genes, p53/genetics', 'Humans', 'Intercalating Agents/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/pathology', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/analysis']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Nov;13(11):1859-63. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401570.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401570 [doi]'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis may involve activation of death-inducing ligand/receptor systems such as CD95 (APO-1/Fas). Treatment with anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin, methotrexate, cytarabine, etoposide and cisplatin at therapeutic concentrations leads to induction of CD95-ligand (CD95-L). CD95-L can mediate cell death in an autocrine/paracrine manner by crosslinking CD95 receptor (CD95). Interfering with CD95-ligand/receptor interaction by antagonistic antibodies to the receptor reduces sensitivity to drug-mediated apoptosis in some cell systems. In addition, treatment with cytotoxic drugs may result in upregulation of CD95, thereby increasing the sensitivity to the CD95 death signal. Apoptosis depends on activation of caspases. Deficient activation of the CD95 system was found in drug-resistant cells. In addition, CD95-resistant and doxorubicin-resistant cells displayed cross-resistance for induction of cell death. Thus, intact apoptosis pathways such as the CD95 system may play a role in determining sensitivity or resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapy.","['Friesen, C', 'Fulda, S', 'Debatin, K M']","['Friesen C', 'Fulda S', 'Debatin KM']","[""University Children's Hospital, Ulm; and Division of Molecular Oncology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Nov;13(11):1854-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401333.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401333 [doi]'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,,,57,,,,,,,,,

In this study we present a simpler, yet accurate, method to assess and quantitate MRD in pediatric pre-B ALL that utilizes these markers. From the sequence of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and T cell receptor (TcR) gene rearrangements characterized at the time of diagnosis or relapse, primers were designed and tested in a clone-specific, single-round PCR assay, then analyzed by fluorescence staining of the PCR products. The most critical step involved an adherence to a new set of guidelines for the design of clone-specific primers. Application of this method to 54 IgH and 13 TcR (nine Vdelta2Ddelta3 and four Ddelta2-Ddelta3) gene rearrangements in 47 patients resulted in an intense band within the region of the predicted molecular weight, confirming the reproducibility of the assay. Quantitative applications of the approach were examined by performing a 10-replicate limiting dilution clone-specific PCR on six diagnostic samples and an asymptotic response model of the Von Krogh form was found to fit the data well. From this model, estimation of leukemic cells of remission bone marrow samples was achieved at a detection sensitivity of 2 x 10(-6). The method is demonstrated on 18 patients whose marrows were prospectively analyzed during therapy. We conclude this methodology is useful in the quick and accurate assessment of MRD in children with pre-B ALL, and could be applied to other DNA quantitation assays.","['Mayer, S P', 'Giamelli, J', 'Sandoval, C', 'Roach, A S', 'Fevzi Ozkaynak, M', 'Tugal, O', 'Rovera, G', 'Jayabose, S']","['Mayer SP', 'Giamelli J', 'Sandoval C', 'Roach AS', 'Fevzi Ozkaynak M', 'Tugal O', 'Rovera G', 'Jayabose S']","['Department of Pediatrics, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA Primers', 'Fluorescence', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Nov;13(11):1843-52. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401530.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401530 [doi]'],"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The assays were also used to evaluate disease depletion in an ex vivo tumor spiking model in which normal peripheral blood was spiked with tumor cell lines and processed according to the clinical purging method. PCR data from both the clinical trial and the ex vivo model demonstrated a 4 to 6 log reduction in tumor cells during CD34+ and CD34+ Thy-1+ enrichment.

This device combines rapid thermocycling with online detection of PCR product formation and is based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between two adjacent hybridization probes carrying donor and acceptor fluorophores. A pair of probes was designed that was complementary to ABL exon 3, thus enabling detection of all known BCR-ABL variants and also normal ABL as an internal control. Conditions were established to amplify less than 10 target molecules/reaction and to detect one CML cell in 105 cells from healthy donors. To determine the utility of the assay, we quantified BCR-ABL and ABL transcripts in 254 samples (222 peripheral blood, 32 bone marrow) from 120 patients with CML after therapy with IFN-alpha (n = 219), allogeneic BMT (n = 17), chemotherapy (n = 11), or at diagnosis (n = 7). The level of residual disease in the 245 BCR-ABL positive specimens was expressed as the ratio of BCR-ABL/ABL. This ratio was compared to results obtained by three established methods from contemporaneous specimens. A highly significant correlation was seen between the BCR-ABL/ABL ratios determined by the LightCycler and (1) the BCR-ABL/ABL ratios obtained by nested competitive RT-PCR (n = 201, r = 0.90, P < 0. 0001); (2) the proportion of Philadelphia chromosome positive metaphases determined by cytogenetics (n = 81, P < 0.0001); and (3) the BCR ratio determined by Southern blot analysis (n = 122, P < 0. 0001). We conclude that real-time PCR with hybridization probes is a reliable and sensitive method to monitor CML patients after therapy.

With similar results, fusions between MUM1 and IgH loci were observed by means of interphase DCFISH in eight (21.1%) out of the 38 MM cases, although no definite relationships between MUM1 status and specific clinical findings could be established.","['Yoshida, S', 'Nakazawa, N', 'Iida, S', 'Hayami, Y', 'Sato, S', 'Wakita, A', 'Shimizu, S', 'Taniwaki, M', 'Ueda, R']","['Yoshida S', 'Nakazawa N', 'Iida S', 'Hayami Y', 'Sato S', 'Wakita A', 'Shimizu S', 'Taniwaki M', 'Ueda R']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya City University Medical School, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Nov;13(11):1812-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401563.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401563 [doi]'],"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.21.4 (Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific)', 'EC 3.1.21.4 (GCGGCCGC-specific type II deoxyribonucleases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reported frequencies in gastric non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) vary from 14% to as high as 90%. Another form of genetic instability in tumours is allelic imbalance (AI) due to loss or gain of genetic material at a specific chromosomal region. This might point to the presence of a tumour suppressor gene or oncogene. We examined both MSI and AI in 26 gastric lymphomas (10 low-grade and 13 high-grade MALT lymphomas and three cases lacking MALT features and categorised as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLCL)). Tumour components and normal cells (epithelium, muscle) were microdissected from paraffin-embedded resection samples. Contrary to other studies we did not observe frequent MSI when investigating 18 different loci distributed over 12 chromosomes. Microsatellite instability of a single locus was found in 1/10 (10%) low-grade MALT lymphomas and 2/13 (15%) high-grade MALT lymphomas. These data indicate that DNA mismatch repair genes do not play a role in the pathogenesis of these lymphomas. Allelic imbalance was detected in 60% (6/10) of low-grade MALT lymphomas, in 62% (8/13) of high-grade MALT lymphoma and in 67% (2/3) of DLCL. In high-grade lymphomas more loci showed AI (one to seven loci, with a mean of 2.5 loci per case) than in the low-grade lymphomas (one to two loci, with a mean of 1.3 loci per case), possibly reflecting an increased genomic instability.","['Hoeve, M A', 'Ferreira Mota, S C', 'Schuuring, E', 'de Leeuw, W J', 'Chott, A', 'Meijerink, J P', 'Kluin, P M', 'van Krieken, J H']","['Hoeve MA', 'Ferreira Mota SC', 'Schuuring E', 'de Leeuw WJ', 'Chott A', 'Meijerink JP', 'Kluin PM', 'van Krieken JH']","['Department of Pathology, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Epithelium/metabolism', 'Genes, myc/genetics', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Loss of Heterozygosity/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/classification/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics', 'Microsatellite Repeats/*genetics', 'Muscles/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion/*genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Nov;13(11):1804-11. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401554.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401554 [doi]'],"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the role of this fusion protein in the pathogenesis of CMML, we expressed the Tel-PDGFRbeta fusion cDNA in hematopoietic cells of transgenic mice under the control of the human CD11a promoter. Transgenic founders and their offspring express the transgene specifically in hematopoietic tissues and develop a myeloproliferative syndrome characterized by: overproduction of mature neutrophils and megakaryocytes in the bone marrow; splenomegaly with effacement of splenic architecture by extramedullary hematopoiesis; an abnormal population of leukocytes co-expressing lymphoid and myeloid markers; and increased numbers of colonies in in vitro bone marrow CFU assays. All mice expressing the transgene exhibited at least one of these features of dysregulated myelopoiesis, and 20% progressed to a myeloid or lymphoid malignancy. This murine model of CMML parallels a myeloproliferative syndrome in humans and implicates the Tel-PDGFRbeta fusion protein in its pathogenesis.","['Ritchie, K A', 'Aprikyan, A A', 'Bowen-Pope, D F', 'Norby-Slycord, C J', 'Conyers, S', 'Bartelmez, S', 'Sitnicka, E H', 'Hickstein, D D']","['Ritchie KA', 'Aprikyan AA', 'Bowen-Pope DF', 'Norby-Slycord CJ', 'Conyers S', 'Bartelmez S', 'Sitnicka EH', 'Hickstein DD']","['Medical Research Service, VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, WA 98108, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/*genetics/metabolism', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Spleen/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transgenes/genetics']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Nov;13(11):1790-803. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401494.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401494 [doi]'],"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)']","['DK48708-02/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K08HL02959/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Identical deletions are found in adults with MDS/AML with a history of exposure to alkylating agents (secondary MDS/AML). While deleted chromosomal regions likely harbor genes encoding proteins with tumor suppressor (TS) function, such genes have not been identified and the environmental forces by which these mutant clones are selected remain unclear. A consistent signaling abnormality in cells bearing mutations of the Fanconi anemia complementation group C (FA-C) gene (FANCC) has revealed a potential selective force. Hematopoietic progenitor cells from patients and mice with FANCC mutations are hypersensitive to the inhibitory effects of IFNgamma and TNFalpha. Consequently, clonal outgrowths in FA likely result from strong selective pressure for stem and/or progenitor cells resistant to these inhibitory cytokines. Additional mutations that inactivate signaling pathways for these inhibitors would create a cell with a profound proliferative advantage over its apoptosis-prone counterparts. Here, we present preliminary evidence supporting a selection-based model of leukemic evolution and argue that MDS in FA patients is a de facto model of secondary MDS in non-FA adults.","['Lensch, M W', 'Rathbun, R K', 'Olson, S B', 'Jones, G R', 'Bagby, G C Jr']","['Lensch MW', 'Rathbun RK', 'Olson SB', 'Jones GR', 'Bagby GC Jr']","['Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics, Oregon Cancer Center, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics', 'Clone Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Fanconi Anemia/complications/*genetics/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/genetics/*pathology', 'Models, Genetic', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/genetics/pathology', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics', '*Selection, Genetic']",1999/11/11 09:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/11/11 09:00'],"['1999/11/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Nov;13(11):1784-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401586.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401586 [doi]'],"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)']",['HL48546/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,63,,,,,,,,,

The polychromatic erythrocytes were also significantly protected against BCNU-induced clastogenicity both in the presence (P < 0.001) and absence of O6-beG (P < 0.05). The primitive, multipotent spleen colony-forming cells (CFU-S) in these animals also showed moderate (1.6-fold, P = 0.034) protection in the absence of O6-beG but in the presence of the inactivator they remained as sensitive to BCNU toxicity as those in the control animals (P = 0.133). This result contrasts with previous findings demonstrating significant hATPA/GA-mediated, O6-beG-resistant protection against the toxicity and clastogenicity of a number of O6-alkylating agents, including temozolomide, fotemustine and chlorozotocin. The possibility that our strategy for protective gene therapy may be highly agent and cell-type specific is unexpected and has possible implications for clinical trials of this approach using BCNU or related agents.","['Chinnasamy, N', 'Rafferty, J', 'Lashford, L', 'Chinnasamy, D', 'Margison, G', 'Thatcher, N', 'Dexter, T', 'Fairbairn, L']","['Chinnasamy N', 'Rafferty J', 'Lashford L', 'Chinnasamy D', 'Margison G', 'Thatcher N', 'Dexter T', 'Fairbairn L']","['CRC Sections of Genome Damage and Repair, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/toxicity', 'Carmustine/*toxicity', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Granulocytes/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Mutagens/toxicity', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotidyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Spleen/*cytology/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Nov;13(11):1776-83. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401584.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401584 [doi]'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Mutagens)', '01KC87F8FE (O(6)-benzylguanine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.42 (glutamine-synthetase adenylyltransferase)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied their mRNA expressions in 41 hematopoietic cell lines and in 137 patients with hematological malignancies; we used a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assay. Normal peripheral bloods, bone marrow and lymph nodes expressed little or undetectable p16INK4A and p14ARF mRNAs, which were readily detected in 12 and 17 of 41 cell lines, respectively.

Almost all patients without p14ARF expression lacked p16INK4A expression, which may correspond to deletions of the INK4A/ARF locus. Undetectable p16INK4A expression with p14ARF expression in 41 patients may correspond to p16INK4A promoter methylation or to normal expression status of the p16INK4A gene. All patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), myeloma or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) expressed p14ARF while nine of 23 patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) lost p14ARF expression.

Extensive cytogenetic studies, including triple-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), revealed that Ph-positive monosomic cells (45, Xc), Ph-negative monosomic cells and normal diploid cells (46, XX) were present in her bone marrow at diagnosis. After successful interferon therapy, the non-leukemia cells expanded and reconstituted normal hematopoiesis resulting in complete cytogenetic response, following the selective suppression of the monosomic Ph-positive leukemia clone. The ratio of Xc to XX cells in bone marrow cells was significantly increased to that in skin fibroblasts. Moreover, the ratio of Ph-positive cells to Ph-negative cells was found to be significantly different between karyotyping and FISH. Studies of this quite unique case not only confirmed the clonality of CML, effectiveness of interferon-alpha and X chromosome imbalance among different tissues, but also demonstrated a discrepant increase of the BCR/ABL-positive clone in CML. The latter supports the hypothesis that reduced programmed cell death may be the primary mechanism responsible for the expansion of the leukemia clone in CML. Our study verifies the importance of extensive analysis of a neoplastic disease in patients with a constitutional chromosomal abnormality.","['Takeshita, A', 'Shinjo, K', 'Yamashita, M', 'Fujisawa, S', 'Naito, K', 'Ohnishi, K', 'Takahashi, K', 'Matsui, H', 'Ohno, R']","['Takeshita A', 'Shinjo K', 'Yamashita M', 'Fujisawa S', 'Naito K', 'Ohnishi K', 'Takahashi K', 'Matsui H', 'Ohno R']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine III, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Count/drug effects', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/complications/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Monosomy/*genetics/pathology', 'Mosaicism/*genetics/pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Skin', 'Turner Syndrome/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'X Chromosome/genetics']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Nov;13(11):1749-53. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401528.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401528 [doi]'],"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this purpose our cohort of patients was divided into two groups of which the first presented with the generally accepted signs and symptoms of IMF (group I; n = 60). Most patients of the second group (group II; n = 19) showed mild to moderate therapy-refractory anemia, minimal to slight splenomegaly and frequently thrombocytosis, but no bone marrow fibrosis at onset. Hematopoiesis was consistent with a striking hypercellularity in comparison to the age-related involution by adipose tissue, a conspicuous clustering and histotopographic dislocation of megakaryocytes, a neutrophil granulocytic proliferation and a reduction of erythropoietic islets with arrest of maturation. Most remarkable was the dysplastic cytology of megakaryocytes with a definitive deviation of differentiation resulting in bizarre forms. Follow-up examinations revealed that at later stages group II patients were not distinguishable from the first group with more advanced IMF. For this reason, these patients were regarded as presenting initial, prefibrotic IMF characterized by distinctive bone marrow features at the beginning. The prominent abnormalities of megakaryopoiesis together with the granulocytic proliferation were extremely helpful to differentiate prefibrotic IMF with accompanying thrombocythemia from essential thrombocythemia (ET). Dynamics of fiber progression were calculated by regarding increase in density per time. Speed of progression during the first year of observation proved to be significantly higher in group II patients with prefibrotic IMF in comparison to full-blown cases (group I). In conclusion, with respect to prospective clinical trials, diagnostic criteria for IMF should be re-evaluated by also taking initial, prefibrotic stages into account.","['Thiele, J', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Boeltken, B', 'Zankovich, R', 'Diehl, V', 'Fischer, R']","['Thiele J', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Boeltken B', 'Zankovich R', 'Diehl V', 'Fischer R']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Anemia, Refractory/blood/diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/blood/diagnosis/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Nov;13(11):1741-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401553.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401553 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report two cases of s-AML with inv(16)(p13q22) who had prior exposure to paclitaxel. Additionally, two previously reported cases of s-AML with inv(16) had prior paclitaxel exposure raising the possibility that the taxanes may predispose to this specific syndrome of s-AML. One of our patients received escalated-dose ara-C chemotherapy, achieving a complete remission (12+ months). We therefore examined the prognosis of previously reported cases of s-AML with inv(16) and analyzed the influence of escalated-dose ara-C (>/=400 mg/m2/day). A total of 25 evaluable cases were identified, with 96% attaining CR independent of ara-C dose. The estimated median remission duration was 40 months and the median survival has not been reached (actuarial 5-year survival 52 +/- 18%). Although not achieving statistical significance, patients treated with escalated dose ara-C (n = 15) had longer remission duration and overall survival than those treated with standard dose ara-C (n = 10) (P = 0.063 and 0.20, respectively). In univariate analysis, younger age, male gender, and the presence of additional cytogenetic abnormalities were associated with a tendency towards adverse outcomes (P< 0.1). Age and gender were equally distributed between ara-C dose cohorts, but more patients treated with standard-dose ara-C had additional cytogenetic abnormalities (P = 0.048). Within the limitations of this retrospective study, this analysis suggests that, similar to de novo AML with inv(16), secondary cases may also potentially benefit from treatment with escalated-dose ara-C. This is consistent with the premise that the underlying molecular defect, rather than the presence of prior cytotoxic drug exposure, may be the most important determinant of disease behavior and chemotherapy responsiveness in AML.","['Seymour, J F', 'Juneja, S K', 'Campbell, L J', 'Ellims, P H', 'Estey, E H', 'Prince, H M']","['Seymour JF', 'Juneja SK', 'Campbell LJ', 'Ellims PH', 'Estey EH', 'Prince HM']","['Haematology Unit, Department of Haematology/Medical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, East Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine/drug therapy/pathology', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*genetics', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Paclitaxel/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Nov;13(11):1735-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401552.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401552 [doi]'],"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",,,,43,,,,,,,,,

We assessed for pediatric patients with T-ALL the relative importance of prognostic factors previously demonstrated to predict outcome in B-precursor ALL. Presenting clinical and laboratory features were correlated with outcome for 441 children 12 months to 21 years of age with previously untreated T-ALL, registered on the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) T3 protocol between 1986 and 1992. These T-ALL prognostic factor analyses were then compared to similar analyses for 1993 patients with B-precursor ALL enrolled during the same time period on the POG ALinC 14 protocol. Quantitative interaction between phenotype and each prognostic factor was studied to determine the relative importance of the prognostic factor for each of the two major immunophenotypes. We also analyzed the importance of maturational stage as a T-ALL prognostic factor, using a modified Ludwig definition of maturational stage. We conclude that several of the clinical and laboratory prognostic factors, which are used reliably for B-precursor ALL, are much less predictive in T-ALL (ie age, WBC, consensus risk group, hyperdiploidy, presence of trans- locations and CALLA expression). There was no significant difference between the phenotypes in the prognostic importance of race or gender. Our data demonstrate a significant difference in outcome among the three maturational stages of T-cell ALL, with the intermediate group faring best. Using traditional risk group criteria to stratify patients with T-ALL for therapy may not be appropriate.","['Pullen, J', 'Shuster, J J', 'Link, M', 'Borowitz, M', 'Amylon, M', 'Carroll, A J', 'Land, V', 'Look, A T', 'McIntyre, B', 'Camitta, B']","['Pullen J', 'Shuster JJ', 'Link M', 'Borowitz M', 'Amylon M', 'Carroll AJ', 'Land V', 'Look AT', 'McIntyre B', 'Camitta B']","['University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'CD24 Antigen', 'Central Nervous System/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Ploidies', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*diagnosis/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Racial Groups', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Nov;13(11):1696-707. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401555.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401555 [doi]'],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD24 Antigen)', '0 (CD24 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']","['CA-15989/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33603/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods are increasingly used for minimal residual disease detection (MRD), and provide useful prognostic information. In this review, current approaches for MRD detection in indolent lymphomas are summarized. In addition, the prognostic aspects of molecular monitoring after transplantation procedures are discussed. The experience accumulated over the past decade shows that PCR analysis has a prognostic impact in several therapeutic programs including conventional and high-dose regimens. Major advantages coming from the introduction of molecular monitoring in clinical programs have been: (1) a rapid evaluation of the anti-tumor activity of innovative treatments; and (2) an early identification of patients with a high-risk of disease recurrence.","['Corradini, P', 'Ladetto, M', 'Pileri, A', 'Tarella, C']","['Corradini P', 'Ladetto M', 'Pileri A', 'Tarella C']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Istituto Scientifico HS Raffaele, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnosis/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics/*pathology/therapy', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/trends', 'Recurrence']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Nov;13(11):1691-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401559.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401559 [doi]'],"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,52,,,,,,,,,

The proteins encoded by these genes are nuclear factors each containing two separate DNA-binding zinc finger domains. The proteins are identical, aside from the N-terminal extension of MDS1/EVI1, which is missing in EVI1. However, they have opposite functions as transcription factors. In contrast to MDS1/EVI1, EVI1 is often activated inappropriately by chromosomal rearrangements at 3q26 leading to inappropriate expression of the protein in hematopoietic cells and to myeloid leukemias, which are often characterized by abnormal megakaryopoiesis. We previously showed that the two proteins affect replication and differentiation of progenitor hematopoietic cell lines in opposite ways: whereas EVI1 inhibits the response of 32Dc13 cells to G-CSF and TGFbeta1, MDS1/EVI1 has no effect on the G-CSF-induced differentiation of the 32Dc13 cells, and it enhances the growth-inhibitory effect of TGFbeta1. In the present study, we analyzed the endogenous expression of the two genes during in vitro hematopoietic differentiation of murine embryonic stem (ES) cells and evaluated the effects of their forced expression on the ability of ES cells to produce differentiated hematopoietic colonies. We found that the expression of the two genes is independently and tightly controlled during differentiation. In addition, the forced expression of EVI1 led to a much higher rate of cell growth before and during differentiation, whereas the expression of MDS1/EVI1 repressed cell growth and strongly reduced the number of differentiated hematopoietic colonies. Finally, our study also found that the forced expression of EVI1 resulted in the differentiation of abnormally high numbers of megakaryocytic colonies, thus providing one of the first experimental models showing a clear correlation between inappropriate expression of EVI1 and abnormalities in megakaryopoiesis.","['Sitailo, S', 'Sood, R', 'Barton, K', 'Nucifora, G']","['Sitailo S', 'Sood R', 'Barton K', 'Nucifora G']","['Oncology Institute and Department of Medicine, Loyola University Medical Center, 2160 S First Avenue, Maywood, IL 60153, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/*genetics', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transgenes/genetics/physiology']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Nov;13(11):1639-45. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401585.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401585 [doi]'],"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MDS1-EVI1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (MDS1-EVI1 fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']","['CA67189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 03668/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that TG/F8 scFv, selected from a phase display library of human V-gene segments by binding to guinea-pig liver tTG, can react with human tTG both in Western blot and in immunohistochemistry. The specific detection of tTG by TG/F8 in human thymocytes is verified by mass spectrometric analysis of the purified protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in lymphoid cells tTG is cleaved by caspase 3 during the late phase of apoptotic death, concomitant to DNA fragmentation, and that such cleavage causes loss of cross-linking function. We propose tTG cleavage as a valuable biochemical marker of caspase 3 activation during the late execution phase of apoptosis.","['Fabbi, M', 'Marimpietri, D', 'Martini, S', 'Brancolini, C', 'Amoresano, A', 'Scaloni, A', 'Bargellesi, A', 'Cosulich, E']","['Fabbi M', 'Marimpietri D', 'Martini S', 'Brancolini C', 'Amoresano A', 'Scaloni A', 'Bargellesi A', 'Cosulich E']","['Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, L.go R.Benzi 10, 16132 Genova, Italy. fabbi@ermes.cba.unige.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Biomarkers/chemistry', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Liver/chemistry/cytology', 'Mice', 'Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2', 'Thymus Gland/chemistry/cytology', 'Transglutaminases/genetics/*metabolism']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 1999 Oct;6(10):992-1001. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400573.,,,['10.1038/sj.cdd.4400573 [doi]'],"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Transglutaminases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The methods were: the Milan/Mulhouse protocol, the ISHAGE guidelines for CD34+ cells enumeration and our own protocol. The procedure we have adopted is essentially a Milan/Mulhouse protocol-derived methodology combined with a multiparametric approach using the PAINT-A-GATE software analysis program. The samples were collected from 70 patients affected by acute leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, myeloma and breast cancer who were scheduled to receive autologous PBSC transplantation. PBSC collection was performed following mobilization with subcutaneous G-CSF at 5-10 microg/kg/day. A minimum target of 2 x 10(6)/kg CD34+ cells was considered an acceptable harvest to ensure a safe transplant. On average, three aphereses per patient were performed and a total of 204 apheresis samples were analyzed. Regression analysis of the percentage and absolute number of CD34+ cells, as calculated with each method, achieved an excellent correlation in spite of methodological differences. In fact, both CD34+dim and CD34+CD45- events were included in our gating strategy. In the setting of a triple staining associating CD34, CD38 and CD45, we identified a variable fraction of CD34+CD38+CD45- cells which would be otherwise undetected due to its CD45 negativity. To this end, we used a new technology referred to as laser-scanning cytometry (LSC) which allowed the isolation and morphological identification of CD34+CD45- cells. By comparing CD34+CD45+ and CD34+CD45- cells, we found that they share a common morphology, thus confirming the hypothesis that the latter are to be considered for CD34+ cell calculation. The median number of CD34+ cells/kg, as calculated by the three methods, was: 4.79 x 10(6)/kg (range 1-570) for the Milan/Mulhouse protocol, 3.9 x 10(6)/kg (range 0.8-498) for the ISHAGE one, and 5.17 x 10(6)/kg (range 2-599) for our protocol.

Human Jurkat cells express IL4 but one of the main factors restricting studies of human IL5 expression has been the lack of human T-cell lines which express significant levels of IL5 in an inducible fashion. We report that the human T-cell leukemia cell line (PER-117), previously shown to produce IL2, also produces IL5 and IL4, and is a useful model for the study of the regulation of IL5 and IL4 gene expression. We show that expression of IL5 and IL4 mRNAs in PER-117 cells is stimulation dependent. IL5 and IL4 reporter constructs are also transiently expressed in these cells in an inducible fashion. IL5 production in the PER-117 cell line can be activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate alone and further enhanced by calcium ionophore A23187, cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate or anti-CD28 antibodies. The conditions used to stimulate the PER-117 cells determined whether IL5 production was inhibited by cyclosporin A or dexamethasone.

While c-Myb is indispensable for normal hematopoiesis, v-Myb induces acute leukemia. The v-Myb DNA-binding domain (DBD) differs from that of c-Myb mainly by deletion of the first of three repeats which correlates with efficient oncogenic transformation and a decrease in DNA-binding activity. To investigate the difference in DNA-binding and transcriptional activation, oligonucleotide selection and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were employed. The v-Myb DBD (R2R3) shows an intrinsic DNA-binding specificity for an AT-rich downstream extension of the Myb recognition element (MRE) PyAAC(T)/(G)G for efficient binding to this site, whereas R1 within the c-Myb DBD allows for more flexibility for this downstream extension. Therefore, due to the presence of repeat R1, c-Myb can bind to a greater number of target sites. The intrinsic DNA-binding specificity of R2R3 is further supported with the results from in vivo transcriptional activation experiments which demonstrated that both the v-Myb and c-Myb DBDs require an extension of the MRE (motif #1) by a downstream T-stretch (motif #2) for full activity. Surprisingly, the T-stretch improves binding when present on either strand, but is required on a specific strand for transcriptional activation.","['Ganter, B', 'Chao, S T', 'Lipsick, J S']","['Ganter B', 'Chao ST', 'Lipsick JS']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University, School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305-5324, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins v-myb/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*physiology', 'Quail', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1999 Nov 5;460(3):401-10. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(99)01373-3.,,,"['S0014-5793(99)01373-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(99)01373-3 [doi]']","['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-myb)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)']",['R01 CA43592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,71,,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, however, is not yet understood. In the present study, we report that hyperpolarization of the membrane potential is required for prevention of mcl-1 mediated cell death in murine myeloblastic FDC-P1 cells. In cells transfected with mcl-1, the membrane potential, measured by the whole-cell patch clamp, was hyperpolarized more than -30 mV compared with control cells. The membrane potential was repolarized by increased extracellular K(+) concentration (56 mV per 10-fold change in K(+) concentration). Using the cell-attached patch-clamp technique, K(+) channel activity was 1.7 times higher in mcl-1 transfected cells (NP(o) = 22.7 +/- 3. 3%) than control cells (NP(o) = 13.2 +/- 1.9%).

The breakpoint on chromosome 11p15 targets the NUP98 gene and results in the separation of the N-terminal FXFG repeats from the RNA-binding domain located in the C-terminus. The breakpoint on chromosome 20q11 occurs within the gene encoding human DNA topoisomerase I (TOP1). As a result, a chimeric mRNA encoding the NUP98 FXFG repeats fused to the body of DNA topoisomerase I is produced.

But many patients relapse despite a potent graft-versus-leukemia effect mediated by allogeneic T cells. The expression of the FasL protein has been suggested as a mechanism of tumor immune escape. We, therefore, evaluated the capacity of leukemic cells from patients with acute or chronic myelogenous leukemia to escape the allogeneic or autologous immune response by bearing the FasL molecule. Although almost all leukemic cells express the 37-kD form of FasL, only 54% of acute myeloblastic leukemia and 27% of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells bore a FasL with killing properties, as assessed by the ability of leukemic cells to cause the apoptosis of a Fas-sensitive target cell line or autologous activated T cells in 3 tested leukemic cases. Experiments with a recombinant Fas-Fc molecule confirmed the role of Fas/FasL in leukemic-mediated cell death. Only CML leukemic cells from certain individuals contained the 26-kD truncated form of FasL. Thus, myeloid leukemic cells from some, but not all patients can set up a mechanism of immune escape involving the Fas/FasL pathway. This leukemic escape may have implications for patients eligible for adoptive cellular immunotherapy.","['Buzyn, A', 'Petit, F', 'Ostankovitch, M', 'Figueiredo, S', 'Varet, B', 'Guillet, J G', 'Ameisen, J C', 'Estaquier, J']","['Buzyn A', 'Petit F', 'Ostankovitch M', 'Figueiredo S', 'Varet B', 'Guillet JG', 'Ameisen JC', 'Estaquier J']","['INSERM Unite 445, ICGM, Hopital Cochin; INSERM E 99-22, Faculte de Medecine Bichat, Paris, France. buzyn@icgm.cochin.inserm.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Death/immunology', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Tumor Escape/*immunology', 'fas Receptor/genetics/*immunology']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Nov 1;94(9):3135-40.,,,['S0006-4971(20)71069-4 [pii]'],"['0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ex vivo potency of several antifolates (MTX, trimetrexate [TMQ], GW1843U89, multitargeted antifolate [MTA], Raltitrexed, and ZD9331) was studied via in situ inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TS). After short-term exposure, relapsed c/preB-ALL (rALL, n = 21), T-ALL (n = 22), and AML (n = 22) were 3-fold, 10-fold, and 6-fold less sensitive to MTX (P </=.01) compared with initial c/preB-ALL (n = 43). This difference in resistance was not observed for TMQ. Also for GW1843U89 and MTA, no resistance was observed in rALL and AML compared with c/preB-ALL. T-ALL compared with c/preB-ALL tended to be less resistant to GW1843U89 (3-fold) and MTA (6-fold) than to MTX (10-fold) (P =.06). Raltitrexed was more active against c/preB-ALL compared with the other subtypes. After 21 hours continuous incubation, T-ALL and AML samples were equally sensitive as c/preB-ALL to MTX, but rALL was 3-fold resistant to MTX compared with initial c/preB-ALL (P =.003). The resistance of rALL was circumvented by TMQ (1-fold; P =.03) and GW1843U89 (1.4-fold; P =. 004). Novel antifolates, except MTA, displayed a more potent TS inhibition than MTX during continuous exposure. These results suggest that MTX resistance in AML and T-ALL can be circumvented by continuous exposure, and that novel antifolates should be explored further for MTX-resistant T-ALL, rALL, and AML cells.","['Rots, M G', 'Pieters, R', 'Peters, G J', 'van Zantwijk, C H', 'Mauritz, R', 'Noordhuis, P', 'Willey, J C', 'Hahlen, K', 'Creutzig, U', 'Janka-Schaub, G', 'Kaspers, G J', 'Veerman, A J', 'Jansen, G']","['Rots MG', 'Pieters R', 'Peters GJ', 'van Zantwijk CH', 'Mauritz R', 'Noordhuis P', 'Willey JC', 'Hahlen K', 'Creutzig U', 'Janka-Schaub G', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Veerman AJ', 'Jansen G']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. marianne.rots@azvu.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Thiophenes/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Trimetrexate/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Nov 1;94(9):3121-8.,,,['S0006-4971(20)71045-1 [pii]'],"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '0 (ZD 9331)', 'FCB9EGG971 (raltitrexed)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PETHEMA group.,3015-21,"The Spanish PETHEMA group designed a protocol for newly diagnosed PML/RARalpha-positive acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in which induction and consolidation followed the original AIDA regimen, except for the omission of cytarabine and etoposide from consolidation. Induction consisted of 45 mg/m(2) all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) daily until complete remission (CR) and 12 mg/m(2) idarubicin on days 2, 4, 6, and 8. Patients in CR received 3 monthly chemotherapy courses: idarubicin 5 mg/m(2)/d x 4 (course no. 1), mitoxantrone 10 mg/m(2)/d x 5 (course no. 2), and idarubicin 12 mg/m(2)/d x 1 (course no. 3). Maintenance therapy consisted of 90 mg/m(2)/d mercaptopurine orally, 15 mg/m(2)/wk methotrexate intramuscularly, and, intermittently, 45 mg/m(2)/d ATRA for 15 days every 3 months. Between November 1996 and December 1998, 123 patients with newly diagnosed PML/RARalpha-positive APL from 39 centers were enrolled. A total of 109 patients achieved CR (89%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 83 to 95), 12 died of early complications, and the remaining 2 were resistant. Consolidation treatment was associated with very low toxicity and no deaths in remission were recorded. Molecular assessment of response by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed conversion to PCR-negative in 48 of 99 (51%) and 82 of 88 patients (93%) after induction and consolidation, respectively. The 2-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival and event-free survival were 82% +/- 4% and 79% +/- 4%, respectively. For patients who achieved CR, the 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 92% +/- 3%. These data indicate that a significant reduction in toxicity might be obtained in APL using a less intensive consolidation without apparently compromising the antileukemic effect.

While differentiating, these cells eventually start to express MHC class II molecules (DR homologues) on their surface. The stable transfection of the fibroblast-like wild-type cells with retroviral constructs containing the cDNA for the canine MHC class II DR-genes (DRA and DRB) induces a change in morphology, accelerates cell cycle progression and leads to a loss of anchorage-dependent growth. Transfected cells show features of an immature stem cell leukaemia, such as giant cell formation. In wild-type D064 cells the accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (cdki) p27kip-1 induces differentiation, which is dependent upon signalling via the ligand for the tyrosine kinase receptor c-kit (stem cell factor). DR-transfected cells instead apparently grow independently of any growth factor-mediated signals and express high levels of the cdkis p27kip-1 and especially p21(waf-1/cip-1), concurrently with accelated cell cycle progression. In contrast to the overexpression of cdkis and despite accelerated cell cycle progression, the expression of the G2/M phase transition kinase p34cdc2 is significantly reduced in DR-transfected and transformed cells as compared to the haematopoietic wild-type cell line D064. This might suggest a possible alternative cell cycle progression pathway in this experimental stem cell leukaemia by by-passing the G0/G1 phase arrest, although retinoblastoma (Rb)-phosphorylation remains unaltered. These results provide evidence that mechanisms normally controlling the cell cycle and early haematopoietic differentiation are disrupted by the constitutive transcription and expression of MHC class II genes (DR) leading to a progression and growth of this experimental stem cell leukaemia independent from cell cycle controlling regulators such as p27 and p21.","['Huss, R', 'Theis, S', 'Deeg, H J']","['Huss R', 'Theis S', 'Deeg HJ']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/biosynthesis', '*Cell Cycle/genetics', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/pathology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Dogs', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology/pathology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology/pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/pathology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 Nov;81(5):808-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690768.,,,['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690768 [doi]'],"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']","['CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 31787/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2374288,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to assess whether topotecan with cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) or with etoposide (VP-16) should be studied in phase II trials in patients with refractory or relapsed AML. Patients with refractory or relapsed AML were assigned to one of 3 strata defined by expected CR rates of 7%, 20% and 40%, then randomly assigned to receive topotecan (dl-5) and ara-C (1 g/m2 over 2 hours; dl-5), topotecan (d1-5) followed by VP-16 (250 mg/m2 twice daily, d6-7), or VP-16 (250 mg/m2 twice daily dl-2) followed by topotecan (d3-d7). A dose-finding phase was conducted in the poorest stratum of each arm (topotecan starting dose: 1.0 mg/m2/day x 5). A Bayesian pre-phase II selection design was used to assess whether the CR rate with a given arm was sufficient to merit investigation in phase II. Thirty-seven patients, median age 58 years, were treated. Their median first CR duration was 28 weeks and 24% were primary refractory. Grade 3-4 mucositis occurred in the initial patients in the topotecan --> VP-16, but not in the topotecan + ara-C or VP-16 --> topotecan arms. Consequently, in subsequent patients, the topotecan dose was lower in the topotecan --> VP-16 than in the other 2 arms (1.0 vs 1.25 mg/m2 daily x 5) and the VP-16 dose was lower in the topotecan --> VP-16 arm (200 vs 250 mg/m2 twice daily x 2). One CR occurred (topotecan --> VP-16 arm), and the treatment arms were terminated after 10, 15, and 12 patients were treated on the topotecan + ara-C, topotecan --> VP-16, and VP-16 --> topotecan arms, respectively. The principal cause of failure was insufficient anti-leukemia effect rather than death on study, and toxicity was minimal at the final doses used.

Liposomal encapsulation of anthracyclines has been proposed as a way of decreasing toxicity and probably increasing efficacy of these agents, therefore allowing the exploration of high-dose anthracycline therapy in acute leukemias. We conducted a phase I study of liposomal daunorubicin (Daunoxome; DNX) in patients with refractory or relapsed acute leukemias.

Twenty-four patients were included and 23 are evaluable. Fifteen patients received one course, seven received two courses, and one received three courses of DNX. Seventeen patients had previously received anthracyclines.

All Class 1 compounds exhibited activity comparable to cisplatin in mouse leukemia L1210 cells, but were at least 8-fold more active against the cisplatin-resistant L1210/R line. The lead compound 1a (R=p-HC6F4) caused nearly complete tumour regression in the ADJ/PC6 mouse tumour model. Compound 1a exhibited similar DNA reactivity to cisplatin, resulting in virtually identical DNA sequence specificity as cisplatin, and had similar time and concentration dependency of interstrand crosslinks. Compared with cisplatin, la showed 3-fold greater cellular uptake into human ovarian carcinoma 2008 cells, and this was dramatically enhanced to 17-fold in the cisplatin-resistant 2008/R line. The activity of 1a, therefore, appears to be due at least in part to a greater cellular uptake into tumour cells, particularly cisplatin-resistant cells, and once in the cell it reacts with DNA in a similar manner to that of cisplatin. The enhanced uptake and enhanced cytotoxicity of Class 1 compounds, and 1a in particular, may be due to a greater hydrophobicity compared with cisplatin. The activity of the Class 2 compounds, especially in the cisplatin-resistant cell lines, is unusual because they have trans amine ligands, and further study of both classes of compounds is warranted.","['Talarico, T', 'Phillips, D R', 'Deacon, G B', 'Rainone, S', 'Webster, L K']","['Talarico T', 'Phillips DR', 'Deacon GB', 'Rainone S', 'Webster LK']","['Pharmacology and Developmental Therapeutics Unit, Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Autoradiography', 'Binding Sites', 'Cisplatin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'DNA Adducts/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drugs, Investigational/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1999;17(1):1-15. doi: 10.1023/a:1006263917610.,,,['10.1023/a:1006263917610 [doi]'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Drugs, Investigational)', '0 (cisplatin-DNA adduct)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We examined the IL-17-induced NO production in human OA chondrocytes, in combination with the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF); the antiinflammatory cytokines IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13; and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). Further, we explored the major intracellular signaling pathways through which IL-17 induced iNOS expression and NO production. RESULTS: Treatment with IL-17 induced a dose-dependent increase in the level of NO. When IL-17 was combined with the above factors, it resulted in a synergistic effect with TNF alpha, an additive effect with LIF, and no further effect than when used alone with IL-1beta. IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, and IL-1Ra had no true effect on IL-17-induced NO production. The cAMP mimetics, 3-isobutyl-1-methyl xanthine plus forskolin, completely blocked IL-17-induced NO production. KT-5720, genistein, and Calphostin C, inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA), tyrosine kinase, and protein kinase C, respectively, reduced the IL-17-induced NO production by 72%, 56%, and 42%, respectively. Within minutes, IL-17 induced the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1/2 (MEK-1/2), -3/6 (MKK-3/6), p44/42, p38, and inhibitor of nuclear factor kappaB (I kappaB)-alpha, as well as the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-1 and -2 (MAPKAPK-1 and -2). Interestingly, IL-17 induced phosphorylation of the stress-activated protein kinase/Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) (p54/46) only when PKA was inhibited. Specific protein kinase inhibitors for MEK-1/2 (PD98059), p38 (SB202190), and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate) each markedly decreased the IL-17-increased iNOS level and NO production. Inhibiting MAPK, including MEK-1/2 and p38, had no effect on the IL-17-induced activation of IkappaB-alpha, but reversed the IL-17 activation of MAPKAPK-1 and -2, respectively. CONCLUSION: These findings show that the stimulation of NO production by IL-17 is mediated mainly by a complex activation of kinases, especially PKA, NF-kappaB, and MAPK. NF-kappaB appears to require MAPK activation, with downstream activation of MAPKAPK probably acting as a transactivating factor, to induce iNOS expression.","['Martel-Pelletier, J', 'Mineau, F', 'Jovanovic, D', 'Di Battista, J A', 'Pelletier, J P']","['Martel-Pelletier J', 'Mineau F', 'Jovanovic D', 'Di Battista JA', 'Pelletier JP']","[""Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, Hopital Notre-Dame, Quebec, Canada.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,IM,"['Aged', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chondrocytes/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-17/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/*biosynthesis', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'Osteoarthritis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/physiology', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 1999 Nov;42(11):2399-409. doi: 10.1002/1529-0131(199911)42:11<2399::AID-ANR19>3.0.CO;2-Y.,,,['10.1002/1529-0131(199911)42:11<2399::AID-ANR19>3.0.CO;2-Y [doi]'],"['0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the clinical and histologic findings of 16 skin biopsies from 11 patients with culture-proven infections by M. haemophilum. The patients had leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Ten of them had undergone bone marrow transplantation. When the skin biopsy specimens were taken, a portion of the skin was simultaneously submitted to a microbiology laboratory for cultures. The remaining skin was processed routinely. Acid-fast bacilli were found in 11 of 16 lesions. The number of histologically detectable organisms was typically low: nine biopsies had fewer than three bacilli per 50 oil immersion fields. The most common histologic pattern was a mixed suppurative and granulomatous reaction (7 of 16 biopsies). Four biopsies showed well-formed epithelioid granulomas. Two showed necrosis, one of which was ulcerated. One lesion was a subcutaneous abscess. Two biopsies showed a mixed lichenoid and granulomatous dermatitis. In one of them, the granulomatous reaction was focal and small. One biopsy lacked a granulomatous tissue reaction altogether; it showed an interface dermatitis, a perivascular and periadnexal lymphocytic infiltrate, and necrotizing lymphocytic small vessel vasculitis. A subsequent biopsy from the same patient additionally showed a focal granulomatous reaction. Our observation that infections by M. haemophilum can present with nongranulomatous or pauci-granulomatous reactions without necrosis is of note. Failure to suspect mycobacterial infection in such reactions contributes to probable underreporting of M. haemophilum and to misdiagnoses. Furthermore, our findings emphasize the importance of simultaneous biopsies for culture and histology in immunocompromised patients.","['Busam, K J', 'Kiehn, T E', 'Salob, S P', 'Myskowski, P L']","['Busam KJ', 'Kiehn TE', 'Salob SP', 'Myskowski PL']","['Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycobacterium Infections/*pathology', '*Mycobacterium haemophilum', 'Tuberculosis, Cutaneous/*pathology']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1999 Nov;23(11):1379-85. doi: 10.1097/00000478-199911000-00008.,,,['10.1097/00000478-199911000-00008 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the cases of 58 patients, 34 males and 24 females, aged 7 to 92 years (mean, 57 years), who had lymphoma involving the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses. Thirty-three patients had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Twenty-three were male and 10 were female, with an age range of 7 to 91 years (mean, 63 years); two were HIV-positive. Only 2 of 11 cases tested (one in an HIV-positive patient and one of lymphomatoid granulomatosis type) were Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive. Thirty (91%) involved paranasal sinuses, 10 with nasal involvement, whereas three cases had nasal, but not sinus, involvement. At last follow-up, 16 (67%) were free of disease 7 to 169 months later (mean, 65 months), and 8 (33%) had died of disease 2 to 166 months later (mean, 45 months). Seventeen patients had nasal-type natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma. There were 10 women and 7 men, aged 27 to 78 years (mean, 48 years). Thirteen of 14 were EBV-positive. Sixteen patients had nasal involvement, eight with sinus involvement. Eleven (73%) of 15 were alive and well 6 to 321 months later (mean, 139 months), three (20%) died of lymphoma 1, 11, and 12 months later, and one (7%) is alive with disease. There was one case each of marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, Burkitt-like lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma of unspecified type, and adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia. In an additional three cases, the lymphomas were composed predominantly of large cells, but no immunophenotyping could be performed for subclassification. In 19 cases (17 DLBCLs, 1 Burkitt-like lymphoma, and 1 lymphoma of uncertain lineage), presenting symptoms included complaints related to the eyes. In 16 cases (13 DLBCLs, 1 Burkitt-like lymphoma, 1 nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma, and 1 lymphoma of uncertain lineage), the orbit was invaded by lymphoma. In our series, the most common lymphoma to arise in the sinonasal area is DLBCL, followed by nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Comparison of these two types of lymphoma showed that lymphomas involving sinuses without nasal involvement were predominantly DLBCLs (20 of 21), whereas nasal cavity lymphomas without sinus involvement were usually NK/T-cell type (8 of 11) (p = 0.000125). Compared with patients with DLBCL, patients with nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma were overall younger, with a lower male-to-female ratio. Lymphomas of B-cell lineage were more likely to be associated with symptoms related to the eyes (p < 0.0005) and to have extension to the orbit (p < 0.01) than were lymphomas of T- or NK-cell lineage. In contrast to results of Asian studies in which nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma has a very poor prognosis, our nasal NK/T-cell lymphomas had an outcome similar to that of DLBCL.","['Cuadra-Garcia, I', 'Proulx, G M', 'Wu, C L', 'Wang, C C', 'Pilch, B Z', 'Harris, N L', 'Ferry, J A']","['Cuadra-Garcia I', 'Proulx GM', 'Wu CL', 'Wang CC', 'Pilch BZ', 'Harris NL', 'Ferry JA']","['Departamento de Patologia, Hospital de Oncologia, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Segura Social, Mexico City.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Prognosis']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1999 Nov;23(11):1356-69. doi: 10.1097/00000478-199911000-00006.,,,['10.1097/00000478-199911000-00006 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose can inhibit tumor promotion by teleocidin. We investigated the effects of penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose and various tea polyphenols on cell viability in human leukemia HL-60 cells. In this study, we demonstrated that penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose was able to induce apoptosis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner; however, other polyphenols were less effective. We further investigated the molecular mechanisms of penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose-induced apoptosis. Treatment with penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose caused induction of caspase-3/CPP32 activity in dose- and time-dependent manner, but not caspase-1 activity, and induced the degradation of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Pretreatment with acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (Ac-DEVD-CHO) and Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl-ketone (Z-VAD-FMK) inhibited penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose-induced DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, treatment with penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose (50 microM) caused a rapid loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into cytosol, and subsequent induction of procaspase-9 processing. Our results indicate that penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose allows caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease to enter the nucleus and degrade chromosomal DNA, and induces DFF-45 (DNA fragmentation factor) degradation. These results lead to a working hypothesis that penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose-induced apoptosis is triggered by the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, procaspase-9 processing, activation of caspase-3, degradation of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and DNA fragmentation caused by the caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease through the digestion of DFF-45. The induction of apoptosis by penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose may provide a pivotal mechanism for its cancer chemopreventive action.","['Pan, M H', 'Lin, J H', 'Lin-Shiau, S Y', 'Lin, J K']","['Pan MH', 'Lin JH', 'Lin-Shiau SY', 'Lin JK']","['Institute of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,IM,"['Acridine Orange', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Hydrolyzable Tannins', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Subcellular Fractions/drug effects', 'Tannins/*pharmacology']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 1999 Sep 24;381(2-3):171-83. doi: 10.1016/s0014-2999(99)00549-x.,,,"['S0014-2999(99)00549-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-2999(99)00549-x [doi]']","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Hydrolyzable Tannins)', '0 (Tannins)', '14937-32-7 (beta-penta-O-galloyl-glucose)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)', 'F30N4O6XVV (Acridine Orange)']",['DOH-HR-403/HR/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) abnormal bone marrow precursors contribute to blood monocyte development but DC development has not been studied previously. Monocytes comprised 60% of blood MNC in 15 CMML patients studied, compared with 20% in 16 age-matched controls. The increase in blood monocytes was accompanied by a reciprocal decrease in mean blood DC percentage (from 0.42% of MNC in normal individuals to 0.16% of MNC in CMML patients). Absolute blood DC numbers showed a minimal (non-significant) reduction from 9.8 x 10(6)/l in normal individuals to 7.5 x 10(6)/l in CMML patients. The CD14(low) WCD16+ monocyte subpopulation was not found in CMML patients. After culture in GM-CSF/IL-4, CMML CD14+ monocytes acquired the phenotype of immature monocyte derived DC (Mo-DC) with similar yields to normal blood Mo-DC generation. Addition of TNF-alpha or LPS induced both normal and CMML Mo-DC to express prominent dendritic processes, the CMRF44+ and CD83+ antigens and high levels of HLA-DR, CD80 and CD86. Treatment either with TNF-alpha or LPS increased the allostimulatory activity of normal Mo-DC, but had little effect on the allostimulatory activity of CMML Mo-DC, perhaps reflecting the underlying neoplastic changes in monocyte precursors.

The detection of leukaemia-associated genetic markers in CD34-positive progenitor cells in a subset of B-CLL patients suggests that malignant transformation in B-CLL occurs in an immature progenitor cell compartment. To further quantify the percentage of B-CLL patients with genetically aberrant progenitor cells we have investigated CD34+ bone marrow cells in 11 B-CLL patients at the single cell level by simultaneous genetic and immunophenotypic analysis (FICTION). In five patients with trisomy 12, CD34+ haemopoietic progenitor cells were detectable on bone marrow smears. In one patient with trisomy 12, CD34+ progenitor cells were isolated by FACS sorting. In all six patients trisomy 12 was not found in the CD34+ cells. Progenitor cells were also analysed in three patients with Rb-deletion and in two patients with deletion of p53. In all patients the genetic marker was not detected in the CD34+ cells. In conclusion, we did not find genetically aberrant progenitor cells in this group of B-CLL patients.

Recently the CALM gene was cloned from the t(10;11) breakpoint of U937 and fused to AF10, a putative transcription factor, which had been identified as one of the fusion partners of the MLL gene. In order to define the involvement of these genes in primary leukaemias and cell lines with t(10;11), we analysed the expression of fusion transcripts by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in five patient samples including ALL, AML and lymphoblastic lymphoma, and three monocytic cell lines (P31/Fujioka, KP-Mo-TS and U937). The CALM-AF10 fusion transcript was detected in all samples; however, the AF10-CALM fusion was not detected in two patient samples and one cell line. In RT-PCR analysis there were six isoforms of the CALM-AF10 fusion transcripts and five of AF10-CALM fusion transcripts. We also detected novel transcripts in U937. Sequence analysis revealed that all these isoforms had in-frame junctions and that some of them resulted from alternative splicing at different exons of CALM and others from different breakpoints at CALM and/or AF10. There were at least two different breakpoints of CALM and three of AF10 gene. Our results suggest that the CALM-AF10 fusion gene is a constant feature and is involved in the pathogenesis of haematological malignancies with t(10;11)(p13-14;q14-21), showing various and often multilineage phenotypes.

FA also belongs to a group of chromosome instability diseases. Because telomeres are directly involved in chromosomal stability and in cell proliferation capacity, we examined telomere metabolism in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Telomere length was significantly shorter in 54 FA patient samples, compared to 51 controls (P<0.0001). In addition, mean telomere terminal restriction fragment lengths (TRF) in nine heterozygous patient samples did not differ from those of controls. In 14 samples from FA patients with severe aplastic anaemia (SFA), telomere length was significantly shorter than in 22 samples of age-matched FA patients with moderate haematological abnormalities (NSFA) (P<0.001). However, no correlation was found between TRF length and the presence of bone marrow clonal abnormalities in 16 additional, separately analysed, patient samples. Sequential measurement of TRF in six FA patients showed an accelerated rate of telomere shortening. Accordingly, telomere shortening rate was inversely correlated with clinical status. Telomerase, the enzyme that counteracts telomere shortening, was 4.8-fold more active in 25 FA patients than in 15 age-matched healthy controls. A model for the FA disease process is proposed.","['Leteurtre, F', 'Li, X', 'Guardiola, P', 'Le Roux, G', 'Sergere, J C', 'Richard, P', 'Carosella, E D', 'Gluckman, E']","['Leteurtre F', 'Li X', 'Guardiola P', 'Le Roux G', 'Sergere JC', 'Richard P', 'Carosella ED', 'Gluckman E']","['Service de Recherches en Hemato-Immunologie, DSV/DRM, CEA, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France. leteurtre@dsvidf.cea.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Fanconi Anemia/enzymology/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/enzymology', 'Male', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Telomere/enzymology/*genetics']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Jun;105(4):883-93. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01445.x.,,,['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01445.x [doi]'],['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

My- and My+ ALL did not significantly differ in sensitivity to prednisolone, dexamethasone, L-asparaginase and cytarabine.

Therefore the nature of drug resistance in My+ ALL remains unknown. The lack of prognostic value for My+ in childhood ALL may be explained by the responsiveness of My+ ALL to glucocorticoids, L-asparaginase and cytarabine.

AREAS OF REVIEW: Three major topics are reviewed. They include the following: (1) the role of chemotherapy in the treatment of malignant and nonmalignant disease in young women, the types of chemotherapy and their gonadal effects (differing between ovaries and testes) in both human and other species, and the reasons for differences in the outcomes of various studies; (2) the human experience with GnRH-agonist therapy for minimizing chemotherapy-associated gonadotoxicity; and (3) inhibin measurements in young women treated by chemotherapy and in perimenopausal patients and those with impending premature ovarian failure (POF). Whereas egg retrieval for in vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo cryopreservation is a valid assisted reproductive technology (ART) for married couples, it may be unacceptable for the young single woman. The investigational endeavors of ovarian cryopreservation awaits the clinical experience of in vitro maturation of thawed primordial follicles, their IVF, and embryo transfer. Although promising, this experience is not yet available. Moreover, the risk of possible reimplantation of malignant stem cells with the thawed cryopreserved ovary has been raised after animal observations. Therefore, until these innovative endeavors prove successful, and in parallel with them, an attempt was made to minimize the gonadotoxic effect of chemotherapy by the cotreatment with a GnRH agonistic analogue (GnRH-a) to induce a temporary prepubertal milieu, because prepubertal ovaries were found more resistant to alkylating agents' effect than the ovaries of older women. To characterize the correlation with ovarian function after gonadotoxic chemotherapy for Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma in young women, the immunoreactive inhibin-A concentrations in the sera of these patients were measured before, during, and after the gonadotoxic chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The GnRH-a cotreatment should be considered in every woman in the reproductive age receiving chemotherapy, in addition to ART and the investigational attempts of ovarian cryopreservation for future in vitro maturation or reimplantation. If these preliminary data are confirmed in a larger group of patients, inhibin-A concentrations may serve as a prognostic factor for predicting the resumption of ovarian function in addition to the levels of FSH, LH, and estradiol.","['Blumenfeld, Z', 'Avivi, I', 'Ritter, M', 'Rowe, J M']","['Blumenfeld Z', 'Avivi I', 'Ritter M', 'Rowe JM']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Rambam Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel. bzeev@techunix.technion.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Soc Gynecol Investig,Journal of the Society for Gynecologic Investigation,9433806,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Routes', 'Female', 'Fertility/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibins/metabolism', 'Ovary/*drug effects', 'Primary Ovarian Insufficiency/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Receptors, LHRH/agonists']",1999/11/11 00:00,1999/11/11 00:01,['1999/11/11 00:00'],"['1999/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Soc Gynecol Investig. 1999 Sep-Oct;6(5):229-39. doi: 10.1016/s1071-5576(99)00028-3.,,,"['S1071-5576(99)00028-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s1071-5576(99)00028-3 [doi]']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, LHRH)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)']",,,,125,,,,,,,,,

Light scatter differences between nonviable and viable cells are unreliable, particularly after the cell permeabilization step that is necessary for DNA staining. We developed a method for identification of nonviable cells by fluorescence in cell preparations that are stained simultaneously for cell surface or intracellular immunofluorescence and DNA content. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nonviable cells that have lost membrane integrity are identified by uptake of 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD). Transfer of 7-AAD from stained nonviable cells to unstained viable cells after permeabilization is prevented by blocking DNA binding with nonfluorescent actinomycin D (AD). Pyronin Y(G) (PY) is used for DNA staining because the orange spectral emission of PY can be separated from the green fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) emission and the red emission of 7-AAD, respectively. RESULTS: Application of the method to the analysis of the T-cell leukemia cell line Molt-4f and of cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells is presented. In both cell preparations, 7-AAD staining permitted reliable dead cell exclusion. Live, 7-AAD-negative Molt-4f cells showed higher expression levels of cell surface CD4 and of intracellular CD3, showed a higher proportion of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and showed a lower coefficient of variation of the G1 peak compared with data obtained from all the cells in the preparation. Live, CD8+ lymphocytes from OKT3-stimulated cultures of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed a specific proliferative response as measured by DNA content analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that cells stained with FITC-labeled antibodies can be analyzed by single-laser flow cytometry for DNA content combined with dead cell discrimination. Furthermore, they emphasize the need for exclusion of dead cells from the analysis of cell preparations with low viability to obtain reliable data on immunofluorescence and cell-cycle distributions.","['Schmid, I', 'Ferbas, J', 'Uittenbogaart, C H', 'Giorgi, J V']","['Schmid I', 'Ferbas J', 'Uittenbogaart CH', 'Giorgi JV']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA. schmid@mednet.ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Cell Death', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Coloring Agents/analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Dactinomycin/analogs & derivatives/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Fluorescent Dyes/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Phenotype', 'Propidium/analysis', 'Pyronine/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/cytology']",1999/11/30 09:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/11/30 09:00'],"['1999/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1999 Jan 1;35(1):64-74. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19990101)35:1<64::aid-cyto9>3.3.co;2-p.,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19990101)35:1<64::AID-CYTO9>3.0.CO;2-Y [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19990101)35:1<64::aid-cyto9>3.3.co;2-p [doi]']","['0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', '7240-37-1 (7-aminoactinomycin D)', 'W659G165T1 (Pyronine)']","['AI-28697/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-29341/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, difficulties remain in cases of highly contracted chromosomes, poor quality of the metaphases or the presence of markers with the involvement of several chromosomes. Here, it is demonstrated that reverse painting can be applied successfully starting with bone marrow cells from primary acute myelocytic leukemias (AML). METHODS: This was accomplished by culturing the leukemic cells with a cocktail of various growth factors, which yielded sufficient numbers of cells in cycle to harvest chromosomes for sorting. Aberrant chromosomes were flow-sorted and amplified by degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR. The resulting products were labeled by nick-translation and hybridized on normal metaphase spreads. RESULTS: Two patients with marker chromosomes in their leukemia cells were analyzed in detail. The hybridization pattern displayed the composition of the aberrant sorted chromosome. Results were compared with conventional cytogenetic analyses that were performed on material obtained from the same aspirate. The reverse-painting technique enabled identification of aberrations that were not detected by conventional cytogenetic analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Primary AML cells can be cultured in vitro, using optimal culture conditions, facilitating the production of high quality flow karyotypes, suitable for sorting of marker chromosomes to produce DOP-PCR derived chromosome painting probes for reverse painting. Valuable additional cytogenetic information can thus be obtained about complex chromosomal rearrangements or structural aberrations that could not be completely resolved by conventional cytogenetic analysis.","['Arkesteijn, G', 'Jumelet, E', 'Hagenbeek, A', 'Smit, E', 'Slater, R', 'Martens, A']","['Arkesteijn G', 'Jumelet E', 'Hagenbeek A', 'Smit E', 'Slater R', 'Martens A']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Chromosome Painting/*methods', 'Chromosomes/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1999/12/20 09:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/12/20 09:00'],"['1999/12/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/12/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1999 Feb 1;35(2):117-24. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19990201)35:2<117::aid-cyto2>3.0.co;2-l.,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19990201)35:2<117::AID-CYTO2>3.0.CO;2-L [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19990201)35:2<117::aid-cyto2>3.0.co;2-l [doi]']",['0 (Genetic Markers)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we evaluated the Bcl-2 content and synthesis in relation with the apoptotic potential in leukemic cell lines after anthracycline treatment. METHODS: U937, HL60, and K562 cells and their drug resistant (DR) variants were treated with varying concentrations of Idarubicin (IDA). Apoptosis was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy after acridine orange staining. Bcl-2 and Bax content were evaluated either by flow cytometry after indirect immunolabelling or by Western blot. RESULTS: High Bcl-2 contents were not related to a poor ability to undergo apoptosis in U937, HL60, K562 and their DR variants. IDA induced a concentration-dependent increase in Bcl-2 content in all cell lines as long as they do not perform apoptosis. Enhanced Bcl-2 expression was inhibited by cycloheximide, actinomycin D, or antisense oligonucleotide directed against bcl-2 mRNA. Bcl-2 expression was also increased in the resistant U937 variant after serum deprivation or C2-ceramide treatment. The synthesis of Bcl-2 led to an increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio solely in the cells with an apoptosis-resistance phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that exposure to IDA induces Bcl-2 expression in leukemic cell lines, and that this mechanism could contribute to apoptosis resistance and participate in the acquisition of chemoresistance. They also confirm that the evolution of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio reflects apoptotic ability better than the steady state level of Bcl-2 expression.","['Durrieu, F', 'Belaud-Rotureau, M A', 'Lacombe, F', 'Dumain, P', 'Reiffers, J', 'Boisseau, M R', 'Bernard, P', 'Belloc, F']","['Durrieu F', 'Belaud-Rotureau MA', 'Lacombe F', 'Dumain P', 'Reiffers J', 'Boisseau MR', 'Bernard P', 'Belloc F']","[""Laboratoire Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite Victor Segalen, Bordeaux, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Ceramides/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1999/11/30 09:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/11/30 09:00'],"['1999/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1999 Jun 1;36(2):140-9. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19990601)36:2<140::aid-cyto8>3.0.co;2-p.,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19990601)36:2<140::AID-CYTO8>3.0.CO;2-P [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19990601)36:2<140::aid-cyto8>3.0.co;2-p [doi]']","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assure the safety of pharmaceutical proteins, validation of the ability of manufacturing process to clear retrovirus-like particles is required for product registration. Xenotropic murine leukemia virus (X-MuLV) is often used as a model virus for validation studies. Some chromatography procedures used for pharmaceutical protein purification utilize low pH (< pH 4.0) elution buffers which readily inactivate X-MuLV. Therefore, cell-based infectivity assays are unable to evaluate the physical removal of X-MuLV by these chromatography procedures. To distinguish viral inactivation by low pH treatment from viral removal by chromatography, a quantitative competitive reverse transcription PCR method capable of quantifying both infectious and non-infectious X-MuLV has been developed. This method quantifies X-MuLV particles in chromatography pools by quantifying the X-MuLV particle RNA (pRNA). The difference between the amount of X-MuLV pRNA in the load pool and the product-containing elution pool represents the extent of X-MuLV removal. This method is an extremely powerful complement to cell based-infectivity assays as it allows physical removal of X-MuLV by chromatography and filtration procedures to be distinguished from X-MuLV inactivation when buffers with the ability to inactivate retrovirus are used.","['Lau, A S', 'Lie, Y S', 'Norling, L A', 'Sernatinger, J', 'Dinowitz, M', 'Petropoulos, C J', 'Xu, Y']","['Lau AS', 'Lie YS', 'Norling LA', 'Sernatinger J', 'Dinowitz M', 'Petropoulos CJ', 'Xu Y']","['Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Biotechnol,Journal of biotechnology,8411927,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CHO Cells/*virology', 'Chromatography/methods', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",1999/12/20 00:00,1999/12/20 00:01,['1999/12/20 00:00'],"['1999/12/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/12/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/12/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biotechnol. 1999 Oct 8;75(2-3):105-15. doi: 10.1016/s0168-1656(99)00152-2.,,,"['S0168-1656(99)00152-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-1656(99)00152-2 [doi]']","['0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction of graft-versus-malignancy as primary therapy.,"1041-57, vii-viii","An immune-mediated graft-versus-malignancy effect is important to prevent relapse after allogeneic bone marrow transplant for a range of hematologic malignancies and potentially some solid tumors. Graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects as seen in response to donor lymphocyte infusions have been most prominent against indolent malignancies including chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and low-grade lymphoma. Acute myelogenous leukemia and multiple myeloma may also respond. An alternative strategy for allogeneic transplantation is to avoid the toxicity of high-dose chemoradiotherapy and use a relatively nontoxic, nonablative preparative regimen to achieve engraftment, allowing subsequent infusion of additional donor lymphocytes to mediate GVL. Fludarabine-based nonablative chemotherapy agents, using standard dose combinations, produce moderate myelosuppression but are sufficiently immunosuppressive to allow engraftment of an allogeneic hematopoietic transplant and generation of graft-versus-malignancy effects.","['Champlin, R', 'Khouri, I', 'Kornblau, S', 'Marini, F', 'Anderlini, P', 'Ueno, N T', 'Molldrem, J', 'Giralt, S']","['Champlin R', 'Khouri I', 'Kornblau S', 'Marini F', 'Anderlini P', 'Ueno NT', 'Molldrem J', 'Giralt S']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA. rchampli@mdacc.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm', '*Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1999/11/30 00:00,1999/11/30 00:01,['1999/11/30 00:00'],"['1999/11/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,"Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 1999 Oct;13(5):1041-57, vii-viii. doi: 10.1016/s0889-8588(05)70108-8.",,,"['S0889-8588(05)70108-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0889-8588(05)70108-8 [doi]']","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",,,,113,,,,,,,,,

Blast cells immunophenotyping is a key test in this issue, yet the information provided by immunophenotyping has become staggering, and it may be difficult to identify relevant characteristics clearly. This manuscript provides a critical review of the literature regarding the importance of immunophenotyping in acute leukemia diagnosis and management. DATA SOURCES AND METHODS The information given here is based on the experience of the authors, on their literature files and on additional material retrieved through articles and reviews covered by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) and the Medline database. Studies with proper definition of the patients and sufficient information regarding follow-up were considered. RESULTS: Immunophenotyping allows an early confirmation of AL diagnosis and establishes lineage assignment. Adequate and comprehensive panels of monoclonal antibodies also allow detection of aberrant immunophenotypic profiles of prognostic value or of use in detecting minimal residual disease. A number of unusual immunophenotypic features are also associated with prognosis. The development of new antibodies, new insights in the functional properties of differentiation antigens, and the quantimetric approach of immunophenotyping will keep this field changing. Moreover, as therapeutic protocols evolve, some earlier results need to be reconsidered. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Immunophenotyping, together with cytologic, karyotypic and molecular approaches, retains a crucial place in the diagnosis and management of acute leukemias. It remains a rather specialized approach and should be interpreted in a multidisciplinary perspective, considering for each patient the idiosyncrasies possibly relevant to prognosis.","['Bene, M C', 'Bernier, M', 'Castoldi, G', 'Faure, G C', 'Knapp, W', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Matutes, E', 'Orfao, A', ""van't Veer, M""]","['Bene MC', 'Bernier M', 'Castoldi G', 'Faure GC', 'Knapp W', 'Ludwig WD', 'Matutes E', 'Orfao A', ""van't Veer M""]","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie du CHU, Faculte de Medecine de Nancy, BP 184, 54500 Vandoeuvre les Nancy, France. bene@grip.u-nancy.fr.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/immunology']",1999/12/20 00:00,1999/12/20 00:01,['1999/12/20 00:00'],"['1999/12/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/12/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/12/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 Nov;84(11):1024-34.,,,,,,,,110,,,,,,,,,

Results of the CML89 trial of the Spanish Collaborative Group on interferon-alpha2a and CML.",978-87,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Interferon-a (IFN) is increasingly being used as the drug of choice in chronic myeloid leukemia patients. The main objectives of the study were to study the influence of the classic prognostic variables and response to IFN, and to assess the influence of this response on the course of the disease and survival. DESIGN AND METHODS: Single arm, prospective, multicenter study, without a control group. Only Ph1-positive CML patients were included. The treatment scheme was biphasic: the patients first received standard chemotherapy and thereafter IFN-a2a was used as monotherapy, with a target dose of 9 MU/d/s.c. RESULTS: Twenty-one centers in Spain enrolled 132 patients (72 men, 60 women). The median dose of IFN given was 5.8 MU/d, and the median treatment duration was 431 days (range: 18-2,597). Seventy-two percent of patients obtained a hematologic response in the first six months of IFN treatment. Genetic response was obtained in 47% of the patients, and the response was major or complete in 27% and 19%, respectively. The median time to obtain this response was 7, 9, and 18 months for minimal, partial and complete genetic response, respectively. Multivariant analysis showed that only a higher percentage of basophils at diagnosis was associated with a worse hematologic response at six months (p=0.001) (OR: 1.23) and with a worse cytogenetic response in the first year of IFN therapy (p=0.018) (OR: 1.4). Over an observation period of 8 years, 35.6% of the patients died, and 85 (64.4%) remained alive. With a median follow-up of 42 months (3.7-98), the 6-year projected probabilities of survival and transformation-free survival were 0.61+/-0.07 vs. 0.54+/-0.07, respectively. Patients with Kantarjian's stage 3 disease or in a high-risk Sokal group had lower probabilities of survival, but these systems did not adequately discriminate in our series. Obtaining a complete hematologic response in the first six months of IFN therapy was favorable in terms of overall survival (p=0.05; HR=0.33). Cox's analysis demonstrated that obtaining a cytogenetic response in the first year was independently associated with better overall survival (p=0.04; HR=0.19) and better transformation-free survival (p=0.0035; HR=0.11). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of the patients obtained some degree of Philadelphia suppression, which was major in 27%, and complete in 19%. A higher percentage of basophils at diagnosis was the only variable associated with a lower probability of cytogenetic response. Obtaining a cytogenetic response during the first year of IFN treatment was a favorable and independent variable in terms of survival and transformation-free survival. Obtaining a major cytogenetic response during this period decreased the risk of transformation twenty times. Our results suggest that the effect of IFN on survival is independent of the classic prognostic variables.","['Steegmann, J L', 'Odriozola, J', 'Rodriguez-Salvanes, F', 'Giraldo, P', 'Garcia-Larana, J', 'Ferro, M T', 'Benitez, E', 'Perez-Pons, C', 'Giralt, M', 'Escribano, L', 'Lavilla, E', 'Miguel, A', 'Areal, C', 'Perez-Encinas, M', 'Abad, A', 'Maldonado, J', 'Massague, I', 'Fernandez-Ranada, J M']","['Steegmann JL', 'Odriozola J', 'Rodriguez-Salvanes F', 'Giraldo P', 'Garcia-Larana J', 'Ferro MT', 'Benitez E', 'Perez-Pons C', 'Giralt M', 'Escribano L', 'Lavilla E', 'Miguel A', 'Areal C', 'Perez-Encinas M', 'Abad A', 'Maldonado J', 'Massague I', 'Fernandez-Ranada JM']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital de la Princesa, Diego de Leon 62, 28006 Madrid, Spain. fundsteeg@nexo.es.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Basophils/*pathology', 'Child', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Hematologic Tests', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Survival Rate', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/12/20 00:00,1999/12/20 00:01,['1999/12/20 00:00'],"['1999/12/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/12/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/12/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 Nov;84(11):978-87.,,,,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are no data on the effects of cryopreservation on the expression of the three CD34 epitope classes, and on their relationship with the clonogenic capacity of PBPC collected by leukapheresis. DESIGN AND METHODS: In order to analyze the effects of freezing/thawing procedures (Eth 80C storage for 3 months) and use of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) on the immunophenotype profile and colony production of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) in apheresis products derived from 20 patients with stage 0-III non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (nHL), a flow cytometry study was undertaken using different CD34 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) capable of recognizing the 3 epitope classes of CD34 molecule (class III: HPCA-2/FITC, HPCA-2/PE, 581/FITC, 581/PE; class II: Q-Bend 10/PE; class I: ICH3/PE, BI3C5-PE, Immu-133-PE). CD34 epitope expression was also analyzed in thawed CD34+ blasts obtained from 14 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who were analyzed using a larger number (#17) of CD34 epitope class I, II, and III reactive MoAbs. RESULTS: Under our experimental conditions it was found that class III and class II CD34 epitopes (differentially resistant to enzymatic cleavage with neuraminidase, chymopapain and glycoprotease) are better preserved than class I epitope Eth sensitive to degradation Eth after cell exposure to cryoprotectant DMSO and the freezing- thawing procedures. Results further showed a concomitant decrease in class I CD34+ counts and in BFU-E colony production. A significant increase in CD34 antigen expression levels (i.e. antibody binding capacity, ABC) by cryopreserved cells stained with CD34 epitope class III, and class II reactive MoAbs was also documented, while no changes after cryopreservation were noted using class I-reactive MoAbs. The slight increase in the percentage of CD34+ cells detected after frozen storage was correlated to a concomitant decrease in the number of more mature myeloid cells (CD15+, CD13+, CD33+). Compared to pre-cryopreservation values, a slight reduction in class I CD34 epitope expression was also found in thawed CD34+ AML blasts. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: As far as the reduction of class I CD34 epitope is concerned, it may be hypothesized that the freezing procedure, use of DMSO, and/or lysis methodology may either damage a CD34 subset, or induce distinct alterations of the CD34 glycoprotein, possibly determining a reduction in their immunoreactivity with some CD34 MoAbs. In conclusion, this study has shown that exposure to the cryoprotectant DMSO and the freezing/thawing procedures modifies the distribution of CD34 epitopes as well as the clonogenic capacity of PBPCs from nHL patients, and CD34+ blasts from AML. These findings need to considered when selecting CD34 MoAbs for enumeration and positive selection of stem/progenitor cells for research and clinical purposes.","['Lanza, F', 'Moretti, S', 'Castagnari, B', 'Montanelli, F', 'Latorraca, A', 'Ferrari, L', 'Bardi, A', 'Dominici, M', 'Campioni, D', 'Dabusti, M', 'Piva, N', 'Lodi, G', 'Reverberi, R', 'Castoldi, G']","['Lanza F', 'Moretti S', 'Castagnari B', 'Montanelli F', 'Latorraca A', 'Ferrari L', 'Bardi A', 'Dominici M', 'Campioni D', 'Dabusti M', 'Piva N', 'Lodi G', 'Reverberi R', 'Castoldi G']","['Hematology Section, Dept. of Biomedical Sciences and Advanced Therapies, University of Ferrara, St. Anna Hospital, corso Giovecca 203, 44100 Ferrara, Italy.

All-trans retinoic acid probably induces differentiation of atypical promyelocytes and clinical remission in APL patients by binding to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the RARa portion of the PML-RARa chimeric protein. Structural alterations of the LBD of the PML/RARa have been revealed in ATRA-resistant APL cell lines and in a few APL patients with acquired clinical resistance to ATRA therapy. Two APL relapsed patients with clinical resistance to ATRA therapy were evaluated for the presence of nucleotide mutations in the LBD of PML/RARa gene and then treated with arsenic trioxide (As2O3). DESIGN AND METHODS: DNA fragments from the LBD of the PML/RARa chimeric transcript were obtained by reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequencing was performed by an unambiguous bi-directional automatic analysis. Samples representative of APL onset and relapse were analyzed from both patients. RESULTS: In both patients, at the ATRA-resistant relapse, a missense point mutation in the LBD of the PML/RARa gene was found. The mutations, absent at APL onset, led to an Arg272Gln and to an Arg276Trp amino acid substitution, according to the sequence of the RARa protein. Both patients had complete clinical and hematologic remission after treatment with As2O3. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: LBD missense mutations appear to be a significant mechanism of acquired ATRA-resistance in vivo, closely related to clinical APL relapse.

To elucidate roles of autoimmunity in the development of arthritis, the immune cells were reciprocally replaced between pX-Tg mice and non-transgenic (Tg) mice. When bone marrow (BM) cells and spleen cells from pX-Tg mice were transferred into irradiated non-Tg mice, arthritis developed in these mice. In contrast, arthritis in pX-Tg mice was completely suppressed by non-Tg BM and spleen cells. Similar results were obtained with BM cells only. After the transplantation, T cells, B cells, and macrophages were replaced completely, whereas cells in the joints were replaced partially. In those mice, serum Ig and rheumatoid factor levels correlated with the disease development, and inflammatory cytokine expression was elevated in the arthritic joints. Furthermore, involvement of T cells in the joint lesion was suggested, because the incidence was greatly reduced in athymic nu/nu mice although small proportion of the mice still developed arthritis. These observations suggest that BM stem cells are abnormal, causing autoimmunity in pX-Tg mice, and this autoimmunity plays an important, but not absolute, role in the development of arthritis in this Tg mouse.","['Saijo, S', 'Kotani, M', 'Habu, K', 'Ishitsuka, C', 'Yamamoto, H', 'Sekiguchi, T', 'Iwakura, Y']","['Saijo S', 'Kotani M', 'Habu K', 'Ishitsuka C', 'Yamamoto H', 'Sekiguchi T', 'Iwakura Y']","['Center for Experimental Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Arthritis/genetics/*immunology/*prevention & control', 'Autoimmune Diseases/genetics/*immunology/*prevention & control', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/prevention & control', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/blood', 'Joints/metabolism/virology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/metabolism/virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Radiation Chimera/immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics', 'Rheumatoid Factor/blood', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transgenes/immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Nov 15;163(10):5700-7.,,,['ji_v163n10p5700 [pii]'],"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (pX protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '9009-79-4 (Rheumatoid Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two distinct PLD isoforms, designated PLD1 and PLD2, have been cloned; however, the regulatory mechanism for each PLD isoform is not clear. In our present study we investigated how PLD2 activity is regulated in mouse lymphocytic leukemia L1210 cells, which mainly contain PLD2, and in PLD2 -transfected COS-7 cells. Intriguingly, A23187, a calcium ionophore that induces calcium influx, potently stimulates PLD activity in these two cell lines, suggesting that Ca2+ might be implicated in the regulation of the PLD2 activity. In addition to the A23187-induced PLD2 activation, A23187 also increases PLA2-mediated arachidonic acid release, and the A23187-stimulated PLD2 and PLA2 activities could be blocked by pretreatment of the cells with cytosolic calcium-dependent PLA2 (cPLA2) inhibitors, such as arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone and methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate in these two cell lines. Moreover, the A23187-induced PLD2 and PLA2 activities could be inhibited by cotransfection with antisense cPLA2 oligonucleotide. These results suggest a role for cPLA2 in the regulation of PLD2 activity in vivo. The inhibitory effect of arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone on the A23187-induced PLD2 activity could be recovered by addition of exogenous lysophosphatidylcholine. This study is the first to demonstrate that PLD2 activity is up-regulated by Ca2+ influx and that cPLA2 may play a key role in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of PLD2 through generation of lysophosphatidylcholine.","['Kim, J H', 'Lee, B D', 'Kim, Y', 'Lee, S D', 'Suh, P G', 'Ryu, S H']","['Kim JH', 'Lee BD', 'Kim Y', 'Lee SD', 'Suh PG', 'Ryu SH']","['National Creative Research Initiative Center for Calcium and Learning, Department of Life Science, School of Environmental Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Arachidonic Acids/pharmacology', 'COS Cells', 'Calcimycin/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cytosol/*enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Leukemia P388', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Lysophosphatidylcholines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Phospholipase D/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Nov 15;163(10):5462-70.,,,['ji_v163n10p5462 [pii]'],"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Lysophosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '00XIW1CR0F (arachidonyltrifluoromethane)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (phospholipase D2)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Individually applied, antagonists of TNF, LT-alpha1beta2, or FasL fully inhibited NK cell-mediated apoptotic killing of tumor cells. On the other hand, recombinant TNF, LT-alpha1beta2, or FasL applied individually or as pairs were not cytotoxic. In contrast, a mixture of the three ligands mediated significant apoptosis in tumor cells.

Elimination of CD25-expressing T cells, which constitute 5-10% of peripheral CD4+ T cells in normal naive mice, elicited potent immune responses to syngeneic tumors in vivo and eradicated them. The responses were mediated by tumor-specific CD8+ CTLs and tumor-nonspecific CD4-8- cytotoxic cells akin to NK cells. Furthermore, in vitro culture of CD25+4+ T cell-depleted splenic cell suspensions prepared from tumor-unsensitized normal mice led to spontaneous generation of similar CD4-8- cytotoxic cells capable of killing a broad spectrum of tumors; reconstitution of CD25+4+ T cells inhibited the generation. In this culture, self-reactive CD25-4+ T cells responding to self peptides/class II MHC complexes on APCs spontaneously proliferated upon removal of CD25+4+ T cells, secreting large amounts of IL-2. The IL-2 thus produced appeared to be responsible for the generation of CD4-8- NK cells as lymphokine-activated killer cells, because direct addition of an equivalent amount of IL-2 to the culture of CD4-8- cells generated similar lymphokine-activated killer/NK cells, whereas coculture of normal CD4-8- cells with CD25-4+ T cells from IL-2-deficient mice did not. Thus, removal of immunoregulatory CD25+4+ T cells can abrogate immunological unresponsiveness to syngeneic tumors in vivo and in vitro, leading to spontaneous development of tumor-specific effector cells as well as tumor-nonspecific ones. This novel way of evoking tumor immunity would help to devise effective immunotherapy for cancer in humans.","['Shimizu, J', 'Yamazaki, S', 'Sakaguchi, S']","['Shimizu J', 'Yamazaki S', 'Sakaguchi S']","['Department of Immunopathology, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*immunology', 'CD4 Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Melanoma, Experimental/*immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*immunology/therapy', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Nov 15;163(10):5211-8.,,,['ji_v163n10p5211 [pii]'],"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND RESULTS: Randomly primed complementary (cDNA) is synthesized from leukocyte RNA and amplified in the presence of Taq Gold in 2 separate reaction tubes containing primer pairs specific for intron 3 (bcr 3, long [L] form mRNA transcript) and intron 6 (bcr 1, short [S] form)/exon 6 (bcr 2, variant [V] form) breakpoints in PML, respectively. The different sized products generated from each RNA transcript (S, L, or V forms) are readily and unambiguously distinguishable after agarose gel electrophoresis without the need for either nested PCR or hybridization. The sensitivity of the assay is 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100,000. The separate amplification of a b2-microglobulin transcript controls for adequate RNA and cDNA preparation. The newly developed assay was used clinically for the evaluation of 78 patients with APL. It was rapid and more sensitive than cytogenetic karyotyping, both for the diagnosis of APL and the assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD) after therapy. RT-PCR detected PML-RARa mRNA in all cases positive for the t(15;17) translocation by cytogenetics. However, as many as 50% and 80% of the diagnostic specimens and the specimens for MRD assessment, respectively, that were positive by RT-PCR were negative by cytogenetics. The ratio of cases with L-form to S-form PML-RARa fusion transcript was 2:1, whereas 3 cases (10%) had fusion sites in exon 6 of the PML gene (V forms). In addition, approximately 50% of the patients were diagnosed morphologically with microgranular M3V-type leukemia, but no significant correlation with PML breakpoints was found.

Nevertheless, many patients either do not have a complete remission or ultimately relapse. To identify such patients, it is important to be able to predict the outcome. We previously found that the differentiation inhibitory factor/nm23 was correlated with the prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia. To examine the prognostic effect of nm23 on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, we established an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedure to determine nm23-H1 protein levels in plasma and assessed the association of this protein level with the response to chemotherapy, overall survival, and progression-free survival in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The plasma concentration of nm23-H1 was significantly higher in patients with malignant lymphoma than in normal controls, especially in aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The complete remission rate in patients with higher nm23-H1 levels was significantly worse than that in patients with lower nm23-H1 levels. Overall survival and progression-free survival were also lower in patients with higher nm23-H1 levels than in those with lower levels. The 3-year survival rates in patients with low and high nm23-H1 levels were 79.5% and 6. 7% (P =.0001). A multivariate analysis of prognostic factors showed that the plasma nm23-H1 level was independently associated with the survival and progression-free survival. An elevated plasma nm23-H1 concentration predicts a poor outcome of advanced non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Therefore, nm23-H1 in plasma may be useful for identifying a distinct group of patients at very high risk.","['Niitsu, N', 'Okabe-Kado, J', 'Kasukabe, T', 'Yamamoto-Yamaguchi, Y', 'Umeda, M', 'Honma, Y']","['Niitsu N', 'Okabe-Kado J', 'Kasukabe T', 'Yamamoto-Yamaguchi Y', 'Umeda M', 'Honma Y']","['Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*blood/diagnosis/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases', '*Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcription Factors/*blood']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Nov 15;94(10):3541-50.,,,['S0006-4971(20)71001-3 [pii]'],"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (NME1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

If these antileukemia CTL are to be used for adoptive immunotherapy, they must have the capability to circulate, migrate through endothelium, home to the bone marrow, and, most importantly, lyse the leukemic cells in a leukemia-permissive bone marrow microenvironment. We demonstrate here that such antileukemia T-cell lines are overwhelmingly CD8(+) and exhibit an activated phenotype. Using a transendothelial chemotaxis assay with human endothelial cells, we observed that these T cells can be recruited and transmigrate through vascular and bone marrow endothelium and that these transmigrated cells preserve their capacity to lyse leukemic cells. Additionally, these antileukemia T-cell lines are capable of adhering to autologous stromal cell layers. Finally, autologous antileukemia CTL specifically lyse leukemic cells even in the presence of autologous marrow stroma. Importantly, these antileukemia T-cell lines do not lyse autologous stromal cells.

B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) frequently express low to undetectable surface Ig, as well as CD79b protein. Recent work described genetic aberrations affecting B29 expression and/or function in B-CLL. Because the prevalence of CLL is increased among first degree relatives, we analyzed the B29 gene in 10 families including 2 affected members each. A few silent or replacement mutations were observed at the genomic level, which never lead to truncated CD79b protein. Both members of the same family did not harbor the same mutations. However, a single silent base change in the B29 extracellular domain, corresponding to a polymorphism, was detected on 1 allele of most patients. These results indicate that the few mutations observed in the B29 gene in these patients do not induce structural abnormalities of the CD79b protein and thus do not account for its low surface expression in B-CLL. Furthermore, genetic factors were not implicated, because identical mutations were not observed among 2 members of the same family.","['Payelle-Brogard, B', 'Magnac, C', 'Mauro, F R', 'Mandelli, F', 'Dighiero, G']","['Payelle-Brogard B', 'Magnac C', 'Mauro FR', 'Mandelli F', 'Dighiero G']","[""Unite d'Immunohematologie et d'Immunopathologie, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/*genetics', 'CD79 Antigens', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Nov 15;94(10):3516-22.,,,['S0006-4971(20)70995-X [pii]'],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79B protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the mechanism of the CD80/CD28 costimulation has been studied extensively in the normal T-cell/antigen-presenting cell (APC) interactions, it is unclear how expression of CD80 by tumor cells mediates its effect. We demonstrate here that optimal CD80 expression on a leukemic cell enhances T-cell recognition of alloantigen primarily by lowering the level of T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation required for activation. CD80 expression by leukemic cells leads to increased survival of activated T cells by inducing upregulation of the antiapoptotic protein BCL-2, but not BCL-X(L). The cytokine microenvironment in which T cells are activated is crucial in determining their differentiation and consequently the nature of the immune response generated. Many tumor cells produce immunosuppressive cytokines that may not favor the induction of cell-mediated immunity. In this study, the presence of CD80 on leukemic cells increased T-cell activation in vitro, but this did not result in the production of Th1 cytokines. We show that this is due to a leukemia-derived soluble factor that inhibits the production of Th1 cytokines. Optimal expression of a costimulatory molecule, therefore, enhances the ability of leukemic cells to present antigen by amplifying TCR signals, but the microenvironment generated by leukemic cells may suppress the immune response required for their eradication. Thus, strategies aimed at inducing antileukemic immunity by providing leukemic cells with costimulatory functions must ensure the presence of an appropriate microenvironment.","['Buggins, A G', 'Lea, N', 'Gaken, J', 'Darling, D', 'Farzaneh, F', 'Mufti, G J', 'Hirst, W J']","['Buggins AG', 'Lea N', 'Gaken J', 'Darling D', 'Farzaneh F', 'Mufti GJ', 'Hirst WJ']","[""Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/*immunology/metabolism', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'CD28 Antigens/physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology/physiology', 'Th1 Cells/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Nov 15;94(10):3479-90.,,,['S0006-4971(20)71015-3 [pii]'],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Platelets are reported to contain FXI activity that may substitute for the plasma protein. The presence of this platelet activity in some patients deficient in plasma FXI could partly explain the variable bleeding associated with the deficiency state. Polyclonal antibodies to plasma FXI recognize a 220 kD platelet membrane protein distinct in structure from plasma FXI. The messenger RNA (mRNA) coding for this protein has been postulated to be an alternatively spliced FXI message lacking the fifth exon found in the liver (wild type) message. We analyzed RNA from platelets, leukocytes, and bone marrow for FXI mRNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology. Single FXI mRNA species were identified by RT-PCR in platelet and bone marrow RNA, but not leukocyte RNA, that are the same size as the message from liver RNA. Sequencing of PCR products confirmed that the FXI mRNA species in platelets is identical to the one in liver. Wild-type FXI mRNA was also identified in three leukemia cell lines with megakaryocyte features (MEG-01, HEL 92.1.7, and CHRF-288-11). The data show that platelets contain wild-type FXI mRNA. FXI protein, therefore, may be present in platelets and may be released during platelet activation. The data do not support the premise that the 220 kD platelet protein that cross-reacts with FXI antibodies is a product of an alternatively spliced mRNA from the FXI gene.","['Martincic, D', 'Kravtsov, V', 'Gailani, D']","['Martincic D', 'Kravtsov V', 'Gailani D']","['Departments of Pediatrics, Pathology, and Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232-6305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Blood Platelets/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Factor XI/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Quality Control', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/11/24 00:00,1999/11/24 00:01,['1999/11/24 00:00'],"['1999/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Nov 15;94(10):3397-404.,,,['S0006-4971(20)71007-4 [pii]'],"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9013-55-2 (Factor XI)']","['HL02917/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL58837/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We have now compared expression of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) from a vector using the MoMuLV LTR (LeGFPSN) with that from the modified vector (MNDeGFPSN) in mature hematopoietic and lymphoid cells in the mouse bone marrow transplant (BMT) model. In primary BMT recipients, we observed a higher frequency of expression from the MND LTR (20% to 80%) in hematopoietic cells of all lineages in spleen, bone marrow, thymus, and blood compared with expression from the MoMuLV LTR (5% to 10%). Expression from the MND LTR reached 88% in thymic T lymphocytes and 54% in splenic B lymphocytes for up to 8 months after BMT. The mean fluorescence intensity of the individual cells, indicating the amount of protein synthesized, was 6- to 10-fold higher in cells expressing MNDeGFPSN compared with cells expressing LeGFPSN. Transduction efficiencies determined by DNA polymerase chain reaction of vector copy number were comparable for the 2 vectors.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis in both newly diagnosed and relapsed groups showed long-term use of As2O3 could lead to a molecular remission in some patients.

TEL-AML1 gene fusion due to chromosomal translocation is frequently seen in the common form of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We investigated whether this abnormality arises prenatally. METHODS: We identified, by reverse-transcriptase PCR screening of blood or bone marrow, TEL-AML1 fusion in 12 children, plus a pair of identical twins, aged 2-5 years from Italy and the UK, who had newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We amplified and sequenced the genomic TEL-AML1 fusion gene with a long-distance inverse PCR method. Primers were designed that could be used in short-range PCR to screen for patient-specific, leukaemia clone-specific TEL-AML1 genomic fusion sequences in neonatal blood spots from each child. FINDINGS: We initially identified TEL-AML1 fusion sequences in blood spots from the identical twins, diagnosed with concordant acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at age 4 years, who shared a single or clonotypic TEL-AML1 sequence that suggested prenatal origin in one twin. Three children were excluded because control genes could not be amplified. Of the other nine patients, six had positive blood spots. Blood spots that were classified as negative were uninformative. INTERPRETATION: Our findings showed that childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is frequently initiated by a chromosome translocation event in utero. Studies in identical twins show however that such an event is insufficient for clinical leukaemia and that a postnatal promotional event is also required.","['Wiemels, J L', 'Cazzaniga, G', 'Daniotti, M', 'Eden, O B', 'Addison, G M', 'Masera, G', 'Saha, V', 'Biondi, A', 'Greaves, M F']","['Wiemels JL', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Daniotti M', 'Eden OB', 'Addison GM', 'Masera G', 'Saha V', 'Biondi A', 'Greaves MF']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/*embryology/*genetics', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Diseases in Twins/genetics', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood/genetics', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",1999/11/07 00:00,1999/11/07 00:01,['1999/11/07 00:00'],"['1999/11/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1999 Oct 30;354(9189):1499-503. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(99)09403-9.,,"['Lancet. 1999 Oct 30;354(9189):1486-7.

Risk of transplacental transmission of MuLV raises concerns of embryo infection and induction of pathogenic effects, and postnatal MuLV infection may lead to tumorigenesis. METHODS: Endogenous ecotropic MuLV-negative SWR/J embryos were implanted into Akv-infected viremic SWR/J mice, into spontaneously provirus-expressing AKR/J mice, and into noninfected SWR/J control mice; virus integration and virus expression were investigated at 14 days' gestation. Tumor development was monitored over 18 months. RESULTS: Of 111 embryos, 20 (18%) recovered from Akv-infected SWR/J mice, which had developed normally, were infected. New proviruses were detected in 10 of 111 (9%) embryos from Akv-infected SWR/J mice, and in 2 of 60 (3%) embryos from AKR/J mice; none expressed viral protein. Of 127 embryos recovered from Akv-infected SWR/J mice, 16 (13%) were dead; 4 of 5 (80%) were infected and expressed viral protein. Of 71 embryos from AKR/J mice, 11 (15%) were dead, and 2 of 2 had virus integration; virus expression was not detected. Numbers of dead embryos recovered from experimentally infected, viremic SWR/J mice and from spontaneously endogenous MuLV-expressing AKR/J mice were significantly higher, compared with numbers from nonviremic SWR/J control mice, and embryo lethality was significantly associated with prenatal provirus expression. Postnatal inoculation of Akv induced lymphoblastic lymphomas in 15 of 24 (61%) SWR/J mice within mean +/- SD latency of 14 +/- 2.4 months. Only 3 of 39 (8%) control mice developed lymphomas (P < 0.005). CONCLUSION: Embryos in MuLV-viremic dams are readily infected, and inappropriate prenatal expression of leukemogenic endogenous retroviruses may play a critical role in embryo lethality and decreased breeding performance in ecotropic provirus-positive mouse strains.","['Hesse, I', 'Luz, A', 'Kohleisen, B', 'Erfle, V', 'Schmidt, J']","['Hesse I', 'Luz A', 'Kohleisen B', 'Erfle V', 'Schmidt J']","['Institute of Molecular Virology, GSF-National Research Center for Environment and Health, Neuherberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lab Anim Sci,Laboratory animal science,1266503,IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn/virology', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Embryo Transfer', 'Embryo, Mammalian/virology', 'Female', 'Fetal Death/virology', 'Gestational Age', '*Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Leukemia/*veterinary/virology', 'Mice', 'Pregnancy', 'Retroviridae Infections/transmission/*veterinary', 'Rodent Diseases/transmission/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/transmission/*veterinary']",1999/11/07 00:00,1999/11/07 00:01,['1999/11/07 00:00'],"['1999/11/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lab Anim Sci. 1999 Oct;49(5):488-95.,,,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Involvement of the skin is relatively uncommon. We examined retrospectively the clinicopathologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular genetic features of six patients with cutaneous involvement of LBL (B-LBL=5; T-LBL=1). Patients presented clinically with solitary, large tumors located on the head (3 cases) or the back (1 case), or with generalized tumors (2 cases). Ulceration was uncommon. In two patients the onset of skin lesions was concomitant to the diagnosis of lymphoblastic leukemia. Histopathologic examination showed in all cases a dense, diffuse, monomorphous infiltrate located in the entire dennis and subcutaneous fat. A typical ""starry sky"" pattern was observed in the majority of the lesions. In some areas neoplastic cells were aligned in a ""mosaic-like"" fashion. Cytomorphologically, medium sized lymphoid cells with round or convoluted nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli and scant cytoplasm predominated. There were no significant differences in the histopathologic features of skin lesions in T- and B-LBL. In B-LBL, CD79a was more useful than CD20 in determining the phenotype of neoplastic cells (4/5 cases positive for CD79a as compared to 2/5 cases positive for CD20). TdT, CD10 and CD43 were positive in 4 cases, CD34 in 2. The case of T-LBL revealed positivity for CD1a, CD3, CD43 and TdT, and negativity for CD34 and for B-cell markers. All neoplasms were positive for CD99 and bcl-2, and showed a high proliferation rate. Molecular genetic analysis of J(H) and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes performed using a polymerase chain reaction technique revealed a monoclonal rearrangement of J(H) genes in all five B-LBLs. One of these cases showed also a concomitant TCR-gamma gene rearrangement. A monoclonal rearrangement of the TCR-gamma gene was detected in the case of T-LBL. Our study shows that skin lesions of LBL present characteristic clinicopathologic and molecular features allowing the differentiation from other cutaneous lymphomas, even in cases without clinical history of previous precursor lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.","['Chimenti, S', 'Fink-Puches, R', 'Peris, K', 'Pescarmona, E', 'Putz, B', 'Kerl, H', 'Cerroni, L']","['Chimenti S', 'Fink-Puches R', 'Peris K', 'Pescarmona E', 'Putz B', 'Kerl H', 'Cerroni L']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Graz, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Skin/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",1999/11/07 00:00,1999/11/07 00:01,['1999/11/07 00:00'],"['1999/11/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 1999 Sep;26(8):379-85. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0560.1999.tb01861.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1600-0560.1999.tb01861.x [doi]'],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of cells with TGF-beta1 in the absence of growth factors significantly enhanced cell viability. Flow cytometric analysis of DNA content and CD14 expression revealed that TGF-beta1 does not affect cell proliferation and differentiation. Consistent with these results was the finding that no transcriptional induction of Cdk inhibitors such as p21Waf1, p15Ink4b, and p27Kip1 was detected following TGF-beta1 treatment. Interestingly, however, pretreatment of TGF-beta1 significantly inhibited Fas-, DNA damage-, and growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis. This antiapoptotic effect was totally abrogated by anti-TGF-beta1 antibody. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated a dose- and time-dependent transcriptional up-regulation of Bcl-X(L), suggesting its implication in the TGF-1-mediated antiapoptotic pathway. We also observed elevated expression of c-Fos and PTEN/MMAC1. But, no detectable change was recognized in expression of c-Jun, Fas, Fadd, Fap-1, Bcl-2, and Bax. Taken together, our study shows that TGF-beta1 enhancement of cellular viability is associated with its antiapoptotic effect, which may result from the transcriptional up-regulation of Bcl-X(L).","['Lee, J', 'Park, B J', 'Park, J H', 'Yang, M H', 'Chi, S G']","['Lee J', 'Park BJ', 'Park JH', 'Yang MH', 'Chi SG']","['Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea.

Recently, another birch pollen protein with an apparent mass of 35 kd was described as a new IgE-binding protein in birch pollen with cross-reacting homologues in plant foods. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the primary structure of the 35-kd birch pollen allergen and to investigate its immunologic properties. METHODS: On the basis of a known complementary DNA fragment, a PCR strategy was applied to obtain the full-length nucleotide sequence of the coding region. The protein was expressed as His-Tag fusion protein in Escherichia coli and purified by Ni-chelate affinity chromatography. Nonfusion protein was obtained by cyanogen bromide treatment of the fusion protein. IgE-binding characteristics and potential allergenicity were investigated by immunoblot, immunoblot inhibition analysis, rat basophil leukemia-cell mediator release assay, and basophil histamine release and compared with those of natural (n) Bet v 5, recombinant (r)Bet v 1, and rBet v 2. RESULTS: Recombinant Bet v 5 has a mass of 33 kd, an isoelectric point of 9.0, and sequence identity of 60% to 80% to isoflavone reductase homologue proteins from various plants. On immunoblots the recombinant Bet v 5 bound IgE from 9 (32%) of 28 sera from patients allergic to birch pollen with a CAP class of at least 3; Bet v 1 was detected by 89% of these patients. IgE immunoblot and inhibition experiments showed that nBet v 5 and rBet v 5 shared identical epitopes. A rabbit antiserum raised against pea isoflavone reductase and patients' IgE reacted with Bet v 5 and proteins of similar size in several vegetable foods, including exotic fruits. A similar reaction pattern was obtained with 2 Bet v 5-specific mAbs. Furthermore, Bet v 5 triggered a dose-dependent mediator release from rat basophil leukemia 2H3 cells passively sensitized with murine anti-birch pollen IgE and from basophils of a Bet v 5-reactive subject with birch pollen allergy. In contrast, no mediator release could be induced from basophils of a subject who was monosensitized to Bet v 1. CONCLUSIONS: This 33-kd protein, designated as Bet v 5, is a new minor allergen in birch pollen and may be responsible for pollen-related oral allergy to specific foods in a minority of patients with birch pollen allergy. Amino acid sequence comparison and immunoreactivity to anti-isoflavone reductase serum indicate that Bet v 5 is related to isoflavone reductase, a protein family that is involved in plant defense reactions.","['Karamloo, F', 'Schmitz, N', 'Scheurer, S', 'Foetisch, K', 'Hoffmann, A', 'Haustein, D', 'Vieths, S']","['Karamloo F', 'Schmitz N', 'Scheurer S', 'Foetisch K', 'Hoffmann A', 'Haustein D', 'Vieths S']","['Department of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,IM,"['Allergens/classification/genetics/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Plant', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cross Reactions', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Fruit/immunology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoglobulin E/blood/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Oxidoreductases/classification/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', '*Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors', 'Plant Extracts/immunology', 'Plant Proteins/classification/genetics/*immunology/isolation & purification', '*Pollen', 'Rats', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', '*Trees']",1999/11/07 00:00,1999/11/07 00:01,['1999/11/07 00:00'],"['1999/11/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 1999 Nov;104(5):991-9. doi: 10.1016/s0091-6749(99)70080-1.,,,"['S0091-6749(99)70080-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0091-6749(99)70080-1 [doi]']","['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Plant)', '0 (Bet v 5 protein, Betula pendula)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.348 (vestitone reductase)', 'EC 1.3.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors)']",,,,,,['GENBANK/AF135127'],,,,,,,

Three cDNA clones encoding different portions of the human equivalent of bovine BLVRcp1 were isolated by DNA-DNA hybridization by comparison of the human cDNA clones to bovine BLVRcp1. Amino acid sequence indicated that the human sequence encodes the delta subunit of the AP-3 adaptor-related protein. When the recombinant human homologue BLVRcp2 was expressed in E. coli, it failed to bind the BLVgp51. However, the BVLVgp51 binding ability was restored when the chimerical BLVRcp molecule was prepared by exchanging 5' ends between bovine and human BLVRcp cDNAs. This finding implies that this BLVgp51 binding site is present only on the bovine BLVRcp and therefore its human homologue cannot be recognized by BLVgp51.

Both areas of paediatric oncology research focus on cancers with a broad range of sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, together with concerns about the neurodevelopmental, neuroendocrine and growth outcomes of survivors. These considerations have influenced the design of curative- intent treatments, strategies for successfully eradicating leptomeningeal disease, and the importance of anatomic and functional identification of residual disease. Unlike the situation with childhood leukaemia, the emotional barriers of pessimism or even nihilism previously evident towards infants with brain tumours have only begun to crumble during the past decade. The challenge to improve both the quality and overall survival of infants with CNS tumours described in this chapter is ours to meet as we move into the new millennium. This paper examines the development of 'infant' approaches to the treatment of CNS tumours, including a discussion of epidemiology, the reasons for avoiding or delaying radiation therapy, and traces the chemotherapy hypotheses tested over the past two decades in the process of developing potentially curative therapy. The reasons for the disappointing rate of progress compared with that in childhood leukaemia, despite similar clinical research paradigms, are discussed, and potential opportunities are identified.","['Kellie, S J']",['Kellie SJ'],"[""University of Sydney, The New Children's Hospital, Westmead, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. stuartk@nch.edu.au""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Childs Nerv Syst,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,8503227,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy/epidemiology/radiotherapy', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Models, Theoretical']",1999/11/07 00:00,1999/11/07 00:01,['1999/11/07 00:00'],"['1999/11/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Childs Nerv Syst. 1999 Oct;15(10):592-612. doi: 10.1007/s003810050548.,,,"['90150592.381 [pii]', '10.1007/s003810050548 [doi]']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,109,,,,,,,,,

The large tumor cells expressed ALK immunoreactivity with a cytoplasmic and nuclear pattern, whereas some of the small cells showed only a nuclear-restricted pattern of staining. An RT-PCR study detected the NPM-ALK chimeric product in the nodal biopsy and in a peripheral blood sample in the early phase of the disease, but it became negative in a peripheral blood sample obtained after completion of the chemotherapy treatment, suggesting that this assay may be useful in the follow-up of these patients.

The proportion of CD34-positive cells was increased in one of 12 healthy BM samples, in seven of 19 cases at DIA, in one of two cases during PERS, and in three of seven cases in CR of AML. Southern blot analysis (SBA) performed in six cases during the course of AML, before and after cell culture, showed that clonal DNA increased after GM-CSF treatment in three of five cases studied at DIA, in six of nine cases studied in CR, in the one case studied at PERS, and in the one studied at relapse (REL). In one case of trisomy 8 at DIA a normal karyotype was demonstrated in CR. However, after 7 days of cultivation of the cells in GM-CSF the trisomy 8 was detected in two of 17 metaphases isolated from colony-cells from methylcellulose cultures. Our data show that a 7-day treatment of BM cells with GM-CSF induced a differentiation of healthy and leukemic BM cells in the great majority of cases. An enrichment of CD34-positive cells was not achieved in healthy BM samples. However, in 70% of the cases in CR and in 30% of the cases at DIA of AML, clonal CD34-positive cells were enriched.

Therefore, one mechanism of action of IFN-alpha in vivo may involve decreasing endogenous IL 10 secretion (thereby reducing suppressive effects on T cell reactivity) and increasing IL 1beta secretion (thereby enhancing antigen presentation).","['Pawelec, G', 'Schlotz, E', 'Rehbein, A']","['Pawelec G', 'Schlotz E', 'Rehbein A']","['Tubingen Ageing and Tumour Immunology Group, Section for Transplantation Immunology, Second Department of Internal Medicine, Tubingen University Medical School, Tubingen, Germany. graham.pawelec@med.uni-tuebingen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*physiology', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism', 'Interleukin-10/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",1999/11/07 00:00,1999/11/07 00:01,['1999/11/07 00:00'],"['1999/11/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1999 Nov;48(8):430-4. doi: 10.1007/s002620050619.,,,"['90480430.262 [pii]', '10.1007/s002620050619 [doi]']","['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recognition of consistent patterns of genetic alterations.,1419-25,"Putative natural killer (NK) cell lymphoma/leukemia is a rare group of recently characterized hematolymphoid malignancies. They are highly aggressive and frequently present in extranodal sites, including the nasal area and the upper aerodigestive system, and nonnasal areas such as the skin and the gastrointestinal tract. According to clinicopathological features, they can be classified into nasal NK cell lymphoma, nasal-type NK cell lymphoma occurring in nonnasal areas, and NK cell lymphoma/leukemia. Genetic alterations in NK cell lymphoma/leukemia are not well defined. In this study, we have performed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on DNA extracted from fresh or frozen tissues of 10 patients with NK cell lymphoma/leukemia. They comprised four nasal NK cell lymphomas, one nasal-type NK cell lymphoma, and five NK cell lymphomas/leukemias. CGH showed frequent deletions at 6q16-q27 (four cases), 13q14-q34 (three cases), 11q22-q25 (two cases), 17p13 (two cases), and loss of the whole chromosome X (two cases). DNA amplification was observed in a majority of the chromosomes. Five cases showed DNA gains at region 1p32-pter. Frequent DNA gains were also found in chromosomes 6p, 11q, 12q, 17q, 19p, 20q, and Xp (three cases each). Interestingly, DNA gains were more frequent in nasal/nasal-type NK cell lymphomas than NK cell lymphoma/leukemia. These genetic alterations correlated well with karyotypic features found in some of the cases. The frequent DNA losses at 6q and 13q suggest that the presence of tumor suppressor genes at these regions is important in NK cell transformation. In addition to establishing novel patterns of genomic imbalances in these rare NK cell malignancies, which may be targets for future molecular analysis, this study also provides important information on genetic alterations in NK cell lymphomas that may be useful in defining their positions in current lymphoma classification schemes, which are increasingly focusing on phenotypic and genotypic correlations.","['Siu, L L', 'Wong, K F', 'Chan, J K', 'Kwong, Y L']","['Siu LL', 'Wong KF', 'Chan JK', 'Kwong YL']","['Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Karyotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization']",1999/11/07 00:00,1999/11/07 00:01,['1999/11/07 00:00'],"['1999/11/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1999 Nov;155(5):1419-25. doi: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65454-5.,,,"['S0002-9440(10)65454-5 [pii]', '10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65454-5 [doi]']",,,,PMC1866965,,,,,,,,,,

These factors, rather than age per se, underlie the poorer outcome as compared with younger cases. Prospective randomized studies clearly demonstrate, however, that elderly patients benefit from more intensive induction therapy and particularly from full-dose application of anthracyclines and possibly also cytarabine.

B-25 was initiated to determine whether further intensifying and increasing the cyclophosphamide dose would yield more favorable results. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 2,548) were randomly assigned to three groups. The dose and intensity of doxorubicin were similar in all groups. Group 1 received four courses, ie, double the dose and intensity of cyclophosphamide given in the B-22 standard therapy group; group 2 received the same dose of cyclophosphamide as in group 1, administered in two courses (intensified); group 3 received double the dose of cyclophosphamide (intensified and increased) given in group 1. All patients received recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Life-table estimates were used to determine disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed in DFS (P =.20), distant DFS (P =.31), or survival (P =.76) among the three groups. At 5 years, the DFS in groups 1 and 2 (61% v 64%, respectively; P =. 29) was similar to but slightly lower than that in group 3 (61% v 66%, respectively; P = 08). Survival in group 1 was concordant with that in groups 2 (78% v 77%, respectively; P =.71) and 3 (78% v 79%, respectively; P =.86). Grade 4 toxicity was 20%, 34%, and 49% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Severe infection and septic episodes increased in group 3. The decrease in the amount and intensity of cyclophosphamide and delays in therapy were greatest in courses 3 and 4 in group 3. The incidence of acute myeloid leukemia increased in all groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Leukaemias that arose in 3 Gy X-irradiated (CBA/H x C57BL/6)F1 intercross and backcross mice were diagnosed as acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or thymic lymphoma (TL). LOH was determined using 28 polymorphic microsatellite markers distributed over seven chromosomes using control and leukaemic DNA from individual mice. RESULTS: LOH incidences of 0-20% were observed at most loci in both leukaemia types. Specific LOH incidences of 38-76% were observed for myeloid (chromosome 2) and lymphoid (chromosomes 11 and 14) leukaemias. Chromosome 4 LOH was frequently (38-50%) observed in both types, although the commonly deleted regions differed. LOH was detected at either chromosome 2 or 4 in AML and either chromosome 4 or 11 in TL. CONCLUSIONS: LOH incidences of 38-76% suggest a causal role of particular loci which is mainly, but not exclusively, dependent on leukaemia type. LOH incidences of 0-20% at other loci in both leukaemias suggest that many genetic deletions are non-causal and incidental in radiation-leukaemogenesis.","['Cleary, H J', 'Wright, E', 'Plumb, M']","['Cleary HJ', 'Wright E', 'Plumb M']","['MRC Radiation and Genome Stability Unit, Harwell, Didcot, Oxfordshire, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosomes/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology/*genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/etiology/*genetics', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/etiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Microsatellite Repeats']",1999/11/30 00:00,1999/11/30 00:01,['1999/11/30 00:00'],"['1999/11/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 1999 Oct;75(10):1223-30. doi: 10.1080/095530099139377.,,,['10.1080/095530099139377 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data were available from a study of female radiographers. Analyses were carried out on 3053 women with a total of 6993 pregnancies. Women reporting problems with conception or previous fetal losses had an increased risk of a pregnancy ending in a fetal death. In particular, women with primary or secondary infertility had an approximately fourfold increase in risk compared with women who reported no difficulties [odds ratio (OR): 3.92; 95% confidence interval (CI): (3.02, 5.07)]. This relationship was independent of pregnancy order and pregnancy history and was more marked in older maternal ages. The effect of pregnancy history was cumulative and possibly multiplicative in effect, with a threefold increase in the risk of losing a third pregnancy following two previous losses [OR: 3.19; 95% CI: (1.60, 6.35)]. There were no consistent patterns of risk associated with year of pregnancy outcome, maternal age, height or smoking status.

The drug inhibits retroviral reverse transcriptase (RT) [i.e. of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV), murine leukaemia virus (MLV) and mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV)] as efficiently as cellular DNA polymerases (i.e. of both DNA polymerases alpha and beta and Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I). The mode and mechanism of inhibition of the DNA-polymerase activity associated with HIV-1 RT by polycitone A have been studied. The results suggest that the inhibitory capacity of the DNA polymerase activity is independent of the template-primer used. The RNase H function, on the other hand, is hardly affected by this inhibitor. Polycitone A has been shown to interfere with DNA primer extension as well as with the formation of the RT-DNA complex. Steady-state kinetic studies demonstrate that this inhibitor can be considered as an allosteric inhibitor of HIV-1 RT. The target site on the enzyme may be also spatially related to the substrate binding site, since this inhibitor behaves competitively with respect to dTTP with poly(rA).oligo(dT) as template primer. Chemical transformations of the five phenol groups of polycitone A by methoxy groups have a determinant effect on the inhibitory potency. Thus, the pentamethoxy derivative which is devoid of all hydroxy moieties, loses significantly, by 40-fold, the ability to inhibit the DNA polymerase function. Furthermore, this analogue lacks the ability to inhibit DNA primer extension as well as the formation of the RT-DNA complex. Indeed, inhibition of the first step in DNA polymerization, the formation of the RT-DNA complex, and hence, of the overall process, could serve as a model for a universal inhibitor of the superfamily of DNA polymerases.","['Loya, S', 'Rudi, A', 'Kashman, Y', 'Hizi, A']","['Loya S', 'Rudi A', 'Kashman Y', 'Hizi A']","['Department of Cell Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Alkaloids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', '*Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Urochordata/chemistry']",1999/11/05 00:00,1999/11/05 00:01,['1999/11/05 00:00'],"['1999/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1999 Nov 15;344 Pt 1:85-92.,,,,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '0 (polycitone A)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)']",,,PMC1220617,,,,,,,,,,

Telomerase activity is typically assayed using an exogenous primer and cellular extracts as the source of enzyme. Since the nuclear organization might affect telomerase function, we developed a system in which telomerase in intact nuclei catalyzes primer extension. Telomerase activity in isotonically isolated nuclei from human CEM cells shows low processivity (addition of up to four TTAGGG repeats). In contrast, telomerase activity which leaks into a 500 g postnuclear supernatant and the activity in a CHAPS extract are highly processive. The nucleotide inhibitor, 7-deaza-dGTP, seems to be more inhibitory against the nuclei-associated enzyme compared to telomerase from cytoplasmic extracts. However, 7-deaza-dATP and ddGTP are less inhibitory against nuclei-associated telomerase. The results suggest that the association of telomerase with the nuclear chromatin affects telomerase activity. Examination of telomerase activity in a more natural nuclear environment may shed new light on the telomerase function and provide a useful system for the evaluation of new telomerase inhibitors.","['Fletcher, T M', 'Trevino, A', 'Woynarowski, J M']","['Fletcher TM', 'Trevino A', 'Woynarowski JM']","['Institute for Drug Development, 14960 Omicron Drive, San Antonio, Texas, 78245, USA.

Retinoic acid is known to activate ERK2. The present data show that the activation is selective for this MAPK pathway. JNK/SAPK or p38 are not activated by retinoic acid. Presumably because it activates relevant signaling pathways including MAPK, the polyoma middle T antigen, as well as certain transformation defective mutants thereof, is known to promote retinoic acid-induced differentiation, although the mechanism of action is not well understood. The present results show that consistent with the selective involvement of ERK2, ectopic expression of either the polyoma middle T antigen or its dl23 mutant, which is defective for PLCgamma and PI-3 kinase activation, or the delta205 mutant, which in addition is also weakened for activation of src-like kinases, caused no enhanced JNK/SAPK or p38 kinase activity that promoted the effects of retinoic acid. However, all three of these polyoma antigens are known to enhance ERK2 activation and promote differentiation induced by retinoic acid. Polyoma-activated MAPK signaling relevant to retinoic acid-induced differentiation is thus restricted to ERK2 and does not involve JNK/SAPK or p38. Taken together, the data indicate that among the three parallel MAPK pathways, retinoic acid-induced HL-60 myeloid differentiation selectively depends on activating ERK but not the other two MAPK pathways, JNK/SAPK or p38, with no apparent cross talk between pathways. Furthermore, the striking ability of polyoma middle T antigens to promote retinoic acid-induced differentiation appears to utilize ERK, but not JNK/SPK or p38 signaling.","['Yen, A', 'Roberson, M S', 'Varvayanis, S']","['Yen A', 'Roberson MS', 'Varvayanis S']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

The study was based on 610 leukemia-, 198 lymphoma-, and 122 myeloma-induced deaths in 489 towns situated within a 30-km radius of such installations. As control areas, we used 477 towns lying within a 50- to 100-km radius of each installation, matched by population size and a series of sociodemographic characteristics (income level, proportion of active population engaged in farming, proportion of unemployed, percentage of illiteracy, and province). Relative risk (RR) for each area and the trends in risk with increasing proximity to an installation were analyzed using log-linear models. None of the nuclear power plants registered an excess risk of leukemia-induced mortality in any of the surrounding areas. Excess risk of leukemia mortality was, however, observed in the vicinity of the uranium-processing facilities in Andujar [RR, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.64] and Ciudad Rodrigo (RR, 1.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-3.08). Excess risk of multiplemyeloma mortality was found in the area surrounding the Zorita nuclear power plant. Statistical testing revealed that, with the single exception of multiple myeloma, none of the tumors studied showed evidence of a rise in risk with proximity to an installation.

Plasmafiltration in Sepsis Study Group.,2096-104,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of plasmafiltration (PF) on biochemical markers of inflammation, cytokines, organ dysfunction, and 14-day mortality in human sepsis. DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial. SETTING: Seven university-affiliated intensive care units. PATIENTS: Thirty patients (22 adults, eight children) with new (<24 hrs) clinical evidence of infection and sepsis syndrome were enrolled. Fourteen of 30 (nine adults, five children) were randomized to PF. INTERVENTIONS: All patients received protocol-driven supportive intensive care, and those randomized to PF received continuous plasma exchange for 34 hrs using a hollow-fiber plasma filter. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Illness severity and risk of death were calculated with the Pediatric Risk of Mortality (children) and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (adults) scales. Plasma samples (0, 6, 24, and 48 hrs) were assayed for acute-phase proteins (albumin, globulin, C-reactive protein, alpha1-antitrypsin, haptoglobin), inflammatory mediators (complement fragment C3, thromboxane B2), and cytokines (interleukin-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, leukemia inhibitory factor). Sieving coefficients were estimated from filtrate concentrations at 3 hrs. The two groups were matched for incidence of septic shock (13 of 14 vs. 11 of 16), refractory shock (three of 14 vs. six of 16), bacteremia (six of 14 vs. five of 16), severity of illness, and calculated risk of death (0.68 vs. 0.64). There was no difference in mortality. Eight of 14 PF patients (57%) and eight of 16 controls (50%) survived for 14 days (p = .73, Fisher's exact test). Multiple logistic regression revealed age (odds ratio, 16.4:1; 95% confidence interval, 2.12-infinity) and shock (10.6:1; 1.32-infinity) as significant predictors of death; plasmafiltration was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in the risk of death (odds ratio, 1.78:1; 95% confidence interval, 0.20-18.1). The mean (SD) number of organs failing in the first 7 days in the PF group was 2.57 (0.94) vs. 2.94 (0.85) in controls (p = .37, Mann-Whitney U test). Both groups had similarly elevated plasma concentrations of all inflammatory mediators except complement fragment C3 at study entry. Leukemia inhibitory factor was detectable in four patients only. PF did not influence mean concentrations of interleukin-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, thromboxane B2, total white cell count, neutrophil count, or platelet count, but it was associated with significant reductions of alpha1-antitrypsin, haptoglobin, C-reactive protein, and complement fragment C3 in the first 6 hrs (p < .05). The sieving coefficients for all inflammatory mediators approached unity. CONCLUSIONS: PF caused a significant attenuation of the acute-phase response in sepsis. There was no significant difference in mortality, but there was a trend toward fewer organs failing in the PF group that suggests that this procedure might be beneficial.","['Reeves, J H', 'Butt, W W', 'Shann, F', 'Layton, J E', 'Stewart, A', 'Waring, P M', 'Presneill, J J']","['Reeves JH', 'Butt WW', 'Shann F', 'Layton JE', 'Stewart A', 'Waring PM', 'Presneill JJ']","[""Intensive Care Unit, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Crit Care Med,Critical care medicine,0355501,IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Complement C3/metabolism', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Female', 'Hemofiltration/*methods', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', '*Plasma Exchange', 'Prospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Rate', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome/blood/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Thromboxane B2/blood', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/11/05 00:00,1999/11/05 00:01,['1999/11/05 00:00'],"['1999/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Crit Care Med. 1999 Oct;27(10):2096-104. doi: 10.1097/00003246-199910000-00003.,,['Crit Care Med. 1999 Oct;27(10):2287-9.

METHODS: The use of the fluorescent dye 7-amino-actinomycin (7AAD) on unfixed cells to measure loss of viability at a range of cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) doses was evaluated. A six-tube flow cytometric assay for measuring the sensitivity to ara-C of CD45/side-scatter-gated or of CD34-positive leukemic blasts with 7AAD was established, using fixed stained normal mononuclear cells as an internal standard for quantitation of viable cells following culture. RESULTS: 7AAD dose response curves for 10 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) showed a wide range of sensitivities at 2.5-5 microM araC (3.7-97%, mean 54% of control cell viability at 2.5 microM and 4.1-94.6 %, mean 27% at 5 microM). Parallel assays for ATP bioluminescence agreed reasonably well with the 7AAD method, r(s) = 0.78. The chemosensitivity of CD45/SSC-gated blast cells at 2.5 microM araC showed no consistent relationship with the ungated cell populations, such that CD45/SSC-gated blast sensitivity of seven samples ranged from 86% more to 38% less than that of the total population. Similarly, the chemosensitivities of the CD34-gated subpopulations ranged from 51% more to 78% less than those of the total populations. CONCLUSIONS: These results emphasize the necessity of measuring the chemosensitivity of the population of interest rather than of the sample as a whole in heterogeneous clinical material.","['Pallis, M', 'Syan, J', 'Russell, N H']","['Pallis M', 'Syan J', 'Russell NH']","['Department of Haematology, Nottingham City Hospital and University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Antibodies', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis/*immunology', 'Cell Count/methods', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', '*Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis/*immunology', 'Light', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/*pathology', 'Scattering, Radiation', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stem Cells/chemistry/drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/drug effects/pathology']",1999/11/05 00:00,1999/11/05 00:01,['1999/11/05 00:00'],"['1999/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1999 Dec 1;37(4):308-13.,,,['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19991201)37:4<308::AID-CYTO8>3.0.CO;2-Z [pii]'],"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '7240-37-1 (7-aminoactinomycin D)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of FMdC on the cell cycle and cell death of human leukemia lines HL-60 and MOLT-4, and murine leukemia L-1210 in vitro. It has been assumed that a prerequisite of FMdC cytotoxicity is intracellular phosphorylation by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK). METHODS: Cell cultures in the exponential phase of growth were exposed to different concentrations of FMdC (10 nM to 10 microM) for 6 and 24 hours. In a parallel set of experiments 1 mM deoxycytidine was added to prevent phosphorylation of the drug by dCK. The DNA and protein content in the cells, as well as Annexin V/PI binding were assessed by flow cytometry. The cell cycle was analyzed by the MacCycle software. RESULTS: The cytotoxic effects of FMdC, i.e., G(1)/S block and cell death were observed, associated with pronounced changes in the protein content. These effects were of variable intensity among the cell lines studied (HL-60 being the most susceptible), and in some cases, were not completely reversed by deoxycytidine excess. CONCLUSIONS: FMdC is a potent cytotoxic/cytostatic agent against human leukemia cell lines in vitro. It also changes the cellular protein content. Unphosphorylated FMdC may slightly influence the cell cycle of some leukemic lines.","['Skierski, J S', 'Koronkiewicz, M', 'Grieb, P']","['Skierski JS', 'Koronkiewicz M', 'Grieb P']","['Flow Cytometry Laboratory, The Drug Institute, Warsaw, Poland. skierski@il.waw.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Animals', 'Annexin A5/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/chemistry/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Phosphorylation']",1999/11/05 00:00,1999/11/05 00:01,['1999/11/05 00:00'],"['1999/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1999 Dec 1;37(4):302-7. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19991201)37:4<302::aid-cyto7>3.0.co;2-7.,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19991201)37:4<302::AID-CYTO7>3.0.CO;2-7 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19991201)37:4<302::aid-cyto7>3.0.co;2-7 [doi]']","['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'UCC4EQS7WL (tezacitabine)']",,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, Bcl-2 family protein expression was examined in oligodendrogliomas and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, and an attempt was made to determine whether these proteins accumulate during disease progression and to search for protein expression patterns predictive of time to progression and overall survival. METHODS: A total of 42 oligodendroglioma tissue samples, 26 de novo World Health Organization (WHO) Grade 2 oligodendrogliomas, and 16 de novo WHO Grade 3 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas were studied. Nineteen Grade 2 tumors progressed: 10 again were Grade 2 oligodendrogliomas and 8 had progressed to higher grade lesions. Eight anaplastic oligodendrogliomas progressed: five again were WHO Grade 3 tumors and three were glioblastoma multiforme. Expression of Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-X, and Mcl-1 proteins and of the proliferation marker Ki-67 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Apoptotic cells were quantified by in situ nick translation (ISNT). RESULTS: De novo WHO Grade 2 oligodendrogliomas had higher Bcl-2 scores (P = 0.037), lower MIB-1 scores (P = 0.0012), and lower ISNT scores (P = 0.049) compared with de novo WHO Grade 3 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. In de novo oligodendrogliomas, low numbers of Bax positive cells were associated with a short time to disease progression (P = 0.043). In de novo anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, low numbers of Bcl-2 positive cells correlated with short survival (P = 0.029). In tumors that had progressed from WHO Grade 3 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, the authors found significantly more Bcl-X positive (P = 0.005), Mcl-1 positive (P = 0.002), and Bax positive (P = 0.03) cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study show that progression of oligodendrogliomas and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas is associated with an enhanced expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins.","['Deininger, M H', 'Weller, M', 'Streffer, J', 'Meyermann, R']","['Deininger MH', 'Weller M', 'Streffer J', 'Meyermann R']","['Institute of Brain Research, University of Tubingen Medical School, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Apoptosis', 'Brain Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Ki-67 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Oligodendroglioma/genetics/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",1999/11/05 00:00,1999/11/05 00:01,['1999/11/05 00:00'],"['1999/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1999 Nov 1;86(9):1832-9. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19991101)86:9<1832::aid-cncr27>3.0.co;2-a.,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19991101)86:9<1832::AID-CNCR27>3.0.CO;2-A [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19991101)86:9<1832::aid-cncr27>3.0.co;2-a [doi]']","['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",,['Copyright 1999 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate this, the authors reviewed their 20-year institutional experience with CLL patients who also had lung carcinoma. METHODS: The records of patients with diagnoses of both CLL and lung carcinoma seen between January 1977 and July 1998 were reviewed. The data collected included patient demographics, the tumor histology and stage, the type of treatment for both CLL and lung carcinoma, the presence of a third malignancy, the disease status at last follow-up, and the first site of relapse. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: From January 1977 to July 1998, 1329 patients with CLL were seen at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Twenty-six (1.9%) also had lung carcinoma (19 males and 7 females). The median age of patients at the time CLL was diagnosed was 61 years, and for patients with lung carcinoma it was 68 years. Twenty-two patients (85%) were current or former smokers. Histologically, the lung carcinomas included 6 squamous cell carcinomas, 19 nonsquamous carcinomas, and 1 small cell carcinoma. Ten patients (38%) had a third malignancy; these malignancies included melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, laryngeal carcinoma, and colon carcinoma. Thirteen patients underwent surgical resection and 13 were treated nonsurgically for lung carcinoma. A poor performance status precluded surgery for 3 patients with Stage I tumors and limited chemotherapy for all patients with advanced disease. The median survival following the diagnosis of lung carcinoma for patients treated surgically was 25 months, and for those treated nonsurgically it was 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 2% of patients with CLL develop lung carcinoma. In this study, 85% of the patients were smokers. These patients had a high risk of a third primary malignancy. Lung carcinoma was diagnosed a decade after CLL. Patients who develop both diseases die of lung carcinoma and not CLL or other solid tumors. CLL and poor performance status limit treatment, particularly for patients with unresectable lung carcinoma.","['Parekh, K', 'Rusch, V', 'Kris, M']","['Parekh K', 'Rusch V', 'Kris M']","['Thoracic Surgery Service, Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/secondary', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Large Cell/secondary', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/secondary', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/secondary', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology/therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking', 'Survival Rate']",1999/11/05 00:00,1999/11/05 00:01,['1999/11/05 00:00'],"['1999/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1999 Nov 1;86(9):1720-3.,,,['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19991101)86:9<1720::AID-CNCR13>3.0.CO;2-X [pii]'],,,['Copyright 1999 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Using the GM-CSF-dependent TF-1 myeloid leukaemia cell line, the authors show that the endogenous levels of BCL-2 and MCL-1 are downregulated upon GM-CSF withdrawal, whereas the levels of BCL-x(L)and Bax are unchanged. Re-exposure of growth factor deprived cells to GM-CSF resulted in an early and transient increase in MCL-1 expression, and prolonged induction of BCL-2, which prevented apoptosis. In contrast, the expression of BCL-2 and MCL-1 were not modulated during TPA-induced differentiation of TF-1 cells, which was followed by apoptosis despite the presence of GM-CSF. TF-1 cells overexpressing BCL-2 or MCL-1 underwent delayed apoptosis upon growth factor withdrawal, but displayed no impaired apoptosis in response to TPA. Erythropoietin (Epo) induced the expression of BCL-2 and MCL-1 protein in TF-1 cells, however it did not support their long term proliferation, further demonstrating that upregulation of these anti-apoptotic genes is insufficient for the long term proliferation of TF-1 cells.","['Klampfer, L', 'Zhang, J', 'Nimer, S D']","['Klampfer L', 'Zhang J', 'Nimer SD']","['Laboratory of Molecular Aspects of Hematopoiesis, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY, 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/deficiency/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/11/05 00:00,1999/11/05 00:01,['1999/11/05 00:00'],"['1999/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1999 Nov;11(11):849-55. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1999.0514.,,,"['10.1006/cyto.1999.0514 [doi]', 'S1043-4666(99)90514-8 [pii]']","['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",['R01 DK 43502/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,

TGF-beta and VD3 synergistically increased the expression of differentiation-associated markers such as the CD11b and CD14 antigens, whereas TGF-beta and Dex did not. On the other hand, TGF-beta and Dex synergistically increased the number of Apo2.7-positive cells, which represents the early stage of apoptosis, whereas TGF-beta and VD3 did not, suggesting that TGF-beta enhanced apoptosis with Dex and enhanced monocytic differentiation with VD3. In the presence of TGF-beta, the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product, pRb, was synergistically dephosphorylated by Dex as well as VD3. TGF similarly enhanced the expression of the p21Waf1 gene in U937 cells treated with Dex and VD3. TGF-beta dose-dependently increased the expression of Bcl-2 and Bad and decreased the expression of Bcl-X(L) in U937 cells. Dex enhanced the down-regulation of Bcl-X(L) expression in TGF-beta-treated cells, whereas VD3 blocked this down-regulation of Bcl-X(L). However, the down-regulation of Bcl-X(L) by treatment with the antisense oligomer did not affect the apoptosis or differentiation of U937 cells. The apoptosis of CD14-positive cells was suppressed in the VD3 plus TGF-beta-treated cultures. These results suggest that the expression of CD14 is involved in the survival of differentiated cells.","['Kanatani, Y', 'Kasukabe, T', 'Okabe-Kado, J', 'Yamamoto-Yamaguchi, Y', 'Nagata, N', 'Motoyoshi, K', 'Honma, Y']","['Kanatani Y', 'Kasukabe T', 'Okabe-Kado J', 'Yamamoto-Yamaguchi Y', 'Nagata N', 'Motoyoshi K', 'Honma Y']","['Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Ina, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclins/genetics', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/*biosynthesis', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-X Protein']",1999/11/05 00:00,1999/11/05 00:01,['1999/11/05 00:00'],"['1999/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1999 Oct;10(10):705-12.,,,,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is increasing concern regarding toxicity of autologous SCT, especially the higher than expected long-term risk of development of myelodysplastic syndrome.

The recent demonstration that an immunologically mediated graft-versus-leukemia effect plays a central role in delivering the anti-leukemic effect of an allograft has led to a fundamental reevaluation of the role of conditioning therapy in allogeneic transplantation. Recent animal studies have demonstrated that stem cell engraftment can occur using conditioning regimens that are minimally myelotoxic. This has prompted the development of less toxic nonmyeloablative conditioning protocols, the goal of which is to achieve donor stem cell engraftment allowing the graft-versus-tumor effect of the allograft to be exploited as the primary anti-leukemic strategy. Preliminary results using such nonmyeloablative clinical protocols confirm that durable engraftment of allogeneic stem cells can be achieved with a marked reduction in the immediate toxicity of transplantation.

This approach is particularly attractive for biological systems in which direct physical measurement is difficult because of the short lifetime of 1O2. Among the many possible reporter molecules in a target system, cholesterol (Ch) has the advantage of affording a limited number of readily distinguishable oxidation products, among which are the hydroperoxides 3 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-cholest-6-ene-5-hydroperoxide (5 alpha-OOH), 3 beta-hydroxycholest-4-ene-6 alpha-hydroperoxide (6 alpha-OOH) and 3 beta-hydroxycholest-4-ene-6 beta-hydroperoxide (6 beta-OOH) that derive specifically from 1O2 addition. The purpose of this study was to compare these species in terms of (1) rates of accumulation in photodynamically treated liposomal membranes; (2) susceptibility to iron-mediated 1 e- reduction that triggers chain peroxidative damage; (3) susceptibility to selenoperoxidase (phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase [PHGPX])-mediated 2 e- reduction that protects against such damage and (4) relative toxicity to mammalian cells. Our results indicate that 5 alpha-OOH is photogenerated at a much greater initial rate than 6 alpha-OOH or 6 beta-OOH. Although liposomal 5 alpha-OOH, 6 alpha-OOH, and 6 beta-OOH exhibit similar first-order decay kinetics during iron/ascorbate treatment, the former decays much more slowly during GSH/PHGPX treatment, and is more toxic to L1210 cells.

The lung was the primary site in 12 cases, and dissemination was present in three of those. Prior to diagnosis, the overwhelming majority of patients had been profoundly neutropenic for at least 14 days (n = 11 of 13) and were receiving systemic antifungal agents (n = 10 of 13). Clinical signs and symptoms were nonspecific but always included fever. All 11 patients who were diagnosed and treated during lifetime for a minimum of 10 days responded to either medical or combined medical and surgical treatment, and seven were cured (64%). Nevertheless, the overall long-term survival was merely 31% after a median follow-up of 5.68 years after diagnosis. Apart from refractory or recurrent cancer, the main obstacles to successful outcome were failure to diagnose IA during lifetime and bleeding complications in patients with established diagnosis. The frequency of invasive aspergillosis of greater than 15% in paediatric patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia and recurrent leukaemias warrants the systematic investigation of preventive strategies in these highly vulnerable subgroups.","['Groll, A H', 'Kurz, M', 'Schneider, W', 'Witt, V', 'Schmidt, H', 'Schneider, M', 'Schwabe, D']","['Groll AH', 'Kurz M', 'Schneider W', 'Witt V', 'Schmidt H', 'Schneider M', 'Schwabe D']","['Department of Pediatrics, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Mycoses,Mycoses,8805008,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Aspergillosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Aspergillus/isolation & purification', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oncology Service, Hospital', 'Pediatrics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survivors']",1999/11/05 00:00,1999/11/05 00:01,['1999/11/05 00:00'],"['1999/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mycoses. 1999;42(7-8):431-42. doi: 10.1046/j.1439-0507.1999.00496.x.,,,['10.1046/j.1439-0507.1999.00496.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fulfilling Our Pledge.,VIII,"We are fortunate, as physicians and clinical researchers, to live in a time of unprecedented expansion of treatment approaches. Much of this change is due to the application of new knowledge regarding the causes of malignant transformation and progression, and the pace of research and its application is likely to quicken. The pace of change is exemplified by the number and variety of new drugs that will transform treatment of cancer in the next few years: antibodies for breast cancer and lymphoma, differentiating agents for acute promyelocytic leukemia, molecularly targeted agents for chronic myelocytic leukemia, antiangiogenic drugs, antimetastatic agents, and new natural products with unique mechanisms of action. Some are already approved and in routine use, while others are progressing rapidly through the pre-approval process. All of this change presents a challenge to the practicing oncologist who must understand the biology, pharmacology, and clinical uses of the new drugs. What are the advantages, limitations, risks, and benefits of the drugs, how do they interact with other drugs and with irradiation, and how are they likely to be used in the future? To provide timely access to this information, The Oncologist has asked its board of editors to develop a new section of the Journal that will be devoted to Promising New Drugs and Combinations. Two experienced and highly respected clinical researchers, Frank Balis, Chief of the Pharmacology and Experimental Section in the Pediatrics Branch at the National Cancer Institute, and Michael Hawkins, Associate Director at the Washington Hospital Center Cancer Institute, have agreed to edit and oversee this section of the journal and will make sure that our readership has essential information on new drugs as they approach marketing status.

Since a considerable amount of PPARgamma is expressed in various hematopoietic cells, the present study was undertaken to examine the effect of TZD in the absence or presence of LG100268, an RXR-selective ligand, on a cultured promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL60. Treatment with TZD (25-50 microM troglitazone or pioglitazone) markedly suppressed cell proliferation of HL60. A cell cycle analysis revealed that the suppressive effect of troglitazone on HL60 cell proliferations was caused by G0/G1 cell cycle arrest as well as by an apoptotic effect. Treatment with the same concentration of troglitazone also induced the monocytic differentiation of HL60 cells. The apoptotic or the differentiating effect of TZD on HL60 cells was synergistically enhanced by the combined treatment with 1 microM LG100268, while LG100268 alone neither had an apoptotic nor a differentiating effect on HL60 cells. These results suggest that these actions are mediated through the nuclear receptor system constituted by the PPARgamma: RXR heterodimer.","['Hirase, N', 'Yanase, T', 'Mu, Y', 'Muta, K', 'Umemura, T', 'Takayanagi, R', 'Nawata, H']","['Hirase N', 'Yanase T', 'Mu Y', 'Muta K', 'Umemura T', 'Takayanagi R', 'Nawata H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromans/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/*drug effects', 'Nicotinic Acids/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects', 'Tetrahydronaphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', '*Thiazolidinediones', 'Troglitazone']",1999/11/05 00:00,1999/11/05 00:01,['1999/11/05 00:00'],"['1999/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncology. 1999 Oct;57 Suppl 2:17-26. doi: 10.1159/000055271.,,,"['55271 [pii]', '10.1159/000055271 [doi]']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chromans)', '0 (Nicotinic Acids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tetrahydronaphthalenes)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', 'AA68LXK93C (2,4-thiazolidinedione)', 'I66ZZ0ZN0E (Troglitazone)', 'UVU4X1103P (LG 100268)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that LIF-induced JAK2 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation is transient, disappearing within 20 and 40 minutes, respectively. LIF activates the SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-1, with maximal stimulation observed at 30 minutes. SHP-1 is constitutively associated with JAK2, and LIF induces recruitment of phosphorylated STAT3 to this complex. Overexpression of wild-type or dominant negative forms of SHP-1 shows decreased or increased LIF-induced proopiomelanocortin (POMC) promoter activity, respectively. LIF-induced JAK2 and STAT3 dephosphorylation is delayed until after 60 minutes in cells that overexpress the mutant SHP-1. In addition, SOCS-3, a negative regulator of LIF signaling, binds to JAK2 after 60 minutes of LIF stimulation, after which the complex is degraded by the proteasome. SOCS-3 overexpression blocks LIF-induced JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation, confirming a role for SOCS-3 in deactivating JAK2 by direct association. Using SOCS-3 fusion proteins, we also define regions of the SOCS-3 protein that are critical for inhibition of LIF-induced POMC promoter activity. Corticotrophic signaling by LIF is thus subject to 2 forms of negative autoregulation: dephosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 by the SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase, and SOCS-3-dependent inactivation of JAK2.","['Bousquet, C', 'Susini, C', 'Melmed, S']","['Bousquet C', 'Susini C', 'Melmed S']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute-University of California-Los Angeles School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Animals', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pituitary Gland/*metabolism', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/*metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteins/*physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', '*Repressor Proteins', 'SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transfection']",1999/11/05 00:00,1999/11/05 00:01,['1999/11/05 00:00'],"['1999/11/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1999 Nov;104(9):1277-85. doi: 10.1172/JCI7924.,,,['10.1172/JCI7924 [doi]'],"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",['R01-DK50238/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC409825,,,,,,,,,,

Although microtubules have been implicated in the activation process, the molecular mechanism of their interactions with signal transduction molecules is poorly understood. Here we show that in rat basophilic leukemia cells large amounts of alphabeta-tubulin dimers ( approximately 70%) and gamma-tubulin ( approximately 85%) are found in a soluble pool which was released from the cells after permeabilization with saponin, or extraction with non-ionic detergents. Soluble tubulins were found in large complexes with other molecules.

Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins associated with the cytoskeleton, i.e. around centrosomes, was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. In vitro kinase assays revealed increased tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in gamma-tubulin complexes isolated from activated cells. Two of the tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in these complexes were identified as the p53/56(lyn) kinase. Furthermore, gamma-tubulin bound to the N-terminal fragment of recombinant Lyn kinase and its binding was slightly enhanced in activated cells. Pretreatment of the cells with Src family-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PP1, decreased the amount of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in gamma-tubulin complexes, as well as the amount of gamma-tubulin in Lyn kinase immunocomplexes.

We show here that cells overexpressing the human homolog of Daxx (hDaxx) display enhanced sensitivity to apoptosis induced by Fas but not by several other cell death stimuli. hDaxx-mediated enhancement of Fas-induced apoptosis was correlated with accelerated activation of caspases but not with JNK induction. Although specifically enhancing Fas function, hDaxx does not bind Fas and instead is found in the nucleus where it localizes to PML oncogenic domains (PODs). Moreover, the hDaxx protein also exhibits the ability to repress transcription. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated a correlation between the localization of hDaxx to PODs and its ability to enhance Fas-induced cell death. Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)), an agent that accentuates POD formation, collaborated synergistically with overexpression of hDaxx to increase cellular sensitivity to Fas-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these findings argue that hDaxx promotes sensitivity to Fas from a nuclear location, probably by modulating the transcription of genes involved in Fas-induced caspase activation and apoptosis.","['Torii, S', 'Egan, D A', 'Evans, R A', 'Reed, J C']","['Torii S', 'Egan DA', 'Evans RA', 'Reed JC']","['The Burnham Institute, 10901 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Yeasts', 'fas Receptor/*pharmacology']",1999/11/02 00:00,1999/11/02 00:01,['1999/11/02 00:00'],"['1999/11/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1999 Nov 1;18(21):6037-49. doi: 10.1093/emboj/18.21.6037.,,,['10.1093/emboj/18.21.6037 [doi]'],"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",['CA72994/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC1171669,,,,,,,,,,

These techniques typically include amplification of the target DNA sequences followed by separation of the amplified fragments by slab gel electrophoresis. As a result of the labor-intensive, time-consuming nature of slab gel electrophoresis, alternative electrophoretic formats have been developed in the form of capillary electrophoresis and, more recently, multichannel microchip electrophoresis. METHODS: Capillary electrophoresis was explored as an alternative to slab gel electrophoresis for the analysis of PCR-amplified products indicative of T- and B-cell malignancies as a means of defining the elements for silica microchip-based diagnosis. Capillary-based separations were replicated on electrophoretic microchips. RESULTS: The microchip-based electrophoretic separation effectively resolved PCR-amplified fragments from the variable region of the T-cell receptor-gamma gene (150-250 bp range) and the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (80-140 bp range), yielding diagnostically relevant information regarding the presence of clonal DNA populations. Although hydroxyethylcellulose provided adequate separation power, the need for a coated microchannel for effective resolution necessitated additional preparative steps. In addition, preliminary data are shown indicating that polyvinylpyrrolidone may provide an adequate matrix without the need for microchannel coating. CONCLUSIONS: Separation of B- and T-cell gene rearrangement PCR products on microchips provides diagnostic information in dramatically reduced time (160 s vs 2.5 h) with no loss of diagnostic capacity when compared with current methodologies. As illustrated, this technology and methodology holds great potential for extrapolation to the abundance of similar molecular biology-based techniques.","['Munro, N J', 'Snow, K', 'Kant, J A', 'Landers, J P']","['Munro NJ', 'Snow K', 'Kant JA', 'Landers JP']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,IM,"['DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Electrophoresis/methods', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary/methods', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Miniaturization', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Povidone/chemistry', 'Silicon Dioxide']",1999/11/02 00:00,1999/11/02 00:01,['1999/11/02 00:00'],"['1999/11/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 1999 Nov;45(11):1906-17.,,,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)', 'FZ989GH94E (Povidone)']",['1R21CA78865-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The proteins complexed to DNA were analyzed by two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). A group of identical non-histone proteins was crosslinked to DNA by any of the three treatments, except that a 51 kDa basic protein was additionally complexed to DNA when either potassium chromate or chromium(III) chloride hexahydrate was the crosslinking agent. Treatment of chromate-induced DNA-protein crosslinks with EDTA or thiourea followed by ultracentifugation dissociated the major proteins from the complex indicating that these proteins were crosslinked to DNA by direct participation of a EDTA-chelatable form of chromium such as Cr(III) through sulfur containing amino acid residues. The 51 kDa protein was not seen in the post-EDTA pellet but was present in the post-thiourea pellet, indicating that it was also crosslinked to DNA by Cr(III) through non-sulfur-containing amino acids. Digestion of x-rays-induced DPCs by DNase I also revealed this protein on two-dimensional gels indicating that the same protein was also crosslinked by oxidative mechanisms. The involvement of oxidative mechanisms in the crosslinking process was indicated as the majority of the proteins in chromate-induced DPCs were resistant to EDTA and thiourea treatment, and were found to crosslink to DNA when x-rays were used as the crosslinking agent. These results suggest that the chromate-induced DPCs are formed by the generation of reactive oxygen species during the intracellular chromate reduction as well as by the biologically generated Cr(III). About 19% of DNA-protein crosslinks actually involve Cr(III) crosslinking DNA to proteins, of which about 14% involve Cr(III) crosslinking DNA to proteins through non-sulfhydryl containing moieties and about 5% involve Cr(III) crosslinking DNA to sulfhydryl groups on proteins. The remaining 81% of DNA-protein crosslinks appear to be oxidatively crosslinked out of which about 45% appear to be through sulfhydryl groups and another 36% appear to be through non-sulfhydryl groups.","['Mattagajasingh, S N', 'Misra, H P']","['Mattagajasingh SN', 'Misra HP']","['Center for Molecular Medicine and Infectious Diseases, Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,IM,"['Carcinogens, Environmental/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Chelating Agents/*analysis', 'Chromates/toxicity', 'Chromium/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*chemistry/*drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Edetic Acid/*analysis', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Potassium Compounds/toxicity', 'Proteins/chemistry/*drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1999/11/02 00:00,1999/11/02 00:01,['1999/11/02 00:00'],"['1999/11/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 1999 Sep;199(1-2):149-62. doi: 10.1023/a:1006910732307.,,,['10.1023/a:1006910732307 [doi]'],"['0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Chromates)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Potassium Compounds)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0R0008Q3JB (Chromium)', '18540-29-9 (chromium hexavalent ion)', '5P0R38CN2X (potassium chromate(VI))', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prognostic factors are not well-established until now. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Based on retrospective analyses of patients with CMML diagnosed at our institution, we compared the presenting clinical and hematological features of both disorders and examined the natural course of the disease and prognostic factors. RESULTS: Out of 225 patients with CMML there were 115 patients with myelodysplastic type (MDS-CMML) and 110 patients with myeloproliferative type (MPD-CMML). Median age of patients at diagnosis and sex ratio were not different. Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly were more common in MPD-CMML. With regard to laboratory findings, patients with MPD-CMML presented with significantly higher LDH values. Except for WBC, peripheral blood counts were not different. Median percentage of bone marrow blasts was 8% in both disorders. Signs of bone marrow dysplasia were comparable in both disorders. Cumulative survival rates were similar in both disorders. Five years after diagnosis, actuarial survival for patients with MPD-CMML was 24%, as compared to 15% for patients with MDS-CMML. The probability of transformation to AML was higher in MDS-CMML (29% vs 18% after 5 years). Elevated LDH values, low hemoglobin values and male sex were independent risk factors for the entire group and for the MDS-CMML group. Using the Dusseldorf score, we could define risk groups within MDS-CMML with a median survial of 12 vs 40 months (p = 0.00005). Prognostic factors could not define risk groups within the MPD-CMML group. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, these data suggest that MDS-CMML and MPD-CMML are clinically distinguishing conditions, but the separation provides little prognostic information. The Dusseldorf score can be used to provide risk stratification in CMML.","['Germing, U', 'Strupp, C', 'Meckenstock, G', 'Giagounidis, A', 'Minning, H', 'Aul, C']","['Germing U', 'Strupp C', 'Meckenstock G', 'Giagounidis A', 'Minning H', 'Aul C']","['Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und klinische Immunologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf. germing@haemouk.uni-duesseldorf.de']",['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Med Klin (Munich),"Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)",8303501,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/blood/*classification/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",1999/11/02 09:00,2000/03/22 09:00,['1999/11/02 09:00'],"['1999/11/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '1999/11/02 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Klin (Munich). 1999 Sep 15;94(9):467-72. doi: 10.1007/BF03044937.,,,['10.1007/BF03044937 [doi]'],,,,,,,,"Klinik, Morphologie und Prognose chronischer myelomonozytarer Leukamien.",,,,,,

FeLV-945 is a natural isolate derived from non-B-cell non-T-cell lymphomas classified anatomically as multicentric. FeLV-945 exhibits a unique structural motif in the LTR composed of a 21-bp tandem triplication downstream of a single copy of enhancer. The unique FeLV-945 LTR is precisely conserved among eight independent multicentric lymphomas collected in a geographic cluster. Previous studies using reporter gene constructs predict that the FeLV-945 LTR would confer a replicative advantage on the virus that contains it, particularly in primitive hematopoietic cells. Such an advantage may account for the precise conservation of the unique LTR sequence. To test that prediction, a set of recombinant, infectious FeLVs was developed that are isogenic other than the presence of the FeLV-945 LTR or mutations of it. Replication assays show that the FeLV-945 LTR confers a distinct growth advantage in K-562, FEA, and 3201 cells and implicate the 21-bp triplication in that function. Replacement of two copies of the triplicated element with random sequence greatly diminished the replicative capacity, thus implicating the triplicated sequence itself in LTR function. The 21-bp triplication was shown to contain specific nuclear protein binding sites, which may account for the selective pressure to conserve the sequence.","['Prabhu, S', 'Lobelle-Rich, P A', 'Levy, L S']","['Prabhu S', 'Lobelle-Rich PA', 'Levy LS']","['Program in Molecular and Cellular Biology and Tulane Cancer Center, Tulane Medical School, New Orleans, Louisiana 70112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Conserved Sequence/genetics', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/enzymology/*genetics/*growth & development', 'Mutation', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/analysis/genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",1999/11/02 00:00,1999/11/02 00:01,['1999/11/02 00:00'],"['1999/11/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1999 Oct 25;263(2):460-70. doi: 10.1006/viro.1999.9974.,,,"['10.1006/viro.1999.9974 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(99)99974-9 [pii]']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, no apparent clinical neurological disease is seen after IP infection with Fr54, a polytropic MuLV differing from Fr98 in its envelope gene sequences. In the brain both Fr98 and Fr54 infect primarily capillary endothelial cells and microglia. However, the level of microglial infection by Fr98 is twofold higher than by Fr54, which might account for the difference in neurovirulence. In the present study, in order to test directly whether an increase in the number of microglia infected by Fr54 would be sufficient to induce clinical disease, we attempted to increase the level of Fr54 in the brain by changing the route of infection. After intraventricular inoculation with Fr54-infected neural stem cells (clone C17.2), a well-established vehicle for delivery of viruses and genes to the brain, mice became ataxic and died 4 weeks postinfection. In these mice induction of brain disease was correlated with a higher level of viral antigen in the cerebrum and an increase in the number of infected microglial cells in all brain regions examined compared with mice inoculated IP. In contrast, mice inoculated with neural stem cells infected with an ecotropic nonneurovirulent murine leukemia virus, FB29, developed no clinical disease in spite of evidence for widespread infection of microglia in brain. Since the main differences between Fr54 and FB29 are in the SU (gp70) region of the envelope gene, this region is most likely to account for the differences in induction of CNS disease seen in the current experiments.","['Poulsen, D J', 'Favara, C', 'Snyder, E Y', 'Portis, J', 'Chesebro, B']","['Poulsen DJ', 'Favara C', 'Snyder EY', 'Portis J', 'Chesebro B']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Hamilton, Montana 59840, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/pathology/*virology', 'Brain Diseases/pathology/*virology', 'Capsid/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Microglia/virology', 'Neurons/cytology/virology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Retroviridae Infections/pathology/*virology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/pathology/*virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism', 'Viral Load', 'Virulence']",1999/11/02 00:00,1999/11/02 00:01,['1999/11/02 00:00'],"['1999/11/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1999 Oct 10;263(1):23-9. doi: 10.1006/viro.1999.9917.,,,"['10.1006/viro.1999.9917 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(99)99917-8 [pii]']","['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,

The TEL protein contains two functional domains that have been partially characterized: a helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain (also known as a pointed domain) at the N-terminus, which physically interacts with itself, with the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9, and with FLI1; and, at the C-terminus, an ETS domain with DNA-binding properties. Little is known about the function of the central region of TEL. The HLH domain and the central region of TEL are consistently maintained in the t(12;21), which is the most frequent chromosomal translocation involving TEL. In this study, we found that the HLH domain and the central region of TEL mediate transcription repression by two distinct mechanisms. The central region involves the recruitment of a repression complex, including SMRT and mSin3A. The HLH domain represses gene transcription through a mechanism that is independent of known corepressors. Thus, TEL belongs to a growing number of transcription factors rearranged by chromosomal translocations that are associated with the corepressor complexes.","['Chakrabarti, S R', 'Nucifora, G']","['Chakrabarti SR', 'Nucifora G']","['Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois, 60153, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1999/11/02 00:00,1999/11/02 00:01,['1999/11/02 00:00'],"['1999/11/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/11/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/11/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1999 Nov 2;264(3):871-7. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1999.1605.,,,"['10.1006/bbrc.1999.1605 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(99)91605-4 [pii]']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (NCOR2 protein, human)', '0 (Ncor2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SIN3A transcription factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex)']","['CA67189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,

A group of long-term surviving, non-reviremic ducks was selected for the study and compared to control reviremic animals in order to obtain information about persisting retroviruses in different duck tissues. A widespread distribution of proviruses in the tested tissues was found, but the proviral load was significantly lower in non-reviremic in comparison to reviremic animals. The only exception were brain and blood cells, in which no significant difference in the quantity of integrated proviruses was found between both categories of ducks, thus indicating an exceptional position of the brain and blood cells among all tested tissues. Contrary to reviremic, the proviruses were not transcribed in non-reviremic ducks, with the exception of brain and thymus. In the majority of non-reviremic ducks viral RNA was revealed in the brain, but no infectious virus could be recovered from this tissue. The opposite situation was observed in the thymus, where infectious virus was recovered but viral RNA remained below the detection limit of the assay. As revealed by in situ analysis, infected cells were either disseminated or focally distributed in tissues. From the long-term follow up of ALV-C in intraembryonally infected ducks we conclude that this model is suitable for the study of retrovirus persistence accompained both by the presence and absence of reviremias. The possible consequences of transmission and long-term persistence of retroviruses in the heterologous host for retroviral evolution are discussed.","['Trejbalova, K', 'Gebhard, K', 'Vernerova, Z', 'Dusek, L', 'Geryk, J', 'Hejnar, J', 'Haase, A T', 'Svoboda, J']","['Trejbalova K', 'Gebhard K', 'Vernerova Z', 'Dusek L', 'Geryk J', 'Hejnar J', 'Haase AT', 'Svoboda J']","['Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Avian Leukosis/immunology/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'DNA, Viral/blood/isolation & purification', 'Ducks/embryology/*virology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Viral Load', 'Viremia/virology']",1999/10/29 00:00,1999/10/29 00:01,['1999/10/29 00:00'],"['1999/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Virol. 1999;144(9):1779-807. doi: 10.1007/s007050050704.,,,"['91441779.705 [pii]', '10.1007/s007050050704 [doi]']","['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In BOOP the newly formed connective tissue is susceptible to even complete reversal, but in UIP it participates in the remodeling of the pulmonary tissue. In this study we have tested the hypothesis that the apoptotic activity in the fibromyxoid lesions is higher in BOOP than in UIP. Apoptotic activity in cells of the newly formed connective tissue in BOOP and UIP was visualized by TUNEL. Apoptosis-regulating proteins bcl-2, mcl-1, and bax were visualized by immunohistochemistry. The number of the apoptotic events was given as an apoptotic index giving the percentage of the apoptotic cells and bodies of the total cell number. Our results show that the apoptotic activity is clearly higher in the fibromyxoid lesions of BOOP (mean, 0.7; S.D., +/-0.51) compared with those of UIP (mean, 0. 13; S.D., +/-0.14, p < 0.003). The results thus suggest that apoptosis has an important role in the resolution process of the newly formed connective tissue in BOOP. The low level of apoptosis in UIP could, on the other hand, suggest that a decreased apoptosis in cells of the fibromyxoid stroma might pathogenetically relate to a decreased resolution of these lesions in UIP. No significant difference was found in the expression of bcl-2, mcl-1, and bax in BOOP and in UIP, suggesting that regulation of apoptosis might partly bypass the influence of these proteins.","['Lappi-Blanco, E', 'Soini, Y', 'Paakko, P']","['Lappi-Blanco E', 'Soini Y', 'Paakko P']","['Department of Pathology, University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lung,Lung,7701875,IM,"['*Apoptosis/physiology', 'Biopsy', 'Connective Tissue/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lung/metabolism/pathology', 'Lung Diseases, Interstitial/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1999/10/29 00:00,1999/10/29 00:01,['1999/10/29 00:00'],"['1999/10/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lung. 1999;177(6):367-76. doi: 10.1007/pl00007654.,,,"['LUNG601 [pii]', '10.1007/pl00007654 [doi]']","['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, this antibody is promising for adjuvant conditioning radioimmunotherapy of bone marrow before bone marrow transplantation. To examine its potential use for radioimmunotherapy, we developed an efficient and reproducible technical protocol for labelling anti-NCA antigen antibody BW 250/183 with generator-produced rhenium-188, aiming at both high radiochemical yield and high specific activity. (188)Re-labelled BW 250/183 antibody was used in 12 patients with advanced leukaemia. Labelling of BW 250/183 with (188)Re was accomplished by the direct radiolabelling method using tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) as the reducing agent. Twelve patients with recurrent acute or chronic leukaemia were treated with activities of 6.5-12.4 GBq of (188)Re-labelled BW 250/183. Standard gamma camera scintigraphy was used to evaluate the biodistribution, and a region of interest analysis together with the MIRDOSE 3.1 software was applied to determine the radiation doses to relevant tissues. The (188)Re-BW 250/183 antibody was labelled in high radiochemical yield, with high radiochemical purity (94%+/-3%) and specific activity (5.55-7.4 GBq/mg) within 1 h. The preliminary biodistribution studies showed persistent uptake of (188)Re-BW 250/183 in bone marrow.

After 12 weeks post LP-BM5 inoculation, 15 immunosuppressed mice each were randomly assinged to one of the following treatment groups: historical control (group A), LP-BM5 control (group B), C. parvum (group C), L. reuteri plus C. parvum (group D) or L. acidophilus plus C. parvum (group E). Mice were pre-fed the L. reuteri or L. acidophilus bacteria strains daily for 13 days, challenged with C. parvum oocysts and thereafter fed the specified Lactobacillus regimens daily during the experimental period. Animals supplemented with L. reuteri shed fewer (p<0.05) oocysts on day-7 post C. parvum challenge compared to controls. Mice supplemented with L. acidophilus also shed fewer (p<0.05) oocysts on days 7 and 14 post-challenge compared to controls. Overall, Lactobacillus supplementation reduced C. parvum shedding in the feces but failed to suppress the production of T-helper type 2 cytokines [interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-8)] which are associated with immunosuppression. Additionally, Lactobacillus supplementation did not restore T-helper type 1 cytokines (interleukin-2 (IL-2) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), which are required for recovery from parasitic infections. Altered T-helper types 1 and 2 cytokine production as a consequence of immunodysfunction permitted the development of persistent cryptosporidiosis while mice with intact immune system were refractory to infection with C. parvum. Reduction in shedding of oocysts observed in the Lactobacillus supplemented mice during deminished IL-2 and IFN-gamma production may be mediated by factors released into the intestinal lumen by the Lactobacillus and possibly other host cellular mechanisms. These observations suggest that L. reuteri or L. acidophilus can reduce C. parvum parasite burdens in the intestinal epithelium during cryptosporidiosis and may serve potential benefits as probiotics for host resistance to intestinal parasitic infections. L. acidophilus was more efficacious in reducing fecal shedding than L. reuteri and therefore may also have implication in the therapy of cryptosporidiosis during immunosuppressive states including human AIDS.","['Alak, J I', 'Wolf, B W', 'Mdurvwa, E G', 'Pimentel-Smith, G E', 'Kolavala, S', 'Abdelrahman, H', 'Suppiramaniam, V']","['Alak JI', 'Wolf BW', 'Mdurvwa EG', 'Pimentel-Smith GE', 'Kolavala S', 'Abdelrahman H', 'Suppiramaniam V']","['Department of Biology, Tuskegee University, Alabama 36088, USA.

Because both CD20 and CD22 are highly expressed relatively early in the course of B cell maturation, and because its expression is maintained up to relatively mature stages, we studied the potential of the humanized anti-CD22 antibody, hLL2, as well as of the chimeric anti-CD20 (chCD20) antibody, rituximab (IDEC-C2B8), for low- or high-dose (myeloablative) RAIT of a broad range of B cell-associated hematological malignancies. A total of 10 patients with chemorefractory malignant neoplasms of B cell origin were studied with diagnostic (n = 5) and/or potentially therapeutic doses (n = 9) of hLL2 (n = 4; 0.5 mg/kg, 8-315 mCi of 131I) or chCD20 (n = 5; 2.5 mg/kg, 15-495 mCi of 131I). The diagnostic doses were given to establish the patients' eligibility for RAIT and to estimate the individual radiation dosimetry. One patient suffered of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, eight patients had low- (n = 4), intermediate- (n = 2) or high- (n = 2) grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and one patient had a chemorefractory acute lymphatic leukemia, after having failed five heterologous bone marrow or stem cell transplantations. Three of these 10 patients were scheduled for treatment with conventional (30-63 mCi, cumulated doses of up to 90 mCi of 131I) and 7 with potentially myeloablative (225-495 mCi of 131I) activities of 131I-labeled hLL2 or chCD20 (0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg, respectively); homologous (n = 6) or heterologous (n = 1) stem cell support was provided in these cases. Good tumor targeting was observed in all diagnostic as well as posttherapeutic scans of all patients. In myeloablative therapies, the therapeutic activities were calculated based on the diagnostic radiation dosimetry, aiming at lung and kidney doses < or = 20 Gy. Stem cells were reinfused when the whole-body activity retention fell below 20 mCi. In eight assessable patients, five had complete remissions, two experienced partial remissions (corresponding to an overall response rate of 87%), and one (low-dose) patient had progressive disease despite therapy. In the five assessable, actually stem-cell grafted patients, the complete response rate was 100%. Both CD20 and CD22 seem to be suitable target molecules for high-dose RAIT in a broad spectrum of hematological malignancies of B cell origin with a broad range of maturation stages (from acute lymphatic leukemia to Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia).

It is typically incurable, even with myeloablative chemotherapy and stem-cell transplantation. The epithelial mucin-1 (MUC1) glycoprotein is expressed by normal and malignant epithelial cells but has also been shown to be expressed by MM cells. MUC1 is a useful antigenic target in solid tumors for clinical diagnostic and therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based approaches. The MA5 mAb, as well as other anti-MUC1 mAbs reactive with the MUC1 variable number tandem repeat domain, exhibited moderate to strong reactivity with both MM cell lines and clinical samples. To explore the biochemical nature and potential of MUC1 as an antigenic target in MM, studies were performed to: (a) compare the mRNA and the MUC1 glycoprotein species between epithelial cancer and MM cell lines; and (b) develop and use a human MM tumor xenograft model system to study the biodistribution of the MA5 mAb. MA5 mAb was strongly reactive with six of eight human MM cell lines by flow cytometry. In seven of eight MM patient samples (bone marrow and/or peripheral blood) reactivity was found in 10-90% of the cells, whereas normal control (n = 5) and leukemia and lymphoma (n = 5) cells showed only 0-6% reactivity. 125I-labeled MA5 whole-cell binding studies showed quantitatively similar amounts of binding between strongly positive MM lines and high-MUC1-expressing breast carcinoma lines. mRNA expression was assessed by Northern blotting and reverse transcription-PCR. MM cell lines were positive by both methods, with strong similarity in the sizes of the mRNAs and cDNAs that were obtained.

We and others have demonstrated recently that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-elevating substances up-regulate monocytic IL-10 expression in vitro and in vivo. Computer analysis of the IL-10 promoter/enhancer region localized four putative cAMP-responsive elements (CRE1- 4) with homology to the CRE consensus motif. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays CRE1 and CRE4 bound protein complexes consisting of transcription factors CREB-1 and ATF-1, while CRE3 bound only marginal amounts of CREB-1/ATF-1 in combination with unknown protein(s). CRE2 showed no protein binding activity. In vitro mutation of CRE1 and CRE4 reduced the level of cAMP-stimulated transactivation in reporter gene assays in comparison to the wild-type promoter by 20 % and 50 %, respectively, while mutation of CRE3 had no effect. The main action of CRE4 on cAMP-dependent stimulation is probably based on its adjacent localization to the TATA box and its sequence comprising a perfect half site. Experiments with double and triple mutants and with deleted promoter fragments indicated the participation of additional elements beside the CRE motifs in the cAMP-dependent stimulation. Our data suggest that intracellular cAMP may directly affect expression of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 in monocytic cells via activation of the eukaryotic transcription factors CREB-1 and ATF-1 and their binding to CRE1 and CRE4 in the upstream enhancer of the IL-10 promoter.","['Platzer, C', 'Fritsch, E', 'Elsner, T', 'Lehmann, M H', 'Volk, H D', 'Prosch, S']","['Platzer C', 'Fritsch E', 'Elsner T', 'Lehmann MH', 'Volk HD', 'Prosch S']","['Institute of Anatomy Anatomy II, Medical School, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena, Germany. cplatzer@mti-n.uni-jena.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['Cyclic AMP/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Monocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics/immunology', 'Response Elements/*immunology', 'Transcriptional Activation/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/30 00:00,1999/10/30 00:01,['1999/10/30 00:00'],"['1999/10/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1999 Oct;29(10):3098-104. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199910)29:10<3098::AID-IMMU3098>3.0.CO;2-H.,,,['10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199910)29:10<3098::AID-IMMU3098>3.0.CO;2-H [doi]'],"['130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Association of membrane expression of CD45 isoforms and differential levels of leukemia cells was studied in 91 cases with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Membrane expression of CD45RA and CD45RO was analyzed by flow cytometry and their expression patterns were compared with AML subtypes classified according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification. CD45RA was essentially expressed in all of the FAB myelocytic subtypes (M0-M3). Its expression in percentage was lower in the most differentiated subtype of AML (M3) when compared with other myelocytic subtypes. CD45RO expression was rarely observed in cases with myelocytic subtypes (1/56 cases of M0, M1, M2, and M3) except for the minimally differentiated myelocytic subtype (M0) or those with potential for differentiation to T-cell lineage where three of 12 cases showed CD45RO expression. When leukemia cells of an M3 case were differentiated to mature granulocytes by treatment of all-trans-retinoic acid, they showed increasing expression of CD45RO. In subtypes with a monocytic component (M4 and M5), both of CD45RA and CD45RO expression were observed and mutually exclusive. When 10 cases of M5 were subdivided by the differential level into undifferentiated (M5a) and differentiated monocytic leukemia (M5b), expression of CD45RA and CD45RO was strictly restricted to cases with M5a and M5b, respectively. These results suggest that CD45 isoform expression in AML characterizes differential levels both in myelocytic and monocytic lineages and specifically disturbed in each subtype. The assessment of CD45 isoform expression appears to provide an insight on biological characteristics and a useful supplementary test for differential diagnosis of AML subtypes.","['Miyachi, H', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Gondo, K', 'Kawada, T', 'Kato, S', 'Sasao, T', 'Hotta, T', 'Oshima, S', 'Ando, Y']","['Miyachi H', 'Tanaka Y', 'Gondo K', 'Kawada T', 'Kato S', 'Sasao T', 'Hotta T', 'Oshima S', 'Ando Y']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan. miyachi@is.icc.u-tokai.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*classification/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Isoforms']",1999/10/28 00:00,1999/10/28 00:01,['1999/10/28 00:00'],"['1999/10/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/28 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1999 Nov;62(3):159-64. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199911)62:3<159::aid-ajh5>3.0.co;2-4.,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199911)62:3<159::AID-AJH5>3.0.CO;2-4 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199911)62:3<159::aid-ajh5>3.0.co;2-4 [doi]']","['0 (Protein Isoforms)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Soluble variant forms (sFas) lacking the transmembrane domain due to alternative splicing have been identified. Up-regulation of sFas expression is reportedly implicated in prereceptorial blockage of Fas-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. We examined mRNA expression of Fas and sFas in fresh leukemia cells. All leukemia cells expressed both mRNAs of full-length Fas (FasFull) and sFas with deletion of exon6 (FasDel6). The ratio of FasFull/FasDel6 mRNA expression was not always correlated with Fas-mediated growth inhibition. Interestingly, in a 6-year-old boy with acute myelogenous leukemia, blast cells obtained at onset and at the time of bone marrow relapses expressed distinct amounts of FasDel6 mRNA. Furthermore, the level of FasDel6 expression appeared to be correlated with Fas-resistance in leukemia blasts. In addition, sFas protein levels were elevated in patients' sera at onset with subsequent return to normal levels after complete remission. These results indicated that sFas could be synthesized and released by leukemia blasts and suggested that up-regulation of Fas variant transcript might render leukemia blasts resistant to Fas-mediated growth inhibition in certain cases.","['Inaba, H', 'Komada, Y', 'Li, Q S', 'Zhang, X L', 'Tanaka, S', 'Azuma, E', 'Yamamoto, H', 'Sakurai, M']","['Inaba H', 'Komada Y', 'Li QS', 'Zhang XL', 'Tanaka S', 'Azuma E', 'Yamamoto H', 'Sakurai M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Mie University School of Medicine, Mie, Tsu, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', '*Apoptosis', 'Blast Crisis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm', 'Up-Regulation', 'fas Receptor/*genetics']",1999/10/28 00:00,1999/10/28 00:01,['1999/10/28 00:00'],"['1999/10/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/28 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1999 Nov;62(3):150-8. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199911)62:3<150::aid-ajh4>3.0.co;2-y.,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199911)62:3<150::AID-AJH4>3.0.CO;2-Y [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199911)62:3<150::aid-ajh4>3.0.co;2-y [doi]']","['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, p53 germline mutations have also, albeit less frequently, been described in patients not fitting the clinical definition of LFS. To clarify whether a genetic predisposition for lymphoma is associated with constitutional p53 mutations, DNA from normal blood lymphocytes of 12 lymphoma patients with a family history of lymphoma and/or with metachronous lymphoma (median age 37 years) was examined for mutations of p53 exons 4-8. One patient had four first-degree relatives with Hodgkin's disease, acute leukemia, and carcinomas, but the family history did not fulfill criteria of LFS. Four patients with Hodgkin's disease were diagnosed with metachronous non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as a second malignant neoplasm.

Because such treatments are now highly technical and specialised, even patients from more urbanised areas are also required to relocate for prolonged specialist treatment not available locally. Consequently, for many rural and urban patients with leukaemia, relocation for specialist treatment is a major concern.

HuM195 has been shown to rapidly target and saturate acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells after i.v. infusion into patients and is capable of mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. This activity is enhanced in vitro when natural killer (NK) effector cells are preincubated with low concentrations of interleukin 2 (IL-2). Previous Phase I trials of HuM195 in patients with relapsed AML demonstrated safety and attainment of complete responses, but significant antileukemic activity appears limited to patients with low leukemia tumor burdens. Therefore, in the present trial, we sought to determine whether low-dose IL-2 could safely enhance the numbers of NK cells and therefore the cytotoxic capability of HuM195 via presumptive NK cell antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in vivo against myeloid leukemia cells. Thirteen patients with relapsed or refractory AML and one patient with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome were treated with 0.6x10(6) IU/m2 of s.c. IL-2 daily for 35 days. Starting on day 15, patients received twice weekly i.v. infusions of HuM195 (3.0 mg/m2) for 3 weeks. Immediately after the HuM195 infusion, the patients received IL-2 i.v. infusions over 2 h at one of three escalating dose levels of 0.5x10(6), 1.0x10(6), and 2.0x10(6) IU/m2. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were quantitated and immunophenotyped by flow cytometry. Safety, tolerability, bone marrow mononuclear cell morphology, and immunophenotype, as well as responses were assessed. Of the 14 patients who entered the study, 10 were able to complete at least one cycle of therapy. Adverse effects to the s.c. IL-2 were relatively mild and included erythema and induration of the skin at the injection site and low-grade fever. Toxicity from the sequential HuM195 and i.v. IL-2 infusions included nausea, rigors, and fever. Toxicity was IL-2 dose related with dose-limiting toxicity seen at the 2.0x10(6) IU/m2 dose level. Three patients had stable disease at the completion of the first cycle and went on to receive a second cycle of treatment. CD3-positive, CD56-positive, and CD33-positive cells were generally found to significantly decrease immediately after each administration of i.v. IL-2 and HuM195. CD56-expressing cells increased in 6 of 10 patients from the beginning to the end of therapy. Among the 10 evaluable patients, 2 patients had significant decreases in the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow (one of which achieved a complete bone marrow remission), 5 patients had stable levels of bone marrow blasts, and 3 had progression of disease on therapy. The combination of IL-2 and HuM195 shows modest biological activity and clinical antileukemic activity but also produced significant toxicity.","['Kossman, S E', 'Scheinberg, D A', 'Jurcic, J G', 'Jimenez, J', 'Caron, P C']","['Kossman SE', 'Scheinberg DA', 'Jurcic JG', 'Jimenez J', 'Caron PC']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*immunology', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",1999/10/28 00:00,1999/10/28 00:01,['1999/10/28 00:00'],"['1999/10/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/28 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1999 Oct;5(10):2748-55.,,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']","['P01CA33049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA72939/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA0920722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We have determined the 2.0 A crystal structure of the BTB/POZ domain from PLZF (PLZF-BTB/POZ), and have carried out biochemical analysis of PLZF-BTB/POZ harboring site-directed mutations to probe structure-function relationships. The structure reveals a novel alpha/beta homodimeric fold in which dimer interactions occur along two surfaces of the protein subunits. The conservation of BTB/POZ domain residues at the core of the protomers and at the dimer interface implies an analogous fold and dimerization mode for BTB/POZ domains from otherwise functionally unrelated proteins. Unexpectedly, the BTB/POZ domain forms dimer-dimer interactions in the crystals, suggesting a mode for higher-order protein oligomerization for BTB/POZ-mediated transcriptional repression. Biochemical characterization of PLZF-BTB/POZ harboring mutations in conserved residues involved in protein dimerization reveals that the integrity of the dimer interface is exquisitely sensitive to mutation and that dimer formation is required for wild-type levels of transcriptional repression. Interestingly, similar mutational analysis of residues within a pronounced protein cleft along the dimer interface, which had been implicated previously for interaction with corepressors, has negligible effects on dimerization or transcriptional repression. Together, these studies form a structure-function framework for understanding BTB/POZ-mediated oligomerization and transcriptional repression properties.","['Li, X', 'Peng, H', 'Schultz, D C', 'Lopez-Guisa, J M', 'Rauscher, F J 3rd', 'Marmorstein, R']","['Li X', 'Peng H', 'Schultz DC', 'Lopez-Guisa JM', 'Rauscher FJ 3rd', 'Marmorstein R']","['The Wistar Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Crystallization', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/physiology', 'Dimerization', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Zinc Fingers']",1999/10/28 09:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/10/28 09:00'],"['1999/10/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/10/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Oct 15;59(20):5275-82.,,,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']","['CA09171/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA52009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Human monocytic leukemia cells were differentiated under standard conditions with vitamin D3 and granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor. Cells were characterized by fluorescence-activated cell-sorter Scan of CD 14 expression analysis as well as a phagocytosis test exploiting fluorescence-labeled particles of bacteria] walls. To achieve a relevant contact between the floating PE particles (approximately 1 microm in size) and MLC, a rotation device was used (15 rotations/min) during incubation. The same was done with the titanium particles. Cell culture supernatants were then analyzed for interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique in the absence or presence of particles. Rotation of incubated MLC alone did not influence the secretion of TNF-alpha, but it enhanced secretion of IL-1beta and IL-8 about 30-fold compared to background levels. Both PE and titanium particles significantly enhanced MLC cytokine release, the amount of which depended on the concentration of particles. Using 40 X 10(8) PE particles (0.7 x 10(8) titanium particles) and 10(6) MLC, the maximal release of IL-1beta was about 20-fold (7-fold titanium particles) higher than that of the rotating control sample. The stimulation of IL-8 release was 4-fold (3-fold titanium particles) and of TNF-alpha. 300-fold (170-fold titanium particles) compared to controls. MLC were viable (>90% cell survival) at concentrations less than 108 x 10(8) polyethylene particles per 10(6) MLC and 16 x 10(8) titanium particles per 10(6) MLC. Rotation per se as well as exposure to increasing concentrations of PE and titanium particles stimulates cytokine release (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-8) by macrophages in vitro. This in vitro model resembles the in vivo situation near arthroplasties, where implant particles make contact with inflammatory cells, such as macrophages. Cytokine release by macrophages may impair osteoblast function as well as stimulate bone resorption by osteoclasts and macrophages, thereby causing aseptic loosening of arthroplasties.

Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in the neutropenic host presents particular challenges in terms of diagnosis and therapy. Against the background of a recognized problem of invasive aspergillosis in haematology/oncology patients treated at the Christie Hospital, we undertook a prospective study in patients at risk for IPA. The aim of the study was to improve outcome by using the linked strategies of first, early diagnosis, and secondly, early aggressive therapy with a lipid-associated formulation of amphotericin B, amphotericin B colloidal dispersion ('Amphocil'). Early investigation comprised the use of high-resolution computerized tomography scanning of the thorax and fibreoptic bronchoscopy to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, processed using conventional detection and culture methods. Using this approach, the incidence of proven or probable IPA in patients with acute leukaemia was 9%.

This study evaluates weekly fungal surveillance cultures from the oropharyngeal and perianal space as well as other suspected sites in 219 courses of myelosuppressive chemotherapy with itraconazole antifungal prophylaxis in 116 neutropenic patients with acute leukaemia. Itraconazole was given from the start of chemotherapy in one of six different dosing regimens. Fungal colonization occurred in 68 (31%) of courses, which was lower than in a historical control group without prophylaxis (53%, P = 0.004). Twenty-six per cent of these 116 isolates had a growth rate of more than 50 colony forming units (CFU) per culture. Candida glabrata (51%), Candida albicans (18%) and Candida krusei (4%) were the most frequently isolated species. Higher median itraconazole trough concentrations were associated with a lower growth rate in the cultures (< or = 50 CFU/culture versus > 50 CFU/culture): 710 (430-1180) ng ml-1 versus 900 (560-1650) ng ml-1 (P = 0.015). The use of itraconazole solution--compared with capsules--led to a reduced growth rate (P = 0.035).

This receptor and its heterodimeric partner, retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha), form a DNA-binding complex that regulates transcription of adipocyte-specific genes. Troglitazone, an antidiabetic drug, has recently been identified as a synthetic ligand for PPARgamma. We studied the effects of troglitazone on proliferation and differentiation of normal and malignant hematopoietic cells. Expression of PPARgamma was easily detectable by Western blot analyses in all five myeloid leukemia cell lines. Troglitazone alone (10-5 M) did not induce differentiation in any of the cell lines; however, this compound suppressed the clonal growth (10-75% of inhibition) of all five myeloid leukemia cell lines. Myelomonocytic U937 cells, which were the most responsive to the growth suppressing effects of troglitazone, were arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle when cultured with this compound. Simultaneous treatment of myeloid leukemia cell lines with both troglitazone and a ligand that specifically binds either RXR (LG100268), or retinoic acid receptors (RAR, ATRA, ALART1550), or both (9-cis RA) resulted in additive suppression of clonal growth. In summary, our studies showed that troglitazone when combined with a retinoid was a moderately potent inhibitor of clonogenic growth of acute myeloid leukemia cells.","['Asou, H', 'Verbeek, W', 'Williamson, E', 'Elstner, E', 'Kubota, T', 'Kamada, N', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Asou H', 'Verbeek W', 'Williamson E', 'Elstner E', 'Kubota T', 'Kamada N', 'Koeffler HP']","['Department of Cancer Cytogenetics, Research Institute for Radiation Research and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Alitretinoin', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Antioxidants/toxicity', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Chromans/*toxicity', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/drug effects/*physiology', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/*toxicity', '*Thiazolidinediones', 'Transcription Factors/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tretinoin/toxicity', 'Troglitazone', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",1999/10/28 00:00,1999/10/28 00:01,['1999/10/28 00:00'],"['1999/10/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/28 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1999 Nov;15(5):1027-31. doi: 10.3892/ijo.15.5.1027.,,,['10.3892/ijo.15.5.1027 [doi]'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Chromans)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '1UA8E65KDZ (Alitretinoin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'I66ZZ0ZN0E (Troglitazone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that many other human blood leukocyte types have endogenous sialic acid binding sites that can be unmasked by sialidase treatment. Truncation of sialic acid side chains on the soluble probes used for detection abolishes all binding, indicating the specificity of the interaction for the details of sialic acid structure. There is limited overlap between alpha2-6- and alpha2-3-sialic acid-specific binding sites, which are unmasked on monocytes, natural killer cells, a minority of mature T cells, neutrophils, and some cultured human leukemic cell lines. Activation with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore causes spontaneous exposure of some of the binding sites, occurring over a period of minutes on neutrophils and several hours on monocytes and U937 leukemia cells. Activation is accompanied by some evidence for desialylation of cell surface molecules. Thus, many human blood cells have specific binding sites for sialic acids, masked by endogenous sialylated ligands. Cellular activation can unmask these sites, possibly by the action of an endogenous sialidase. The nearly universal masking of such sites in unactivated blood cells could explain why many of these sialic acid-binding lectins have not been previously discovered. Similar considerations may apply to sialic acid binding lectins of other cell types and tissues.","['Razi, N', 'Varki, A']","['Razi N', 'Varki A']","['Glycobiology Program and Cancer Center, Divisions of Hematology-Oncology, and Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Glycobiology,Glycobiology,9104124,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Biotinylation', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Humans', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Lactose/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Lectins/*blood', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid/*metabolism', 'Neuraminidase/*pharmacology', 'Neutrophil Activation/*drug effects', 'Sialic Acids/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/27 00:00,1999/10/27 00:01,['1999/10/27 00:00'],"['1999/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Glycobiology. 1999 Nov;9(11):1225-34. doi: 10.1093/glycob/9.11.1225.,,,"['cwc113 [pii]', '10.1093/glycob/9.11.1225 [doi]']","['0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', '3J7TAL60G3 (N-acetylneuraminoyllactose)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)', 'J2B2A4N98G (Lactose)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']","['HL57345-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM32373/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

A common 677 C --> T polymorphism in the MTHFR gene results in thermolability and reduced MTHFR activity that decreases the pool of methylTHF and increases the pool of methyleneTHF. Recently, another polymorphism in MTHFR (1298 A --> C) has been identified that also results in diminished enzyme activity. We tested whether carriers of these variant alleles are protected from adult acute leukemia. We analyzed DNA from a case-control study in the United Kingdom of 308 adult acute leukemia patients and 491 age- and sex-matched controls. MTHFR variant alleles were determined by a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. The MTHFR 677TT genotype was lower among 71 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cases compared with 114 controls, conferring a 4.3-fold decrease in risk of ALL [odds ratio (OR = 0.23; 95% CI = 0.06-0.81]. We observed a 3-fold reduction in risk of ALL in individuals with the MTHFR 1298AC polymorphism (OR = 0.33; 95% CI = 0.15-0.73) and a 14-fold decreased risk of ALL in those with the MTHFR 1298CC variant allele (OR = 0.07; 95% CI = 0.00-1.77). In acute myeloid leukemia, no significant difference in MTHFR 677 and 1298 genotype frequencies was observed between 237 cases and 377 controls. Individuals with the MTHFR 677TT, 1298AC, and 1298CC genotypes have a decreased risk of adult ALL, but not acute myeloid leukemia, which suggests that folate inadequacy may play a key role in the development of ALL.","['Skibola, C F', 'Smith, M T', 'Kane, E', 'Roman, E', 'Rollinson, S', 'Cartwright, R A', 'Morgan, G']","['Skibola CF', 'Smith MT', 'Kane E', 'Roman E', 'Rollinson S', 'Cartwright RA', 'Morgan G']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA. martynts@uclink4.berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/genetics', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic']",1999/10/27 00:00,1999/10/27 00:01,['1999/10/27 00:00'],"['1999/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Oct 26;96(22):12810-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.22.12810.,,['Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Oct 26;96(22):12216-8.

We now show from analyses of growth-factor gene expression, protein production, and antibody inhibition studies that this deregulated growth can be explained, at least in part, by a novel differentiation-controlled autocrine mechanism. This mechanism involves the consistent and selective activation of IL-3 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) production and a stimulation of STAT5 phosphorylation in CD34(+) leukemic cells. When these cells differentiate into CD34(-) cells in vivo, IL-3 and G-CSF production declines, and the cells concomitantly lose their capacity for autonomous growth in vitro despite their continued expression of BCR-ABL. Based on previous studies of normal cells, excessive exposure of the most primitive chronic myeloid leukemia cells to IL-3 and G-CSF through an autocrine mechanism could explain their paradoxically decreased self-renewal in vitro and slow accumulation in vivo, in spite of an increased cycling activity and selective expansion of later compartments.","['Jiang, X', 'Lopez, A', 'Holyoake, T', 'Eaves, A', 'Eaves, C']","['Jiang X', 'Lopez A', 'Holyoake T', 'Eaves A', 'Eaves C']","['The Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC Canada V5Z 1L3.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'DNA Primers', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/27 00:00,1999/10/27 00:01,['1999/10/27 00:00'],"['1999/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Oct 26;96(22):12804-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.22.12804.,,,['10.1073/pnas.96.22.12804 [doi]'],"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,PMC23105,,,,,,,,,,

We studied 13 cancer sites, including 37,877 people. Data on familial and sporadic cancers were analyzed separately. We adjusted for age of spouse, year of diagnosis, and birth order. Rate ratios (RRs) were calculated by Poisson regression. Maternal age was associated with sporadic melanoma and leukemia, causing a 30% excess if mothers were more than 40 years vs. less than 20 years of age. A marginal effect of about 10% of both maternal and paternal age was observed for sporadic breast cancer. Paternal age increased the RR of sporadic nervous system cancer by about 15%. Accumulation of chromosomal aberrations and mutations during the maturation of germ cells may be a mechanism for these findings. In familial cancers of colon, melanoma, and thyroid, higher age showed an apparent protective effect, which was also noted for sporadic cervical cancer and melanoma. The results argue against major age-induced mutagenic/carcinogenic effects on germ cells as well as against age-induced adverse cancer-related hormonal effects during pregnancy. Because two or more mutations are required for adult cancers, however, these cancers may be an insensitive indicator of germ cell mutagenesis.","['Hemminki, K', 'Kyyronen, P']","['Hemminki K', 'Kyyronen P']","['Department of Biosciences at Novum, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Epidemiology,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",9009644,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Germ Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Maternal Age', 'Melanoma/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutagenesis', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Registries', '*Reproduction', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",1999/10/27 00:00,1999/10/27 00:01,['1999/10/27 00:00'],"['1999/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Epidemiology. 1999 Nov;10(6):747-51.,,,['00001648-199911000-00013 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transport characteristics of the mutated carrier were studied by transfection into the MTXrA line, which lacks endogenous RFC1 function. The level of expression of carrier in the cell lines studied was determined by specific surface binding of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-CH3-THF). Influx of 5-CH3-THF and 5-CHO-THF mediated by RFC1-S309F was 20- and 7-fold greater than that of MTX, respectively. Consistent with the influx difference between 5-CHO-THF and MTX, the growth requirement (EC50) for 5-CHO-THF in MTXrA-S309F cells was decreased by a factor of 9, while the MTX IC50 was reduced by a factor of only approximately 2 as compared with the recipient MTXrA cells. The decrease in 5-CH3-THF influx mediated by the mutated carrier was attributed to a decrease in the mobility of the 5-CH3-THF-carrier complex, since the influx Kt was essentially unchanged. However, the reduction in 5-CHO-THF and MTX influx was attributed to decreases in both carrier affinity and Vmax, although the decline in the MTX influx Vmax appeared to be much greater than for 5-CHO-THF. The inhibitory effect of chloride on 5-CHO-THF influx observed for L1210 cells was eliminated in the MTXrA-S309F line. This study represents another example of a single mutation in RFC1 that markedly impairs MTX influx but partially preserves transport of reduced folates when cells are selected with 5-CHO-THF as the available folate substrate. The data indicate that residues in the predicted eighth transmembrane domain of RFC1 can play an important role in the selectivity of folate binding and the mobility of the carrier-substrate complex.","['Zhao, R', 'Gao, F', 'Goldman, I D']","['Zhao R', 'Gao F', 'Goldman ID']","['Department of Medicine, The Albert Einstein Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chlorides/pharmacology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Complementary/analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Kinetics', 'Leucovorin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Phenylalanine/*metabolism', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Serine/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/27 00:00,1999/10/27 00:01,['1999/10/27 00:00'],"['1999/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1999 Nov 15;58(10):1615-24. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(99)00257-9.,,,"['S0006-2952(99)00257-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(99)00257-9 [doi]']","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (Slc19a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Slc19a2 protein, mouse)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",['CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

There are no clear data available from the literature on the therapeutic management of these patients who often suffer an unfavourable course. METHODS: Fourteen consecutive cases of biopsy-proven chronic liver disease fulfilling the following criteria were included: Child's A or B liver disease, hepatitis B surface antigen positive, HBV-DNA positive, antibody to HCV positive and HCV-RNA positive. Seven patients had chronic liver disease (group I), while the remaining seven patients (group II) had additional disorders (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (two), acute leukaemia (two), thalassaemia (two), chronic renal failure (one). Interferon alpha-2b (IFN) was given in a dose of 6 MIU thrice weekly for 6 months. Complete response was defined as loss of HBV-DNA and HCV-RNA at 6 months and sustained response (SR) as the sustained loss of HBV-DNA and HCV-RNA for more than 6 months during the follow-up period. RESULTS: At the end of 6 months, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels remained unchanged (120 +/- 40 vs 136 +/- 64 IU/L), but six of the seven (86%) patients in group I lost HBV-DNA. All three hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients lost HBeAg with an early flare of ALT (at 45 +/- 12 therapy days). Two of these patients (29%) lost HCV-RNA. Thus, SR was seen in 29%, while HBV-DNA loss was found in 100% during the follow-up period. In group II patients, there was a significant decrease in ALT (308 +/- 14 vs 65 +/- 25 IU/L, P < 0.001), but only three (43%) patients lost HBV-DNA and two (29%) lost HCV-RNA. One patient with acute leukaemia and another with renal failure had a complete response to IFN, but none of the lymphoma patients showed any antiviral response. CONCLUSIONS: In chronic hepatitis due to dual infection with HBV and HCV, interferon therapy is: (i) safe; (ii) effective (more so in clearing HBV); (iii) often associated with early ALT flare; and (iv) may be less effective if non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is present.","['Guptan, R C', 'Thakur, V', 'Raina, V', 'Sarin, S K']","['Guptan RC', 'Thakur V', 'Raina V', 'Sarin SK']","['Department of Gastroenterology, GB Pant Hospital, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Australia,J Gastroenterol Hepatol,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,8607909,IM,"['Adult', 'Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Asians', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Biopsy', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hepacivirus/genetics/immunology', 'Hepatitis B virus/genetics/immunology', 'Hepatitis B, Chronic/*complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy/ethnology', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic/*complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy/ethnology', 'Humans', 'India', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Serologic Tests', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/10/27 00:00,1999/10/27 00:01,['1999/10/27 00:00'],"['1999/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 1999 Sep;14(9):893-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1440-1746.1999.01952.x.,,,['10.1046/j.1440-1746.1999.01952.x [doi]'],"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We initially determined the expression of the different alternatively spliced TEL-AML1 mRNAs found in t(12;21) breakpoint variants I and II. We then optimized PCR primers for the RQ-PCR system and, using the t(12;21)+ REH cell line in spiking experiments, found a linear detection of TEL-AML1 over at least five logs. Moreover, 1 malignant cell in a background of 1,000,000 normal cells could be detected. The expression of the GAPDH, ABL, and beta(2)-microglobulin (beta2M) housekeeping genes were then compared in normal donors and in leukemic patients, and the very stably expressed beta2M was selected as an internal reference gene, allowing us to compensate for variation in RNA quality and day-to-day variation. In 12 samples from t(12;21)-positive patients at diagnosis, the levels of the TEL-AML1 fusion transcripts were found to vary up to 14-fold after normalization to beta2M. Interestingly, in samples obtained from seven patients at diagnosis, during induction chemotherapy, or relapse, the level of TEL-AML1 in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) was found to differ only by threefold, suggesting that MRD may be evaluated in PB samples in most patients. We conclude that this assay could set new standards for t(12;21) MRD detection with its accuracy, its high throughput, and its short turnover time for samples.

We have used SKY for comprehensive analysis of 20 myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) (13 primary MDSs, 3 therapy-related MDSs, and 4 acute leukemias developed from MDS, including 1 cell line established from a secondary leukemia), previously analyzed by G-banding. To locate the chromosomal breakpoints, DAPI-counterstained band images from all metaphases were transformed to G-band-like patterns. By using SKY, it was possible to identify the origin and organization of all clonal marker chromosomes (mar), as well as the origin of all abnormalities defined as additional material of unknown origin (add) or homogeneously staining regions (hsr) by G-banding. In total, SKY identified the chromosomal basis of 38 mar, add, and hsr, corrected 8 abnormalities misidentified by G-banding, and revealed 6 cryptic translocations in 5 cases. Total or partial chromosomal loss (mainly of -5/5q- and -7/7q-) is the most frequent cytogenetic abnormality in MDS. In 3 of 11 cases with -5/5q- and in 4 of 8 with -7/7q-, lost material was detected by SKY in unbalanced translocations. A total of 60 chromosomal losses were identified by G-banding in 16 cases with multiple chromosome abnormalities involving at least 3 chromosomes. For 26 of these losses (43%), SKY analysis suggested that the losses were not complete, but had been translocated to a variety of partner chromosomes. Moreover, SKY analysis revealed that a ring chromosome in a case of acute leukemia developed from MDS contained three to six segments that originated from chromosome 21 material. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed the amplification of the AML1 gene on regions derived from chromosome 21, providing the first evidence of amplification involving this gene in MDS.

The morphological, immunohistological, and molecular study of these cases has allowed us to detect precise distinctive features of this SMZL variant. The cases included here were characterized by massive splenomegaly and a morphological picture showing a micronodular pattern of splenic involvement with follicle replacement, biphasic cytology, and marginal zone differentiation. Unlike classical SMZL cases, a conspicuous component of larger lymphocytes was distributed in the marginal zone ring, occasionally overrunning it, with isolated presence of the same cells within the central small cell component and also in the red pulp. The bone marrow and peripheral lymph nodes showed similar histological findings to those described for SMZL in these locations. The genetic and molecular study of these cases showed no alterations specific to other lymphoma types, such as t14;18 and t11;14. Instead of this, it showed 7q loss in 3 of 5 cases, p53 inactivation in 2 of 6 cases, cyclinD1 overexpression in 2 of 6 cases, and the presence of translocations involving the 1q32 region in 2 of 4 cases.

To characterize the biosynthesis and processing of azurocidin, cDNA encoding human preproazurocidin was stably transfected to the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-1 and the murine myeloblast-like cell line 32D cl3; cell lines previously utilized to study the related proteins cathepsin G and proteinase 3. After 30 min of pulse radiolabeling, two forms of newly synthesized proazurocidin (34.5 and 37 kDa), differing in carbohydrate content but with protein cores of identical sizes, were recognized. With time, the 34.5-kDa form disappeared, while the 37-kDa form was further processed proteolytically, as judged by digestion with N-glycosidase F. Conversion of high-mannose oligosaccharides into complex forms was shown by acquisition of complete resistance to endoglycosidase H. Radiosequence analysis demonstrated that the amino-terminal seven amino acid propeptide of proazurocidin was removed in a stepwise manner during processing; initial removal of five amino acids was followed by cleavage of a dipeptide. Presence of the protease inhibitors Gly-Phe-diazomethyl ketone, bestatin, or leupeptin inhibited only the cleavage of the dipeptide, thus indicating the involvement of at least two amino-terminal processing enzymes. Translocation of azurocidin to granules was shown by subcellular fractionation. Similar results, with efficient biosynthesis, processing, and targeting to granules in both cell lines, were obtained with a mutant form of human preproazurocidin lacking the amino-terminal heptapropeptide. In conclusion, this investigation is an important addition to our previous studies on related azurophil granule proteins, and provides novel information concerning the biosynthesis and distinctive amino-terminal processing of human azurocidin.","['Lindmark, A', 'Garwicz, D', 'Rasmussen, P B', 'Flodgaard, H', 'Gullberg, U']","['Lindmark A', 'Garwicz D', 'Rasmussen PB', 'Flodgaard H', 'Gullberg U']","['Department of Hematology, Lund University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,IM,"['Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides', 'Asparagine/metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Blood Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Mice', 'Monocyte Chemoattractant Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Precursors/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/26 00:00,1999/10/26 00:01,['1999/10/26 00:00'],"['1999/10/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1999 Oct;66(4):634-43. doi: 10.1002/jlb.66.4.634.,,,['10.1002/jlb.66.4.634 [doi]'],"['0 (AZU1 protein, human)', '0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Monocyte Chemoattractant Proteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of note, the median Karnofsky performance status of both groups was 100% (range 70-100%), reflecting the low incidence of extensive chronic GVHD. Survival rates free of chronic GVHD were 52 vs. 42% (p = 0.29) for patients receiving CSA/MTX/PSE vs. CSA/PSE. The incidence of relapse was also similar in both groups of patients.

These protective effects are mediated by interferon (IFN)-gamma, whose early secretion is induced by IL-12 treatment. We investigated the relationship of IL-12 dose and timing of administration, as well as timing and type of total-body irradiation (TBI), with the ability of IL-12 to inhibit GVHD or mediate toxicity. The results show that a relatively low dose of IL-12 (as little as 50 U in a single injection) can mediate significant GVHD protection. The timing of IL-12 administration, however, is a critical factor. IL-12 administered 1 hour before BMT was most protective, but protection was still observed when it was administered 1-12 hours after BMT. Delaying IL-12 administration to 36 hours post-BMT completely obviated its protective effect. Administration of a second IL-12 injection 6 days after BMT negated the protective effect of an initial injection at the time of BMT. While IL-12 protection was evident when TBI was administered by 137Cs-irradiator in one or two fractions on day -1 or day 0, the use of an X-irradiator to deliver TBI on day -1 was associated with marked IL-12 toxicity. Whereas the protective effect of IL-12 against GVHD depended on donor-derived IFN-gamma, toxicity depended on the ability of host cells to produce IFN-gamma. Careful studies are warranted to test the effects of IL-12 in the context of BMT with various conditioning regimens in large animal preclinical models before this novel approach to GVHD protection can be applied clinically.","['Sykes, M', 'Pearson, D A', 'Taylor, P A', 'Szot, G L', 'Goldman, S J', 'Blazar, B R']","['Sykes M', 'Pearson DA', 'Taylor PA', 'Szot GL', 'Goldman SJ', 'Blazar BR']","['Transplantation Biology Research Center, Surgical Service, Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston 02129, USA. sykes@helix.mgh.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Cesium Radioisotopes/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control/radiotherapy', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-12/*administration & dosage/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Time Factors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*methods']",1999/10/26 00:00,1999/10/26 00:01,['1999/10/26 00:00'],"['1999/10/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 1999;5(5):277-84. doi: 10.1016/s1083-8791(99)70002-9.,,,"['S1083-8791(99)70002-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s1083-8791(99)70002-9 [doi]']","['0 (Cesium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']","['P01 AI35225/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI 34495/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA64912/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Transfusion-associated virus-transmission risks have significantly decreased, which suggests that white cell reduction by filtration eliminates any difference in the risk of alloimmunization in transfused leukemic patients. Health care reform pressures of make it appropriate to examine the cost-effectiveness of SDPs versus RDPs in reducing donor exposures. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A decision analysis model was developed and sensitivity analyses were used to assess the incremental cost (dollars/quality-adjusted life-year) associated with the use of SDPs versus RDPs for adult patients undergoing hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation or primary coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). RESULTS: Among transplant patients, the incremental cost of choosing SDPs as opposed to RDPs ranged from $168,700 to $519,822 per quality-adjusted life-year. For patients undergoing primary CABG, the incremental cost was $192,415 (females) and $216,280 (males). Variations in the cost differential between SDPs and RDPs, the number of random-donor platelets in the RDP, and the risk of bacterial sepsis markedly influenced cost-effectiveness. The model was minimally affected by variations in the risks of transmission of HIV and hepatitis B and C, and human T-lymphotropic viruses. CONCLUSION: In comparison with other accepted medical interventions, the use of SDPs as opposed to RDPs may not be a cost-effective method of reducing donor exposures in the adult patient populations studied. SDPs were more cost-effective in patients undergoing primary CABG than in leukemia patients undergoing hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation. Regardless of diagnosis, decreasing the acquisition cost differential would have the greatest impact on improving the cost-effectiveness of SDPs, as opposed to RDPs, to decrease donor exposures.","['Lopez-Plaza, I', 'Weissfeld, J', 'Triulzi, D J']","['Lopez-Plaza I', 'Weissfeld J', 'Triulzi DJ']","['Transfusion Service, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and the Central Blood Bank, The Institute For Transfusion Medicine, Pennsylvania, USA. ilopez-plaza@itxm.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['Adult', 'Bacterial Infections/epidemiology/transmission', '*Blood Donors/supply & distribution', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'HIV Infections/transmission', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hepatitis C/transmission', 'Humans', 'Platelet Transfusion/*economics/*methods', 'Quality of Life', 'Risk Assessment', 'Transfusion Reaction', 'Virus Diseases/epidemiology/mortality/transmission']",1999/10/26 00:00,1999/10/26 00:01,['1999/10/26 00:00'],"['1999/10/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 1999 Sep;39(9):925-32. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1999.39090925.x.,,,['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1999.39090925.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During third intensification, bone alkaline phosphatase, procollagen type I C-terminal propeptide, the carboxyterminal propeptide of type I collagen, procollagen type III N-terminal propeptide and lower leg length all decreased in response to dexamethasone, then returned to (but not beyond) baseline levels after dexamethasone was stopped and other drugs started. These changes were unrelated to circulating insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-3 or IGFBP-2. In all children, bone alkaline phosphatase remained below the population mean throughout.

All subjects also underwent magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological assessment 5 years after cessation of the therapy. Focal cerebral blood flow abnormalities were found in ECD-SPECT in 5 of the 8 survivors. Glucose utilisation appeared normal in the corresponding regions. However, glucose utilisation was decreased in thalamus and cerebellum in the survivors of ALL as compared with healthy controls. 3 patients had severe and 5 patients mild neurocognitive difficulties. The changes in cerebral blood flow and FDG uptake did not correspond neuroanatomically with the neurocognitive defects. Focal defects in cerebral blood flow in long-term survivors of ALL are not associated with changes in local cerebral glucose utilisation. Neurocognitive difficulties are not consistently associated with either changes in cerebral blood flow or with decreased glucose utilisation. Therefore, based on the present set of studies FDG-PET and ECD-SPECT cannot yet be recommended for the evaluation of long-term neurocognitive defects associated with treatment of ALL.","['Kahkonen, M', 'Harila-Saari, A', 'Metsahonkala, L', 'Korhonen, T', 'Norvasuo-Heila, M K', 'Utriainen, T', 'Ahonen, A', 'Bergman, J', 'Salmi, T T', 'Minn, H']","['Kahkonen M', 'Harila-Saari A', 'Metsahonkala L', 'Korhonen T', 'Norvasuo-Heila MK', 'Utriainen T', 'Ahonen A', 'Bergman J', 'Salmi TT', 'Minn H']","['Turku PET Centre, University of Turku, Finland. meri.kahkonen@pet.tyks.fi']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blood Flow Velocity', 'Blood Glucose/*metabolism', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/radiotherapy', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation/*physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition Disorders/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/radiotherapy', 'Survivors', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon']",1999/10/26 00:00,1999/10/26 00:01,['1999/10/26 00:00'],"['1999/10/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1999 Jul;35(7):1102-8. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(99)00053-2.,,,"['S0959804999000532 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(99)00053-2 [doi]']",['0 (Blood Glucose)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The protein that is defective in WAS, named WASP, appears to be involved in regulating changes in the cytoskeletal organisation of haematopoietic cells in response to external stimuli. In support of this idea, WASP has been found to be physically associated in haematopoietic cells in vivo with a number of SH3 domain-containing proteins involved in signal transduction, including the cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase Fyn. Here, we have used a baculovirus expression system to explore the biochemical consequences of the interaction between WASP and Fyn. We find that the kinase activity of Fyn is stimulated as a result of binding to WASP, and that a cellular protein, which may be WASP itself, becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine as a result of the binding of WASP to Fyn.","['Banin, S', 'Gout, I', 'Brickell, P']","['Banin S', 'Gout I', 'Brickell P']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Childhood Leukaemia, Molecular Haematology Unit, Institute of Child Health, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/drug effects/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*drug effects/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome/*metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein']",1999/10/26 00:00,1999/10/26 00:01,['1999/10/26 00:00'],"['1999/10/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 1999 Aug;26(3):173-7. doi: 10.1023/a:1006954206151.,,,['10.1023/a:1006954206151 [doi]'],"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (WAS protein, human)', '0 (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FYN protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though p53 is the most commonly mutated protein found in tumors, there does exist the remaining body of cancers that possess wild-type p53. Within the hematopoietic compartment, the majority of acute myelogenous leukemia isolates fall into this latter category ([174, 175,375-377], for example). In particular, it is found that in most AML isolates p53 is genotypically wild-type but found to have an immunophenotype typical of mutant p53, or in the promoter conformation [170, 174,175,377]. The clinical significance of the research which aims to discern the molecular machinery involved in p53 conformational modulation must certainly include the notion that a therapeutic modality may be developed which interferes with the molecular process of shifting p53 from a viability-compromising suppressor conformation to the survival-enhancing promoter conformation. Further studies that investigate the interface between cytokine signaling transduction cascades and the subsystem(s) regulating the redox state of p53 are critical to advancing this field.","['Ritchie, A', 'Broxmeyer, H E']","['Ritchie A', 'Broxmeyer HE']","['Department of Microbiology/Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, USA. aritchie@scripps.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*chemistry/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Thrombopoietin/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",1999/10/26 00:00,1999/10/26 00:01,['1999/10/26 00:00'],"['1999/10/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 1999 Aug;31(3):169-91. doi: 10.1016/s1040-8428(99)00018-9.,,,"['S1040842899000189 [pii]', '10.1016/s1040-8428(99)00018-9 [doi]']","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",,,,377,,,,,,,,,

Forty-eight percent organisms were isolated from blood, 16% from urine, 13% from wounds and superficial abscesses and 11% from respiratory tract. E. coli exhibited a great degree of resistance to the commonly used antibiotics, such as pipericillin (70%), ofloxacin (50%) and aztreonam (50%). Pseudomonas and klebsiella also showed varying degree of resistance against the antibiotics. Staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were almost universally resistant to penicillin and showed a variable degree of resistance to other antibiotics too.

The mechanisms of osteopenia in childhood malignancies have not been well established. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate changes in bone turnover and in bone hormonal metabolism in children with a malignancy at completion of their chemotherapy. PROCEDURE: Serum levels of human intact osteocalcin, type I collagen carboxyterminal propeptide (PICP), type I collagen carboxyterminal telopeptide (ICTP), 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25-(OH)-D], 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1, 25-(OH)(2)-D], intact parathyroid hormone, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), alkaline phosphatase, calcium, and phosphate were analyzed in 22 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and in 26 children with other malignancies. Results were expressed as Z-scores [mean (95% confidence intervals)] relative to healthy Caucasian-children. RESULTS: The marker of collagen degradation (ICTP) was significantly increased [1.43 (1.10-1.76), P < 0.0001] compared to reference values, whereas the markers of bone formation (PICP, osteocalcin) were not changed [0.07 (-0.55 to 0.49), 0.35 (-0.05 to 0.74), respectively, NS].

We describe the testing of ALL leukemia cells for the presence of DNA sequences of the polyomavirus family: JC virus, BK virus, and simian virus 40 (SV40). PROCEDURE: Cryopreserved leukemia cells from 25 children between 2 and 5 years of age at the time of diagnosis and classified as having ""common"" ALL (B-precursor ALL expressing the CD19 and CD10 surface antigens) were tested for the presence of polyomavirus sequences using standard PCR methods. RESULTS: Human beta-globin gene sequences were detected in 22 of 25 leukemia specimens. However, polyomavirus sequences were not detected in any of the 22 specimens with amplifiable DNA. CONCLUSIONS: The inability to detect JC virus, BK virus, and SV40 virus DNA sequences in any of the 22 specimens with amplifiable DNA suggests that that these members of the polyomavirus family are unlikely to be causally associated with most childhood ALL.

Each broad category of de novo AML that arises in infants and children, young adults, and the elderly, or, AML arising secondary to antecedent myelodysplasia (MDS) or prior exposure to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or environmental agents is characterized by distinct cytogenetic and molecular genetic abnormalities. Over the past 15 years, a number of these recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities have been cloned and characterized, yielding valuable insights into the mechanisms of leukemogenesis and providing powerful molecular tools for precise diagnosis and monitoring of minimal residual disease. As cytogenetic and molecular genetic characterization of AML cells is now considered crucial for both diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making, it is essential to have a working knowledge of the molecular basis of AML.

Ig/TCR V-(D)-J polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification has largely replaced Southern blotting, and the techniques of PCR product analysis are evolving rapidly. V-(D)-J errors are often involved in genetic abnormalities leading to lymphoid malignancies, with consequent deregulated expression of the associated proto-oncogenes.

It is an attractive and logical proposition to use this difference within the lymphoma cell to eradicate the malignant process. One such new therapeutic approach based on the ""silencing"" of genes involved in the prevention of apoptosis is Bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide (AO) therapy. In the field of lymphoma, obvious targets included follicular lymphoma with the t(15;18) translocation, which results in deregulated expression of the Bcl-2 gene, chemoresistance, and subsequent protection against lymphoma cell death. Targeting the initiating codon of the Bcl-2 gene decreases both cell viability and Bcl-2 protein expression in lymphoma and leukemia cell lines that overexpress Bcl-2. Preclinical toxicity studies using a Bcl-2 AO G3139 (Genta, San Diego, CA) show good tolerance at a dose of 10 mg/kg, which is considerably higher than the dose required for good antilymphoma efficacy. In a phase I clinical study, G3139 was well tolerated with minimal toxicity in a dose escalation up to 147.2 mg/m2/d. Evidence of efficacy includes a responder with stage IVB follicular lymphoma who achieved complete clinical and radiologic response that has lasted more than 2 years. The main dose-limiting toxicity has been reversible thrombocytopenia related to the thioate backbone. Other antisense reagents are also in development to combat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). These include oligonucleotides that target the messages of the Bcl-X(L) and protein kinase-Calpha (PKCalpha) genes. AOs may also have an application in tumors expressing mutant p53. AOs against MDM2 genes have shown the ability to restore wild-type p53 expression, suggesting that as oncogenic pathways are unraveled, normal cell growth and death patterns may be restored by molecular manipulation. Downregulation of antiapoptosis by AOs in the human setting has low toxicity and antilymphoma activity in cases in which conventional chemotherapy has failed. In the future, antisense therapy followed by chemotherapy may overcome chemoresistance to provide effective therapy for a range of malignancies.","['Cotter, F E']",['Cotter FE'],"['Department of Experimental Hematology, St. Bartholomew Royal London School of Medicine, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,IM,"['Animals', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*therapeutic use']",1999/10/26 00:00,1999/10/26 00:01,['1999/10/26 00:00'],"['1999/10/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1999 Oct;36(4 Suppl 6):9-14.,,,,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)']",,,,29,,,,,,,,,

Studies performed to date have investigated the use of such antibodies in an unmodified state, combined with potent chemicals to form immunotoxins or combined with various radionuclides. Encouraging results have been obtained in all three settings. The CD33 antigen is expressed by most early myeloid cells and by more than 90% of cases of AML but is not present on the hematopoietic stem cell. Initial in vivo studies with an unmodified murine anti-CD33 antibody in patients with AML demonstrated that the antibody quickly bound to leukemia cells and that the antigen-antibody complex rapidly internalized following cell binding. However, when administered to patients with overt leukemia, unmodified antibody resulted in only brief decreases in peripheral blast counts, not in sustained response. A number of CD33-based immunotoxins have also been studied, including a calicheamicin conjugate, CMA-676. In a phase I dose-escalation study of patients with refractory AML, CMA-676 was well tolerated with the only consistent toxicities being the development of fevers and chills several hours after administration and the subsequent development of temporary pancytopenia. A phase III study has been performed involving patients with AML in first relapse. An interim analysis of the first 23 patients found that in 10, treatment with CMA-676 resulted in elimination of blasts from peripheral blood and marrow. This was achieved with far less toxicity than seen with standard chemotherapy. Radiolabeled antibodies have been explored as a stand-alone treatment or in the context of bone marrow transplantation. In an effort to avoid toxicities to normal stem cells residing alongside leukemic cells in the marrow, studies have been performed to explore the use of 231Bi conjugated to an anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody. The short path length of this alpha-emitter could theoretically allow killing of the targeted leukemic cell without damage to normal neighbors. Of 12 patients with recurrent AML who received this drug, eight had reductions in marrow and peripheral blast counts. Complete remissions (CRs) have not been observed to date. Another set of studies focused on the use of radiolabeled antibodies to deliver radiation specifically to sites of leukemia as part of a transplant preparative regimen. In a phase I clinical trial, 131I-labeled anti-CD45 antibody delivered at least threefold more radiotherapy to spleen and marrow than any other organ. In a phase II trial, among 25 AML patients in first remission, 22 are alive and in remission for periods up to 6 years.","['Appelbaum, F R']",['Appelbaum FR'],"['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/immunology/therapeutic use']",1999/10/26 00:00,1999/10/26 00:01,['1999/10/26 00:00'],"['1999/10/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 1999 Oct;36(4 Suppl 6):2-8.,,,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",['CA-44991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,29,,,,,,,,,

The objective was to explore potential associations for cancer diseases beyond those extensively studied before (leukemia and brain tumors). METHODS: Exposure was assessed from Census information on occupations that were linked to a job exposure matrix based on measurements. In a basic analysis, three levels of exposure were used. In addition, subjects with a more definite low exposure were compared with an aggregate of occupations with more definite exposures. RESULTS: Observed associations were weak and there were no evident exposure-response relationships. For all cancer, an approximate 10% increase in risk was seen in the medium and high exposure groups. Several types of cancer were associated with exposure among men, including cancer of the colon, biliary passages and liver, larynx and lung, testis, kidney, urinary organs, malignant melanoma, non-melanoma skin cancer, astrocytoma III-IV. For women, associations were seen for cancer of the lung, breast, corpus uteri, malignant melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: In the analysis of occupations with a more definite exposure, the most notable finding for men was an increased risk of testicular cancer in young workers, and for women a clear association emerged for cancer of the corpus uteri. The outcome suggests an interaction with the endocrine/immune system.","['Floderus, B', 'Stenlund, C', 'Persson, T']","['Floderus B', 'Stenlund C', 'Persson T']","['Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,IM,"['Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Testicular Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Uterine Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology']",1999/10/26 00:00,1999/10/26 00:01,['1999/10/26 00:00'],"['1999/10/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 1999 Oct;10(5):323-32. doi: 10.1023/a:1008953920877.,,,['10.1023/a:1008953920877 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 432 myeloma patients for this study were derived from 4 prospective multicentre trials of the Finnish Leukaemia Group. The comparisons of the response rate to primary chemotherapy, progression-free survival time (PFS), response rate after first relapse and overall survival time (OS) were made between patients treated in 3 hospital categories according to annual enrolment rate. 273 of the patients had been treated in ""large"" hospitals, 120 in ""intermediate"" and 38 in ""small"" ones. The median OS of patients aged up to 70 yr was 49 months and that of patients older than 70 yr was 31 months. There were no significant differences in response rate, PFS, response rate after first relapse and OS between the hospital categories. The most important endpoints in the treatment of multiple myeloma, response rate, PFS and OS are independent of the size of the hospital, measured as the number of annual patient entries in the trial. This allows the decentralisation of the conventional chemotherapy of multiple myeloma, within the framework of properly organised clinical trials.","['Oivanen, T', 'Kellokumpu-Lehtinen, P', 'Koivisto, A M', 'Koivunen, E']","['Oivanen T', 'Kellokumpu-Lehtinen P', 'Koivisto AM', 'Koivunen E']","['Department of Oncology, Tampere University Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy/mortality', 'Patient Selection', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/10/26 00:00,1999/10/26 00:01,['1999/10/26 00:00'],"['1999/10/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1999 Oct;63(4):225-30. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01882.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01882.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that age at presentation and presence of secondary AML were significantly correlated to leukaemia cell Ara-C resistance. Thus, analysis of in vitro drug resistance data revealed that age at presentation and presence of secondary leukaemia were both independently correlated to cellular drug resistance, with older age being associated with higher Ara-C resistance in vitro (p=0.02 and 0.01 in univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively) and with secondary leukaemia being associated with higher Ara-C resistance (p=0.04 and 0.059 in univariate and multivariate analysis, respectively). Median LC-50 values (Ara-C) were: 178 ng/ml in paediatric cases, 356 ng/ml in younger adult cases, and 584 ng/ml in elderly (age > or = 60 yr) cases giving a resistance ratio between these age subgroups of 1:2.0:3.3. Median LC-50 values (Ara-C) was 381 ng/ml in de novo cases as opposed to 891 ng/ml (resistance ratio 1:2.3) in secondary cases. By contrast, cytogenetic findings, presenting leucocyte count, FAB-subtype, and gender were not consistently correlated to in vitro drug resistance to any of the three drugs. We conclude that at least two major adverse prognostic factors in AML (advanced age at presentation and presence of secondary leukaemia) are associated with increased leukaemia cell Ara-C resistance. High leucocyte count is not associated with increased cellular drug resistance towards Acla, Ara-C or Dau.","['Norgaard, J M', 'Olesen, G', 'Kristensen, J S', 'Pedersen, B', 'Hokland, P']","['Norgaard JM', 'Olesen G', 'Kristensen JS', 'Pedersen B', 'Hokland P']","['Department of Medicine and Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus Amtssygehus, Denmark. janmaxgaard@dadlnet.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Aclarubicin/therapeutic use', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Tetrazolium Salts']",1999/10/26 00:00,1999/10/26 00:01,['1999/10/26 00:00'],"['1999/10/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1999 Oct;63(4):219-24. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01881.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01881.x [doi]'],"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using primers directed to the framework regions (FR) 1, 2 and 3 of the IgH gene, clonal IgH rearrangements were observed in 82, 58 and 58%, respectively, whereas clonality was presented in 45 and 27% using primers hybridising to the TCR delta and gamma genes. A combination of all five primer sets used resulted in 96% positive cases (children 100%, adults 88%). The frequency of clonal IgH rearrangements correlated to patient age with a significantly lower fraction of positive cases in the adult group. The concomitant usage of more than one V(H) family gene was similar for childhood and adult ALL, and an over-representation of V(H)6 rearrangements was found in childhood ALL. Twenty-five out of 91 cases (27%) displayed an oligoclonal pattern for either IgH or TCR gene rearrangements (children 37%, adults 12%). A comparative analysis of samples from different compartments was performed in 23 patients, and differences between two or three compartments were observed in seven cases. Unexpectedly large, clonally appearing PCR products of 540-715 bp were found in three leukemias and sequence analysis verified their clonal nature. In summary, using multiple sets of primers clonal rearrangements of IgH and TCR genes can be detected in a very high frequency, including previously neglected large size PCR products. A common heterogeneity was demonstrated in different compartments reflecting ongoing clonal evolution, which can make detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in ALL troublesome. Therefore, we suggest that a minimum of three targets should be used to minimise false-negative results.","['Li, A H', 'Rosenquist, R', 'Forestier, E', 'Holmberg, D', 'Lindh, J', 'Lofvenberg, E', 'Roos, G']","['Li AH', 'Rosenquist R', 'Forestier E', 'Holmberg D', 'Lindh J', 'Lofvenberg E', 'Roos G']","['Department of Pathology, Umea University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Child', 'Clone Cells/*physiology', '*DNA Primers', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",1999/10/26 00:00,1999/10/26 00:01,['1999/10/26 00:00'],"['1999/10/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1999 Oct;63(4):211-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01880.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01880.x [doi]'],['0 (DNA Primers)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: There were 62 infants with ALL who were treated between 1977 and 1995 at 30 institutions affiliated with the Tokyo Children's Cancer Study Group. Clinical and laboratory data obtained from these infants (all under 1 year of age) were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: The morphological diagnoses were FAB-L1 for 51 patients (82.2%) and FAB-L2 for 11 patients (17.8%). Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were found in 40 (70.0%) and 40 patients (68.3%), respectively. The mean (+/- SEM) leukocyte count at diagnosis was 205,900 +/- 35,700/microL. The involvement of the central nervous system was evident in nine of 36 patients who were subjected to lumbar puncture, while three of these nine patients were free of neurological symptoms at diagnosis. Thirty-one patients (55.4%) were CD10 negative and 14 (25.0%) were CD10 positive. Thirty-one of 47 patients (65.9%) exhibited chromosomal abnormalities, including 28 patients (59.6%) with 11q23 abnormalities. Rearrangements in the MLL gene were found in nine of 13 infants (69.2%) examined. Translocation of 11q23 and/or MLL gene rearrangement (11q23/MLL) was significantly associated with the absence of the CD10 antigen.

Summary of the Vienna Mastocytosis Meeting 1998.,1-7,"The term mastocytosis denotes a heterogenous group of disorders characterized by abnormal growth and accumulation of mast cells in one or more organs. Cutaneous and systemic variants of the disease have been described. Mast cell disorders have also been categorized according to other aspects, such as family history, age, course of disease, or presence of a concomitant myeloid neoplasm. However, so far, generally accepted disease criteria are missing. Recently, a number of diagnostic (disease-related) markers have been identified in mastocytosis research. These include the mast cell enzyme tryptase, CD2, and mast cell growth factor receptor c-kit (CD117). Several gain-of-function-mutations in the kinase domain of c-kit appear to occur in mastocytosis supporting the clonal (neoplastic) nature of the disease. Also, certain point mutations appear to be associated with distinct variants of mastocytosis, i.e. Asp-816-->Val with a subset of sporadic persistent (systemic) mastocytosis (mostly adults), and Gly-839-->Lys with (a subset of) typical pediatric (mostly cutaneous) mastocytosis. Another potential indicator of mast cell neoplasm is the T-/NK-cell-associated marker CD2. This antigen (LFA-2) is abnormally expressed on neoplastic mast cells in cases of systemic mastocytosis or mast cell leukemia, but not found on normal mast cells. The mast cell enzyme tryptase is increasingly used as a serum- and immunohistochemical marker to estimate the actual spread of disease (burden of neoplastic mast cells). The clinical significance of novel mastocytosis markers is currently under investigation. First results indicate that they may be useful to define reliable criteria for the delineation of the disease.","['Valent, P', 'Escribano, L', 'Parwaresch, R M', 'Schemmel, V', 'Schwartz, L B', 'Sotlar, K', 'Sperr, W R', 'Horny, H P']","['Valent P', 'Escribano L', 'Parwaresch RM', 'Schemmel V', 'Schwartz LB', 'Sotlar K', 'Sperr WR', 'Horny HP']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Congress', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Chymases', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mast Cells/pathology', '*Mastocytosis/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Serine Endopeptidases/blood', 'Terminology as Topic', 'Tryptases']",1999/10/26 00:00,1999/10/26 00:01,['1999/10/26 00:00'],"['1999/10/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 1999 Sep;120(1):1-7. doi: 10.1159/000024214.,,,"['24214 [pii]', '10.1159/000024214 [doi]']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (chymase 2)', 'EC 3.4.21.39 (Chymases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",,,,67,,,,,,,,,

The results obtained indicated that ATRA and G-CSF, either alone or in combination, were effective in inducing NAP activity in CML cells, whereas GM-CSF was not. Further, NAP restoration in ATRA- and G-CSF-treated cultures was accompanied by increased morphologic differentiation of the CML clone.

This study examined levels of tallimustine lesions in intracellular DNA, their sequence- and region-specificity, and the long-range distribution of the drug binding motif. Tallimustine adducts in DNA converted to strand breaks by heating allowed the quantitation of drug lesions. In bulk DNA of intact human leukemia CEM cells, tallimustine formed 0.15 +/- 0.04 and 0.64 +/- 0.18 lesions/kbp at 5 and 50 microM, respectively. These lesions represent monoadducts as no interstrand cross-links or DNA-protein cross-links were detected. Tallimustine adducts in intracellularly treated DNA showed a general preference for sequences with T-tracts, suggesting a propensity for intrinsically bent motifs. Major drug-adducted sites identified by repetitive primer extension, included 5'-TTTTGPu-3' and 5'-TTTTGC-3' motif. Despite the high specificity at the nucleotide level, tallimustine did not differentiate among bulk DNA and three discrete AT-rich regions of genomic DNA examined by quantitative PCR stop assay with lesion frequencies ranging from 0.23 to 0.39 lesions/kbp at 25 microM drug. In comparisons of lesion frequencies and cytotoxicity, tallimustine adducts are approximately 50 times more lethal than relatively nonsequence specific cisplatin adducts but are >100 times less lethal than lesions by an unrelated AT-specific drug, bizelesin. However, the 5'-TTTTGPu-3' motifs targeted by tallimustine are relatively infrequent and scattered throughout the genome. In contrast, the motifs 5'-T(A/T)(4)A-3' motifs targeted by bizelesin, while also infrequent, cluster in defined AT-rich islands. The lack of region-specificity may be the reason tallimustine adducts, despite high AT-specificity at the nucleotide level, are less lethal than region-specific bizelesin adducts.","['Herzig, M C', 'Trevino, A V', 'Arnett, B', 'Woynarowski, J M']","['Herzig MC', 'Trevino AV', 'Arnett B', 'Woynarowski JM']","['Cancer Therapy and Research Center, Institute for Drug Development, San Antonio, Texas 78245, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Adenine/chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*chemistry/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/drug effects/genetics', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/chemistry', 'DNA Adducts/chemistry/metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/chemistry/metabolism', 'Distamycins/*chemistry/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*chemistry/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Thymine/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/21 00:00,1999/10/21 00:01,['1999/10/21 00:00'],"['1999/10/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1999 Oct 19;38(42):14045-55. doi: 10.1021/bi991286r.,,,"['bi991286r [pii]', '10.1021/bi991286r [doi]']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Distamycins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '71193OXG6S (tallimustine)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'QR26YLT7LT (Thymine)']",['CA71969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The important role of NCp10 (or NCp7 for HIV-1) in the retroviral life cycle seems mainly related to their preferential binding to single-stranded nucleic acids. We report here the structure of the complex formed between the biologically active (14-53)NCp10 and the oligonucleotide d(ACGCC) in aqueous solution determined by 2D (1)H NMR based methods. The aromatic residue Trp(35) of NCp10 directs nucleic acid complexation as shown by its complete fluorescence quenching upon addition of d(ACGCC). (1)H and (31)P NMR studies support the insertion of Trp(35) between the G(3) and C(4) bases. A total of 577 NOE distance restraints, of which 40 were intermolecular, were used for the structure determination. The zinc finger provides a well-defined surface for the binding of d(ACGCC) through hydrophobic interactions and tryptophan stacking on the guanine. This latter interaction was also observed in the NMR-derived structures of the complexes between NCp7, which contains two successive zinc fingers, and single-stranded DNA and RNA, supporting the proposal for a major role played by aromatic residues of NCp proteins in nucleic acid recognition. Upon binding to the nucleotide a new loop in NCp10 that participates in the intermolecular interaction is formed. Additional interactions provided by positively charged residues surrounding the zinc finger appear necessary for tight binding. The structure of the complex NCp10-d(ACGCC) gives a structural explanation for the loss of virus infectivity following point mutations in the finger domain.","['Schuler, W', 'Dong, C', 'Wecker, K', 'Roques, B P']","['Schuler W', 'Dong C', 'Wecker K', 'Roques BP']","['Departement de Pharmacochimie Moleculaire et Structurale, INSERM U266-CNRS UMR 8600, UFR des Sciences Pharmaceutiques et Biologiques, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Capsid/*chemistry', '*Capsid Proteins', 'Gene Products, gag/*chemistry', 'HIV-1/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*chemistry', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular/methods', 'Oligonucleotides/*chemistry', 'Phosphorus Isotopes', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protons', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Viral Core Proteins/*chemistry', '*Viral Proteins', '*Zinc Fingers', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1999/10/21 00:00,1999/10/21 00:01,['1999/10/21 00:00'],"['1999/10/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1999 Oct 5;38(40):12984-94. doi: 10.1021/bi990378d.,,,"['bi990378d [pii]', '10.1021/bi990378d [doi]']","['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (NCP7 protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Phosphorus Isotopes)', '0 (Protons)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '129924-33-0 (retroviral nucleocapsid protein NCp10, Moloney murine leukemia', 'virus)']",,,,,,['PDB/1A6B'],,,,,,,

Advances in our understanding of the mechanics of immune activation have led to development of immune-based strategies for gene therapy of cancer. Preliminary findings in a phase I trial of one such approach in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are encouraging.

The rationale for hepatic arterial chemotherapy has both an anatomical and pharmacological basis. Several randomized clinical studies of fluoropyrimidine showed higher response rates in all trials when the drug was given as an hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) versus systemic administration. However, the studies did not accurately define survival for the following reasons: (1) some allowed a crossover; (2) some were too small; and (3) some used inadequate systemic chemotherapy. Patients who have failed to respond to previous systemic chemotherapy have an approximately 50% response rate with HAI treatment. Hepatic toxicity, especially biliary sclerosis, is the dose-limiting toxicity, occurring in 6% to 25% of patients. Adding dexamethasone to HAI fluoropyrimidine decreases the hepatobiliary toxicity. The therapeutic benefit of HAI in one study was also demonstrated by an increased time with normal quality of life. To truly define the role of regional therapy in patients with CRC confined to the liver, the current Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) study is randomizing patients to HAI versus systemic therapy without a crossover to demonstrate if HAI improves survival and/or quality of life in addition to response rates.","['Kemeny, N E', 'Ron, I G']","['Kemeny NE', 'Ron IG']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Catheterization', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Hepatic Artery', 'Humans', '*Infusion Pumps, Implantable/adverse effects/economics', 'Infusions, Intra-Arterial', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*secondary', 'Quality of Life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survival Analysis']",1999/10/21 00:00,1999/10/21 00:01,['1999/10/21 00:00'],"['1999/10/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1999 Oct;26(5):524-35.,,,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,75,,,,,,,,,

Juvenile nephronophthisis (NPH1) is the most common genetic cause of renal failure in children and maps to chromosome 2q12-q13. The responsible gene NPHP1 has been identified and encodes for nephrocystin. Not all families with NPH demonstrate linkage to that locus. METHODS: We studied six families with NPH without linkage to the NPH1 locus. In order to attempt identification of a new causative gene, the candidate genes ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) and Bcl-2 (B cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 gene) originating from mouse models, were examined. For the six families highly polymorphic microsatellites covering the whole candidate gene regions were haplotyped and linkage analysis was performed. RESULTS: Haplotype analyses of all families examined were incompatible with linkage of the disease status to ACE or Bcl-2. Linkage analysis excluded both candidate gene regions with a LOD-score of < -2. CONCLUSIONS: This study excluded the candidate genes ACE and Bcl-2 for NPH. Additional linkage studies need to be performed in order to identify further genes responsible for nephronophthisis.","['Omran, H', 'Haffner, K', 'Vollmer, M', 'Pigulla, J', 'Wagner, G', 'Caridi, G', 'Hildebrandt, F']","['Omran H', 'Haffner K', 'Vollmer M', 'Pigulla J', 'Wagner G', 'Caridi G', 'Hildebrandt F']","[""University Children's Hospital Freiberg, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nephrol Dial Transplant,"Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",8706402,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Child', '*Chromosome Mapping', '*Genes, bcl-2', 'Genetic Linkage/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lod Score', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A/*genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Polycystic Kidney, Autosomal Recessive/*genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases']",1999/10/21 00:00,1999/10/21 00:01,['1999/10/21 00:00'],"['1999/10/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nephrol Dial Transplant. 1999 Oct;14(10):2328-31. doi: 10.1093/ndt/14.10.2328.,,,['10.1093/ndt/14.10.2328 [doi]'],"['0 (Arabidopsis Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (NPH1 protein, Arabidopsis)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.15.1 (Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantitative analysis of apoptosis parameters on semi-fine sections obtained from peripheral blood was performed prior and during the first five days of therapy. The level of spontaneous apoptosis (SA) was determined, as well as the maximal response by apoptosis (MAR), and the time needed to establish maximal response by apoptosis (TMAR), respectively. The results revealed that the level of SA in the studied group of patients was 11.39%-20.50%. In three patients with achieved criteria for complete remission (CR) was observed high level of SA, TMAR 2-4 days and MAR 23.42-26.36%, respectively.

Although previous studies demonstrated this kinase to have oncogenic potential, it is not known whether axl actively participates in the onset and/or progression of CML. We addressed this question by generating transgenic mice possessing constitutive ectopic expression of human axl throughout cells of the myeloid hematopoietic lineage through the use of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) receptor promoter. The transgenics did not exhibit hematopoietic malignancies, but did exhibit phenotypic characteristics associated with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) including hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, severe insulin resistance, progressive obesity, hepatic lipidosis, and pancreatic islet dysplasia. The obese-diabetes phenotype was similar to that observed in the agouti and melanocortin-4(-/-) mutants, however the axl transgenics were not hyperphagic. Axl transgenic animals expressed elevated serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels that were further enhanced upon in vitro lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of peripheral blood. Administration of the axl ligand, gas6, to peripheral transgenic blood samples eliminated excessive TNF-alpha production in response to LPS stimulation. As a means to better understand axl-gas6 biology, transgenic animals were produced which systemically expressed the gas6-binding axl proteolytic cleavage product. A more severe NIDDM phenotype occurred in these mice. The observed phenotypes may be related to the axl receptor or proteolytic cleavage product competing with related axl family receptors for binding of the gas6 ligand. We conclude that axl expression in myeloid cells in itself does not lead to the onset or progression of leukemia and suggest that ectopic axl expression affects endogenous modulation of TNF-alpha production indirectly resulting in the NIDDM phenotype.","['Augustine, K A', 'Rossi, R M', 'Van, G', 'Housman, J', 'Stark, K', 'Danilenko, D', 'Varnum, B', 'Medlock, E']","['Augustine KA', 'Rossi RM', 'Van G', 'Housman J', 'Stark K', 'Danilenko D', 'Varnum B', 'Medlock E']","['Department of Cell Biology, Amgen, Inc., Thosand Oaks, California, USA. karen_a_augustine@sbphrd.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*enzymology/*genetics/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Islets of Langerhans/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/genetics', 'Liver/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Rats', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Testis/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",1999/10/21 00:00,1999/10/21 00:01,['1999/10/21 00:00'],"['1999/10/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1999 Dec;181(3):433-47. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199912)181:3<433::AID-JCP7>3.0.CO;2-Y.,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199912)181:3<433::AID-JCP7>3.0.CO;2-Y [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199912)181:3<433::AID-JCP7>3.0.CO;2-Y [doi]']","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (axl receptor tyrosine kinase)']",,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

A simple and effective method for controlling the fate of naive or primed T-lymphocytes in vivo without eliminating their beneficial properties is needed. In this report, photochemical treatment (PCT) ex vivo with a synthetic psoralen (S-59) and UVA light was evaluated as a pharmacological approach to limiting the proliferation and GVH potential of naive and primed donor T cells in vivo. S-59 rapidly intercalates into and cross-links DNA on UVA illumination. The effects of PCT on T cells were found to be both S-59 and UVA dose dependent. With selected PCT regimens, treated T cells still expressed activation markers (CD25 and CD69) and secreted IL-2 on activation, but they showed limited proliferative capacity in vitro and in vivo. Clonal expansion of CTL in MLR was reduced after PCT, but short term lytic activity of primed CTL was not affected. In a murine model of MHC-mismatched bone marrow transplantation, the addition of PCT-treated T cells to T-depleted bone marrow facilitated donor engraftment and complete chimerism without causing acute or chronic graft-vs-host disease. Allospecific GVL reactivity was reduced but not eliminated after PCT treatment. In an MHC-matched model using host-presensitized donor T cells, PCT significantly reduced GVH-associated mortality without eliminating GVL reactivity. Thus, PCT ex vivo offers a simple, rapid, and inexpensive method by which to control the fate of naive and primed T cells in vivo.","['Truitt, R L', 'Johnson, B D', 'Hanke, C', 'Talib, S', 'Hearst, J E']","['Truitt RL', 'Johnson BD', 'Hanke C', 'Talib S', 'Hearst JE']","['Department of Pediatrics and Cancer Center, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226, USA. rtruitt@mcw.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clonal Anergy/drug effects', 'Cytokines/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Ficusin/pharmacology', '*Furocoumarins', 'Graft vs Host Reaction/drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'PUVA Therapy/*methods', 'Radiation Chimera/immunology', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1999/10/21 00:00,1999/10/21 00:01,['1999/10/21 00:00'],"['1999/10/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Nov 1;163(9):5145-56.,,,['ji_v163n9p5145 [pii]'],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Furocoumarins)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'K1LDZ0VBC0 (amotosalen)', 'KTZ7ZCN2EX (Ficusin)']",['CA39854/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

HLA-A24-restricted and tumor-specific CTLs established from T cells infiltrating into lung adenocarcinoma recognized the two antigenic peptides encoded by a cyclophilin B gene, a family of genes for cyclophilins involved in T cell activation. These two cyclophilin B peptides at positions 84-92 and 91-99 induced HLA-A24-restricted CTL activity against tumor cells in PBMCs of leukemia patients, but not in epithelial cancer patients or in healthy donors. In contrast, the modified peptides at position 2 from phenylalanine to tyrosine, which had more than 10 times higher binding affinities to HLA-A24 molecules, could induce HLA-A24-restricted CTL activity against tumor cells in PBMCs from leukemia patients, epithelial cancer patients, or healthy donors. PHA-activated normal T cells were resistant to lysis by the CTL line or by these peptide-induced CTLs. These results indicate that a cyclophilin B gene encodes antigenic epitopes recognized by CTLs at the tumor site, although T cells in peripheral blood (except for those from leukemia patients) are immunologically tolerant to the cyclophilin B.

Although the long-term effects of breast-feeding on childhood cancer have not been studied extensively, a protective effect against childhood Hodgkin's disease and lymphoma has been suggested previously from small investigations. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that breast-feeding decreases the risk of childhood acute leukemia. METHODS: A total of 1744 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 1879 matched control subjects, aged 1-14 years, and 456 children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 539 matched control subjects, aged 1-17 years, were included in the analysis. Information regarding breast-feeding was obtained through telephone interviews with mothers. All leukemias combined, histologic type of leukemia (ALL versus AML), immunophenotype of ALL (early pre-B cell, pre-B cell, or T cell), and morphology of AML were assessed separately in the data analysis. RESULTS: Ever having breast-fed was found to be associated with a 21% reduction in risk of childhood acute leukemias (odds ratio [OR] for all types combined = 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.70-0.91). A reduction in risk was seen separately for AML (OR = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.57-1.03) and ALL (OR = 0.80; 95% CI = 0.69-0.93). The inverse associations were stronger with longer duration of breast-feeding for total ALL and AML; for M0, M1, and M2 morphologic subtypes of AML; and for early pre-B-cell ALL. CONCLUSION: In this study, breast-feeding was associated with a reduced risk of childhood acute leukemia. If confirmed in additional epidemiologic studies, our findings suggest that future epidemiologic and experimental efforts should be directed at investigating the anti-infective and/or immune-stimulatory or immune-modulating effects of breast-feeding on leukemogenesis in children.","['Shu, X O', 'Linet, M S', 'Steinbuch, M', 'Wen, W Q', 'Buckley, J D', 'Neglia, J P', 'Potter, J D', 'Reaman, G H', 'Robison, L L']","['Shu XO', 'Linet MS', 'Steinbuch M', 'Wen WQ', 'Buckley JD', 'Neglia JP', 'Potter JD', 'Reaman GH', 'Robison LL']","['Division of Pediatric Epidemiology and Clinical Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', '*Breast Feeding', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*prevention & control']",1999/10/21 00:00,1999/10/21 00:01,['1999/10/21 00:00'],"['1999/10/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1999 Oct 20;91(20):1765-72. doi: 10.1093/jnci/91.20.1765.,,,['10.1093/jnci/91.20.1765 [doi]'],,"['CA13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA48051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene-knockout studies in mice have demonstrated that TAL1 is required for embryonic and adult haematopoiesis, and considerable evidence suggests it also has important functions in terminal erythroid differentiation. We reported previously that TAL1 phosphorylation is stimulated by erythropoietin in splenic proerythroblasts isolated from mice infected with the anaemia-inducing strain of Friend virus and show here the signalling pathway responsible. Erythropoietin was found to stimulate nuclear mitogen-activated protein kinase activity in addition to TAL1 protein phosphorylation, both of which were quantitatively inhibited by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD 098059 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Tryptic phosphopeptide analysis of radiolabelled TAL1 immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts of Friend virus-induced proerythroblasts revealed that phosphorylation of Ser(122), shown previously to be a substrate for the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK1 (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase) in vitro, was specifically, although not exclusively, increased by erythropoietin and inhibited by wortmannin and PD 098059. These results are consistent with an erythropoietin-stimulated signalling pathway in which there is direct activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and identify TAL1 as one of its nuclear targets. These data suggest, in addition, a specific mechanism by which the principal regulator of erythroid differentiation could enhance TAL1 function, in addition to increasing its expression.","['Tang, T', 'Prasad, K S', 'Koury, M J', 'Brandt, S J']","['Tang T', 'Prasad KS', 'Koury MJ', 'Brandt SJ']","['Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Anemia/metabolism/virology', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Erythroblasts/*metabolism', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphopeptides/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphoserine/analysis', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Spleen', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Wortmannin']",1999/10/21 00:00,1999/10/21 00:01,['1999/10/21 00:00'],"['1999/10/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1999 Nov 1;343 Pt 3:615-20.,,,,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",['R01 HL49118/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC1220593,,,,,,,,,,

Using single cell alkaline electrophoresis, we have shown that the vicinal TCM, meso-2, 3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), 2,3-dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate, and 2,3-dimercaptopropanol markedly enhanced, whereas the mono TCM, D-penicillamide, glutathione, beta-mercaptoethanol, and diethyl dithiocarbomate, reduced nickel chloride (Ni)-induced DNA breaks in a human leukemia cell line, NB4 cells. Ni or TCM alone did not induce plasmid DNA breaks in test tubes and neither did Ni plus mono TCM; however, Ni plus vicinal TCM did. Vicinal TCM did, but mono TCM did not generate H(2)O(2) in solution. H(2)O(2) alone did not, but H(2)O(2) plus Ni induced plasmid DNA breaks. Although Ni plus glutathione did not break DNA, Ni plus glutathione plus H(2)O(2) did. The Ni-DMSA-induced DNA breaks in NB4 cells, as well as in plasmids, were completely prevented by d-mannitol or partially prevented by several antioxidants. Therefore, the DNA breaks induced by Ni plus vicinal TCM seem to be due to the complex of Ni with TCM in concert with the H(2)O(2) produced by the vicinal TCM. The results that DMSA at a concentration as low as 5 microM enhanced the Ni-induced DNA breaks suggest a further evaluation of the TCM as nickel chelators is needed.","['Lynn, S', 'Yu, G L', 'Yan, K']","['Lynn S', 'Yu GL', 'Yan K']","['Institute of Zoology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, 11529, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,IM,"['Cell Line/drug effects', 'Comet Assay', '*DNA Damage', 'Dimercaprol/pharmacology', 'Ditiocarb/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glutathione/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mercaptoethanol/pharmacology', 'Nickel/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Penicillic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Plasmids/drug effects', 'Succimer/pharmacology', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology']",1999/10/21 00:00,1999/10/21 00:01,['1999/10/21 00:00'],"['1999/10/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 1999 Oct 15;160(2):198-205. doi: 10.1006/taap.1999.8758.,,,"['10.1006/taap.1999.8758 [doi]', 'S0041-008X(99)98758-6 [pii]']","['0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '0CPP32S55X (Dimercaprol)', '34138-28-8 (penicillamide)', '60-24-2 (Mercaptoethanol)', '696BNE976J (nickel chloride)', '7OV03QG267 (Nickel)', '99Z2744345 (Ditiocarb)', 'DX1U2629QE (Succimer)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'ONL14K3AFD (Penicillic Acid)']",,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Few studies have investigated the potential effects of neurotrophic factors on more mature motor neurons that might be relevant for neurodegenerative diseases. Using organotypic spinal cord cultures from postnatal rats, we have demonstrated that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) significantly increase choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, but brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-4 (NT-4/5), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) do not. Surprisingly, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) actually reduces ChAT activity compared to age-matched control cultures. Neurotrophic factors have also been shown to alter the sensitivity of some neurons to glutamate neurotoxicity, a postulated mechanism of injury in the neurodegenerative disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Incubation of organotypic spinal cord cultures in the presence of the glutamate transport inhibitor threo-hydroxyaspartate (THA) reproducibly causes death of motor neurons which is glutamate-mediated. In this model of motor neuron degeneration, IGF-I, GDNF, and NT-4/5 are potently neuroprotective, but BDNF, CNTF, and NT-3 are not. The organotypic glutamate toxicity model appears to be the best preclinical predictor to date of success in human clinical trials in ALS.","['Corse, A M', 'Bilak, M M', 'Bilak, S R', 'Lehar, M', 'Rothstein, J D', 'Kuncl, R W']","['Corse AM', 'Bilak MM', 'Bilak SR', 'Lehar M', 'Rothstein JD', 'Kuncl RW']","['Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Meyer 5-119, 600 North Wolfe Street, Baltimore, Maryland, 21287-7519, USA. acorse@welchllink.welch.jhu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Neurobiol Dis,Neurobiology of disease,9500169,IM,"['Animals', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/pharmacology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Models, Neurological', 'Motor Neuron Disease/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Motor Neurons/cytology/*drug effects/pathology', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology', 'Neuroprotective Agents/*pharmacology', 'Neurotrophin 3/pharmacology', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Rats', 'Spinal Cord/cytology/*drug effects/pathology']",1999/10/21 00:00,1999/10/21 00:01,['1999/10/21 00:00'],"['1999/10/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neurobiol Dis. 1999 Oct;6(5):335-46. doi: 10.1006/nbdi.1999.0253.,,,"['10.1006/nbdi.1999.0253 [doi]', 'S0969-9961(99)90253-X [pii]']","['0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (GDNF protein, human)', '0 (Gdnf protein, rat)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '0 (Neurotrophin 3)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'P658DCA9XD (neurotrophin 4)']","['K08NS01722-02/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01NS33985-01/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,

We found high numbers of CD19+CD5+ B lymphoid cells in the bone marrows and spleens of NOD/SCID mice transplanted with human CD34+ stem/progenitor cells. The CD5+ cells accounted for a particularly large percentage of the B lymphoid cells in the spleens of chimeras analyzed three months after transplantation.

Thus, the CD19+CD5+ cell population detected in our study has the phenotype of previously described CD5+ B lymphoid cells in humans and other species. The origin and role of the B lymphoid cells which express CD5 cell surface glycoprotein are poorly understood. The malignant cells in B lymphoid chronic lymphocytic leukemia express CD5, and the numbers of CD5+ B lymphoid cells are elevated in several autoimmune conditions.

Colchicine and thiocolchicine were used as reference compounds. Thiocolchicine was the most active agent on MDR-negative cells in terms of growth inhibition, whereas for multidrug-resistant cells, thiocolchicone was the most active compound (IC50 = 14 nM). As indicated by statistical analysis, a perfect agreement for the potency order (IC50 values) of the compounds between all the MDR-negative cancer cells (k = 1.00), a poor agreement between MDR-positive and MDR-negative cancer lines, and a moderate agreement (k = 0.50) between the two resistant cancer cells MCF-7 ADRr and CEM VBL were observed. To gain further insight into the mechanism of the antitumor activity of colchicinoids, the most active compounds, colchicone and thiocolchicone, were selected to evaluate their effect on cell cycle, apoptosis, and tubulin interaction. The highest recruitment activity into the G21/M phase of the cell cycle was detected in thiocolchicone-treated breast cancer cells. Interestingly, after 72 h of culture, when the cell cycle block subsided, a consistent amount of DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis, was evident. Morphological analysis of MCF-7 ADRr cells confirmed this hypothesis and revealed that thiocolchicone was able to induce apoptosis in this MDR-bearing model.

The relative potencies (mean +/- S.D.) of 1 microM compounds in inducing the differentiation of NB4 cells, a cell line that contains the chromosomal transposition t(15;17) characteristic of acute promyelocytic leukemia, after 4 days of incubation were: RA: 1.35 +/- 0.16, 5,6-EC: 0.29 +/- 0.01, 5,8-EC: 0.22 +/- 0.05, 5,6,5',6'-DEC: 0.11 +/- 0.02, beta C: 0.09 +/- 0.01, and the control: 0.06 +/- 0.01. The same order of potencies existed at other concentrations tested and at other incubation times. P values for the differences between the inducing activities of successive pairs of compounds at 1 microM were: RA vs. 5,6-EC, < 0.001; 5,6-EC vs. 5,8-EC, < 0.01; 5,8-EC vs. 5,6,5',6'-DEC, < 0.01; 5,6,5',6'-DEC vs. beta-Car, < 0.10; beta-Car vs. control, < 0.005. Similar P values were also obtained for studies at other concentrations and at other incubation times. The viable cell mass at 4 days was inversely proportional to the extent of differentiation (rs = -1.0). The inducing activities of all compounds were dose-dependent. Thus, the 5,6-monoepoxide of beta-carotene, which has not previously been studied as an inducer, showed higher activity in NB4 cell differentiation than the 5,8-monoepoxide, the 5,6,5',6'-diepoxide, or beta-carotene.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From September 1990 to March 1993, 73 evaluable patients with newly diagnosed stage IIB, III (A and B), and IV (A and B) Hodgkin's disease or who were relapsing after primary subtotal or total nodal irradiation were treated with eight cycles of etoposide, epirubicin, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, and prednisolone (VEBEP) followed by radiotherapy (30-36 Gy) to the nodal site or sites of pretreatment disease. The median duration of follow-up was 68 months. RESULTS: The complete remission rate was 94% (95% CI: 86-98). At 6 years, freedom from progression and overall survival rates were 78% (95% CI: 68-88) and 82% (95% CI: 73-91), respectively. There was one episode of fatal sepsis after bone marrow aplasia that occurred after VEBEP and extended-field irradiation. Hematologic toxicity during chemotherapy was acceptable; without the support of growth factors, grade IV leukopenia and grade IV neutropenia, as determined within cycles, occurred in 38% and 85% of patients, respectively, but was reversible in the vast majority of patients by the day of treatment recycle. No episodes of epidoxorubicin-related cardiomyopathy or symptomatic pulmonary toxicity were documented. Overt and/or subclinical hypothyroidism occurred in 38% of cases. Gonadal damage was evident in the large majority of male patients but reversible in half of them, whereas permanent sterility was observed in females at least 35 years of age. No secondary leukemia has been so far detected. DISCUSSION: VEBEP followed by involved-nodal-field radiotherapy is an effective treatment for chemotherapy-naive Hodgkin's disease and is associated to acceptable rates of acute and intermediate-term toxicity. This intensive regimen, which does not routinely require the support of hematopoietic growth factors and can be delivered in an outpatient setting, warrants a prospective comparison in a randomized trial versus one of the more effective standard-combination regimens.","['Viviani, S', 'Bonfante, V', 'Santoro, A', 'Zanini, M', 'Devizzi, L', 'Di Russo, A D', 'Soncini, F', 'Villani, F', 'Ragni, G', 'Valagussa, P', 'Bonadonna, G']","['Viviani S', 'Bonfante V', 'Santoro A', 'Zanini M', 'Devizzi L', 'Di Russo AD', 'Soncini F', 'Villani F', 'Ragni G', 'Valagussa P', 'Bonadonna G']","['Division of Medical Oncology A, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer J Sci Am,The cancer journal from Scientific American,9513568,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Epirubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/10/20 00:00,1999/10/20 00:01,['1999/10/20 00:00'],"['1999/10/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer J Sci Am. 1999 Sep-Oct;5(5):275-82.,,['Cancer J Sci Am. 1999 Sep-Oct;5(5):264-5.

Components of the JAK/STAT protein pathway have been identified and characterized in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. This review summarizes the molecular and genetic data obtained from these model organisms. In particular, a Drosophila JAK/STAT pathway regulates normal segmentation, cell proliferation, and differentiation, and hyperactivation of the pathway leads to tumor formation and leukemia-like defects. A Dictyostelium STAT regulates the development of stalk cells during the multicellular part of the life cycle. Future research utilizing these organisms should continue to provide insights into the roles and regulation of these proteins and their signaling pathways.","['Dearolf, C R']",['Dearolf CR'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA. cdearolf@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Invertebrates/*physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1999/10/20 00:00,1999/10/20 00:01,['1999/10/20 00:00'],"['1999/10/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 1999 Sep;55(12):1578-84. doi: 10.1007/s000180050397.,,,"['10.1007/s000180050397 [pii]', '10.1007/s000180050397 [doi]']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,36,,,,,,,,,

Psychosocial adjustment was most impaired in domains of life related to sexual relationships, vocational adjustment, social adjustment, and psychological distress. Females and older adults reported significantly higher dysfunction compared with males and younger subjects. Passage of time since bone marrow transplantation was unrelated to psychosocial improvement. Fatigue was the main symptom interfering with daily life in most (78.6%). Regression analysis showed that development of fatigue in our sample was mainly the result of the combined effects of anxiety, presence of pain, and infections (R2 = 0.75, p < .001), with weight loss showing a trend in relation to fatigue.

Fifty-nine patients were enrolled in the study. Fifty-three patients met all study eligibility criteria; 48 of them (91%) had mediastinal disease and 29 (55%) had bulky mediastinal disease. RESULTS: A complete response (CR) occurred in 35 of the patients (66%). Of all patients who had CR, 26% had the CR after the chemotherapy and before the radiation, and 74% after the chemotherapy and radiation. Twenty percent of the patients who had CR experienced disease progression; in these patients, the progression was outside the radiotherapy field in the lung and involved widespread disease. CONCLUSIONS: EVA offers a nonbleomycin-containing alternative for patients in whom preexisting pulmonary disease may be exacerbated by bleomycin and radiation therapy. EVA, as given in this study (in three cycles), was insufficient chemotherapy for patients who had disease in areas outside the radiation fields (occult disease).","['Wasserman, T H', 'Petroni, G R', 'Millard, F E', 'Chung, C T', 'Barcos, M', 'Johnson, J L', 'Canellos, G P', 'Peterson, B A']","['Wasserman TH', 'Petroni GR', 'Millard FE', 'Chung CT', 'Barcos M', 'Johnson JL', 'Canellos GP', 'Peterson BA']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Washington University, Barnes-Jewish Hospital, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukopenia/etiology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology/*radiation effects', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/pathology/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vinblastine/therapeutic use']",1999/10/20 00:00,1999/10/20 00:01,['1999/10/20 00:00'],"['1999/10/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1999 Oct 15;86(8):1590-5. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19991015)86:8<1590::aid-cncr29>3.0.co;2-4.,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19991015)86:8<1590::AID-CNCR29>3.0.CO;2-4 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19991015)86:8<1590::aid-cncr29>3.0.co;2-4 [doi]']","['5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']","['CA21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['Copyright 1999 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,

GOELAMS Group.",1496-505,"BACKGROUND: Despite modern treatment programs, less than 20% of adult cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are cured. For relapsing and/or refractory patients, use of high dose cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) and anthracyclin achieved a complete remission (CR) rate of up to a 75%. The aim of this study was to evaluate in adult patients with ALL 1) the CR rate of a chemotherapy schedule similar to a schedule for acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) patients, 2) the antileukemic value and the tolerance of 3 intensive stage treatments, and 3) the impact of recombinant granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (rGM-CSF) on chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and infectious complications, as well as the effect of dose intensity. METHODS: Between November 1990 and April 1992, 67 patients ages 15-55 years with de novo ALL were randomly assigned to receive either rGM-CSF or placebo. The induction treatment consisted of idarubicin, methylprednisolone, and high dose ara-C. After achieving CR, patients up to age 45 years who had an HLA-identical sibling were assigned to undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). All remaining patients received a first course of early intensification with high dose ara-C, mitoxantrone, etoposide, and methylprednisolone, followed by autologous, unpurged BMT. RESULTS: Of the 64 eligible patients, 50 (78%) achieved CR. Sixteen allogeneic and 18 autologous BMTs were performed. The median survival was 10.2 months. The 4-year survival was 24%. rGM-CSF only improved the incidence of severe mucositis during the induction course (P = 0.003) and probably also improved the median duration of fever (P = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: This schedule, similar to that for the treatment of AML patients, with early BMT included, did not prove to be a satisfactory approach to the treatment of most adult ALL patients, although CR was achieved in 78% of cases. In this study, no major improvement was obtained with rGM-CSF therapy.","['Ifrah, N', 'Witz, F', 'Jouet, J P', 'Francois, S', 'Lamy, T', 'Linassier, C', 'Pignon, B', 'Berthou, C', 'Guyotat, D', 'Cahn, J Y', 'Harousseau, J L']","['Ifrah N', 'Witz F', 'Jouet JP', 'Francois S', 'Lamy T', 'Linassier C', 'Pignon B', 'Berthou C', 'Guyotat D', 'Cahn JY', 'Harousseau JL']","['Service de Medecine D, CHU, Angers, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/10/20 00:00,1999/10/20 00:01,['1999/10/20 00:00'],"['1999/10/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1999 Oct 15;86(8):1496-505. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19991015)86:8<1496::aid-cncr16>3.0.co;2-#.,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19991015)86:8<1496::AID-CNCR16>3.0.CO;2-# [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19991015)86:8<1496::aid-cncr16>3.0.co;2-# [doi]']","['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,['Copyright 1999 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,

We recently reported that oncostatin M (OSM), a cytokine of the interleukin (IL)-6 family secreted by macrophages, has a potent angiogenic activity on human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1), but has no effect on macrovascular cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)). In this work, we show that in HMEC-1, OSM (0.5-2.5 ng/ml), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (25 ng/ml), bFGF (25 ng/ml) and IL-1beta (5 ng/ml) induced production of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. In contrast, in HUVECs, neither OSM nor LIF induced COX-2 mRNA, suggesting that COX-2 might be implicated in the angiogenic activity of OSM. This was confirmed by the inhibiting effect on OSM-induced HMEC-1 proliferation of specific COX-2 inhibitors. In vivo studies confirmed this findings. We conclude that induction of COX-2 by OSM is necessary for its angiogenic activity, but is not sufficient since IL-1beta, which also induces COX-2 in HMEC-1, has only a poor proliferative effect.","['Pourtau, J', 'Mirshahi, F', 'Li, H', 'Muraine, M', 'Vincent, L', 'Tedgui, A', 'Vannier, J P', 'Soria, J', 'Vasse, M', 'Soria, C']","['Pourtau J', 'Mirshahi F', 'Li H', 'Muraine M', 'Vincent L', 'Tedgui A', 'Vannier JP', 'Soria J', 'Vasse M', 'Soria C']","['Laboratoire DIFEMA, UFR de Medecine et Pharmacie de Rouen, Boulevard Gambetta, 76183, Rouen, Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cornea/blood supply/drug effects', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/*drug effects', 'Nitrobenzenes/pharmacology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']",1999/10/20 00:00,1999/10/20 00:01,['1999/10/20 00:00'],"['1999/10/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1999 Oct 15;459(3):453-7. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(99)01301-0.,,,"['S0014-5793(99)01301-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(99)01301-0 [doi]']","['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nitrobenzenes)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '123653-11-2 (N-(2-cyclohexyloxy-4-nitrophenyl)methanesulfonamide)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients were all children suffering from leukaemia and common solid tumours (nephroblastoma, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, central nervous system (CNS) tumours) diagnosed between July 1988 and June 1993 in Lower Saxony (Germany) and aged less than 15 years. Two population-based control groups were matched by age and gender to the leukaemia patients. Long-term (1 year) radon measurements were performed in those homes where the children had been living for at least 1 year, with particular attention being paid to those rooms where they had stayed most of the time. Due to the sequential study design, radon measurements in these rooms could only be done for 36% (82 leukaemias, 82 solid tumours and 209 controls) of the 1038 families initially contacted. Overall mean indoor radon concentrations (27 Bq m(-3)) were low compared with the measured levels in other studies.

Through a comparison of the age structure of CML incidence data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program and the age structure of chromosomal translocations found in healthy subjects, the number of CML target stem cells is estimated for individuals above 20 years of age. The estimation involves three steps. First, CML incidence among adults is fit to an exponentially increasing function of age. Next, assuming a relatively short waiting time distribution between BCR-ABL induction and the appearance of CML, an exponential age function with rate constants fixed to the values found for CML is fitted to the translocation data. Finally, assuming that translocations are equally likely to occur between any two points in the genome, the parameter estimates found in the first two steps are used to estimate the number of target stem cells for CML. The population-averaged estimates of this number are found to be 1.86x10(8) for men and 1.21x10(8) for women; the 95% confidence intervals of these estimates are (1.34x10(8), 2. 50x10(8)) and (0.84x10(8), 1.83x10(8)), respectively.","['Radivoyevitch, T', 'Ramsey, M J', 'Tucker, J D']","['Radivoyevitch T', 'Ramsey MJ', 'Tucker JD']","['Department of Biometry and Epidemiology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, USA. radivot@musc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1999/10/20 00:00,1999/10/20 00:01,['1999/10/20 00:00'],"['1999/10/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 1999 Sep;38(3):201-6. doi: 10.1007/s004110050156.,,,"['90380201.411 [pii]', '10.1007/s004110050156 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Located between latitudes 65 degrees and 70 degrees north, the population in northern Finland is exposed to extreme seasonal alterations of ultraviolet-B light and temperature. There is also a seasonal variation of both the 25(OH)- and 1,25(OH)2-D3 vitamin serum concentrations. In the present work, the frequencies of different types and age-groups at diagnosis of AL were compared during the dark and light months of the year, to uncover seasonality. Between January 1972 and December 1986, 300 consecutive patients aged >/=16 years and diagnosed as having AL were enrolled. The observed mean monthly global solar radiation, temperature measurements, and influenza epidemics were compared with the monthly occurrence of AL. Both acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (p=0.006) and total AL (p=0.015) were diagnosed excessively in the dark and cold compared with light and warm period of the year. There was a tendency for de novo leukemia to increase also in the dark and cold, but for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients the excess was not significant. Age >/=65 was strongly associated with the dark and cold season (p=0.003). Significantly more ALL (p=0.005) and de novo leukemias (p=0.029) were observed during influenza epidemics than during nonepidemic periods. However, a seasonality, i. e., the fluctuation of numbers of AL cases, was not determined, either monthly or during different photo- and temperature periods or influenza epidemics; this might be due to the small numbers of patients studied. Nevertheless, it is hypothesized that sunlight deprivation in the arctic winter can lead to a deficiency of the 1, 25(OH)2D3 vitamin, which might stimulate leukemic cell proliferation and block cell differentiation through dysregulation of growth factors in the bone marrow stromal cells, causing one mutation and an overt ALL in progenitor cells damaged during the current or the previous winter by influenza virus, the other mutation.","['Timonen, T T']",['Timonen TT'],"['University of Oulu, Department of Internal Medicine, Kajaanintie 50, FIN-90220 Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cholecalciferol/deficiency', 'Cold Temperature/*adverse effects', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Influenza, Human/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Seasons', 'Ultraviolet Rays/*adverse effects']",1999/10/20 00:00,1999/10/20 00:01,['1999/10/20 00:00'],"['1999/10/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1999 Sep;78(9):408-14. doi: 10.1007/s002770050539.,,,"['90780408.277 [pii]', '10.1007/s002770050539 [doi]']",['1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three major factors are associated with blastic transformation: cytogenetic abnormalities, myelofibrotic features, and the use of cytotoxic agents. Hematological malignancies have been reported in ET patients after treatment with alkylating agents, such as busulphan, as well as other cytoreductive drugs, such as hydroxyurea. Concerns about leukemogenicity have led some to suggest limiting the indications of these drugs to patients at higher risk of bleeding and thrombosis. Major risk factors for thrombosis are age above 60 years and a previous thrombotic event, whereas an increased bleeding tendency has been reported with platelet counts in excess of 1000-1500x10(9)/l. No myelosuppressive therapy is recommended for younger patients if they are asymptomatic or their platelet counts are below 1500x10(9)/l. The threshold of 1500x10(9)/l is controversial, however, and cytoreduction can be considered when platelets are above 1000x10(9)/l or in the presence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In the presence of thrombotic events or extreme thrombocytosis, young ET patients can be managed with cytoreductive agents theoretically devoid of leukemogenic risk, such as a-interferon or anagrelide. Nevertheless, the mutagenic risk of anagrelide has not been investigated in long-term follow-up studies, and the ultimate place of these 'new' drugs in the management of ET patients remains to be established in prospective and controlled clinical trials.","['Finazzi, G', 'Barbui, T']","['Finazzi G', 'Barbui T']","['Division of Hematology, Ospedali Riuniti, Largo Barozzi 1, I-24100 Bergamo, Italy. ematologia@cyberg.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombocytosis/*drug therapy', 'Thrombosis/prevention & control']",1999/10/20 00:00,1999/10/20 00:01,['1999/10/20 00:00'],"['1999/10/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1999 Sep;78(9):389-92. doi: 10.1007/s002770050536.,,,"['90780389.277 [pii]', '10.1007/s002770050536 [doi]']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,25,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the mechanism of ND10 assembly by identifying proteins that are essential for this process using cells lines that lack individual ND10-associated proteins. We identified the adapter protein Daxx and BML, the RecQ helicase missing in Bloom syndrome, as new ND10-associated proteins. PML, but not BLM or Sp100, was found to be responsible for the proper localization of all other ND10-associated proteins since they are dispersed in PML-/- cells. Introducing PML into this cell line by transient expression or fusion with PML-producing cells recruited ND10-associated proteins into de novo formed ND10 attesting to PMLs essential nature in ND10 formation. In the absence of PML, Daxx is highly enriched in condensed chromatin. Its recruitment to ND10 from condensed chromatin requires a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO-1) modification of PML and reflects the interaction between the COOH-terminal domain of Daxx and PML. The segregation of Daxx from condensed chromatin in the absence of PML to ND10 by increased accumulation of SUMO-1-modified PML suggests the presence of a variable equilibrium between these two nuclear sites. Our findings identify the basic requirements for ND10 formation and suggest a dynamic mechanism for protein recruitment to these nuclear domains controlled by the SUMO-1 modification state of PML.","['Ishov, A M', 'Sotnikov, A G', 'Negorev, D', 'Vladimirova, O V', 'Neff, N', 'Kamitani, T', 'Yeh, E T', 'Strauss, J F 3rd', 'Maul, G G']","['Ishov AM', 'Sotnikov AG', 'Negorev D', 'Vladimirova OV', 'Neff N', 'Kamitani T', 'Yeh ET', 'Strauss JF 3rd', 'Maul GG']","['The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'SUMO-1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitins/*metabolism']",1999/10/20 09:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/10/20 09:00'],"['1999/10/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/10/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1999 Oct 18;147(2):221-34. doi: 10.1083/jcb.147.2.221.,,,['10.1083/jcb.147.2.221 [doi]'],"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']","['GM 57599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HD 34612/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 41136/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2174231,,,,,,,,,,

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) and EBER 1 (2/2) were detected in the RS-like cells in all cases. The neoplastic T cells were negative for EBV. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis demonstrated clonal rearrangements of the T-cell receptor gamma chain gene in the three cases. PCR analysis of microdissected RS-like cells for immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements in cases 1 and 3 showed an oligoclonal pattern. The presence of RS-like cells in PTCL represents a diagnostic pitfall, because in one case this observation led to a misdiagnosis of Hodgkin's disease (HD). The oligoclonal expansion of EBV-infected cells may be related to underlying immunodeficiency associated with T-cell lymphomas and AILT in particular. This phenomenon may provide the basis for some cases of Hodgkin's disease after T-cell lymphomas and suggests that they are clonally unrelated neoplasms. The expression of LMP1 appears to be crucial for the immunophenotype and probably for the morphology of the RS and RS-like cells appearing in diverse lymphoid malignancies, including HD, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and PTCL.","['Quintanilla-Martinez, L', 'Fend, F', 'Moguel, L R', 'Spilove, L', 'Beaty, M W', 'Kingma, D W', 'Raffeld, M', 'Jaffe, E S']","['Quintanilla-Martinez L', 'Fend F', 'Moguel LR', 'Spilove L', 'Beaty MW', 'Kingma DW', 'Raffeld M', 'Jaffe ES']","['Hematopathology Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1500, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology/virology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/genetics/*pathology/virology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Lymph Nodes/chemistry/*pathology/virology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/genetics/*pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/*pathology/virology', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/analysis']",1999/10/19 00:00,1999/10/19 00:01,['1999/10/19 00:00'],"['1999/10/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1999 Oct;23(10):1233-40. doi: 10.1097/00000478-199910000-00008.,,,['10.1097/00000478-199910000-00008 [doi]'],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA 1)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study analyzed 66 nodal lymphomas expressing T-cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1) and/or granzyme B to characterize the clinicopathologic spectrum of these neoplasms. Four main groups could be delineated. The first group consisted of p80/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive ALCL (n = 35). The patients were 2 to 62 years of age (median age, 16 years), and the lymphomas pursued a relatively indolent clinical course. The tumors were phenotypically of either T- or null-cell type with constant expression of CD30, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and p80/ALK, but not CD15 or BCL2. None harbored Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The second group consisted of peripheral T/NK-cell lymphoma, the nodal high-grade cytotoxic type (n = 13). The patients were 29 to 72 years in age (median age, 55 years), and the tumors pursued an aggressive clinical course. The tumors often showed pleomorphic, anaplastic, or centroblastoid morphology, and were featured by either EBV association or CD56 expression. The third group consisted of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, of the nodal low-grade cytotoxic type (n = 8). The patients, three men and five women, were 31 to 75 years old (median age, 61 years). Notably, six of them exhibited lymphoepithelioid (Lennert's) lymphoma. The fourth group consisted of cytotoxic Hodgkin's-like ALCL/HD (n = 10), included seven cases of Hodgkin's-like ALCL and three cases of HD, and was characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells and often the CD15+ phenotype. The patients were all men except for one woman, and they ranged in age from 24 to 84 years (median age, 62 years). The link among these four groups was reinforced by the presence of a highly characteristic large cell with horseshoelike or reniform nuclei-the frequent expression of CD30 and EMA-and the often lack of T-cell receptor-alphabeta. In this series, the expression of p80/ALK and CD56 was also associated with favorable and poor prognoses respectively (p<0.001, log-rank test).","['Kagami, Y', 'Suzuki, R', 'Taji, H', 'Yatabe, Y', 'Takeuchi, T', 'Maeda, S', 'Kondo, E', 'Kojima, M', 'Motoori, T', 'Mizoguchi, Y', 'Okamoto, M', 'Ohnishi, K', 'Yamabe, H', 'Seto, M', 'Ogura, M', 'Koshikawa, T', 'Takahashi, T', 'Kurita, S', 'Morishima, Y', 'Suchi, T', 'Nakamura, S']","['Kagami Y', 'Suzuki R', 'Taji H', 'Yatabe Y', 'Takeuchi T', 'Maeda S', 'Kondo E', 'Kojima M', 'Motoori T', 'Mizoguchi Y', 'Okamoto M', 'Ohnishi K', 'Yamabe H', 'Seto M', 'Ogura M', 'Koshikawa T', 'Takahashi T', 'Kurita S', 'Morishima Y', 'Suchi T', 'Nakamura S']","['Department of Hematology and Chemotherapy, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'CD56 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens/analysis', 'Female', 'Granzymes', 'Hodgkin Disease/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/classification/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/classification/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/classification/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Poly(A)-Binding Proteins', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', '*Proteins', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Intracellular Antigen-1']",1999/10/19 00:00,1999/10/19 00:01,['1999/10/19 00:00'],"['1999/10/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1999 Oct;23(10):1184-200. doi: 10.1097/00000478-199910000-00003.,,['Am J Surg Pathol. 2000 Sep;24(9):1309-10.

This article reports two unusual cases of Bacillus cereus sepsis with massive intravascular hemolysis in patients who had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 20-year-old woman who was 9 weeks pregnant experienced a relapse of ALL. A therapeutic abortion was performed. During week 4 of reinduction the patient had abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, with severe neutropenia but no fever. Her condition deteriorated rapidly with cardiovascular collapse, acute massive intravascular hemolysis, and death within hours of the onset of symptoms. Blood cultures were positive for Bacillus cereus. Postmortem histologic examination and cultures revealed Bacillus cereus and Candida albicans in multiple organs. The second patient, a 10-year-old girl, presented with relapsed T-cell ALL. In the second week of reinduction, she had abdominal pain followed by hypotension. Again, no fever was noted. Laboratory studies showed intravascular hemolysis 12 hours after admission. Aggressive support was promptly initiated. Despite disseminated intravascular coagulation; cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal failure; and multiple intracerebral hypodense lesions believed to be infarcts, the patient recovered fully and resumed reinduction therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Bacillus cereus infection can have a fulminant clinical course that may be complicated by massive intravascular hemolysis. This pathogen should be suspected in immunosuppressed patients who experience gastrointestinal symptoms and should not be precluded by the absence of fever, especially if steroids such as dexamethasone are being given. Exchange transfusion may be lifesaving in Bacillus cereus septicemia associated with massive hemolysis.","['Arnaout, M K', 'Tamburro, R F', 'Bodner, S M', 'Sandlund, J T', 'Rivera, G K', 'Pui, C H', 'Ribeiro, R C']","['Arnaout MK', 'Tamburro RF', 'Bodner SM', 'Sandlund JT', 'Rivera GK', 'Pui CH', 'Ribeiro RC']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Bacillus cereus/isolation & purification', 'Bacteremia/*blood/complications/pathology', 'Child', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', '*Hemolysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*complications/drug therapy', 'Liver/microbiology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction']",1999/10/19 00:00,1999/10/19 00:01,['1999/10/19 00:00'],"['1999/10/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1999 Sep-Oct;21(5):431-5. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199909000-00018.,,,['10.1097/00043426-199909000-00018 [doi]'],,"['CA 23099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 522258/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Serum concentrations of soluble CD44 (sCD44) are elevated in various cancers. The purpose of this study was to measure the serum concentrations of CD44 in pediatric patients with acute leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen pediatric patients with acute leukemia were studied. The authors measured the serum concentration of sCD44 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and after therapy. The concentrations were compared with those of 15 control healthy children and 10 patients with bacterial infections. RESULTS: The mean serum concentration of sCD44 at presentation was significantly higher in patients than in control subjects, but decreased to a normal range in complete remission after chemotherapy. There was no difference in sCD44 concentrations between patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia and those with acute myeloid leukemia. Serum concentrations of sCD44 did not correlate with lactic dehydrogenase concentrations or bone marrow nucleated cell counts and only weakly with peripheral leukocyte count. sCD44 levels in patients with bacterial infections were similar to those of control subjects. CONCLUSION: Serum concentration of sCD44 may reflect disease status in pediatric patients with acute leukemia and might be a useful tumor marker in these patients.","['Takeuchi, M', 'Tanizawa, A', 'Fukumoto, Y', 'Kikawa, Y', 'Mayumi, M']","['Takeuchi M', 'Tanizawa A', 'Fukumoto Y', 'Kikawa Y', 'Mayumi M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Fukui Medical University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antigens, CD/*blood', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Bacterial Infections/blood/immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*blood', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Reference Values', 'Remission Induction', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1999/10/19 00:00,1999/10/19 00:01,['1999/10/19 00:00'],"['1999/10/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1999 Sep-Oct;21(5):384-8. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199909000-00009.,,,['10.1097/00043426-199909000-00009 [doi]'],"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were examined by cerebral single photon emission computed tomography at the beginning of treatment (16 untreated, 9 during the first week) and after 4 weeks of treatment. Cerebrospinal fluid was sampled for analyses of neuron-specific enolase on four occasions in 54 patients. RESULTS: Regional cerebral blood flow became impaired during treatment in all patients. The single photon emission computed tomography score for nonhomogeneous perfusion increased from 6.4/50 to 16.6/50. Hypoperfusion was global without any clear preference for any lobe. The cerebellum was not affected. Neuron-specific enolase increased significantly during treatment, with a peak after 1 week, followed by a gradual decrease, but it was still significantly elevated after 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Nonhomogeneous cerebral hypoperfusion was found in all patients during induction treatment, including repeated intrathecal administration of methotrexate, but before systemic high-dose methotrexate. Signs of neuronal injury, in the form of a moderate increase in neuron-specific enolase in the cerebrospinal fluid, were found early in the treatment.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors analyzed 36 children, ages 6 weeks to 18 years, by combining descriptions of 2 patients observed at their institution with 34 patients reported in the English medical literature. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (10 at diagnosis and 5 later on) had symptoms directly related to ET, including 9 who had severe thrombohemorrhagic phenomena. Common abnormalities included large platelets, increased marrow megakaryocytes with hyperlobulated forms, and abnormal platelet aggregation. Symptomatic patients had significantly higher platelet counts (2,419 versus 904 x 10(9)/L, P < 0.001); however, three patients with platelet counts that were only moderately elevated (600-800 x 10(9)/L) had thrombotic events. Eleven patients received various therapeutic agents. Interestingly, three patients who had one thrombotic event, and did not receive therapy, went on to have a benign clinical course. Leukemia developed in two treated patients, and they died; two others died of thrombotic complications; and myelofibrosis developed in one patient. Seventeen cases (47%) were familial. Patients with familial cases had significantly lower platelet counts, a lower incidence of hepatomegaly, and no thrombotic complications. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of children with ET found that severe vascular complications developed in a substantial number. Platelet counts usually, but not always, correlate with the occurrence of complications. The indications for treatment and the best treatment of children with ET are currently not known, and guidelines for the management of children with ET are needed. Familial thrombocythemia is common among children with primary thrombocytosis and appears to be a different disease from ET, with a more benign course.","['Dror, Y', 'Zipursky, A', 'Blanchette, V S']","['Dror Y', 'Zipursky A', 'Blanchette VS']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'MEDLINE', 'Male', 'Platelet Count', 'Thrombocytosis/blood/diagnosis/*physiopathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/10/19 00:00,1999/10/19 00:01,['1999/10/19 00:00'],"['1999/10/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1999 Sep-Oct;21(5):356-63. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199909000-00005.,,['Br J Haematol. 2000 Sep;110(4):1009-10.

Chloramphenicol has been widely used in the treatment of serious infections including typhoid fever and meningitis. However, the drug is haemotoxic in man inducing firstly, a reversible, dose-dependent anaemia which develops during treatment, secondly, an often fatal aplastic anaemia with pancytopenia and acellular marrow, and thirdly, leukaemia. 2. We investigated the haemotoxicity of chloramphenicol succinate (CAPS) in female CD-1 mice in repeat dose studies, to compare the response with the reversible anaemia reported in man. Studies in male Wistar Hanover rats were also carried out. 3. CAPS was gavaged daily to mice at dose levels from 800 - 2000 mg/kg for seven days. Values were significantly reduced for reticulocytes at 1700 and 2000 mg/kg, and for erythrocytes (RBC), haematocrit (HCT), and haemoglobin (Hb) at 2000 mg/kg. Platelet and white blood cell (WBC) counts were unaffected. 4. Mice were dosed with CAPS at 1400 mg/kg for 10 days and sampled at 1, 4 and 15 days after the last dose. At day 1 post dosing, RBC, HCT and Hb values were significantly reduced, but returned to normal (or above normal) by day 4 or 15. 5. CAPS from 2000 - 4000 mg/kg was gavaged to rats daily for 19 days. Hb values were significantly lower at 3600 and 4000 mg/kg; reticulocytes were not reduced. WBC and platelet counts, in general, were unaffected. 6. Levels of apoptosis in marrow mononuclear cells were increased in CAPS-treated mice, but not in CAPS-treated rats. Serum biochemistry parameters, in general, showed few changes of toxicological significance. 7. We conclude that the administration of CAPS to CD-1 mice induced haematological changes showing close parallels with the chloramphenicol-induced reversible anaemia seen in man.","['Turton, J A', 'Yallop, D', 'Andrews, C M', 'Fagg, R', 'York, M', 'Williams, T C']","['Turton JA', 'Yallop D', 'Andrews CM', 'Fagg R', 'York M', 'Williams TC']","['Centre for Toxicology, Department of Pharmacology, The School of Pharmacy, University of London, 29-39 Brunswick Square, London WC1N 1AX, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Exp Toxicol,Human & experimental toxicology,9004560,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blood Cell Count/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Chloramphenicol/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Clinical Chemistry Tests', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Hematologic Tests', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Species Specificity']",1999/10/19 00:00,1999/10/19 00:01,['1999/10/19 00:00'],"['1999/10/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Exp Toxicol. 1999 Sep;18(9):566-76. doi: 10.1191/096032799678845098.,,,['10.1191/096032799678845098 [doi]'],"['66974FR9Q1 (Chloramphenicol)', 'ZCX619U9A1 (chloramphenicol succinate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the signal transduction pathway responsible is unknown. Downstream of protein kinase C (PKC), the effects of TPA are often mediated by the Raf-1/MEK/ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, and Raf-1 has been implicated in MDR1 induction by serum and mitogens. Therefore, we examined the potential role of MAPK activation in TPA-mediated MDR1 induction in human leukemia K562 cells. MDR1 mRNA expression was significantly increased by TPA in the concentration range of 4 - 100 nM, with a maximal response 5 - 10 h after TPA addition. TPA-mediated MDR1 induction was inhibited by several PKC inhibitors including staurosporine, H7 and calphostin C. TPA stimulated the subcellular translocation of PKCalpha from the cytosol to the membrane and nucleus but did not affect other PKC isozymes. TPA also activated the Raf1/MEK/ERK cascade and activated another MAPK member, p38, but not JNK. In order to determine the potential role of MAPKs in MDR1 induction by TPA, specific inhibitors were utilized. The MEK inhibitor PD 098059, as well as the PKC inhibitors, completely blocked TPA-mediated ERK activation. However, under identical conditions, MDR1 induction by TPA was completely unaffected by PD 098059. Furthermore, SB 202190, which effectively inhibited TPA-mediated p38 activation, failed to inhibit TPA-induced MDR1 mRNA expression. These data demonstrate that MDR1 induction by TPA occurs via a PKC-dependent mechanism that operates independently of ERK, p38 or JNK pathways, and thus have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of MDR1 induction by extracellular stimuli.","['Osborn, M T', 'Berry, A', 'Ruberu, M S', 'Ning, B', 'Bell, L M', 'Chambers, T C']","['Osborn MT', 'Berry A', 'Ruberu MS', 'Ning B', 'Bell LM', 'Chambers TC']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas 72205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'K562 Cells', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Naphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/19 00:00,1999/10/19 00:01,['1999/10/19 00:00'],"['1999/10/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Oct 14;18(42):5756-64. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202943.,,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1202943 [doi]'],"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (calphostin complex)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",['CA75577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This gene is a member of the Ets gene family, a class of transcription factors that recognize and bind to a DNA motif known as the Ets binding site (EBS). Our laboratory has previously cloned and characterized the promoter region of both human and mouse Fli-1 genes. We had then identified several regulatory elements conserved between the two species. Two of them, an exon 1 GATA/EBS dual element and an EBS element located in the 5' end of intron 1, were analysed in the present study. EMSA analysis performed with nuclear extracts from different cell lines showed that the EBS element in intron 1 (EBSi) was bound by one potential Ets-related ubiquitous factor. The GATA/EBS element was bound by several factors that seemed Ets-related, one of which was found to be specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells. the GATA/EBS dual element was thus chosen for further analysis. A human Fli-1-derived genomic fragment containing the GATA/EBS led to enhanced transcription when positioned upstream of the SV40 promoter in the erythroleukemic HEL cell line. In addition, an increasing number of GATA/EBS oligonucleotides upstream of this same promoter resulted in a copy number-dependent increase in luciferase activity which was greatly reduced when the EBS consensus sequence was mutated. One of the factors binding to the GATA/EBS region was identified to be Spi-1 by supershift analysis and was also shown to bind to the EBS element of the human Ets-2 gene. Supershift analysis also demonstrated the binding of the GATA-1 factor to the GATA/EBS dual element. Our results suggest that Spi-1 and GATA-1 might play a key role in the regulation of Fli-1.","['Barbeau, B', 'Barat, C', 'Bergeron, D', 'Rassart, E']","['Barbeau B', 'Barat C', 'Bergeron D', 'Rassart E']","['Laboratoire de biologie moleculaire, Departement des Sciences Biologiques, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'DNA, Antisense/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Exons/*genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Introns/genetics', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/19 00:00,1999/10/19 00:01,['1999/10/19 00:00'],"['1999/10/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Sep 30;18(40):5535-45. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202913.,,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1202913 [doi]'],"['0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the activation of Fli-1 is an early, primary transforming event, p53 mutations are correlated with the immortalization of erythroleukemic cells in culture. In this study we have further analysed the role of p53 loss in F-MuLV induced erythroleukemias by examining the progression of this disease in p53 deficient mice. We found that p53-/- mice succumb to the disease more rapidly than p53+/+ littermates. Additionally, of the 112 tumors generated, 19 gave rise to immortal cell lines, eight of which were derived from p53-/- mice, and ten of which were from p53+/- mice. The ability of these primary tumor cells to grow in culture was associated with the complete loss of wild-type p53 in these cell lines. However, cells from many of the tumors induced in p53-/- hosts did not survive in vitro. These results suggest that the loss of p53 does not directly immortalize tumor cells. Instead, we have evidence to suggest that the loss of p53 promotes the accumulation of mutations that are required for survival in culture and that are capable of accelerating tumor progression in vivo. Indeed, mutations causing expression of the growth factor gene erythropoietin (Epo), were detected in two of seven Epo-independent cell lines from p53 deficient primary erythroleukemias. Moreover, the mechanism of activation of the Epo gene in one of these two Epo-independent cell lines involved genomic rearrangement, that is a hallmark of genetic instability. We propose that, in F-MuLV induced-erythroleukemias, p53 loss may encourage the accumulation of further mutations, subsequently conferring a growth advantage and immortality to the transformed erythroblasts.","['Wong, K S', 'Li, Y J', 'Howard, J', 'Ben-David, Y']","['Wong KS', 'Li YJ', 'Howard J', 'Ben-David Y']","[""Division of Cancer Biology, Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre, Research Building, S-Wing, S-218, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M4N 3M5.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Blood Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Division', 'Cellular Senescence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Disease Progression', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*metabolism/virology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*physiology', '*Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, p53', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutagenesis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics/virology', 'Trans-Activators/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/transplantation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*genetics/virology']",1999/10/19 00:00,1999/10/19 00:01,['1999/10/19 00:00'],"['1999/10/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Sep 30;18(40):5525-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202938.,,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1202938 [doi]'],"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

MRD was detected by identifying cells with aberrant antigen expression and/or leukemia-associated phenotype (LAP) using MPFC. Prior to BMT, 8 out of 21 patients exhibited normal antigen expression based on normal BM samples while 13 BM aspirates had abnormal MPFC. Pre-BMT MPFC was abnormal in all 10 patients who were not in complete remission (CR) (>5% blasts in BM) as well as 3 patients acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who were in CR. In BM from ALL patients, an abnormal uniform B cell population was observed however antigen expression patterns varied greatly between patients. BM from acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) patients showed an abnormal distribution of CD34+ cells. In addition, a correlation was observed between pre-BMT cytogenetics and MPFC. Only 2 out of 8 (25%) patients with normal MPFC pre-autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) relapsed (AML), while 6 out of 13 (46%) patients with abnormal pre-BMT MPFC relapsed including 2 out of 3 patients who were transplanted in clinical CR.

We found that both FUS-ERG and EWS-ERG could induce anchorage-independent proliferation of the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3. However, only FUS-ERG was able to inhibit the differentiation into neutrophils of a mouse myeloid precursor cell line L-G and induce its granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-dependent growth. We constructed several deletion mutants of FUS-ERG lacking a part of the N-terminal FUS region. A deletion mutant lacking the region between amino acids 1 and 173 (exons 1 to 5) lost the NIH 3T3-transforming activity but retained the L-G-transforming activity. On the other hand, a mutant lacking the region between amino acids 174 and 265 (exons 6 and 7) lost the L-G-transforming activity but retained the NIH 3T3-transforming activity. These results indicate that the N-terminal region of FUS contains two independent functional domains required for the NIH 3T3 and L-G transformation, which we named TR1 and TR2, respectively. Although EWS intrinsically possessed the TR2 domain, the EWS-ERG construct employed lacked the EWS sequence containing this domain. Since the TR2 domain is always found in chimeric proteins identified from t(16;21) leukemia patients but not in chimeric proteins from Ewing's sarcoma patients, it seems that the TR2 function is required only for the leukemogenic potential. In addition, we identified three cellular genes whose expression was altered by ectopic expression of FUS-ERG and found that these are regulated in either a TR1-dependent or a TR2-dependent manner. These results suggest that FUS-ERG may activate two independent oncogenic pathways during the leukemogenic process by modulating the expression of two different groups of genes simultaneously.","['Ichikawa, H', 'Shimizu, K', 'Katsu, R', 'Ohki, M']","['Ichikawa H', 'Shimizu K', 'Katsu R', 'Ohki M']","['Radiobiology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan. hichikaw@ncc.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'DNA Primers', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics', 'RNA-Binding Protein EWS', 'RNA-Binding Protein FUS', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1999/10/19 00:00,1999/10/19 00:01,['1999/10/19 00:00'],"['1999/10/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Nov;19(11):7639-50. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.11.7639.,,,['10.1128/MCB.19.11.7639 [doi]'],"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein EWS)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein FUS)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (TLS-ERG fusion protein, human)']",,,PMC84797,,,['GENBANK/AB028209'],,,,,,,

PBX proteins bind DNA cooperatively as heterodimers with MEIS family members and also with HOX proteins from paralog groups 1 to 10. MEIS proteins cooperatively bind DNA with ABD-B class HOX proteins of groups 9 and 10. Here, we examine aspects of dimeric and higher-order interactions between these three homeodomain classes. The most significant results can be summarized as follows. (i) Most of PBX N terminal to the homeodomain is required for efficient cooperative binding with HOXD4 and HOXD9. (ii) MEIS and PBX proteins form higher-order complexes on a heterodimeric binding site. (iii) Although MEIS does not cooperatively bind DNA with ANTP class HOX proteins, it does form a trimer as a non-DNA-binding partner with DNA-bound PBX-HOXD4. (iv) The N terminus of HOXD4 negatively regulates trimer formation. (v) MEIS forms a similar trimer with DNA-bound PBX-HOXD9. (vi) A related trimer (where MEIS is a non-DNA-binding partner) is formed on a transcriptional promoter within the cell. (vii) We observe an additional trimer class involving non-DNA-bound PBX and DNA-bound MEIS-HOXD9 or MEIS-HOXD10 heterodimers that is enhanced by mutation of the PBX homeodomain. (viii) In this latter trimer, PBX is likely to contact both MEIS and HOXD9/D10. (ix) The stability of DNA binding by all trimers is enhanced relative to the heterodimers.

The SH2-containing inositol-5-phosphatase SHIP is a 145-kDa protein which has been shown to regulate hematopoiesis in mice. Targeted disruption of the murine SHIP gene results in a myeloproliferative syndrome characterized by a dramatic increase in numbers of granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells in the marrow and spleen. Also, hematopoietic progenitor cells from SHIP(-/-) mice are hyperresponsive to certain hematopoietic growth factors, a phenotype very similar to the effects of BCR/ABL in murine cells. In a series of BCR/ABL-transformed hematopoietic cell lines, Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive cell lines, and primary cells from patients with CML, the expression of SHIP was found to be absent or substantially reduced compared to untransformed cell lines or leukemia cells lacking BCR/ABL. Ba/F3 cells in which expression of BCR/ABL was under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter showed rapid loss of p145 SHIP, coincident with induction of BCR/ABL expression. Also, an ABL-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, CGP57148B (STI571), rapidly caused reexpression of SHIP, indicating that BCR/ABL directly, but reversibly, regulates the expression of SHIP protein. The estimated half-life of SHIP protein was reduced from 18 h to less than 3 h. However, SHIP mRNA also decreased in response to BCR/ABL, suggesting that SHIP protein levels could be affected by more than one mechanism. Reexpression of SHIP in BCR/ABL-transformed Ba/F3 cells altered the biological behavior of cells in culture. The reduction of SHIP due to BCR/ABL is likely to directly contribute to the pathogenesis of CML.","['Sattler, M', 'Verma, S', 'Byrne, C H', 'Shrikhande, G', 'Winkler, T', 'Algate, P A', 'Rohrschneider, L R', 'Griffin, J D']","['Sattler M', 'Verma S', 'Byrne CH', 'Shrikhande G', 'Winkler T', 'Algate PA', 'Rohrschneider LR', 'Griffin JD']","['Department of Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. martin_sattler@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Half-Life', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Mice', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'src Homology Domains']",1999/10/19 00:00,1999/10/19 00:01,['1999/10/19 00:00'],"['1999/10/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/19 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Nov;19(11):7473-80. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.11.7473.,,,['10.1128/MCB.19.11.7473 [doi]'],"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (INPPL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']","['P01 DK050654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK50654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC84744,,,,,,,,,,

Tight-seal whole-cell patch clamp experiments were performed to investigate the mechanism whereby passive depletion of stores activates the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current (ICRAC) in rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL) cells. 2. Passive depletion of stores was achieved by dialysing cells with different concentrations of Ca2+ chelators. Low concentrations generally evoked a submaximal ICRAC, which developed slowly and monophasically. Higher concentrations resulted in a biphasic current in which the initial slow monophasic component developed into a faster and bigger second phase. 3. The kinetics of ICRAC as well as its final amplitude were not affected by Ca2+ chelators that had different affinities or speeds of binding. 4. Exogenous Ca2+ binding ratios > or = 16,670 were necessary to fully activate ICRAC. Because the Ca2+ binding ratio within the stores is presumably low, this indicates that other factors like Ca2+ transport across the stores membrane are rate limiting for passive store depletion. 5. Heparin and Ruthenium Red both failed to affect passive Ca2+ leak from the intracellular stores. 6. Treatment with sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pump blockers dramatically altered the kinetics of activation of biphasic currents, and increased the amplitude of monophasic ones. 7. Our results suggest that SERCA pumps are very effective in preventing ICRAC from activating passively, and are responsible for the phasic nature of the current, its time course of development and its overall extent.","['Fierro, L', 'Parekh, A B']","['Fierro L', 'Parekh AB']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signalling, Department of Physiology, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Physiol,The Journal of physiology,0266262,IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Calcium Channels/*metabolism', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Egtazic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Heparin/pharmacology', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Ruthenium Red', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/16 00:00,1999/10/16 00:01,['1999/10/16 00:00'],"['1999/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Physiol. 1999 Oct 15;520 Pt 2:407-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-7793.1999.00407.x.,,,"['PHY_9693 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1469-7793.1999.00407.x [doi]']","['0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '11103-72-3 (Ruthenium Red)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', ""K22DDW77C0 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid)"", 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'X9TLY4580Z (cyclopiazonic acid)']",['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,PMC2269586,,,,,,,,,,

One of the genes isolated (HLS7) is homologous to the novel human oncogene myeloid leukemia factor 1 (MLF1) involved in the t(3;5)(q25.1;q34) translocation associated with acute myeloid leukemia. Enforced expression of HLS7 in J2E cells induced a monoblastoid phenotype, thereby recapitulating the spontaneous erythroid to myeloid lineage switch. HLS7 also inhibited erythropoietin- or chemically-induced differentiation of erythroleukemic cell lines and suppressed development of erythropoietin-responsive colonies in semi-solid culture. However, intracellular signaling activated by erythropoietin was not impeded by ectopic expression of HLS7. In contrast, HLS7 promoted maturation of M1 monoblastoid cells and increased myeloid colony formation in vitro. These data show that HLS7 can influence erythroid/myeloid lineage switching and the development of normal hemopoietic cells.","['Williams, J H', 'Daly, L N', 'Ingley, E', 'Beaumont, J G', 'Tilbrook, P A', 'Lalonde, J P', 'Stillitano, J P', 'Klinken, S P']","['Williams JH', 'Daly LN', 'Ingley E', 'Beaumont JG', 'Tilbrook PA', 'Lalonde JP', 'Stillitano JP', 'Klinken SP']","['Laboratory for Cancer Medicine, Department of Biochemistry, Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, Western Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, Switch', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Oncogenes', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/16 00:00,1999/10/16 00:01,['1999/10/16 00:00'],"['1999/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1999 Oct 15;18(20):5559-66. doi: 10.1093/emboj/18.20.5559.,,,['10.1093/emboj/18.20.5559 [doi]'],"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MLF1 protein, human)', '0 (Mlf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)']",,,PMC1171624,,,['GENBANK/AF009515'],,,,,,,

Since antioxidants have been shown to protect against radiation-induced apoptosis, in this study we have evaluated the putative protective effect of ascorbate against radiation-induced apoptosis as well as the production of peroxides in the cells. HL60 cells transport the oxidized form of ascorbic acid, dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), and accumulate reduced ascorbate. Exposure of the cells to 5-40 Gy X radiation resulted in induction of apoptosis. Preincubation of the cells with DHA reduced the level of apoptosis after exposure to 5-20 Gy. Exposure of the cells to 5 or 20 Gy X radiation did not affect the intracellular concentration of peroxides, while phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), which is known to induce production of H(2)O(2) in cells (and served as a control), resulted in an increase in peroxides and a decrease in intracellular ascorbate. Irradiation of the cells with 1-3 Gy resulted in up-regulation of expression of BCL2 without affecting the level of apoptosis. At higher doses of radiation, enhanced BCL2 expression did not prevent radiation-induced apoptosis. Loading of the cells with ascorbate prior to their exposure to 1-3 Gy X radiation did not affect the enhanced BCL2 expression observed in the irradiated cells. At higher doses of radiation, ascorbate decreased apoptosis and restored the level of BCL2 in the cells. Exposure of the cells to 3-20 Gy X radiation enhanced the cell surface expression of TNFRSF6 (formerly known as Fas/APO-1) antigen and enhanced anti-TNFRSF6 antibody-induced apoptosis of the cells. Ascorbate loading did not affect expression of TNFRSF6 and did not overcome the anti-TNFRSF6 antibody-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that exposure of HL60 cells to radiation enhanced BCL2 and TNFRSF6 expression. Ascorbate did not affect BCL2 or TNFRSF6 expression. We therefore conclude that it protects HL60 cells against radiation-induced apoptosis, although the mechanisms of protection must still be elucidated.","['Witenberg, B', 'Kletter, Y', 'Kalir, H H', 'Raviv, Z', 'Fenig, E', 'Nagler, A', 'Halperin, D', 'Fabian, I']","['Witenberg B', 'Kletter Y', 'Kalir HH', 'Raviv Z', 'Fenig E', 'Nagler A', 'Halperin D', 'Fabian I']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Ascorbic Acid/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Peroxides/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'X-Rays', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",1999/10/16 00:00,1999/10/16 00:01,['1999/10/16 00:00'],"['1999/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 1999 Nov;152(5):468-78.,,,,"['0 (Peroxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A different pattern of relapse has been observed after allogeneic BMT for patients with leukemia. Compared with treatment using conventional chemotherapy alone, isolated extra-medullary relapse of disease appears to be seen more commonly after allogeneic BMT. While a full donor's hematopoiesis may be retained, prolonged morphological remission has been observed in the recipient's bone marrow. There appears to be a population of leukemic cells with an affinity to extra-medullary tissues. The failure of the leukemic clone to repopulate the recipient's marrow suggests the presence of a more profound GVL effect in the marrow environment. The optimal treatment for extra-medullary relapse of leukemia following allogeneic BMT remains uncertain. In the case of isolated extra-medullary relapses following BMT, the leukemia may still be responsive to further treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

Two classes of tumors were frequently observed: tumors of the haematopoietic system (lymphomas, myelocytic leukemias) and lung tumors. The results indicate that the genes controlling various aspects of tumor development were segregated in the CcS strain series. Large inter-strain differences were observed in the incidence of lung tumors. With lymphomas and leukemias, we not only observed strain differences in the incidence of tumors and in the latency of their development but also in the type of tumors (T- vs. B-cell lymphomas, myelocytic tumors) and in the frequency of their localized or disseminated (leukemic) form. Surprisingly, the myelocytic tumors, which occur very rarely or not at all in the parental strains BALB/c and STS or in their crosses, developed with high frequency in one of the CcS strains (CcS-2), indicating a unique combination of genes in this strain, which facilitates the development of myelocytic tumors. The effect of these genes is suppressed in the genetic composition of the parental strains. Tests of crosses of the resistant-strain CcS-13 with BALB/c indicated a suggestive linkage of a susceptibility gene for lymphomas to chromosome 5. These tests of the CcS strains illustrate the genetic complexity of the control of radiation-induced tumors in mice and suitability of these model systems to study their different facets.","['Szymanska, H', 'Sitarz, M', 'Krysiak, E', 'Piskorowska, J', 'Czarnomska, A', 'Skurzak, H', 'Hart, A A', 'de Jong, D', 'Demant, P']","['Szymanska H', 'Sitarz M', 'Krysiak E', 'Piskorowska J', 'Czarnomska A', 'Skurzak H', 'Hart AA', 'de Jong D', 'Demant P']","['Division of Genetics, Laboratory Animal Breeding, Department of Immunology, M.

Wnt proteins are believed to activate a transcription factor leukemia enhancer factor-1 (LEF-1) by inhibiting GSK, and Akt was shown to phosphorylate GSK and inhibit its kinase activity. We investigated the effect of an activated Akt on the accumulation of cytosolic beta-catenin and LEF-1-dependent transcription. Although the activated Akt, mAkt, clearly inhibited the kinase activity of GSK, mAkt alone did not induce accumulation of cytosolic beta-catenin or activate LEF-1-dependent transcription. On the contrary, coexpressed Wnt-1 and Frat activated LEF-1 but did not show significant inhibition of GSK-mediated phosphorylation of a peptide substrate. However, mAkt could act synergistically with Wnt-1 or Frat to activate LEF-1. In addition, the interaction of GSK for Axin appeared to decrease in the presence of mAkt, whereas the interaction for Frat remained unchanged. Consistently, a GSK mutant with substitution of a Phe residue for residue Tyr-216, which showed one-fifth of kinase activity of the wild-type GSK, exhibited a reduced association for Axin than the wild-type GSK. These results suggest that inhibition of GSK kinase activity is not sufficient for activation of LEF-1 but may facilitate the activation by reducing the interaction of GSK for Axin. The additional mechanism for LEF-1 activation may require dissociation of GSK from Axin as Frat facilitates the dissociation of GSK from Axin.","['Yuan, H', 'Mao, J', 'Li, L', 'Wu, D']","['Yuan H', 'Mao J', 'Li L', 'Wu D']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Rochester, New York 14642, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Axin Protein', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', '*Carrier Proteins', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinases', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1', 'Mice', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Wnt Proteins', 'Wnt1 Protein', '*Zebrafish Proteins', 'beta Catenin']",1999/10/16 00:00,1999/10/16 00:01,['1999/10/16 00:00'],"['1999/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Oct 22;274(43):30419-23. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.43.30419.,,,"['10.1074/jbc.274.43.30419 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)51699-4 [pii]']","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Axin Protein)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Frat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lef1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Wnt1 Protein)', '0 (Wnt1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.- (Glycogen Synthase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']","['GM53162/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM54167/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Two-cell murine embryos were obtained from ICR strain mice. INTERVENTION(S): Second-day intracytoplasmic sperm injection procedures were performed on oocytes that failed to be fertilized by IVF. Embryos were cultured to various stages and collected for study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The transcript levels of LIF and LIF-R in these embryos were examined and semiquantitated using single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction methodology. RESULT(S): Leukemia inhibitory factor and LIF-R transcripts were detectable in most human preimplantation embryos (30 of 34 and 31 of 34 embryos showed LIF and LIF-R messenger RNA, respectively). There was a trend toward decreased expression of both transcripts in embryos at the four-cell stage and in embryos in which growth had been arrested for 24-48 hours. The expression of LIF and LIF-R genes in murine embryos was inconsistent. CONCLUSION(S): Preimplantation human embryos express LIF and LIF-R messenger RNA. It is suggested that LIF may be able to affect embryo development through its action at stages before implantation in an autocrine or paracrine manner.","['Chen, H F', 'Shew, J Y', 'Ho, H N', 'Hsu, W L', 'Yang, Y S']","['Chen HF', 'Shew JY', 'Ho HN', 'Hsu WL', 'Yang YS']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Fertil Steril,Fertility and sterility,0372772,IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF']",1999/10/16 00:00,1999/10/16 00:01,['1999/10/16 00:00'],"['1999/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Fertil Steril. 1999 Oct;72(4):713-9. doi: 10.1016/s0015-0282(99)00306-4.,,,"['S0015-0282(99)00306-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0015-0282(99)00306-4 [doi]']","['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis of CLL, treatment indications, and response criteria were according to the National Cancer Institute established guidelines. Sixteen patients (53%) had advanced-stage disease, and four (13%) had trisomy 12 abnormality. The overall remission rate was 80%, including 20% complete remission (CR), 30% nodular partial remission (nPR), and 30% partial remission (PR). Minimal residual disease was detected phenotypically in two of five patients with CR and in eight of nine with nPR. Overall, CR, nPR, and PR rates were not influenced significantly by the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities or advanced clinical stage. With a median follow-up of 33 months, 58% of patients who had a response had relapse. Median time to progression in all 30 patients was 30 months, and time to progression and progression-free survival were not significantly different for the different response groups, clinical stages, or cytogenetic groups. Severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 33% and 7% of patients, respectively. Only two patients had documented bacterial infections, and four had herpetic infections. Concurrent combination chemotherapy with abbreviated doses of 2-CdA and standard-dose CLB is feasible and safe in previously untreated CLL.

Since MTX toxicity is related to drug exposure, a monitoring of serum MTX concentrations at H24, H48, H72 and until the concentration is less than 0.2 micromol/L is commonly performed. However, a number of patients may reach concentrations of less than 0.2 micromol/L long before the next sampling is scheduled. The aim of our study was to develop a Bayesian method predicting the time at which MTX concentration reaches 0.2 micromol/L in order to decrease the number of samples drawn and to allow for a more rapid patient discharge. Methotrexate population parameters were estimated from a retrospective analysis of 60 infusions in 23 children and MTX concentrations were predicted from an independent set of 20 courses in 14 children with a Bayesian approach using either one (H48) or two (H24 and H48) samples. The following population parameters were obtained using a two-compartment model: CL = 3.51 L/h (inter-individual variability: 66%), Vd = 8.67 L (58%), k12 = 0.0044 h(-1)(105%), k21 = 0.039 h(-1)(25%). Clearance and Vd were found to increase with weight and age respectively. Both sampling schedules tested for the Bayesian estimation enabled accurate prediction of concentrations and provided satisfactory precision despite a small bias. When considering the ability to predict the time at which the threshold was reached, the one-sample (H48) schedule gave the best results.

The transition of a 213Bi-radiolabeled antibody from a preclinical construct to a clinical drug represented a difficult task that involved development of reliable and validated methods to provide multiple MBq quantities of a pure, immunoreactive agent that met pharmaceutical standards to treat patients. METHODS: The methods used for the preparation of (213Bi)CHX-A-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA)-HuM195, an alpha particle-emitting anti-CD33 antibody construct for therapy of myeloid leukemias, is used as a specific example. This article describes methods for reagent purification, drug labeling, radioprotection and chromatographic purification. Quality of the drug is evaluated using radiochemical incorporation and purity assays with instant thin-layer chromatography (ITLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), determination of cell-based antibody total immunereactivity, small animal safety, pyrogen level, sterility and radionuclidic purity. RESULTS: Sixty-seven doses were prepared. Individual doses ranged from 148 to 814 MBq. Specific activities ranged from 329 to 766 MBq/mg. The radiolabeling efficiency (median +/- SD) of CHX-A-DTPA-HuM195 with 213Bi was 81% +/- 9% (n = 67) after 9 min. The construct was purified by size-exclusion chromatography and was found to be 99% +/- 2% pure (n = 67) by either ITLC or HPLC methods. The immunoreactivity of (213Bi)CHX-A-DTPA-HuM195 was 89% +/- 9% (n = 44) and was independent of the specific activity. The formulated pharmaceutical was found to contain < or =4 +/- 1 EU/mL pyrogens (n = 66); all samples examined were sterile.

METHODS: In exponentially growing HL60 cells, apoptosis was induced by ionizing radiation, hyperthermia, topotecan, and cytosine beta-D-arabinofuranoside. At 4 consecutive days following induction, apoptosis was detected by double-labelling, either with PI/annexin-V or PI/FDA. Forward and side scatter, red (PI), and green (FDA or annexin-V) fluorescence were measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: While light scatter discriminated between morphologically damaged and undamaged cells, fluorescence differentiated vital, apoptotic, and dead cells. Equal proportions of these three subpopulations were detected by both staining techniques. Occasionally, early and mature apoptoses were identified as distinct clusters. During the 4-day observation period, no pronounced maxima of the apoptotic fractions were obtained with either treatment modality. The gradual increases usually showed a delay of 1-2 days. CONCLUSIONS: FDA and annexin-V are equally suitable for detecting apoptosis. Separation improves with time after induction, indicating that, with respect to test specificity, mature apoptoses are superior to early stages. However, the sensitivity towards low rates of apoptosis after weak induction appears limited with both staining procedures.","['Bartkowiak, D', 'Hogner, S', 'Baust, H', 'Nothdurft, W', 'Rottinger, E M']","['Bartkowiak D', 'Hogner S', 'Baust H', 'Nothdurft W', 'Rottinger EM']","['Department of Radiooncology, University Hospital, Ulm, Germany. detlef.bartkowiak@medizin.uni-ulm.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Annexin A5/*metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluoresceins/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology/radiation effects', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Propidium/metabolism', 'Scattering, Radiation', 'Topotecan/pharmacology']",1999/10/16 00:00,1999/10/16 00:01,['1999/10/16 00:00'],"['1999/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1999 Nov 1;37(3):191-6. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19991101)37:3<191::aid-cyto5>3.0.co;2-u.,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19991101)37:3<191::AID-CYTO5>3.0.CO;2-U [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19991101)37:3<191::aid-cyto5>3.0.co;2-u [doi]']","['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'YL39R93PRE (diacetylfluorescein)']",,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we need a rapid, accurate, precise, and easy method for counting basophils. METHODS: Using flow cytometry, basophils (CD22+/CD19-) and B cells (CD22+/CD19+) were counted. Within a large lymphocyte light scatter gate, % basophils (G%baso) and % B cells (G%B) were determined from the total count. Another method of analysis was to make two regions (R1 for basophils and R2 for B cells) and to determine in those the % basophils (R1%baso) and % B cells (R2%B) without gating. The flow cytometric basophil counts of the blood of 21 normal controls and 43 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients were compared with manual basophil count (Ma%baso) and basophil count by Coulter electronic cell counter (Hialeah, FL) (Auto%baso). CD22+/CD19- cells were sorted by a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). RESULTS: The G%baso of all samples was 4.66 +/- 5.35%, and R1%baso was 4.23 +/- 4.88%, and they were well-correlated (r = 0.996, P < 0.001). The G%B of all samples was 1.55 +/- 1.68%, and R2%B was 1.59 +/- 1.67%, and they were also well-correlated (r = 0.993, P < 0.001). Their correlation was better in normal controls than in CML. G%baso was well-correlated to Ma%baso (r = 0.827) and Auto%baso (r = 0.806), and R1%baso was well-correlated to Ma%baso (r = 0.831) but showed poor correlation to Auto%baso (r = 0.734). Auto%baso revealed the poorest correlation to Ma%baso (r = 0.692). The sorted CD22+/CD19- cells were all basophils (99.48 +/- 0.30%), and they revealed CD13, CD33, and dim CD45 expression, whereas CD3, CD14, CD16, and HLA-DR were not detected on them. CONCLUSIONS: We discovered a specific marker combination to identify basophils (CD22+/CD19-), and we suggest that flow cytometric analysis using these markers is an easy, reliable, and accurate method of basophil counting.","['Han, K', 'Kim, Y', 'Lee, J', 'Lim, J', 'Lee, K Y', 'Kang, C S', 'Kim, W I', 'Kim, B K', 'Shim, S I', 'Kim, S M']","['Han K', 'Kim Y', 'Lee J', 'Lim J', 'Lee KY', 'Kang CS', 'Kim WI', 'Kim BK', 'Shim SI', 'Kim SM']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Catholic University Medical College, Seoul, Korea. hankja@cmc.cuk.ac.kr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD19/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Basophils/cytology/*metabolism', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', '*Lectins', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/metabolism', 'Leukocyte Count/methods', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2']",1999/10/16 00:00,1999/10/16 00:01,['1999/10/16 00:00'],"['1999/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1999 Nov 1;37(3):178-83. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19991101)37:3<178::aid-cyto3>3.3.co;2-q.,,['Cytometry. 2000 Jul 1;40(3):251.

These podia can dynamically extend and retract, often adhere to the substrate, and appear to connect cells up to 300 microm apart. The surface receptors found on these podia have not been described. METHODS: By using time-lapse fluorescent microscoscopy and immunostaining techniques, we describe a method for detecting surface receptors on these podia. This includes an in situ antibody staining procedure without fixing cells. RESULTS: We demonstrate, using CD34 selected mobilized peripheral blood cells and KG1a cells, that adhesion molecules known to play important roles in blood-cell migration and adhesion are present on these podia. These include: CD11a, CD18, CD29, CD34, CD45, CD49d, CD49e, and CD62L. Additionally, CD54 and CD44 were present on the podia extended by KG1a cells, but were not detectable on the primary CD34(+) cells. The integrin CD49d localized at the base of these podia in a time-dependent manner in KG1a cells. The frequency and morphology of these long podia on three myeloid leukemia-cell lines (KG1a, MV4-11, and AML-193) and a CD34-negative T-cell line (CEM) are also compared. KG1a and CEM cell lines extend long, dynamic podia that are similar to the podia on primary CD34(+) cells in morphology and adhesion molecule expression. The AML-193 and MV4-11 cell lines, however, did not extend these long podia. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a technique that provides a method of detecting surface receptors on thin cell membrane projections. These results support the likely role of these podia in cell migration and cell-cell communication.","['Holloway, W', 'Martinez, A R', 'Oh, D J', 'Francis, K', 'Ramakrishna, R', 'Palsson, B O']","['Holloway W', 'Martinez AR', 'Oh DJ', 'Francis K', 'Ramakrishna R', 'Palsson BO']","['Department of Bioengineering, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, California.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*analysis', 'Cell Movement', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*chemistry/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Pseudopodia/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/16 00:00,1999/10/16 00:01,['1999/10/16 00:00'],"['1999/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1999 Nov 1;37(3):171-7. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19991101)37:3<171::aid-cyto2>3.0.co;2-8.,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19991101)37:3<171::AID-CYTO2>3.0.CO;2-8 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19991101)37:3<171::aid-cyto2>3.0.co;2-8 [doi]']","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)']","['R01 HL59234/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL60398/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

B-CLL cells have been found to respond poorly to various activation signals and only after successful Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformation has it been possible to maintain such cells in long-term cultures. In this work we describe a new method to activate and induce proliferation in B-CLL cells and to maintain such cells in long-term culture for longer than 1 month. We used a combination of protocols in an attempt to mimic some of the signals of a thymus-dependent immune response. The B-CLL cells were first activated with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain 1 (SAC) particles plus thioredoxin (Trx), followed by stimulation with interleukin (IL)-2 + Trx. This treatment primed the cells for further stimulation with anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) presented on irradiated CD32L cells (the CD40-system) or soluble CD40 Ligand, and a combination of Trx and cytokines (IL-4 + IL-10), which allowed the cells to be maintained for up to 1 month with preserved viability and a variable rate of proliferation. However, induced proliferation of the B-CLL cells was limited to approximately 1 month, suggesting that additional signals are required to facilitate further proliferation.","['Soderberg, O', 'Thunberg, U', 'Weigelt, C', 'Christiansen, I', 'Totterman, T H', 'Carlsson, M', 'Sallstrom, J', 'Nilsson, K']","['Soderberg O', 'Thunberg U', 'Weigelt C', 'Christiansen I', 'Totterman TH', 'Carlsson M', 'Sallstrom J', 'Nilsson K']","['Instituto de Patologia e Imunologia Molecular da Universidade do Porto (IPATIMUP), Porto, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/*immunology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Cycle', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/isolation & purification', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Staphylococcus aureus/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/16 00:00,1999/10/16 00:01,['1999/10/16 00:00'],"['1999/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1999 Oct;50(4):363-70. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-3083.1999.00604.x.,,,"['sji604 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-3083.1999.00604.x [doi]']","['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A selective depletion of T cells has proved to be effective in preventing aGVHD but is associated with relapse and increased incidence of infection. As aGVHD is directed mainly against epithelial tissues we examined whether it would be feasible to selectively deplete T cells reactive with epithelial cells whilst preserving other specificities. Donor T cells which express HLA-DR, CD25, CD69 and CD71 activation markers after cocultivation with patient keratinocytes were depleted using magnetic cell separation techniques. Depletion of major as well as minor histocompatibility antigen activated T cells revealed a significant (P = 0.004 and P = 0.031, respectively) 10-fold decrease in the frequency of donor T lymphocyte precursors reactive with patient keratinocytes. The frequency reactive with third-party and patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells, including leukaemia cells, remained unchanged, supporting the notion that aGVHD and graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) may be separable. This alloantigen-specific depletion may be used in matched unrelated as well as HLA-identical sibling BMT for reducing aGVHD whilst conserving GVL.","['van Dijk, A M', 'Kessler, F L', 'Stadhouders-Keet, S A', 'Verdonck, L F', 'de Gast, G C', 'Otten, H G']","['van Dijk AM', 'Kessler FL', 'Stadhouders-Keet SA', 'Verdonck LF', 'de Gast GC', 'Otten HG']","['Jordan Laboratory, Department of Immunohaematology, University Hospital Utrecht, The Netherlands. a.m.c.vandijk@lab.azu.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1999/10/16 00:00,1999/10/16 00:01,['1999/10/16 00:00'],"['1999/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Oct;107(1):169-75. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01675.x.,,,"['bjh1675 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01675.x [doi]']",['0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

It appears that a PNH clone reaches detectable proportions only when there is selection in its favour. GPI-deficient T lymphocytes have been identified in patients treated with CAMPATH-1H, a monoclonal antibody against the GPI-linked CD52 molecule. CAMPATH-1H selects for cells that are deficient in CD52 (such as PNH-like cells) promoting the development of a PNH-like clone (analogous to PNH). We report that 10/15 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia developed PNH-like lymphocytes after therapy with CAMPATH-1H. The remaining five patients developed no PNH-like cells at any stage, including one patient who received 12 weeks of therapy. The inactivating PIG-A mutation has been identified in one patient. This mutation was detectable by an extremely sensitive mutation-specific PCR-based analysis in the patient's mononuclear cells prior to CAMPATH-1H therapy. The frequency and phenotype of GPI-deficient lymphocytes after CAMPATH-1H and the detection of a PIG-A mutation in the lymphocytes prior to CAMPATH-1H therapy indicated that such mutations were present in a very small proportion of cells prior to selection in their favour by CAMPATH-1H. This suggests that a large proportion of individuals have cells with PIG-A mutations that are not detectable by flow cytometry and thus may have the potential to develop PNH.","['Rawstron, A C', 'Rollinson, S J', 'Richards, S', 'Short, M A', 'English, A', 'Morgan, G J', 'Hale, G', 'Hillmen, P']","['Rawstron AC', 'Rollinson SJ', 'Richards S', 'Short MA', 'English A', 'Morgan GJ', 'Hale G', 'Hillmen P']","['Department of Haematology, University of Leeds, Leeds General Infirmary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*therapeutic use', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/*genetics', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1999/10/16 00:00,1999/10/16 00:01,['1999/10/16 00:00'],"['1999/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Oct;107(1):148-53. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01676.x.,,,"['bjh1676 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01676.x [doi]']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Attempts to draw comparisons with Western lymphomas have led to difficulties, with so-called African chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) having a different pattern of incidence from Western CLL. Splenomegaly is common in African CLL, and this has posed diagnostic problems in differentiating the tumour from malaria-associated hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS). One feature of the splenomegalic form of African CLL is that the tumour cells often possess short but fine cytoplasmic projections reminiscent of those observed in Western splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes (SLVL). Analysis of Ig VH genes both facilitates discrimination between clonal B-cell tumours and HMS, and reveals the differentiation status of the cell of origin. This study indicated that VH genes of nine cases of clonal splenic B-cell tumours with villous lymphocytes from Ghana were relatively unmutated, consistent with an origin from a naive B cell. These features differ from SLVL which arises from a post-follicular antigen-selected B cell. One possibility is that these splenic B-cell tumours derive from a splenic T-independent B cell, with malaria infection as a potential influence.","['Zhu, D', 'Thompsett, A R', 'Bedu-Addo, G', 'Stevenson, F K', 'Bates, I']","['Zhu D', 'Thompsett AR', 'Bedu-Addo G', 'Stevenson FK', 'Bates I']","['Molecular Immunology Group, Tenovus Research Laboratory, Southampton University Hospitals, Southampton, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Tropical Medicine']",1999/10/16 00:00,1999/10/16 00:01,['1999/10/16 00:00'],"['1999/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Oct;107(1):114-20. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01679.x.,,,"['bjh1679 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01679.x [doi]']","['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

De novo CLL cells expressed a low level of surface fas, and were not lysed by fasL-bearing cells. CLL cells cultured in media containing the type I cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 or interferon (IFN)-alpha had increased fas expression, and were readily lysed by fasL-bearing cells. In contrast, the type II cytokine IL-4 did not increase CLL cell fas, and abrogated type I cytokine-induced fas up-regulation. With prolonged culture, IL-4 exposed CLL cells expressed an intermediate level of fas; however, such CLL cells were resistant to fas-mediated lysis. These results indicate that IL-4 inhibits fas-mediated killing of CLL cells at the level of both fas receptor expression and post-receptor events. Additionally, we have defined in vitro culture conditions which generate fasL-bearing T cells from CLL patients; such T cells efficiently mediated fas-based lysis of autologous fas-positive CLL cells. We therefore conclude that type I and type II cytokines differentially regulate the fas pathway in CLL cells, and that a combination of type I cytokines and fasL-expressing T cells may represent a new approach to the immunotherapy of CLL.","['Williams, J F', 'Petrus, M J', 'Wright, J A', 'Husebekk, A', 'Fellowes, V', 'Read, E J', 'Gress, R E', 'Fowler, D H']","['Williams JF', 'Petrus MJ', 'Wright JA', 'Husebekk A', 'Fellowes V', 'Read EJ', 'Gress RE', 'Fowler DH']","['Transplantation Therapy Section, Medical Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*physiology', 'Interleukins/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",1999/10/16 00:00,1999/10/16 00:01,['1999/10/16 00:00'],"['1999/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Oct;107(1):99-105. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01670.x.,,,"['bjh1670 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01670.x [doi]']","['0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, life-threatening multiorgan failure commonly occurs, i.e. retinoic acid syndrome, and is thought to be the result of organ infiltration by leukaemic cells. We hypothesized that ATRA-induced differentiation of APL cells leads to adhesion receptor alterations responsible for leucocyte extravasation from the blood into tissue. Changes in adhesive properties of the APL cell line NB-4 in response to ATRA were investigated using a parallel plate flow chamber under conditions that recapitulate physiologic flow conditions. Untreated NB-4 cells initially tether and roll on activated human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers using a combination of E-selectin, P-selectin and alpha4 integrin. After ATRA treatment, > 80% of initial NB-4 cell attachment to endothelial cells was E-selectin dependent. Stable arrest (firm adherence) of NB-4 cells on activated endothelium was also altered by ATRA treatment. Untreated NB-4 cells used alpha4 integrin to arrest on endothelium, but beta2 integrin dependent arrest was induced by ATRA. With the acquisition of beta2 integrin function, ATRA-treated cells acquired the ability to transmigrate through activated endothelium. Thus, ATRA dramatically altered the adhesion phenotype on NB-4 cells: ATRA induced rolling largely attributable to E-selectin, abrogated alpha4 integrin dependent rolling, and promoted acquisition of beta2 integrin dependent firm adherence and transmigration. These findings represent novel cellular and differentiation effects of ATRA, and, to our knowledge, are the first demonstration that a therapeutic agent differentially regulates alpha4 and beta2 integrin on the same leucocyte.","['Brown, D C', 'Tsuji, H', 'Larson, R S']","['Brown DC', 'Tsuji H', 'Larson RS']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Endothelium, Vascular/pathology', 'Epitopes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1999/10/16 00:00,1999/10/16 00:01,['1999/10/16 00:00'],"['1999/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Oct;107(1):86-98. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01671.x.,,,"['bjh1671 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01671.x [doi]']","['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Epitopes)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",['IDEA PAR-96-012/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Survival for these three groups was 70%, 48% and 15% respectively and relapse rates were 33%. 50% and 78% (both P < 0.0001).

As a result, it is often difficult to obtain sufficient numbers of cells to undertake many of the assays that would be informative about the molecular events involved in the regulation of lineage-affiliated genes within these multipotent cells. To circumvent this problem, we have used the myeloproliferative leukaemia virus (MPLV) to generate a phenotypically diverse array of haemopoietic progenitors from adult mouse bone marrow and embryonic blood. These cells could be expanded to perform a variety of analyses that would not previously have been possible using analogous primary cells. The validity of these assays was supported by the observation that the phenotype of several MPLV-infected lines was very similar to previously described primary haemopoietic progenitor cells. By using mice transgenic for the human alpha and beta globin gene clusters, we have shown that human genes may also be investigated.

The leukaemogenic activity of the cytotoxic drugs employed for the treatment of PM may have played a potential role in only a proportion of patients, opening the possibility that some sALL patients may have developed two or more malignancies due to individual predisposing factors.","['Pagano, L', 'Pulsoni, A', 'Tosti, M E', 'Annino, L', 'Mele, A', 'Camera, A', 'Martino, B', 'Guglielmi, C', 'Cerri, R', 'Di Bona, E', 'Invernizzi, R', 'Castagnola, C', 'Bassan, R', 'Mele, L', 'Todeschini, G', 'Leone, G', 'Mandelli, F']","['Pagano L', 'Pulsoni A', 'Tosti ME', 'Annino L', 'Mele A', 'Camera A', 'Martino B', 'Guglielmi C', 'Cerri R', 'Di Bona E', 'Invernizzi R', 'Castagnola C', 'Bassan R', 'Mele L', 'Todeschini G', 'Leone G', 'Mandelli F']","['Department of Haematology, Catholic University, Largo Francesco Vito, I-00168 Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology']",1999/10/16 00:00,1999/10/16 00:01,['1999/10/16 00:00'],"['1999/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Sep;106(4):1037-40. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01636.x.,,,"['bjh1636 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01636.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the only two published population-based studies reported widely divergent incidence figures. To further explore the epidemiology of childhood MDS and to evaluate the accuracy of cancer registry and treatment trial data, we conducted a population-based study of children aged 0-14 years in British Columbia (BC), Canada, between 1982 and 1996. MDS was diagnosed in 31 cases corresponding to an annual incidence of 3.2 per million children or 6% of all leukaemias, compared with an incidence of 6.0/million for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), and of 0.5/million for chronic myeloid leukaemia. There was a non-significant (P = 0.19) trend toward an increase in MDS incidence with time, the increase was partly explained by an increasing number of patients with Down syndrome. Associated abnormalities were found in 48% of the MDS cases with Down syndrome as the most common (seven cases). Only one third of the MDS cases were correctly registered in the Cancer Registry and less than half of the eligible MDS patients were enrolled on a cooperative group study. Data on MDS from treatment-based studies and cancer registries were inaccurate and seemed to significantly underestimate the incidence of MDS in children.","['Hasle, H', 'Wadsworth, L D', 'Massing, B G', 'McBride, M', 'Schultz, K R']","['Hasle H', 'Wadsworth LD', 'Massing BG', 'McBride M', 'Schultz KR']","['Department of Paediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark. hasle@post2.tele.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'British Columbia/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Congenital Abnormalities/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1999/10/16 00:00,1999/10/16 00:01,['1999/10/16 00:00'],"['1999/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Sep;106(4):1027-32. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01645.x.,,,"['bjh1645 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01645.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This identified 66 patients with post transplant myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The actuarial risk for MDS/AML at 5 years post-transplant (+/-95% CI) was 4.6% (3.1-6.8) for Hodgkin's disease and 3.0% (2.0-4. 3) for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Multivariate analysis for all patients demonstrated an effect of age at transplant, radiotherapy at conditioning, number of transplants and interval between diagnosis and transplant as risk factors. For patients with NHL, grade of histology was important (low grade > intermediate or high-grade); for Hodgkin's disease, female sex was identified as a risk factor. These findings suggest that the incidence of MDS/AML may not be greater following an autograft than after conventional chemotherapy.","['Milligan, D W', 'Ruiz De Elvira, M C', 'Kolb, H J', 'Goldstone, A H', 'Meloni, G', 'Rohatiner, A Z', 'Colombat, P', 'Schmitz, N']","['Milligan DW', 'Ruiz De Elvira MC', 'Kolb HJ', 'Goldstone AH', 'Meloni G', 'Rohatiner AZ', 'Colombat P', 'Schmitz N']","['Department of Haematology, Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham B9 5SS, UK. milligd@heartsol.wmids.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*epidemiology', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1999/10/16 00:00,1999/10/16 00:01,['1999/10/16 00:00'],"['1999/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Sep;106(4):1020-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01627.x.,,,"['bjh1627 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01627.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median age of patients enrolled was 45 years. The endpoints of the study were clinical efficacy and toxicity. The survival rates at 3 years and 5 years were 77% and 56%, respectively. The rate of complete haematological response was 60%. Evaluation of cytogenetic response was available in 29/65 patients. A complete cytogenetic response was seen in 3/29 patients (10%). W.H.O. toxicity grade 3-4 occurred in only 22/523 evaluable treatment cycles. Since the study protocol required intermittent or definitive discontinuation of cytarabine in case of moderate leucopenia (white blood cells (WBC) <5 x 109/l), combined cytopenia (WBC < 5 x 109/l, platelets <100 x 109/l), and isolated moderate thrombocytopenia (<100 x 109/l), the drug had to be discontinued temporarily or definitively in 200 cycles and the dose of cytarabine had to be reduced in 35 cycles. Thus, only 25% of the planned dose of cytarabine could be administered. At this dosage it would appear that cytarabine had no effect on survival and did not improve remission rates. We conclude that a clinical benefit for the addition of cytarabine to the treatment of CML with IFN might only be achieved by the administration of a higher cumulative dose of cytarabine, suggesting that lower leucocyte counts of 2-4 x 109/l have to be tolerated.","['Lindauer, M', 'Domkin, D', 'Dohner, H', 'Kolb, H J', 'Neubauer, A', 'Huhn, D', 'Kreiter, H', 'Koch, B', 'Huber, C', 'Aulitzky, W', 'Fischer, T']","['Lindauer M', 'Domkin D', 'Dohner H', 'Kolb HJ', 'Neubauer A', 'Huhn D', 'Kreiter H', 'Koch B', 'Huber C', 'Aulitzky W', 'Fischer T']","['III.

B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) cells were treated in vitro with CD40-ligand (CD40L) (CD154) or the protein kinase C modulator Bryostatin-1, exploring the effects on: (a) sensitivity to apoptosis induction by chemotherapeutic drugs (fludarabine, dexamethasone) or anti-Fas antibody; (b) expression of apoptosis-regulatory proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-X, Mcl-1, Bax, Bak, BAG-1, Flip, XIAP); (c) expression of cell surface co-stimulatory antigens (CD80 [B7.1]; CD54 [ICAM-1]; CD70); and (d) expression of immune modulatory receptors (CD27, CD40, CD95 [Fas]). CD40L and Bryostatin decreased both spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis in most B-CLL specimens tested. Apoptosis resistance was associated with CD40L- and Bryostatin-induced elevations in the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1. CD40L also induced striking increases in the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL in B-CLLs. CD40L stimulated increases in the surface expression of CD40, CD54, CD69, CD70, CD80 and CD95, whereas Bryostatin induced expression of CD40, CD54, CD69 and CD95 but not the co-stimulatory molecules CD70 and CD80. Despite elevations in the expression of CD95 (Fas), anti-Fas antibodies failed to induce apoptosis of CD40L- and Bryostatin-treated B-CLL cells. This Fas-resistance was associated with increased expression of the Fas-antagonist Flip in CD40L-treated, and with elevations in the caspase inhibitor XIAP in Bryostatin-treated B-CLLs. The potential anti-apoptotic properties of CD40L and Bryostatin should be taken into consideration when employing these agents in clinical trials involving patients with B-CLL.","['Kitada, S', 'Zapata, J M', 'Andreeff, M', 'Reed, J C']","['Kitada S', 'Zapata JM', 'Andreeff M', 'Reed JC']","['The Burnham Institute, Program on Apoptosis and Cell Death Research, La Jolla, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bryostatins', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activators/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/16 00:00,1999/10/16 00:01,['1999/10/16 00:00'],"['1999/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Sep;106(4):995-1004. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01642.x.,,,"['bjh1642 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01642.x [doi]']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Enzyme Activators)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)']","['CA-55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-69381/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Since mutation and/or deletion of the p53 gene has been reported to be associated with disease progression in a wide variety of human cancers, including adult-type chronic myelogenous leukaemia, we studied the p53 gene in 20 patients with JMML (16 samples in chronic phase and seven at blast crisis). Exons 4-8 of the p53 gene, which cover all the hot spots of point mutations, were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and subjected to mutation screening by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. No mobility shift of single-strand DNA of PCR products in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating point mutations, was found in 19/20 patients. DNA of the remaining patient in the chronic phase failed to be amplified by PCR and Southern blot analysis with XbaI-digested genomic DNA revealed a gross rearrangement (presumed deletion) of the p53 gene. These data indicate that abnormalities of the p53 gene are rare in JMML and not responsible for acute transformation, but could be involved in the pathogenesis of some cases of JMML.","['Miyauchi, J', 'Asada, M', 'Tsunematsu, Y', 'Kaneko, Y', 'Kojima, S', 'Mizutani, S']","['Miyauchi J', 'Asada M', 'Tsunematsu Y', 'Kaneko Y', 'Kojima S', 'Mizutani S']","[""Department of Virology, National Children's Medical Research Centre, Aichi, Japan.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational']",1999/10/16 00:00,1999/10/16 00:01,['1999/10/16 00:00'],"['1999/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Sep;106(4):980-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01634.x.,,,"['bjh1634 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01634.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The system is based on the stable transfection of a normal or mutated beta-globin gene into mouse erythroleukaemia (MEL) cells. The expression construct contains an Agamma gene as an internal control and both globin genes are under the control of the HS2 element of the beta LCR. The system enables analysis of transcription, RNA processing and transport, as well as mRNA stability. With non-mutant genes, high-level expression of both beta and Agamma genes is seen and both mRNAs are stable. The system was validated by comparing the expression of the beta654 thalassaemia splicing mutation in MEL cells with its well-characterized expression in vivo. The level of the initial transcript, the proportion of abnormally spliced mRNA and its instability during erythroid cell maturation were all faithfully reproduced. The system was used to examine the mechanism by which two mutations in the beta-globin 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) result in beta thalassaemia. Surprisingly, the mechanism appeared to differ in the two cases, with the C-G substitution at position +33 affecting transcription, whereas the -T deletion at position +10 resulted in a translational defect. The stably transfected MEL cells, with an internal control and an endogenous enhancer, appear to be a valid and realistic experimental model, superior to transient expression studies. This system should find wide application in the analysis of the effects and mechanisms of gene inactivation in mutations affecting the beta-globin as well as other genes.","['Ho, P J', 'Sloane-Stanley, J', 'Athanassiadou, A', 'Wood, W G', 'Thein, S L']","['Ho PJ', 'Sloane-Stanley J', 'Athanassiadou A', 'Wood WG', 'Thein SL']","['MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford. j.ho@centenary.usyd.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions/*genetics"", 'Animals', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/16 00:00,1999/10/16 00:01,['1999/10/16 00:00'],"['1999/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Sep;106(4):938-47. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01659.x.,,,"['bjh1659 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01659.x [doi]']","[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arachidonic acid (AA), a biologically active fatty acid, plays a crucial role as a mediator of signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival. In this study, we investigated the potential role of AA as a proapoptotic agent in CML. Pretreatment of human CML isolated progenitor cells with AA (100 microM for 18 h) induced 71-75% inhibition of in vitro colony formation of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units, multilineage colony-forming units, and erythroid burst-forming units. This inhibition was significantly greater than the effect on normal progenitor cells (19-39% growth inhibition of erythroid burst-forming units, multilineage colony-forming units, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units). AA also inhibited growth of the bcr-abl-transformed cell line H7.bcr-abl A54. In contrast, a minimal effect of AA on inhibition of cell growth was observed in the parental nontransformed NSF/N1.H7 cell line. The antiproliferative effect of AA was associated with apoptosis. Gamma-linolenic acid, a precursor of AA, also inhibited cell growth, whereas other unsaturated and saturated fatty acids had no effect. Pharmacological inhibition of cyclooxygenase, lipooxygenase, and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase enzymes prior to exposure to AA did not rescue cells from the inhibitory effect of AA. Moreover, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid, a nonmetabolizable arachidonate analogue, also inhibited cell growth, suggesting that the effect of AA did not require further metabolism. Treatment with antioxidants prior to stimulation with AA was also ineffective in preventing its antiproliferative effect. Thus, AA inhibited proliferation of CML cells by inducing apoptotic cell death. The signaling mechanisms of AA-induced inhibition of cell growth appeared to be independent of its conversion into eicosanoids or free radical generation.","['Rizzo, M T', 'Regazzi, E', 'Garau, D', 'Akard, L', 'Dugan, M', 'Boswell, H S', 'Rizzoli, V', 'Carlo-Stella, C']","['Rizzo MT', 'Regazzi E', 'Garau D', 'Akard L', 'Dugan M', 'Boswell HS', 'Rizzoli V', 'Carlo-Stella C']","['Signal Transduction Laboratory, Methodist Research Institute, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA. mrizzo@clarian.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraynoic Acid/pharmacology', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arachidonic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Caffeic Acids/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Ketoconazole/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Male', 'Masoprocol/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/16 00:00,1999/10/16 00:01,['1999/10/16 00:00'],"['1999/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Oct 1;59(19):5047-53.,,,,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Caffeic Acids)', '1191-85-1 (5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraynoic Acid)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '7BO8G1BYQU (Masoprocol)', 'R9400W927I (Ketoconazole)', 'U2S3A33KVM (caffeic acid)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of polyamine oxidase in hematopoietic cells by a specific inhibitor, N,N'-bis(2,3-butadienyl)-1,4-butanediamine (MDL-72,527), reduces the levels of Put and Spd and induces the accumulation of N1-acetylated Spd. Although previously thought to be relatively nontoxic, we now report that this inhibitor overrides survival factors to induce cell death of several immortal and malignant murine and human hematopoietic cells, but not of primary myeloid progenitors. Cells treated with MDL-72,527 displayed biochemical changes typical of apoptosis, and cell death was associated with the down-regulation of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-X(L). However, enforced overexpression of Bcl-X(L), or treatment with the universal caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, failed to block MDL-72,527-induced apoptosis in these hematopoietic cells. Despite decreases in Put and Spd pools, MDL-72,527-induced apoptosis was not blocked by cotreatment with exogenous Put or Spd, nor was it influenced by overexpression or inhibition of the polyamine biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase. Significantly, MDL-72,527-induced apoptosis was associated with the rapid formation of numerous lysosomally derived vacuoles. Malignant leukemia cells were variably sensitive to the lysosomotropic effects of MDL-72,527, yet pretreatment with the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor L-alpha-difluoromethylornithine sensitized all of these leukemia cells to the deleterious effects of the inhibitor by stimulating its intracellular accumulation. The lysosomotropic nature of select polyamine analogues may, thus, provide a novel chemotherapeutic strategy to selectively induce apoptosis of malignant hematopoietic cells.","['Dai, H', 'Kramer, D L', 'Yang, C', 'Murti, K G', 'Porter, C W', 'Cleveland, J L']","['Dai H', 'Kramer DL', 'Yang C', 'Murti KG', 'Porter CW', 'Cleveland JL']","[""Department of Biochemistry, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Eflornithine/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Lysosomes/*drug effects/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Polyamines/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Putrescine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Spermidine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Spermine/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein']",1999/10/16 00:00,1999/10/16 00:01,['1999/10/16 00:00'],"['1999/10/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Oct 1;59(19):4944-54.,,,,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '14278-49-0 (N(1)-acetylspermidine)', '1YVR349GN4 (MDL 72527)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors)', 'EC 1.5.3.- (polyamine oxidase)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']","['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK44158/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that, in cycling T-lymphoblastoid cells, ara-G may act directly by incorporation into DNA, which may lead to apoptosis. Hence, blocking the incorporation of ara-G monophosphate (ara-GMP) into DNA may prevent apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we performed experiments in a T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (CCRF-CEM) after synchronization with a double aphidicolin block. Intracellular accumulation of ara-GTP was neither cell cycle dependent nor affected by aphidicolin (53 +/- 5 microM/h without aphidicolin, 50 +/- 5 microM/h with aphidicolin). Cells at the G1-S boundary accumulated 75 +/- 7 microM ara-GTP with minimal incorporation into DNA (5 +/- 2 pmol ara-GMP/mg DNA) and had little biochemical or morphological evidence of apoptosis. In marked contrast, cells in S phase had significantly more ara-G incorporated into DNA (24 +/- 4 pmol ara-GMP/mg DNA), although the cytosolic concentration of ara-GTP (85 +/- 7 microM) was similar to that in the G1-enriched population. In the S-phase cells, there was a corresponding increase in apoptosis (measured as high molecular weight DNA fragmentation and morphological changes), and the incorporation of ara-GTP into DNA resulted in a >95% inhibition of DNA synthesis. There was a direct linear relationship between the number of cells in S phase and both the total number of ara-GMP molecules in DNA and the inhibition of DNA synthesis. Blocking of ara-GTP incorporation into S-phase DNA abolished biochemical and morphological features of apoptosis, even in the presence of cytotoxic level of intracellular ara-GTP. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the incorporation of ara-GTP into DNA is the critical event that mediates the induction of apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells.","['Rodriguez, C O Jr', 'Gandhi, V']","['Rodriguez CO Jr', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Aphidicolin/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Arabinonucleosides/*pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'S Phase', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/16 09:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/10/16 09:00'],"['1999/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Oct 1;59(19):4937-43.,,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '38819-10-2 (9-arabinofuranosylguanine)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)']","['CA 32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 57629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The marrow from patients pretreated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is enriched with multifactor-responsive high proliferative potential colony-forming cells. To develop an efficient ex vivo chemical purging system, we evaluated interaction between 4-HC and 5-FU. We investigated the antitumor effect of cyclophosphamide, a mother compound of 4-HC, and 5-FU against L1210 ascites tumor in B6D2F1 mice. The median lifespan of the mice treated with 4-HC or 5-FU alone was 8 and 12 days, respectively. The combination of both drugs significantly extended the median lifespan to 18.5 days. The median effect plot analysis indicated a synergistic cytotoxic interaction between 5-FU and 4-HC in 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl terazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Clonogenic assay also showed that combination of 4-HC and 5-FU significantly reduced L1210 leukemic colonies to 20% of untreated control. Bone marrow cells from the mice treated with 5-FU at 150 mg/kg body weight was resistant to 4-HC at concentrations as high as 0.2 microgram/ml, which was more than 70% inhibitory concentration for colony formation in L1210 leukemic cells.

STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed 37 consecutive archived FNAB malignant lymphoma specimens. Immunophenotypic data from the fine needle aspiration biopsy and excisional biopsy material was available for all specimens. PCR to identify monoclonal rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene, T-cell receptor and translocations involving the bcl-1 and bcl-2 genes was performed. RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of cases were detected by at least one of these assays. Where DNA analysis was performed on excisional biopsy material, 70% of the cases had identical results; no discordant results for the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene or T-cell receptor were found. In 23% of cases, after review of all available data, a discordant result was thought to be a consequence of a false negative result in DNA analysis of excisional biopsy material.

Pgp expression was performed by immunocytochemistry (ICC) using the avidin-biotin peroxidase technique with JSB1 and UIC2 monoclonal antibodies. Flow cytometry (FCM) analysis of Pgp was investigated using UIC2 in an indirect immunofluorescent assay. UIC2 staining was measured by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test and fluorescence intensity ratio. Finally, the rhodamine 123 test (Rh 123) with or without verapamil was performed to detect functional activity. RESULTS: by ICC, results of JSB1 and UIC2 were consistent in 94% of the cases. In 74% of the cases, concordant conclusions were observed by ICC and FCM. Overall, Pgp expression was detected in 67% of the cases (ICC/JSB1+ and ICC/UIC2+ or FCM/UIC2+). Functional activity of Pgp was shown in 59% of the patients. Rh 123 efflux was correlated with Pgp expression in 70% of the 27 studied cases but 3 cases were Pgp-/Rh 123+ and 5 Pgp+/Rh 123-.

A wide array of phenolic substances, particularly those present in dietary and medicinal plants, have been reported to possess substantial anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic activities. The majority of these naturally occurring phenolics retain antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties which appear to contribute to their chemopreventive or chemoprotective activity. Capsaicin (trans-8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide), a pungent ingredient of hot chili pepper, protects against experimentally-induced mutagenesis and tumorigenesis. It also induces apoptosis in various immortalized or malignant cell lines. Plants of ginger family (Zingiberaceae) have been frequently and widely used as spices and also, in traditional oriental medicine. Curcumin, a yellow ingredient from turmeric (Curcuma longa L., Zingiberaceae), has been extensively investigated for its cancer chemopreventive potential. Yakuchinone A [1-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-7-phenyl-3-heptanone] and yakuchinone B [1-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-7-phenylhept-1-en-3-one] present in Alpinia oxyphylla Miquel (Zingiberaceae) have inhibitory effects on phorbol ester-induced inflammation and skin carcinogenesis in mice, and oxidative stress in vitro. These diarylheptanoids suppress phorbol ester-induced activation of ornithine decarboxylase and production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-1alpha and their mRNA expression. They also nullified the phorbol ester-stimulated induction of activator protein 1 (AP-1) in cultured human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells. In addition, both yakuchinone A and B induced apoptotic death in HL-60 cells. Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe, Zingiberaceae) contains such pungent ingredients as [6]-gingerol and [6]-paradol, which also have anti-tumor promotional and antiproliferative effects. Resveratrol (3, 5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene), a phytoalexin found in grapes and other dietary and medicinal plants, and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, a major antioxidative green tea polyphenol, exert striking inhibitory effects on diverse cellular events associated with multi-stage carcinogenesis. In addition, these compounds have ability to suppress proliferation of human cancer cells via induction of apoptosis.","['Surh, Y']",['Surh Y'],"['Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Shinlim-dong, Kwanak-gu, Seoul, South Korea. surh@plaza.snu.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,"['Animals', 'Capsaicin/pharmacology', 'Catechin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Catechols', 'Curcumin/pharmacology', 'Diet', 'Fatty Alcohols/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/prevention & control', 'Phenols/*pharmacology', 'Plants, Edible', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/pharmacology']",1999/10/13 00:00,1999/10/13 00:01,['1999/10/13 00:00'],"['1999/10/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/13 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1999 Jul 16;428(1-2):305-27. doi: 10.1016/s1383-5742(99)00057-5.,,,"['S1383574299000575 [pii]', '10.1016/s1383-5742(99)00057-5 [doi]']","['0 (Catechols)', '0 (Fatty Alcohols)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', '925QK2Z900 (gingerol)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)', 'S07O44R1ZM (Capsaicin)']",,,,239,,,,,,,,,

Thus, topical application of yakuchinone A or B significantly suppressed TPA-induced epidermal ornithine decarboxylase activity. They also reduced TPA-stimulated production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in cultured human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells. Both compounds blunted the TPA-induced superoxide generation in differentiated HL-60 cells in a concentration-related manner and also inhibited lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenates. Furthermore, yakuchinone A and yakuchinone B nullified the activation of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) in immortalized mouse fibroblast cells in culture.

G-band cytogenetic analysis showed that specific deletions involving regions D-E of one copy of mouse chromosome 2 [del(2)(D-E)] were frequently associated in both radiation- and benzene-induced acute leukemias. In addition, translocations of chr2(D-E) were also observed in some cases. These results suggest an important role of chr2 (D-E) deletions and translocations in the development of radiation- and benzene-induced murine acute leukemias. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with DNA probes specific for 2(D-E), constructed in our laboratory by means of chromosomal microdissection and PCR amplification, also demonstrate 2(D-E) deletions and/or translocations in these leukemic cells. Aneuploidy of chromosomes 3, 15, 16, and Y were also frequently detected in benzene-induced leukemic cells with or without lesions on chr2. These cytogenetic findings support the previous observations that metabolites of benzene lead to spindle-fiber disruption or abnormal cytokinesis in exposed animals. In summary, genetic instabilities observed in leukemic cells isolated from mice that had developed leukemia after exposure to radiation or benzene are syntenic with those frequently detected in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, acute ML, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Thus, the CBA/Ca mouse has several characteristics that make it an excellent model for the study of radiation or benzene leukemogenesis in humans.","['Rithidech, K', 'Dunn, J J', 'Bond, V P', 'Gordon, C R', 'Cronkite, E P']","['Rithidech K', 'Dunn JJ', 'Bond VP', 'Gordon CR', 'Cronkite EP']","['Department of Pathology, BHS T9, SUNY at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794-8691, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*chemically induced/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/13 00:00,1999/10/13 00:01,['1999/10/13 00:00'],"['1999/10/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/13 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1999 Jul 16;428(1-2):33-9. doi: 10.1016/s1383-5742(99)00029-0.,,,"['S1383-5742(99)00029-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s1383-5742(99)00029-0 [doi]']",['J64922108F (Benzene)'],,,,63,,,,,,,,,

It is highly expressed in several human malignancies, and a role in the suppression of antitumor immune responses has been suggested. We evaluated FasL expression in leukemia and normal hematopoietic cells. By Western blotting, all acute leukemic cell lines (n = 9) and primary samples of acute leukemic marrow (n = 4) revealed high levels of FasL. In contrast, much weaker signals were observed in samples of normal marrow (n = 5), and either weak or intermediate expression was seen in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (n = 7). Additional leukemic samples were examined by immunohistochemistry. Staining for FasL was negative in 7 of 9 cases of chronic-phase CML, whereas all cases of CML in blast crisis (n = 6), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 6), and acute myeloid leukemia (n = 11) stained strongly in 60 to 100% of nucleated cells. FasL+ leukemic cell lines did not trigger Fas-mediated apoptosis in either Jurkat cells or activated human T lymphocytes, possibly related to the intracellular location of the ligand. Western analysis of normal marrow subpopulations revealed that most FasL in marrow mononuclear cells was expressed by CD7+ lymphocytes. FasL also was strongly expressed in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells from both normal and chronic-phase CML marrow, suggesting a correlation with primitive maturation stage. In summary, high levels of FasL expression were associated with aggressive biologic behavior in leukemia, including transformation of CML to blast crisis. This could potentially represent a response to loss of proapoptotic Fas signaling, which is known to occur in acute leukemic blasts.","['Lickliter, J D', 'Kratzke, R A', 'Nguyen, P L', 'Niehans, G A', 'Miller, J S']","['Lickliter JD', 'Kratzke RA', 'Nguyen PL', 'Niehans GA', 'Miller JS']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis', 'Blast Crisis/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis']",1999/10/12 00:00,1999/10/12 00:01,['1999/10/12 00:00'],"['1999/10/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 Oct;27(10):1519-27. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00091-0.,,,"['S0301-472X(99)00091-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00091-0 [doi]']","['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",['P01-CA-65493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The major predictive factor for response is the disease stage at time of treatment, because patients in molecular or cytogenetic relapse fare better than those in hematologic relapse. Moreover, patients with a short interval between transplant and DLI have a higher probability of response than those with longer intervals. The durability of DLI-induced remissions has not yet been established, but they appear to be prolonged. The observation that DLI can be highly effective for patients in relapse has encouraged the recent development of new strategies designed to minimize the myeloablative regimen and exploit the immunotherapeutic component of the transplant. The principal complication associated with use of DLI is the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Several approaches have been tested to reduce the incidence or impact of GVHD, based on the ex vivo depletion of alloreactive donor cells or the use of donor T cells transduced with a suicide gene. The incidence of GVHD can also be reduced by starting with low doses of donor cells and ""escalating"" subsequent doses as required. However, the identification of selective targets for leukemia-reactive immunity is probably the optimal strategy to resolve the problem of GVHD. Although currently minor histocompatibility antigens appear to be the most likely targets for DLI, several groups are focusing on the generation of leukemia-specific immunity. The results obtained by use of tumor-associated antigens presented by dendritic cells are encouraging and may lay the foundations for the use of adoptive immunotherapy in the autologous setting.","['Dazzi, F', 'Szydlo, R M', 'Goldman, J M']","['Dazzi F', 'Szydlo RM', 'Goldman JM']","['Department of Haematology, Hammersmith Hospital/ICSM, London, United Kingdom. f.dazzi@ic.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Blood Transfusion, Autologous', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",1999/10/12 00:00,1999/10/12 00:01,['1999/10/12 00:00'],"['1999/10/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 Oct;27(10):1477-86. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00096-x.,,,"['S0301-472X(99)00096-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00096-x [doi]']",,,,,90,,,,,,,,,

Thus, the distribution of choline among the different metabolites is important for a better understanding of the regulation of these pathways in neurons. A non-HPLC method for the simultaneous separation of five choline metabolites found in neurons is described. High voltage electrophoresis (HVE) was combined with thin layer chromatography (TLC) to separate choline, PCh, CDP-choline, acetylcholine and betaine. This method is useful in studying the distribution of choline among its different metabolites in radiotracer experiments. Aqueous metabolites from leukemia inhibitory factor treated LA-N-2 cells labeled with [methyl-3H]choline were separated by HVE followed by TLC in the same dimension. Although the separation appeared to be complete, some 'tailing' by PCh significantly elevated the radioactivity measured in CDP-choline. This tailing of PCh was confirmed by subjecting radiolabeled PCh alone to this multiple separation method. Contamination of CDP-choline by PCh was eliminated by subjecting the samples to HVE followed by TLC in the second dimension. This two-dimensional approach was consistently reproducible and achieved excellent resolution of all five metabolites. In addition, this technique also resolved a sixth choline-containing metabolite, glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC), a breakdown product of phosphatidylcholine.","['Utal, A K', 'Coleman, P D']","['Utal AK', 'Coleman PD']","['Department of Neurobiology and Anatomy, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, NY 14642, USA. amandip_utal@urmc.rochester.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Neurosci Methods,Journal of neuroscience methods,7905558,IM,"['Choline/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Choline Kinase/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', '*Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Electrophoresis/*methods', 'Phosphorylcholine/chemical synthesis', 'Solubility', 'Tritium', 'Water/chemistry']",1999/10/12 00:00,1999/10/12 00:01,['1999/10/12 00:00'],"['1999/10/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurosci Methods. 1999 Aug 1;90(1):13-21. doi: 10.1016/s0165-0270(99)00059-x.,,,"['S0165-0270(99)00059-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-0270(99)00059-x [doi]']","['0 (methylcholine)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', 'EC 2.7.1.32 (Choline Kinase)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)']","['P30 AG08665/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG14441/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 AG09016/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Gram-positive organisms caused 233 (53%) episodes of bacteremia, gram-negative organisms caused 151 (34%) episodes, and 48 (11%) episodes were polymicrobial. The overall mortality within 30 days of the onset of bacteremia was 24.4%.

A contribution to the Debate Round-Table on Phenotypic and Genotypic Analyses of Multidrug Resistance (MDR) in Clinical Hospital Practice.,1627-9,"The detection of multidrug resistance (MDR) in clinical hospital practice represents an important strategy to combat clinical tumor drug resistance. Predicting the response of tumors to cytostatic drugs is of prognostic value. The 'Debate Round-Table on Phenotypic and Genotypic Analyses of Multidrug Resistance (MDR) in Clinical Hospital Practice' was launched in 1997 to address specific questions on this topic. The results published thus far are a rich source to learn about the promises and pitfalls of methods, eg surrogate and functional tests and protein or mRNA expression assays as well. In the present paper, some requirements are discussed for applications of drug resistance testing in clinical routine diagnostics. To improve the detection of low-level resistance, established methodologies may be strengthened with respect to: (1) standardization of sample handling, antibodies, PCR primers, and detection reagents; (2) standardization of protocols and far reaching automation in performance and evaluation of results to ensure high quality control criteria. Sophisticated new techniques will feature: (1) high-throughput analyses for the 'horizontal screening' of single drug resistance genes in large numbers of patient samples at economically fair costs; (2) 'vertical screening' of a large number of resistance mechanisms operating upstream or downstream of the actual drug-target interaction sites, in order to detect more complex and multifaceted genotypes and phenotypes of multidrug resistance.","['Efferth, T']",['Efferth T'],"['Institute for Clinical and Molecular Virology, University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Schlossgarten 4, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Conference', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Phenotype', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1999/10/12 00:00,1999/10/12 00:01,['1999/10/12 00:00'],"['1999/10/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Oct;13(10):1627-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401551.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401551 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To improve the detection of clonal TCR gamma (TCRG) gene rearrangements by Southern blot analysis, we designed four new Jgamma probes and determined the most optimal restriction enzymes to be used with these probes. Based on detailed analysis of the sequences as well as on hybridization experiments with the TCRGJ21 probe, the Jgamma1.2 and Jgamma2.1 downstream areas were found to be highly homologous, suggesting that during evolution the duplication of the Jgamma region was followed by deletion of the tentative Jgamma2.2 gene segment. Southern blot analysis of 51 T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) revealed that all TCRG gene rearrangements can be detected by use of the TCRGJ13 probe in EcoRI digests and the TCRGJ21 probe in PstI digests. Additional probes and digests allow a more precise identification of the exact type of TCRG gene rearrangements in the majority of cases. Almost 90% of the TCRG gene rearrangements in T-ALL involved the Jgamma2 region (16% Jgamma2.1 and 72% Jgamma2.3), whereas Jgamma1 region rearrangements were particularly found in TCRgammadelta+ T-ALL. This information has implications for design of primer sets for PCR analysis at diagnosis and for PCR target choice in detection of minimal residual disease during follow-up of T-ALL patients.","['Moreau, E J', 'Langerak, A W', 'van Gastel-Mol, E J', 'Wolvers-Tettero, I L', 'Zhan, M', 'Zhou, Q', 'Koop, B F', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Moreau EJ', 'Langerak AW', 'van Gastel-Mol EJ', 'Wolvers-Tettero IL', 'Zhan M', 'Zhou Q', 'Koop BF', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus University Rotterdam/University Hospital Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', '*Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Restriction Mapping']",1999/10/12 00:00,1999/10/12 00:01,['1999/10/12 00:00'],"['1999/10/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Oct;13(10):1620-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401540.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401540 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we have shown that adenoviral vectors can be used for the transduction of normal human progenitors with gene transfer efficiencies of approximately 30%. However, this approach is limited by relatively slow uptake kinetics (24-48 h) and a strong dependence on the presence of exogenous cytokines. Thus, we have modified this approach by combining adenoviral vectors with polycations to generate a virus-polycation complex, or VPC. Vehicles of this nature, when composed of conventional adenoviral vectors and polyamidoamine dendrimers, are a highly efficient means of transducing both normal and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells. Moreover, the kinetics of gene transfer are markedly increased using the VPC strategy, with approximately 70% of transduction complete within 2 h. In this study, using viruses that encode green fluorescence protein (GFP), or the T cell costimulatory molecule B7.1 (CD80), we show that VPC-mediated gene transfer is an effective means of transducing normal and AML cells, including those with a highly primitive phenotype. Our data suggest that transient genetic manipulation of primitive hematopoietic cells can readily be achieved and should therefore permit a variety of research and clinical endeavors.","['Howard, D S', 'Rizzierri, D A', 'Grimes, B', 'Upchurch, D', 'Phillips, G L', 'Stewart, A K', 'Yannelli, J R', 'Jordan, C T']","['Howard DS', 'Rizzierri DA', 'Grimes B', 'Upchurch D', 'Phillips GL', 'Stewart AK', 'Yannelli JR', 'Jordan CT']","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Markey Cancer Center, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, KY 40536-0093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",1999/10/12 00:00,1999/10/12 00:01,['1999/10/12 00:00'],"['1999/10/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Oct;13(10):1608-16. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401541.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401541 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This problem of intraspecies and interspecies cross-contamination among human cell lines has been recognized for over 25 years; incidences of cell cross-contamination between 17 and 35% have been reported. The most useful methods to detect human cell cross-contamination are DNA fingerprinting and cytogenetic analysis, each complementing the other. Using this combination, we found that in total 14.8% of the human hematopoietic cell lines received either from the original investigator (n = 117 cell lines) or from secondary sources (n = 72 cell lines) were cross-contaminated with another hematopoietic cell line and were thus false cell cultures. Another problem relates to the fact that not every cell line established from a patient with a hematopoietic malignancy is a malignant cell line; unintended immortalization of non-malignant B cells by 'passenger' Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) leads to the establishment of B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (termed EBV+ B-LCLs), an event which is much more frequent than the establishment of a 'true' leukemia-lymphoma-myeloma cell line. These EBV+B-LCLs are most often (albeit not always) unrelated to the malignant clone. The misinterpretation of such EBV+ B-LCLs as true malignant hematopoietic cell lines (particularly in research areas investigating B cell-derived neoplasms such as myeloma) and the indiscriminate use of these cell lines may render some of the results of such studies irrelevant to the pathobiology of the disease concerned. However, a combination of markers commonly allows for an accurate determination of the nature of EBV+ B-LCLs: immunoprofile, cellular morphology, EBV status, and karyotype. In summary, the continuous need for vigilant quality and identity control procedures is emphasized by the high incidences of cross-contaminated cell lines. Most laboratories using cells cultured in vitro maintain multiple cell lines. Such cell lines should be monitored regularly for their identity and specific characteristics in order to prevent invalidation of research work due to incidents of cell line cross-contamination or misinterpretation.","['Drexler, H G', 'Dirks, W G', 'MacLeod, R A']","['Drexler HG', 'Dirks WG', 'MacLeod RA']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Mascheroder Weg 1 B, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Cell Culture Techniques/*standards', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Lineage', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping']",1999/10/12 00:00,1999/10/12 00:01,['1999/10/12 00:00'],"['1999/10/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Oct;13(10):1601-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401510.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401510 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P388 was found to be diploid and genomically stable. P388D1 was triploid, highly unstable and characterized by numerous marker chromosomes (Chrs) and composite rearrangements. The karyotype of P388D1 was so complex that its clonal relatedness to P388 would have remained questionable without confirmation by molecular analysis of the clonotypic immunoglobulin heavy-chain and light-chain gene recombinations that coexisted in both tumors. The intrinsic instability of the P388D1 genome was indicated by the observation that only four out of 42 aberrations uncovered by SKY (in a total of 27 metaphases) occurred consistently (100% incidence), whereas 27 changes occurred non-randomly (27 to 96% incidence) and 11 alterations randomly (4 to 11% incidence). Persistent cytogenetic instability was also observed in P388 'macrophages' after phorbol ester- and ionomycin-induced conversion in vitro of P388 lymphoma cells. The 'cytogenetic noise' in these cells was manifested by a multiplicity of sporadic chromosomal aberrations; ie 25 distinct changes were identified by SKY in 40 metaphases. The results in P388D1 and P388 'macrophages' were interpreted to indicate that the myeloid differentiation program in the bipotential pre-B cell lymphoma P388 is invariably characterized by karyotypic instability.

This resistance to apoptosis is associated with a Bcr/Abl-mediated G2/M delay. Therefore, inhibiting Bcr/Abl signaling pathways should block the ability of the Bcr/Abl kinase to protect cells from apoptosis. The monoterpenes, limonene and perillyl alcohol (POH) are new anticancer agents that selectively induce apoptosis in neoplastic cells of a variety of rodent carcinoma models. Since the potential antitumor activities of monoterpenes overlap with signaling pathways affected by the Bcr/Abl kinase, POH and limonene were tested for antileukemia activity. POH, but not limonene selectively induced G0/G1 arrest followed by apoptosis in Bcr/Abl-transformed, but not nontransformed FDC.P1 and 32D myeloid cell lines. In contrast to their greater sensitivity to POH, Bcr/Abl-transformed cells were more resistant than nontransformed cells to several chemotherapy agents and ionizing irradiation. Since in Bcr/Abl-transformed cells, POH induces apoptosis associated with G0/G1 arrest, POH must activate an apoptotic pathway that is not protected by the Bcr/Abl-induced G2/M delay.

In contrast to Bcl-2 that inversely correlated with %S-phase cells and WBC, and was lower in T than in B-lineage ALL, the Bcl-2 family members were not found to be associated with features at presentation. These expression levels were also compared with drug resistance in in vitro MTT (methyl-thiazol-tetrazolium) assays for prednisolone, vincristine and asparaginase in 46 children. Protein expression levels of the Bcl-2 family were not found to correlate with in vitroresistance to the individual drugs or the combined drug resistance profile. In addition, neither peripheral blast reduction after 1 week of prednisone monotherapy nor long-term disease-free interval or survival showed a correlation with protein expression.

Overexpression of Bcl-xL blocked various aspects of paclitaxel-mediated apoptosis, including caspase-3 activation, degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psim), and release of cytochrome c. However, subsequent (but not prior) exposure of paclitaxel-treated U937/Bcl-xL cells (500 nM; 6 h) to bryostatin 1 (10 nM; 15 h) restored the extent of apoptosis, caspase activation, and mitochondrial damage to levels approximating those in paclitaxel-treated empty-vector control cells (U937/Neo). Potentiation of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis by bryostatin 1 in U937/Bcl-xL cells occurred primarily in the G2M cell population, and was associated with alterations in Bcl-xL gel mobility and a reduction in paclitaxel-mediated stimulation of CDK1 activity. Enhancement of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis by bryostatin 1 in Bcl-xL overexpressors was accompanied by a corresponding reduction in clonogenic potential. In contrast to its effects on apoptosis, bryostatin 1 failed to restore paclitaxel-mediated increases in free Bax levels in U937/Bcl-xL cells. Lastly, the actions of bryostatin 1 were mimicked by a pharmacologic inhibitor of the MEK1/MAP kinase pathway (PD98059), but not by SB203580, an inhibitor of p 38 MAP kinase. Moreover, sequential exposure of both U937/Neo or/Bcl-xL cells to paclitaxel followed by bryostatin 1 or PD98059 was associated with a net reduction in MAP kinase activity. Collectively, these findings indicate that protection against paclitaxel-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in human U937 leukemia cells conferred by Bcl-xL overexpression can be substantially overcome by bryostatin 1 and possibly other agents that interrupt the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway.","['Wang, S', 'Wang, Z', 'Boise, L H', 'Dent, P', 'Grant, S']","['Wang S', 'Wang Z', 'Boise LH', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Bryostatins', 'Choristoma/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Macrolides', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'U937 Cells']",1999/10/12 00:00,1999/10/12 00:01,['1999/10/12 00:00'],"['1999/10/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Oct;13(10):1564-73. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401532.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401532 [doi]'],"['0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']","['CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 77141/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We also studied the expression of apoptosis-related genes, in total and separated mononuclear marrow cells and correlated the findings with clinical and laboratory characteristics.

Expression of Bcl-2 and its homologues, Bcl-xL, Bcl-xS, Bax, Bad, Bak and Bag-1, was detected in all NHL cases, with wide variations between histological subtypes and within each subtype. Statistically significant differences were: (1) a higher level of Bad expression in DLCL compared to FL and MCL; (2) a lower level of Bak expression in FL compared to DLCL, SLL and MCL; and (3) a higher Bag-1 expression level in FL compared to SLL. When compared to NHL cells, normal B cells showed a higher level of Bax expression, and a lower level of Bcl-xL expression. Thus, quantitative analysis shows ubiquitous expression of Bcl-2 family proteins in normal and neoplastic B cells; the variations in expression levels may contribute to both the B-NHL clinicopathological diversity and the different apoptotic sensitivities of normal B cells vs B-NHL cells.","['Xerri, L', 'Devilard, E', 'Bouabdallah, R', 'Hassoun, J', 'Chaperot, L', 'Birg, F', 'Plumas, J']","['Xerri L', 'Devilard E', 'Bouabdallah R', 'Hassoun J', 'Chaperot L', 'Birg F', 'Plumas J']","['Department of Hematopathology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Biopsy', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factors', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein']",1999/10/12 00:00,1999/10/12 00:01,['1999/10/12 00:00'],"['1999/10/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Oct;13(10):1548-53. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401533.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401533 [doi]'],"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2-associated athanogene 1 protein)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These leukemias are characteristically refractory to conventional chemotherapeutic treatments operating through the induction of apoptosis. However, the mechanisms leading to increased cell survival and resistance to cell death in these leukemias are largely unknown. Interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), a potent inhibitor of hematopoiesis, acts in part by upregulating CD95 and sensitizing cells to CD95-induced apoptosis. The t(4;11) lines SEM, RS4;11, and MV4;11 expressed low levels of CD95, but were completely resistant to CD95-mediated death. Addition of IFNgamma markedly upregulated CD95 expression in SEM (8-9-fold), RS4;11 (2-3-fold), and MV4;11 (2-3-fold) lines. However, after treatment with IFNgamma, only an 11% increase in sensitivity to CD95-mediated cell death was observed in SEM cells, whereas RS4;11 and MV4;11 cells remained resistant. Cycloheximide, but not actinomycin D or brefeldin A, increased CD95-specific cell death only in IFNgamma-treated RS4;11 cells by approximately 12%. Abundant levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, known to inhibit CD95-signaling in some cells, were present suggesting a possible role for both molecules in the resistance to CD95-mediated cell death. Resistance of the leukemic blasts to CD95-mediated cell death and the failure of IFNgamma to substantially sensitize the CD95-signaling pathway may contribute to the highly malignant phenotype of pro-B ALL with translocation t(4;11).","['Dorrie, J', 'Schuh, W', 'Keil, A', 'Bongards, E', 'Greil, J', 'Fey, G H', 'Zunino, S J']","['Dorrie J', 'Schuh W', 'Keil A', 'Bongards E', 'Greil J', 'Fey GH', 'Zunino SJ']","['Chair of Genetics, Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, Surface/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Cell Death/*drug effects/immunology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/biosynthesis/*drug effects/immunology']",1999/10/12 00:00,1999/10/12 00:01,['1999/10/12 00:00'],"['1999/10/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Oct;13(10):1539-47. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401479.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401479 [doi]'],"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas potential functions have been suggested for isolated domains of either MLL or ENL no experimental data exist for the biological properties of the complete chimeric MLL-ENL protein.

MLL-ENL strongly transactivated several unrelated promoters including the promoter of Hoxa7 a potential target gene for the unaltered MLL protein. This transactivation capability was cell type specific and it was critically dependent on the contributions of the methyltransferase-homology (MT) region of MLL in combination with the C-terminus of ENL.

In the fifth patient, hematological CR could not be achieved with two cycles of intensive induction chemotherapy, and MLL-AF9 transcripts were present in all samples tested. Our data indicate that MLL-AF9 RT-PCR is specific for the t(9;11) translocation. PCR negativity can be achieved in responding patients already 1 month after induction chemotherapy. The fast reduction of MLL-AF9 positive blast cells below the detection limit of RT-PCR seems to be a prerequisite for long-term CR. The results of RT-PCR may be useful for treatment decisions (eg BMT).","['Mitterbauer, G', 'Zimmer, C', 'Fonatsch, C', 'Haas, O', 'Thalhammer-Scherrer, R', 'Schwarzinger, I', 'Kalhs, P', 'Jaeger, U', 'Lechner, K', 'Mannhalter, C']","['Mitterbauer G', 'Zimmer C', 'Fonatsch C', 'Haas O', 'Thalhammer-Scherrer R', 'Schwarzinger I', 'Kalhs P', 'Jaeger U', 'Lechner K', 'Mannhalter C']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Molecular Biology, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/*methods', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1999/10/12 00:00,1999/10/12 00:01,['1999/10/12 00:00'],"['1999/10/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Oct;13(10):1519-24. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401542.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401542 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to characterize AML-M0 expression and regulation of adhesion/costimulatory molecule involved in immune recognition, to test blast in vitro immunogenicity, and to determine the percentage of leukemia progenitor cells. Here, we demonstrate that alloimmune recognition of AML-M0 in primary mixed lymphocyte reaction, as evaluated by IL-2 secretion of responding T cells, is reduced in comparison with more differentiated subtypes (128 +/- 95 pg/ml vs304 +/- 159 pg/ml, P < 0.05). These data are in line with low blast cell expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II DR molecules, and of the CD28 ligand B7-2, which plays an important role in AML immune recognition. Adhesion/costimulatory molecules were up-regulated by leukemic cell stimulation via CD40, and, although less efficiently, by gamma-IFN; both stimuli improved blast cell immunogenicity. We also demonstrate that AML-M0 have a very high percentage (40% +/- 30) of CD34+/CD38- leukemic clonogenic precursors in comparison with more differentiated AMLs (2.5% +/- 2) or non-leukemic CD34+hematopoietic precursors (1.8% +/- 0.8). Since the presence of a leukemic cell population at an early differentiation stage has been identified as a poor prognostic factor, we conclude that the high frequency of CD34+/CD38- blasts in AML-M0 may converge with already identified poor prognosis factors such as chemotherapy resistance and cytogenetic abnormalities. The clinical implications of AML-M0 impaired in vitroimmunogenicity and a high percentage of CD34+/CD38- blasts will require comparative analysis of additional patients. The increased immunogenicity of blast cells after CD40 triggering provide interesting clues for AML-M0 immunotherapy, that have to be confirmed with an in vivo leukemia model in mice.","['Costello, R', 'Mallet, F', 'Chambost, H', 'Sainty, D', 'Arnoulet, C', 'Gastaut, J A', 'Olive, D']","['Costello R', 'Mallet F', 'Chambost H', 'Sainty D', 'Arnoulet C', 'Gastaut JA', 'Olive D']","[""Immunologie des Tumeurs, Departement d'Hematologie, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Universite de Mediterranee, Marseille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD34/*blood', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'CD40 Antigens/blood', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/*blood', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology']",1999/10/12 00:00,1999/10/12 00:01,['1999/10/12 00:00'],"['1999/10/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Oct;13(10):1513-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401519.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401519 [doi]'],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (Cd38 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the help of immunophenotyping, this subtype of leukemia was shown to express myeloid antigens on the blasts and was designated AML-M0 by FAB Cooperative Study Group in 1991. Among the 423 consecutive newly diagnosed de novo AML at our institution, 12 (2.8%) were of M0 subtype. The proportion of M0 in AML was higher in children than in adults (8.2% vs 1.7%). Four other M0 patients referred from outside hospitals for immunophenotyping were also included in this study. There were two peaks in age distribution of these 16 patients: less than 3 years and between 51 and 70 years, respectively. Organomegaly was more common in patients with AML-M0 than in those with other subtypes (56.3% vs 29.2%, P = 0.025). The former patients had higher incidences of CD7 and CD34 expression on the leukemic cells than the latter ones (50% vs 16.9%, P = 0.003 and 69.2% vs 37.9%, P = 0.019, respectively). The patients with AML-M0 showed more frequent clonal chromosomal abnormalities in the leukemic cells than other AML patients (83.3% vs 53.9%, P = 0.039); the same is also true for complex cytogenetic aberrations (50% vs 11. 4%, P = 0.004). Adults with AML-M0 showed a lower complete remission (CR) rate and significantly poorer survival than those with non M0-AML. However there was no significant difference in outcome between the two groups of pediatric patients. In conclusion, AML-M0 is a unique subtype of leukemia that has distinct age distribution and shows different clinical and biological characteristics from other AML. Adult patients have poor prognosis. Whether pediatric patients had better outcome than adults needs to be clarified in further studies.","['Huang, S Y', 'Tang, J L', 'Jou, S T', 'Tsay, W', 'Hu, C H', 'Lin, D T', 'Lin, K S', 'Lin, K S', 'Wang, C H', 'Chen, Y C', 'Shen, M C', 'Tien, H F']","['Huang SY', 'Tang JL', 'Jou ST', 'Tsay W', 'Hu CH', 'Lin DT', 'Lin KS', 'Lin KS', 'Wang CH', 'Chen YC', 'Shen MC', 'Tien HF']","['Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Taiwan', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/10/12 00:00,1999/10/12 00:01,['1999/10/12 00:00'],"['1999/10/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Oct;13(10):1506-12. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401521.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401521 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the clinical significance of CD79b expression in CLL patients and its possible value for the evaluation of minimal residual disease (MRD) was explored. A total of 15 peripheral blood (PB) samples from healthy blood donors, five bone marrow (BM) samples from normal donors and 40 PB samples from CLL untreated patients were included in the study. In addition we studied the expression of CD79b in B lymphocytes from five CLL patients after fludarabine treatment in order to support our method. The expression of CD79b in B lymphocytes from PB was analyzed by flow cytometry, using simultaneous staining with the Mabs CD22, CD79b, CD19 and CD5, CD79b and CD19. Since normal immature bone marrow B cells are CD79b-/dim+ on their surface, in BM samples we used the combination CD45, CD79b and CD19 selecting mature B lymphocytes according to their bright CD45 intensity. Cell acquisition was performed in two consecutive steps using a live gate drawn on SSC/CD19+ cells. For data analysis, the PAINT-A-GATE PRO software (Becton Dickinson) was used. Dilution experiments of CD79b- CLL cells and CD79bdim+ CLL cells with normal PB and BM cells were performed in order to assess the sensitivity level of the technique for detection of CD79b-/dim+residual CLL cells. All B lymphocytes from normal samples showed reactivity for the CD79b antigen. In contrast, CD79b was absent in 18/40 CLL patients (42.5%) and 20/40 CLL cases (50%) exhibited a low CD79b expression. Therefore, CD79b- B lymphocytes would be restricted to the CLL population and thus could be considered a 'tumor phenotype' for monitoring MRD in CLL patients. Dilution experiments indicate that the detection limit with this marker almost reaches the levels obtained by molecular biology methods as the PCR technique. All cases studied after fludarabine presented leukemic cells in their PB or BM samples detected by flow cytometry. Upon comparing the clinical and morphological characteristics of CD79b- and CD79b+ cases, all atypical CLL cases included in the present study were CD79b+ and advanced clinical stage (B and C Binet stage) was most frequently observed in CD79b+ cases than in CD79b- cases.","['Garcia Vela, J', 'Delgado, I', 'Benito, L', 'Monteserin, M', 'Garcia Alonso, L', 'Somolinos, N', 'Andreu, M', 'Ona, F']","['Garcia Vela J', 'Delgado I', 'Benito L', 'Monteserin M', 'Garcia Alonso L', 'Somolinos N', 'Andreu M', 'Ona F']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Getafe, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*blood', 'CD79 Antigens', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*immunology']",1999/10/12 00:00,1999/10/12 00:01,['1999/10/12 00:00'],"['1999/10/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Oct;13(10):1501-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401511.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401511 [doi]'],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79B protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine this proposition we typed five markers on chromosome 11q in 24 CLL families. No evidence for linkage between CLL and ATM in the 24 families studied and the best estimates of the proportion of sibling pairs that share no, one or both haplotypes at ATM were not different from their null expectations.

To date, the most efficient mode of gene delivery is via Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV)-based retroviral vectors which stably integrate into the genome of the target cell. The quiescent nature of HSC and the fact that MoMuLV-based retroviral vectors can only integrate into dividing cells are major obstacles in gene therapy.

Development of TMA was accompanied by reactivation of HHV-6, which was identified by both an increase in the copy number of HHV-6 DNA in the peripheral blood and a significant increase in antibody titers to HHV-6. Thus, it was suggested that reactivation of HHV-6 together with high-dose chemotherapy played an important role in the pathogenesis of TMA in these patients. Since HHV-6 is known to infect vascular endothelial cells, and CMV which is virologically closely related to HHV-6, has been reported to be a pathogen that causes TMA, infection with HHV-6 of vascular endothelial cells may induce TMA via damage and activation of these cells.","['Matsuda, Y', 'Hara, J', 'Miyoshi, H', 'Osugi, Y', 'Fujisaki, H', 'Takai, K', 'Ohta, H', 'Tanaka-Taya, K', 'Yamanishi, K', 'Okada, S']","['Matsuda Y', 'Hara J', 'Miyoshi H', 'Osugi Y', 'Fujisaki H', 'Takai K', 'Ohta H', 'Tanaka-Taya K', 'Yamanishi K', 'Okada S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Osaka University, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome/etiology/*virology', 'Hepatoblastoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*etiology', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/pathology/*therapy', 'Liver Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Thrombosis/etiology/*virology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1999/10/12 00:00,1999/10/12 00:01,['1999/10/12 00:00'],"['1999/10/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1999 Oct;24(8):919-23. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702003.,,,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702003 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, we investigate interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 in vitro effects on apoptosis of B cells from 32 previously untreated patients with B-CLL in initial clinical stages. B cells were isolated from peripheral blood, and apoptosis was measured in these cells immediately after isolation and following incubation in vitro, without and with the different cytokines, for 24 and 48 h. Distribution of cellular DNA content and quantitative analysis of apoptosis were determined by standard propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Spontaneous apoptosis occurred in B-CLL cells incubated in vitro in the absence of cytokines. Our results indicate that both IL-2 and IL-4, but not IL-6, inhibit in vitro apoptosis in a large percentage of B-CLL patients. IL-10 increases in vitro apoptotic cell number in stage 0 patients, but not in stage I and II. These data support the hypothesis that IL-2 or IL-4, may be cell survival factors in vivo and that IL-10 might be a candidate for immune therapy of early B-CLL.","['Castejon, R', 'Vargas, J A', 'Romero, Y', 'Briz, M', 'Munoz, R M', 'Durantez, A']","['Castejon R', 'Vargas JA', 'Romero Y', 'Briz M', 'Munoz RM', 'Durantez A']","['Service of Internal Medicine I, Clinica Puerta de Hierro, Universidad Autonoma, Madrid, Spain. castejon@medint1.cph.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/12 00:00,1999/10/12 00:01,['1999/10/12 00:00'],"['1999/10/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1999 Oct 15;38(5):224-30. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19991015)38:5<224::aid-cyto4>3.3.co;2-s.,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19991015)38:5<224::AID-CYTO4>3.0.CO;2-0 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19991015)38:5<224::aid-cyto4>3.3.co;2-s [doi]']","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukins)']",,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Sequence analysis of a approximately 330-bp fragment of 44 chimeric proviruses, encompassing the U5, the primer binding site, and the upstream part of the 5' untranslated region, enabled us to map recombination sites, guided by distinct scattered nucleotide differences. In 30 of 44 analyzed sequences, recombination was mapped to a 33-nucleotide similarity window coinciding with the kissing-loop stem-loop motif implicated in dimerization of the diploid genome. Interestingly, the recombination pattern preference found in replication-competent viruses from T-cell tumors is very similar to the pattern previously reported for retroviral vectors in cell culture experiments.

This phenotype maps to amino acid 102 in the envelope (Env) protein of TR1.3. Substitution of glycine (G) for tryptophan (W) at this position (W102G Env) in the nonpathogenic MLV FB29 induces both syncytium formation and neurologic disease in vivo. Using an in vitro gene reporter cell fusion assay, we showed that fusion either with murine NIH 3T3 cells or with nonmurine target cells that expressed receptors at or below endogenous murine levels mirrored that seen in BCEC in vivo. In these instances only TR1.3 and W102G Env induced cell fusion. In contrast, when receptor levels on nonmurine cells were raised above endogenous murine levels, FB29 Env was as fusogenic as the neuropathogenic TR1.3 and W102G Env. These results indicate that TR1.3 Env and W102G Env are intrinsically more fusogenic than FB29 Env, that the induction of fusion requires a threshold number of receptors that is greater for FB29 Env than for TR1.3 or W102G Env, and that receptor density on murine NIH 3T3 cells and BCEC is below the threshold for FB29-dependent fusion. Surprisingly, receptor density on NIH 3T3 cells could not be increased by stable expression of exogenous receptors, and FB29-dependent fusion was not observed in NIH 3T3 cells that transiently expressed elevated receptor numbers.

However, recent reports have indicated that some variations in env sequences may induce incomplete cross-reactivity between HTLV-1 strains. To identify the amino acid changes that might be involved in the antigenicity of neutralizable epitopes, we constructed expression vectors coding for the envelope glycoproteins of two HTLV-1 isolates (2060 and 2072) which induced human antibodies with different neutralization patterns. The amino acid sequences of the envelope glycoproteins differed at four positions. Vectors coding for chimeric or point-mutated envelope proteins were derived from 2060 and 2072 HTLV-1 env genes. Syncytium formation induced by the wild-type or mutated envelope proteins was inhibited by human sera with different neutralizing specificities.

Recent evidence has demonstrated that these viruses use a common cell surface receptor (the X-receptor) for infection of human cells. We describe the properties of X-receptor cDNAs with distinct sequences cloned from five laboratory and wild strains of mice and from hamsters and minks. Expression of these cDNAs in resistant cells conferred susceptibilities to the same viruses that naturally infect the animals from which the cDNAs were derived. Thus, a laboratory mouse (NIH Swiss) X-receptor conferred susceptibility to P-MLVs but not to X-MLVs, whereas those from humans, minks, and several wild mice (Mus dunni, SC-1 cells, and Mus spretus) mediated infections by both X-MLVs and P-MLVs. In contrast, X-receptors from the resistant mouse strain Mus castaneus and from hamsters were inactive as viral receptors. These results suggest that X-receptor polymorphisms are a primary cause of resistances of mice to members of the X-MLV/P-MLV family of retroviruses and are responsible for the xenotropism of X-MLVs in laboratory mice. By site-directed mutagenesis, we substituted sequences between the X-receptors of M. dunni and NIH Swiss mice. The NIH Swiss protein contains two key differences (K500E in presumptive extracellular loop 3 [ECL 3] and a T582 deletion in ECL 4) that are both required to block X-MLV infections. Accordingly, a single inverse mutation in the NIH Swiss protein conferred X-MLV susceptibility. Furthermore, expression of an X-MLV envelope glycoprotein in Chinese hamster ovary cells interfered efficiently with X-MLV and P-MLV infections mediated by X-receptors that contained K500 and/or T582 but had no effect on P-MLV infections mediated by X-receptors that lacked these amino acids. In contrast, moderate expression of a P-MLV (MCF247) envelope glycoprotein did not cause substantial interference, suggesting that X-MLV and P-MLV glycoproteins interfere nonreciprocally with X-receptor-mediated infections. We conclude that P-MLVs have become adapted to utilize X-receptors that lack K500 and T582. A penalty for this adaptation is a reduced ability to interfere with superinfection. Because failure of interference is a hallmark of several exceptionally pathogenic retroviruses, we propose that it contributes to P-MLV-induced diseases.","['Marin, M', 'Tailor, C S', 'Nouri, A', 'Kozak, S L', 'Kabat, D']","['Marin M', 'Tailor CS', 'Nouri A', 'Kozak SL', 'Kabat D']","['Department of Biochemistry, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, Oregon 97201-3098, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/metabolism/*virology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muridae', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Receptors, Virus/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/metabolism/*virology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor']",1999/10/09 00:00,1999/10/09 00:01,['1999/10/09 00:00'],"['1999/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Nov;73(11):9362-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.11.9362-9368.1999.,,,['10.1128/JVI.73.11.9362-9368.1999 [doi]'],"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor)']","['CA25810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA54149/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC112970,,,"['GENBANK/AF131096', 'GENBANK/AF131097', 'GENBANK/AF131098', 'GENBANK/AF131099', 'GENBANK/AF131100', 'GENBANK/AF131101', 'GENBANK/AF131102']",,,,,,,

This difference in disease progression occurs despite the fact that E-55+ MuLV causes persistent infection in both immunocompetent BALB/c-H-2(k) (BALB.K) progressor (P) and C57BL/10-H-2(k) (B10.BR) long-term nonprogressor (LTNP) mice. In contrast to immunocompetent mice, immunosuppressed mice from both P and LTNP strains develop lymphomas about 2 months after infection, indicating that the LTNP phenotype is determined by the immune response of the infected mouse. In this study, we used bone marrow chimeras to demonstrate that the LTNP phenotype is associated with the genotype of donor bone marrow and not the recipient microenvironment. In addition, we have mapped a genetic locus that may be responsible for the LTNP trait. Microsatellite-based linkage analysis demonstrated that a non-major histocompatibility complex gene on chromosome 15 regulates long-term survival and is located in the same region as the Rfv3 gene. Rfv3 is involved in recovery from Friend virus-induced leukemia and has been demonstrated to regulate neutralizing virus antibody titers. In our studies, however, both P and LTNP strains produce similar titers of neutralizing and cytotoxic anti-E-55+ MuLV. Therefore, while it is possible that Rfv3 influences the course of E-55+ MuLV infection, it is more likely that the LTNP phenotype in E-55+ MuLV-infected mice is regulated by a different, closely linked gene.","['Panoutsakopoulou, V', 'Hunter, K', 'Sieck, T G', 'Blankenhorn, E P', 'Blank, K J']","['Panoutsakopoulou V', 'Hunter K', 'Sieck TG', 'Blankenhorn EP', 'Blank KJ']","['Department of Pathology, MCP Hahnemann School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Inbreeding', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/immunology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phenotype', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics/immunology/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/immunology/virology']",1999/10/09 00:00,1999/10/09 00:01,['1999/10/09 00:00'],"['1999/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Nov;73(11):9232-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.11.9232-9236.1999.,,,['10.1128/JVI.73.11.9232-9236.1999 [doi]'],,['CA65389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC112957,,,,,,,,,,

We recently demonstrated that MLV proteins cannot support the replication of an SNV-based vector; RNA analysis revealed that MLV proteins cannot efficiently package SNV-based vector RNA. The domain in Gag responsible for the specificity of RNA packaging was identified using chimeric gag-pol expression constructs. A competitive packaging system was established by generating a cell line that expresses one viral vector RNA containing the MLV packaging signal (Psi) and another viral vector RNA containing the SNV packaging signal (E). The chimeric gag-pol expression constructs were introduced into the cells, and vector titers as well as the efficiency of RNA packaging were examined. Our data confirm that Gag is solely responsible for the selection of viral RNAs. Furthermore, the nucleocapsid (NC) domain in the SNV Gag is responsible for its ability to interact with both SNV E and MLV Psi. Replacement of the SNV NC with the MLV NC generated a chimeric Gag that could not package SNV RNA but retained its ability to package MLV RNA. A construct expressing SNV gag-MLV pol supported the replication of both MLV and SNV vectors, indicating that the gag and pol gene products from two different viruses can functionally cooperate to perform one cycle of retroviral replication. Viral titer data indicated that SNV cis-acting elements are not ideal substrates for MLV pol gene products since infectious viruses were generated at a lower efficiency. These results indicate that the nonreciprocal recognition between SNV and MLV extends beyond the Gag-RNA interaction and also includes interactions between Pol and other cis-acting elements.","['Certo, J L', 'Kabdulov, T O', 'Paulson, M L', 'Anderson, J A', 'Hu, W S']","['Certo JL', 'Kabdulov TO', 'Paulson ML', 'Anderson JA', 'Hu WS']","['Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center, West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia 26506, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Dogs', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-pol/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleocapsid/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reticuloendotheliosis virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transfection', '*Virus Assembly']",1999/10/09 00:00,1999/10/09 00:01,['1999/10/09 00:00'],"['1999/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Nov;73(11):9170-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.11.9170-9177.1999.,,,['10.1128/JVI.73.11.9170-9177.1999 [doi]'],"['0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-pol)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,PMC112950,,,,,,,,,,

We decided to examine the M-MuLV response in congenic C57BL/6 Vbeta(a) mice which are unable to express the dominant Valpha3.2(+) Vbeta5.2(+) T-cell receptor (TCR) due to a large deletion at the TCR locus that includes the Vbeta5.2 gene segment. Interestingly, M-MuLV-immune C57BL/6 Vbeta(a) mice were still able to reject M-MuLV-infected tumor cells and direct ex vivo analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes from these immune mice revealed a dramatic increase in CD8(+) cells utilizing the same Valpha3.2 gene segment in association with two different Vbeta segments (Vbeta3 and Vbeta17). Surprisingly, all these CTL recognized the same immunodominant M-MuLV gag epitope. Analysis of the TCR repertoire of individual M-MuLV-immune (C57BL/6 x C57BL/6 Vbeta(a))F(1) mice revealed a clear hierarchy in Vbeta utilization, with a preferential usage of the Vbeta17 gene segment, whereas Vbeta3 and especially Vbeta5.2 were used to much lesser extents. Sequencing of TCRalpha- and -beta-chain junctional regions of CTL clones specific for the M-MuLV gag epitope revealed a diverse repertoire of TCRbeta chains in Vbeta(a) mice and a highly restricted TCRbeta-chain repertoire in Vbeta(b) mice, whereas TCRalpha-chain sequences were highly conserved in both cases. Collectively, our data indicate that the H-2D(b)-restricted M-MuLV gag epitope can be recognized in a hierarchal fashion by different Vbeta domains and that the degree of beta-chain diversity varies according to Vbeta utilization.","['Brawand, P', 'Cerottini, J C', 'MacDonald, H R']","['Brawand P', 'Cerottini JC', 'MacDonald HR']","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Lausanne Branch, 1066 Epalinges, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cytophotometry', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Products, gag/*immunology', '*Genes, T-Cell Receptor beta', 'Immunization', 'Immunodominant Epitopes/*immunology', 'L-Selectin/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/09 00:00,1999/10/09 00:01,['1999/10/09 00:00'],"['1999/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Nov;73(11):9161-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.11.9161-9169.1999.,,,['10.1128/JVI.73.11.9161-9169.1999 [doi]'],"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Immunodominant Epitopes)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)']",,,PMC112949,,,,,,,,,,

It remains to be elucidated how the R peptide impairs fusion activity of the uncleaved Pr15E. The R peptide from MoMLV was analyzed by Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunostained with antiserum against the synthetic 16-aa R peptide. The R peptide resolved with an apparent molecular mass of 7 kDa and not the 4 kDa seen with the corresponding synthetic peptide. The 7-kDa R peptide was found to be membrane bound in MoMLV-infected NIH 3T3 cells, showing that cleavage of the 7-kDa R-peptide tail must occur before or during budding of progeny virions, in which only small amounts of the 7-kDa R peptide were found. The 7-kDa R peptide was palmitoylated since it could be labeled with [(3)H]palmitic acid, which explains its membrane association, slower migration on gels, and high sensitivity in immunoblotting. The present results are in contrast to previous findings showing equimolar amounts of R peptide and p15E in virions. The discrepancy, however, can be explained by the presence of nonpalmitoylated R peptide in virions, which were poorly detected by immunoblotting. A mechanistic model is proposed. The uncleaved R peptide can, due to its lipid modification, control the conformation of the ectodomain of the transmembrane protein and thereby govern membrane fusion.","['Olsen, K E', 'Andersen, K B']","['Olsen KE', 'Andersen KB']","['Department of Pharmacology, The Royal Danish School of Pharmacy, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel/methods', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*metabolism', 'Palmitic Acid/*metabolism', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism']",1999/10/09 00:00,1999/10/09 00:01,['1999/10/09 00:00'],"['1999/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Nov;73(11):8975-81. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.11.8975-8981.1999.,,,['10.1128/JVI.73.11.8975-8981.1999 [doi]'],"['0 (Peptides)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '0 (murine leukemia virus protein p2E)', '0 (p15E protein, Murine leukemia virus)', '2V16EO95H1 (Palmitic Acid)']",,,PMC112929,,,,,,,,,,

Only one of these species is able to start and complete reverse transcription in the cell cytoplasm. This RTC is composed of at least the viral genome, capsid, integrase, and reverse transcriptase proteins. The RTC becomes permeable to micrococcal nuclease but not to antibodies. Shortly after initiation of reverse transcription, the viral strong stop DNA within the RTC is protected from nuclease digestion. The sedimentation velocity of the RTC decreases during reverse transcription. After entry into the nucleus, most capsid proteins are lost from the RTC and its sedimentation velocity decreases further.","['Fassati, A', 'Goff, S P']","['Fassati A', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Biochemistry, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Capsid/analysis', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Chemical Fractionation', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Detergents', 'Genome, Viral', 'Integrases/analysis', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/analysis/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Virion', '*Virus Integration']",1999/10/09 00:00,1999/10/09 00:01,['1999/10/09 00:00'],"['1999/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Nov;73(11):8919-25. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.11.8919-8925.1999.,,,['10.1128/JVI.73.11.8919-8925.1999 [doi]'],"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Detergents)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,PMC112922,,,,,,,,,,

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed that human T-cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I)-infected T-cell lines (MT-1, SLB-1, and C5/MJ) expressed mRNA for the hiNOS, but TL-Om1 or uninfected Jurkat, H9, and CCRF-CEM did not. The MT-1, SLB-1, and C5/MJ cell lines are infected with HTLV-I and express the viral transactivator Tax, whereas TL-Om1 cells, although derived from adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) leukemic cells, do not express Tax. There was, thus, a correlation between Tax and hiNOS mRNA expression. The transcriptional regulatory region of the hiNOS gene was activated by Tax in Jurkat, in which endogenous hiNOS is induced by Tax. Deletion analysis showed that the region of hiNOS encompassing nucleotides -159 to -111 contained the minimum Tax-responsive elements. Mutations in the NF-kappaB element at position -115 and -106 bp in the hiNOS promoter were still activated by Tax, and a Tax mutant defective for activation of the NF-kappaB pathway retained the ability to activate the hiNOS promoter. In addition, overexpression of the dominant-negative mutants of IkappaBalpha and I kappaBbeta failed to reduce Tax-induced activation of hiNOS gene. Furthermore, hiNOS mRNA was detected in leukemic cells from ATL patients. Our results show that the hiNOS promoter contains a minimum Tax-responsive element located between nucleotides -159 and -111, and imply that the expression of the hiNOS gene is involved in the pathogenesis of HTLV-I-associated diseases.","['Mori, N', 'Nunokawa, Y', 'Yamada, Y', 'Ikeda, S', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Yamamoto, N']","['Mori N', 'Nunokawa Y', 'Yamada Y', 'Ikeda S', 'Tomonaga M', 'Yamamoto N']","['Department of Preventive Medicine and AIDS Research, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan. n-mori@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Induction', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/enzymology/genetics/*pathology/virology', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nitric Oxide/biosynthesis', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/*enzymology/pathology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/09 00:00,1999/10/09 00:01,['1999/10/09 00:00'],"['1999/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Oct 15;94(8):2862-70.,,,['S0006-4971(20)71097-9 [pii]'],"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (I kappa B beta protein)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these compounds, As(2)O(3), induces apoptosis in APL cells via a mechanism independent of the retinoic acid pathway. To test the hypothesis that arsenic compounds may be effective against other forms of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), we studied the membrane-permeable arsenic compound phenylarsine oxide (PAO). Because interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) plays a key role in AML cell proliferation, we first tested the effect of PAO on OCIM2 and OCI/AML3 AML cell lines, both of which produce IL-1beta and proliferate in response to it. We found that PAO inhibited the proliferation of both OCIM2 and OCI/AML3 cells in a dose-dependent fashion (0.01 to 0.1 micromol/L) and that IL-1beta partially reversed this inhibitory effect. We then measured IL-1beta levels in these cells by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western immunoblotting and found that PAO almost completely abolished the production of IL-1beta in these AML cells, whereas it did not affect the production of IL-1 receptor antagonist. Because PAO inhibits activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB and because NF-kappaB modulates an array of signals controlling cellular survival, proliferation, and cytokine production, we also studied the effect of PAO on NF-kappaB activation in AML cells and found that PAO suppressed the IL-1beta-induced activation of NF-kappaB. Because inhibition of NF-kappaB may result in cellular apoptosis, we also tested whether PAO may induce apoptotic cell death in AML cells. We found that PAO induced apoptosis in OCIM2 cells through activation of the cystein protease caspase 3 and subsequent cleavage of its substrate, the DNA repair enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. The PAO-induced apoptosis was caspase dependent, because it was completely blocked by the caspase inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK. Finally, we tested the effect of PAO on fresh AML marrow cells from 7 patients with newly diagnosed AML and found that PAO suppressed AML colony-forming cell proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion. Taken together, our data showing that PAO is an effective in vitro inhibitor of AML cells suggest that this compound may have a role in future therapies for AML.","['Estrov, Z', 'Manna, S K', 'Harris, D', 'Van, Q', 'Estey, E H', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Talpaz, M', 'Aggarwal, B B']","['Estrov Z', 'Manna SK', 'Harris D', 'Van Q', 'Estey EH', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Talpaz M', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, The University of Texas M.

We have analyzed the effect in vitro of the combination of fludarabine with cyclophosphamide and/or mitoxantrone on cells from 20 B-CLL patients. Mafosfamide, the active form of cyclophosphamide in vitro, increased the cytotoxicity of fludarabine in all of the patients studied and produced a significant synergistic effect (P <.01) after 48 hours of incubation. The addition of mitoxantrone to this combination increased the cytotoxic effect in cells from 8 patients, but in the remaining 12 patients no significant increase was observed. The effect of fludarabine and mafosfamide was dose-dependent. Mafosfamide and fludarabine had a synergistic effect in inducing apoptosis of B-CLL cells as determined by DNA staining with propidium iodide and analysis of phosphatidylserine exposure. Mafosfamide significantly increased the apoptosis induced by fludarabine on CD19(+) cells (P =.007), but not on CD3(+) cells (P =. 314). Cell viability was correlated with a decrease in Mcl-1 levels and an increase in p53 levels.

Here, we demonstrate by retroviral gene transfer that nef expression, in the absence of other HIV genes, impaired human thymic T-cell development. Thymocytes were generated in reduced numbers and downmodulated CD4 and CD8beta cell surface expression. T cells grown from nef-expressing thymocytes were hyperproliferative in vitro upon T-cell receptor triggering.

We have isolated and characterized jak cDNAs from the zebrafish Danio rerio. The zebrafish genome possesses 2 jak2 genes that occupy paralogous chromosome segments in the zebrafish genome, and these segments conserve syntenic relationships with orthologous genes in mammalian genomes, suggesting an ancient duplication in the zebrafish lineage. The jak2a gene is expressed at high levels in erythroid precursors of primitive and definitive waves and at a lower level in early central nervous system and developing fin buds. jak2b is expressed in the developing lens and nephritic ducts, but not in hematopoietic tissue. The expression of jak2a was examined in hematopoietic mutants and found to be disrupted in cloche and spadetail, suggesting an early role in hematopoiesis. Taken together with recent gene knockout data in the mouse, we suggest that jak2a may be functionally equivalent to mammalian Jak2, with a role in early erythropoiesis.","['Oates, A C', 'Brownlie, A', 'Pratt, S J', 'Irvine, D V', 'Liao, E C', 'Paw, B H', 'Dorian, K J', 'Johnson, S L', 'Postlethwait, J H', 'Zon, L I', 'Wilks, A F']","['Oates AC', 'Brownlie A', 'Pratt SJ', 'Irvine DV', 'Liao EC', 'Paw BH', 'Dorian KJ', 'Johnson SL', 'Postlethwait JH', 'Zon LI', 'Wilks AF']","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Melbourne Tumour Biology Branch, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia. aoates@molbio.princeton.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Drosophila melanogaster/enzymology/genetics', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/enzymology', '*Erythropoiesis/genetics', 'Evolution, Molecular', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Genes', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Mammals/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Species Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Zebrafish/embryology/*genetics']",1999/10/09 00:00,1999/10/09 00:01,['1999/10/09 00:00'],"['1999/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Oct 15;94(8):2622-36.,,,['S0006-4971(20)71112-2 [pii]'],"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']","['P01HD22486/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01RR10715/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,"['GENBANK/AJ005689', 'GENBANK/AJ005690', 'GENBANK/AJ005691']",,,,,,,

Furthermore, recent data have shown that numerical chromosomal changes are present in most individuals with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Epidemiological studies have shown that up to one third of MM may emerge from pre-existing MGUS. To clarify further possible stepwise chromosomal aberrations on a pathway between MGUS and MM, we have analyzed 158 patients with either MM or primary PCL and 19 individuals with MGUS using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Our FISH analyses were designed to detect illegitimate IGH rearrangements at 14q32 or monosomy 13. Whereas translocations involving the 14q32 region were observed with a similar incidence (60%) in both conditions, a significant difference was found in the incidence of monosomy 13 in MGUS versus MM or primary PCL. It was present in 40% of MM/PCL patients, but in only 4 of 19 MGUS individuals. Moreover, whereas monosomy 13 was found in the majority of plasma cells in MM, it was observed only in cell subpopulations in MGUS. It is noteworthy that, in a group of 20 patients with MM and a previous MGUS history, incidence of monosomy 13 was 70% versus 31% in MM patients without a known history of MGUS (P =.002). Thus, this study highlights monosomy 13 as correlated with the transformation of MGUS to overt MM and may define 2 groups of MM with possible different natural history and outcome, ie, post-MGUS MM with a very high incidence of monosomy 13 and de novo MM in which other genetic events might be involved. Serial analyses of individuals with MGUS will be needed to validate this model.","['Avet-Loiseau, H', 'Li, J Y', 'Morineau, N', 'Facon, T', 'Brigaudeau, C', 'Harousseau, J L', 'Grosbois, B', 'Bataille, R']","['Avet-Loiseau H', 'Li JY', 'Morineau N', 'Facon T', 'Brigaudeau C', 'Harousseau JL', 'Grosbois B', 'Bataille R']","['Laboratory of Hematology, the Clinical Hematology Department, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Nantes, France. havetloiseau@chu-nantes.fr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monosomy', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/pathology', 'Paraproteinemias/*genetics/pathology', 'Precancerous Conditions/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1999/10/09 00:00,1999/10/09 00:01,['1999/10/09 00:00'],"['1999/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Oct 15;94(8):2583-9.,,,['S0006-4971(20)71078-5 [pii]'],['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present a patient with poor-risk AML who relapsed from first complete remission (CR) and was unwilling to undergo high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue. In second chemotherapy-induced CR, the patient had no evidence of antileukaemia cytolytic activity in an in vitro assay, and she commenced IFN-alpha (Roferon). She subsequently developed high levels of leukaemia-specific cytotoxicity, and has remained in second CR for two years.

Using a sensitive and specific HPLC method we have determined the pH dependent activity of beta-GAL in cell lines of lung carcinoma (A549), colon carcinoma (Caco2-TC7), promyelocytic leukemia (HL60), hepatoma (HepG2) and human liver homogenates. The HPLC method has been validated and the influence of pH and substrate concentration was studied. There was a good linear correlation between HPLC and quantitative enzyme histochemistry (pH 4.5: r = 0.985; pH 6.0: r = 0.967). Both, pH 4.5 beta-GAL and pH 6 beta-GAL could be demonstrated in all biological material tested and pH 6 beta-GAL activity was always lower (25-50%) than pH 4.5 activity. In Caco2-TC7 cells both activities increased by a factor of 10 from day 3 to day 17 after seeding. In addition, since the beta-GAL activity decreased with increase in pH both in human liver homogenates (independent of the age of the donor) as well as in tumor cell lysates in a similar fashion we believe that the activity at pH 6 can hardly be considered as an exclusive 'senescence marker'.

RESULTS: No significant difference was found in genotype or allele frequencies between the groups. CONCLUSION: This promoter polymorphism is not a significant risk factor responsible for the LGL expansions seen in Felty's and LGL syndromes.

This study defines the potential for gene transfer of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) into bovine brain endothelial cells (BBEC). METHODS: The retroviral vectors derived from murine leukemia virus (MuLV) were used to transfer human tPA cDNA to BBEC. The tPA activity, tPA antigen and tPA inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) antigen were determined in the supernatant of transduced (BBEC/tPA) cell cultures by an immunoassay. RESULTS: The tPA antigen and enzymatic activity in cell culture supernatants of BBEC/tPA transduced cells were 75 ng/ml and 14 IU/ml after 4 days, that was 25 and 28-fold higher compared to the respective values in control cells. The PAI-1 antigen was not affected by tPA cDNA transfer. The Western blot assay of cell lysates confirmed that the majority of tPA in BBEC/tPA transduced cells was in the form of free tPA. While the maximal transduction efficiency of BBEC with an amphotropic MuLV vector was about 15%, a MuLV pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein envelope achieved high > 90% maximal transduction efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: The fibrinolytic activity of brain endothelial cells can be enhanced by transferring human tPA cDNA. These findings provide an initial step in implementation of future studies that investigate the use of this technology as an adjunctive treatment for cerebrovascular disease.","['Yu, H', 'Wang, Y', 'Eton, D', 'Stins, M', 'Wang, L', 'Apuzzo, M L', 'Weaver, F A', 'McComb, J G', 'Weiss, M H', 'Zlokovic, B V']","['Yu H', 'Wang Y', 'Eton D', 'Stins M', 'Wang L', 'Apuzzo ML', 'Weaver FA', 'McComb JG', 'Weiss MH', 'Zlokovic BV']","['Department of Surgery, University of Southern California, School of Medicine, Los Angeles, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Neurosurgery,Neurosurgery,7802914,IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/*blood supply', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Complementary/*genetics', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*metabolism', 'Fibrinolysis/genetics/physiology', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Tissue Plasminogen Activator/*genetics']",1999/10/09 00:00,1999/10/09 00:01,['1999/10/09 00:00'],"['1999/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neurosurgery. 1999 Oct;45(4):962-8; discussion 968-70. doi: 10.1097/00006123-199910000-00072.,,,['10.1097/00006123-199910000-00072 [doi]'],"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', 'EC 3.4.21.68 (Tissue Plasminogen Activator)']","['NS31945/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS26310/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular basis of this persistence is the integration of a copy of the viral genome into cellular chromosomal DNA. At the level of the whole animal, however, each retrovirus genus has evolved a different strategy to ensure its survival. This variety is well illustrated in the cat. Feline leukaemia virus, an oncovirus, has a simple genomic structure and survives in its host by suppressing the immune response to the virus. As a result, this virus is antigenically highly conserved. By contrast, feline immunodeficiency virus and feline foamy virus, representatives of the lentiviruses and spumaviruses, respectively, have more complex genomes which include genes responsible for maintaining the virus in a latent state thereby avoiding elimination in the face of a powerful antiviral immune response. In the lentiviruses, this response drives the selection of viruses exhibiting variation in antigenicity and pathogenicity.","['Jarrett, O']",['Jarrett O'],"['Department of Veterinary Pathology, University of Glasgow, Bearsden, Scotland, UK. o.jarrett@vet.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Vet Microbiol,Veterinary microbiology,7705469,IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/*virology', 'Cats', 'Retroviridae', 'Retroviridae Infections/*veterinary/virology']",1999/10/09 00:00,1999/10/09 00:01,['1999/10/09 00:00'],"['1999/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Microbiol. 1999 Sep 1;69(1-2):99-107. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1135(99)00095-4.,,,"['S0378-1135(99)00095-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1135(99)00095-4 [doi]']",,,,,14,,,,,,,,,

Studies based on heterologous reporter plasmids identified an intronic CRS in the 5' LTR and a CRS that overlaps with the RXRE. The present study investigated the effects of these elements in the context of spliced viral mRNAs encoding p21Rex (mRNA 1-3), Tax/Rex (mRNA 1-2-3), and Tof (mRNA 1-2-B). All three mRNAs were inefficiently expressed when transcribed in their mature intronless form, with the p21Rex mRNA showing the weakest expression. In contrast, efficient expression of p21Rex was obtained from a plasmid containing the 5' LTR and 3' portion of the genome that encoded a spliceable RNA. The defective expression of the intronless mRNAs reflected the inhibitory activity of the RXRE and the lack of 5' intronic sequences. Insertion of an intronic 5' LTR segment located upstream of the 5' CRS overcame Rex dependence conferred by the RXRE. The activity of this segment was mapped to the major splice donor and sequences overlapping with, but functionally distinct from, a previously described transcriptional enhancer. The three mRNAs responded differently to Rex and to insertion of the constitutive transport element of simian retrovirus type 1. Taken together, these results suggest that expression of the spliced mRNAs is controlled by the relative influence of positive and negative sequences present on the primary transcript as well as the Rex-RXRE interaction.","[""D'Agostino, D M"", 'Ciminale, V', 'Zotti, L', 'Chieco-Bianchi, L']","[""D'Agostino DM"", 'Ciminale V', 'Zotti L', 'Chieco-Bianchi L']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, University of Padova, Italy. dmdago@ux1.unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, rex/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Introns/*genetics', 'Plasmids/genetics', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Response Elements']",1999/10/09 00:00,1999/10/09 00:01,['1999/10/09 00:00'],"['1999/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1999 Oct 10;15(15):1351-63. doi: 10.1089/088922299310061.,,,['10.1089/088922299310061 [doi]'],"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A moderate increase in Epo-induced activation of JNK was also observed in cells overexpressing CrkL. Overexpression of C3G enhanced the Elk-1 activation synergistically with CrkL, while a C3G mutant lacking the guanine nucleotide exchange domain showed an inhibitory effect. Studies using a dominant negative Ha-Ras mutant demonstrated that the Elk-1 and ERK2 activation enhanced by CrkL and C3G was dependent on Ras. Consistent with this, the Epo-induced activation of Ras was augmented in cells inducibly overexpressing CrkL. Most importantly, a CrkL mutant defective in the SH2 or N-terminal SH3 domain showed an inhibitory effect on the Epo-induced activation of ERK2. These data indicate that the CrkL-C3G complex plays a role in Epo- or IL-3-induced, Ras-dependent activation of the Raf/ERK pathway leading to the activation of Elk-1 and the c-fos gene transcription.","['Nosaka, Y', 'Arai, A', 'Miyasaka, N', 'Miura, O']","['Nosaka Y', 'Arai A', 'Miyasaka N', 'Miura O']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Genes, fos', 'Guanine Nucleotide-Releasing Factor 2/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', '*Transcription Factors', 'ets-Domain Protein Elk-1', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism', 'src Homology Domains']",1999/10/09 00:00,1999/10/09 00:01,['1999/10/09 00:00'],"['1999/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Oct 15;274(42):30154-62. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.42.30154.,,,"['10.1074/jbc.274.42.30154 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)51878-6 [pii]']","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Elk1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide-Releasing Factor 2)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ets-Domain Protein Elk-1)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

TEL is unusual among other ETS proteins by its ability to self-associate in vivo, a property that is essential to the oncogenic activation of TEL-derived fusion proteins. We show here that TEL is a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor of ETS-binding site-driven transcription of model and natural promoters. Deletion of the oligomerization domain of TEL or its substitution by the homologous region of monomeric ETS1 impaired the ability of TEL to repress. In contrast, substitution of the oligomerization domain of TEL by unrelated oligomerization domains resulted in an active repressor, showing that the ability of TEL to repress depends on its ability to self-associate. The study of the properties of TEL fusions to the heterologous DNA binding domain of Gal4 identified two autonomous repression domains in TEL, distinct from its oligomerization domain, that are essential to the ability of TEL to repress ETS-binding site-containing promoters. These results have implications for the normal function of TEL, its relation to other ETS proteins, and its role in leukemogenesis.","['Lopez, R G', 'Carron, C', 'Oury, C', 'Gardellin, P', 'Bernard, O', 'Ghysdael, J']","['Lopez RG', 'Carron C', 'Oury C', 'Gardellin P', 'Bernard O', 'Ghysdael J']","['CNRS UMR146, Institut Curie, Centre Universitaire, 91405 Orsay, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1999/10/09 00:00,1999/10/09 00:01,['1999/10/09 00:00'],"['1999/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Oct 15;274(42):30132-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.42.30132.,,,"['10.1074/jbc.274.42.30132 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)51875-0 [pii]']","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (ETS1 protein, human)', '0 (Ets1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Asynchronous involvement of cells in apoptosis results in different proportions of apoptotic cells with blebbed membrane, broken nuclei, modified mitochondrial units or fragmented DNA coexisting in the culture at any single moment. Thus, depending on the method used, the extent of apoptosis determined in the same cell population may vary. In the present study, a microculture kinetic (MiCK) assay was used to monitor apoptosis in HL-60 cells exposed to 1, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 micromol/L etoposide and cisplatin. Both the extent and timing of apoptotic responses were dependent on the drug and drug concentration. Time-lapse video microscopy (TLVM), flow cytometry analysis of the light scattering properties of cells, morphological studies of Giemsa-stained cells, annexin V binding, and DNA fragmentation assays were performed at multiple times of cell exposure to 10 micromol/L etoposide and 5 micromol/L cisplatin. Steep linear increases in optical density, indicating apoptosis in the MiCK assay, correlated with both linear increases in the proportion of cells with plasma membrane blebbing in TLVM and with increased side scattering properties of apoptotic cells in flow cytometry. During a 24-hour culture period, the MiCK assay and TLVM provided multiple consecutive appraisals of nondisturbed cell microcultures at intervals of 5 and 2.5 minutes, respectively, and thus could be considered as real time kinetic assays. With the three endpoint assays, each of which was applied 12 times at 2-hour intervals, maximum apoptotic responses varied from 22.5 to 72% in etoposide-treated cells and from 30 to 57% in cisplatin-treated cells. With the annexin V binding assay, maximum apoptosis could always be detected 4 to 5 hours earlier than it was seen in Giemsa-stained preparations and 8 hours earlier than it was detected by measuring of DNA fragmentation. Values of the maximum extent of apoptosis varied, being the lowest with annexin V and the greatest with DNA fragmentation assays. The best correlations of both extent and timing of apoptosis were observed between the MiCK, TLVM, and morphological assays. In conclusion, both a maximum apoptotic response and the time at which it was achieved are the obligatory requirements for determining the apoptosis-inducing potency of an agent and for comparing results of studies performed in different laboratories.","['Kravtsov, V D', 'Daniel, T O', 'Koury, M J']","['Kravtsov VD', 'Daniel TO', 'Koury MJ']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center Nashville, Tennessee, USA. vladimir.d.kravtsov@vanderbilt.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/pharmacokinetics', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/pharmacokinetics', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Light', 'Microscopy, Video', 'Scattering, Radiation', 'Time Factors']",1999/10/09 00:00,1999/10/09 00:01,['1999/10/09 00:00'],"['1999/10/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1999 Oct;155(4):1327-39. doi: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65235-2.,,,"['S0002-9440(10)65235-2 [pii]', '10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65235-2 [doi]']","['0 (Annexin A5)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']","['P30 CA068485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1P30 CA68485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0-1 DK38518/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC1867030,,,,,,,,,,

While mechanisms of its biological activities are not understood, previous studies have shown that it modulates glutathione (GSH)-linked detoxification mechanisms in rats. In the present studies, we have examined the effects of curcumin on GSH-linked enzymes in K562 human leukemia cells. One micromolar curcumin in medium (16 h) did not cause any noticeable change in glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities. Gamma-glutamyl-cysteinyl synthetase activity was induced 1.6-fold accompanied by a 1.2-fold increase in GSH levels. GSH S-transferase (GST) activities towards 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, and 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE) were increased in curcumin-treated cells 1.3- and 1.6-fold, respectively (P = 0.05). The GST isozyme composition of K562 cells was determined as follows: 66% of GST Pl-1, 31% of Mu class GST(s), and 3% of an anionic Alpha-class isozyme hGST 5.8, which was immunologically similar to mouse GSTA4-4 and displayed substrate preference for 4HNE. The isozyme hGST 5.8 appeared to be preferentially induced by curcumin, as indicated by a relatively greater increase in activity toward 4HNE. Immunoprecipitation showed that GPx activity expressed by GST 5.8 contributed significantly (approximately 50%) to the total cytosolic GPx activity of K562 cells to lipid hydroperoxides. Taken together, these results suggest that GSTs play a major role in detoxification of lipid peroxidation products in K562 cells, and that these enzymes are modulated by curcumin.","['Singhal, S S', 'Awasthi, S', 'Pandya, U', 'Piper, J T', 'Saini, M K', 'Cheng, J Z', 'Awasthi, Y C']","['Singhal SS', 'Awasthi S', 'Pandya U', 'Piper JT', 'Saini MK', 'Cheng JZ', 'Awasthi YC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77555, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Isoenzymes', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Selenium/pharmacology']",1999/10/08 00:00,1999/10/08 00:01,['1999/10/08 00:00'],"['1999/10/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 1999 Sep 20;109(1-2):87-95. doi: 10.1016/s0378-4274(99)00124-1.,,,"['S0378-4274(99)00124-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-4274(99)00124-1 [doi]']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']","['CA27967/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77495/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This molecule has been shown to inhibit cell growth and induce erythroid differentiation in human leukemia K562 cells. In the present study, to clarify the mechanism of the actions of DIF-1, we examined the effect of DIF-1 on Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) in K562 cells. Akt/PKB is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cell survival and differentiation in a variety of cells. A nonphosphorylated (inactive) form of Akt/PKB was ordinarily expressed in K562 cells. However, Akt/PKB was phosphorylated and potently activated within several hours of incubation with 5-30 microM DIF-1, and this activation was inhibited by wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase). Calcium-increasing agents thapsigargin and A23187 also activated Akt/PKB slightly, which was inhibited by wortmannin. By contrast, calcium-reducing agents TMB-8 and EGTA together with A23187 inhibited the DIF-1-induced activation of Akt/PKB. PMA (PKC activator) also activated Akt/PKB but this activation was not inhibited by wortmannin. DIF-1 exhibited no marked effect on the activation of PKCalpha, beta, and gamma, which were activated by PMA. These results indicate that DIF-1 activates Akt/PKB possibly via cytosolic calcium and subsequent activation of PI3-kinase and also that PMA activates Akt/PKB in a PI3-kinase-independent manner.","['Kubohara, Y', 'Hosaka, K']","['Kubohara Y', 'Hosaka K']","['Department of Molecular Physiology, Institute for Molecular and Cellular Regulation (IMCR), Gunma University, Maebashi, 371-8512, Japan. kubohara@akagi.sb.gunma-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Dictyostelium', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Erythrocytes/cytology', 'Gallic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Hexanones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Wortmannin']",1999/10/08 00:00,1999/10/08 00:01,['1999/10/08 00:00'],"['1999/10/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1999 Oct 5;263(3):790-6. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1999.1468.,,,"['10.1006/bbrc.1999.1468 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(99)91468-7 [pii]']","['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hexanones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '111050-72-7 (1-((3,5-dichloro)-2,6-dihydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-1-hexanone)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '57818-92-5 (8-(N,N-diethylamino)octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate)', '632XD903SP (Gallic Acid)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,

The morphological characteristics and responses to treatment revealed two distinct groups among the present 13 patients. The lymphocytes in one group were typical granular lymphocytes of T cell phenotype which were treated effectively with cyclophosphamide rather than cyclosporine. The response to therapy in this group occurred after a perceptible reduction in lymphocyte mass, which took at least 8 weeks. The lymphocytes in the second group consisted mainly of non-granulated lymphocytes or some granulated lymphocytes with fine and indistinct granules and responded well to cyclosporine therapy. A reduction in lymphocytes mass was not a prerequisite for the development of the remission of red cell aplasia in this group, and responses occurred within 4 weeks. Clonal T cell proliferation was detected in some patients, which raised the possibility of idiopathic PRCA being associated with a clonal proliferation of T cells. Distinguishing lymphocytes in patients with PRCA could potentially be used to plan treatment strategy and assess prognosis.","['Yamada, O']",['Yamada O'],"[""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical College, Japan. yamadao@lab.twmc.ac.jp""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Clone Cells/*pathology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Tests', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/drug therapy/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology']",1999/10/08 09:00,2000/08/12 11:00,['1999/10/08 09:00'],"['1999/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/12 11:00 [medline]', '1999/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Sep;35(1-2):69-82. doi: 10.3109/10428199909145706.,,,"['I308J991004 [pii]', '10.3109/10428199909145706 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the biological activity of IL-15 in vitro has been studied extensively, its physiological role is still obscure. The receptors for IL-15 and IL-2 consist of three subunits, an unique alpha chain and shared beta and gamma chains. Since beta and gamma chains transduce the signals from the receptors, both cytokines share similar biologic functions, although IL-15 and IL-2 do not have sequence homology. The alpha chains function to increase binding affinity for each cytokines. Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells constitutively express the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) alpha and expression is believed to be essential in the early stages of disease development. We have recently shown that ATL cells also express the complete form of IL-15R including the alpha chain, and that ATL cells proliferate in response to exogenous IL-15. Since the mRNA of IL-15 is ubiquitous and is detected in many tissues and cells, it is possible that IL-15R stimulation is involved in the development and progression of ATL. Here, we review recent studies on IL-15 and IL-15R and their association with ATL and other lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Yamada, Y', 'Kamihira, S']","['Yamada Y', 'Kamihira S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan. y-yamada@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adult', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/physiopathology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-15', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/physiology']",1999/10/08 09:00,2000/08/12 11:00,['1999/10/08 09:00'],"['1999/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/12 11:00 [medline]', '1999/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Sep;35(1-2):37-45. doi: 10.3109/10428199909145703.,,,"['I308J991015 [pii]', '10.3109/10428199909145703 [doi]']","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IL15RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-15)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,,,63,,,,,,,,,

Even though there are indications that CD30L plays a key role as a paracrine-acting surface molecule in the deregulated cytokine cascade of Hodgkin's disease, little is known about its biological functions in other human hemopoietic malignancies, despite the demonstration of the frequent expression of CD30L in hemopoietic neoplasms of both myeloid and lymphoid origin. The present review summarises structural and biological properties of CD30L, and focuses on CD30L+ acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) by recapitulating some phenotypic and clinical features of this subset of acute leukemias. We also discuss some mechanisms by which CD30L-expressing leukemic blasts may gain a proliferative advantage through direct interaction with specific cells, in turn expressing its specific counterreceptor CD30. In particular, data has been provided suggesting that CD30L+ AMLs may evoke a sort of polarized T-cell response with the preferential production of Th2-like cytokines, mainly IL-4, by specific CD30-expressing T cell subsets. On the other hand, leukemic blasts presenting surface CD30L, have been shown to express a peculiar cytokine-receptors pattern that makes them an ideal target for T cells-produced Th2-like cytokines. Furthermore, some Th2-like cytokines, such as IL-4, are able to enhance blast cells proliferation, as well as to up-regulate the surface expression of specific adhesion molecules that have been shown to be associated with the presence of CD30L on AML blasts.","['Gattei, V', 'Degan, M', 'Rossi, F M', 'de Iuliis, A', 'Mazzocco, F T', 'Serraino, D', 'Zagonel, V', 'Aldinucci, D', 'Pinto, A']","['Gattei V', 'Degan M', 'Rossi FM', 'de Iuliis A', 'Mazzocco FT', 'Serraino D', 'Zagonel V', 'Aldinucci D', 'Pinto A']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, I.R.C.C.S., Aviano, Italy. vgattei@ets.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blast Crisis/*immunology', 'CD30 Ligand', 'Humans', '*Ki-1 Antigen', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis', '*Models, Biological', '*Paracrine Communication']",1999/10/08 00:00,1999/10/08 00:01,['1999/10/08 00:00'],"['1999/10/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Sep;35(1-2):21-35. doi: 10.3109/10428199909145702.,,,['10.3109/10428199909145702 [doi]'],"['0 (CD30 Ligand)', '0 (Ki-1 Antigen)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (TNFSF8 protein, human)']",,,,92,,,,,,,,,

Methotrexate is a key component in ALL consolidation and maintenance therapies and is administered intrathecally in the prophylaxis and treatment of central nervous system leukemia. Recent reports have significantly extended the results of preclinical studies of methotrexate response and resistance to patients with ALL. The application of new and sensitive molecular biology techniques makes it possible to study specific chromosomal and genetic alterations [t(12;21), hyperdiploidy, deletions or methylation of p15INK4B and p16INK4A] which potentially contribute to methotrexate response and resistance in childhood ALL. Studies of the relationships between genetic alterations and ALL progression, methotrexate pharmacology, and long term event-free-survivals may lead to the better identification of subgroups of patients who exhibit unique levels of sensitivity or resistance to chemotherapy including methotrexate. Further, by characterizing the roles of translocation-generated fusion genes (TEL-AML 1) and tumor suppressor genes (p15INK4B and p16INK4A) in treatment response, it may be possible to identify new and selective targets and/or treatment strategies for both children and adults with ALL who are refractory to current therapies.","['Matherly, L H', 'Taub, J W']","['Matherly LH', 'Taub JW']","[""Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Department of Pharmacology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, and the Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit 48201, USA. matherly@kci.wayne.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Disease Progression', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors']",1999/10/08 09:00,2000/08/12 11:00,['1999/10/08 09:00'],"['1999/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/12 11:00 [medline]', '1999/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Sep;35(1-2):1-20. doi: 10.3109/10428199909145701.,,,"['I308J991027 [pii]', '10.3109/10428199909145701 [doi]']","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']","['R01 CA076641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,141,,,,,,,,,

There were 33 cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasias (CLHs) and 6 cutaneous B-cell lymphomas. IAs were present in 9 lesions and clonal bands in 14 lesions. In 6 cutaneous B-cell lymphomas, IAs were associated with pure and reproducible clonal bands. IAs in 3 CLH lesions with a superficial infiltrate were not associated with clonal bands. Clonal bands in 8 CLH lesions without IAs were not reproducible from deeper sections; furthermore, in 5 of 8 cases, these were present against a background smear. A combination of IAs and clonality is a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of CBIs.","['Saxena, A', 'Angel, S', 'Geldenhuys, L', 'Hull, P R']","['Saxena A', 'Angel S', 'Geldenhuys L', 'Hull PR']","['Department of Pathology, Royal University Hospital, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*chemistry/immunology', 'Biopsy', 'Clone Cells/chemistry', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/immunology/*pathology']",1999/10/08 00:00,1999/10/08 00:01,['1999/10/08 00:00'],"['1999/10/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1999 Oct;112(4):495-512. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/112.4.495.,,,['10.1093/ajcp/112.4.495 [doi]'],['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this treatment is associated with deleterious toxic effects. Gene transfer of the IFN-alpha gene into hematopoietic progenitors represents a novel strategy to deliver high concentrations of IFN-alpha to a local area. METHODS: We compared the effect of the transfer of the IFN-alpha gene on the cell growth and differentiation of several CD34+ cells in culture and in a NOD/SCID animal model, using adenovirus and retrovirus constructs. RESULTS: Transient local expression of the IFN-alpha gene using an adenovirus vector was associated with normal proliferation of CD34+ progenitors as measured by a colony forming unit of granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) growth. Flow cytometric determination revealed that there was no significant difference in viability of these cells for 24-hour transduction periods. Reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of RNA from CD34+ harvested CFU-GM progenitors demonstrated expression of IFN-alpha mRNA; radioimmunoassay (RIA) revealed that transduced cells secreted substantial levels of IFN-alpha protein. Furthermore, we constructed a retroviral vector in which IFN-alpha cDNA was driven by a viral LTR promoter to evaluate the effect of permanent IFN-alpha gene expression on cell growth. Retroviral packaging cells PA317 with high titers of retrovirus were produced and used to infect CD34+ and K562 cells. RIA showed that IFN-alpha-transduced CD34+ cells (with the aid of fibronectin fragment CH-296) produced approximately 400 units of IFN-alpha protein compared to CD34+ cells, or cells transduced with empty vector. IFN-alpha transduced CD34+ generated similar numbers of CFU-GM colonies as compared to control CD34+ cells. Engraftment of CD34+ cells transduced with IFN-alpha gene in NOD/SCID mice was successful for the first 30 days. Additionally, we studied the effect of local IFN-alpha expression on the cellular adhesion molecules, VLA-4, Mac-1, ICAM-1, and L-selectin in K562 cells, and human umbilical endothelial vein cells. K562 cells transduced with the IFN-alpha gene expressed a significantly elevated level of VLA-4, Mac-1, and ICAM-1. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that expression of the IFN-alpha gene using retrovirus vectors results in an adequate localized expression of IFN-alpha mRNA and protein.","['Seiter, K', 'Kancherla, R', 'Yang, L', 'Quan, S', 'Farley, T J', 'Abraham, N G', 'Ahmed, T']","['Seiter K', 'Kancherla R', 'Yang L', 'Quan S', 'Farley TJ', 'Abraham NG', 'Ahmed T']","['Department of Medicine, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Investig Med,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,9501229,IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*genetics/metabolism', 'K562 Cells/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1999/10/08 00:00,1999/10/08 00:01,['1999/10/08 00:00'],"['1999/10/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Investig Med. 1999 Sep;47(8):414-24.,,,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",['HL54138/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The present studies were undertaken to compare the drug concentrations and length of exposure required for this sensitization in vitro with the drug exposure that could be achieved in mice in vivo. Human K562 leukemia cells and A549 lung cancer cells were incubated with 6AN for various lengths of time, exposed to cisplatin for 1-2 hr, and assayed for Pt-DNA adducts as well as the ability to form colonies. K562 cells displayed progressive increases in Pt-DNA adducts and cisplatin sensitivity during the first 10 hr of 6AN exposure. An 18-hr 6AN exposure was likewise more effective than a 6-hr 6AN exposure in sensitizing A549 cells to cisplatin. HPLC analysis of 6AN and its metabolite, 6-amino-NAD+, permitted assessment of exposures achieved in vivo after i.v. administration of 10 mg/kg of 6AN to CD2F1 mice. 6AN reached peak serum concentrations of 80-90 microM and was cleared rapidly, with T1/2alpha and T1/2beta values of 7.4 and 31.3 min, respectively. Bioavailability was 80-100% with identical plasma pharmacokinetics after i.p. administration. At least 25% of the 6AN was excreted unchanged in the urine. The metabolite 6-amino-NAD+ was detected in perchloric acid extracts of brain, liver, kidney, and spleen, but not in serum. Efforts to prolong systemic 6AN exposure by administering multiple i.p. doses or using osmotic pumps resulted in lethal toxicity. These results demonstrated that 6AN exposures required to sensitize tumor cells to cisplatin in vitro are difficult to achieve in vivo.","['Walker, D L', 'Reid, J M', 'Svingen, P A', 'Rios, R', 'Covey, J M', 'Alley, M C', 'Hollingshead, M G', 'Budihardjo, I I', 'Eckdahl, S', 'Boerner, S A', 'Kaufmann, S H', 'Ames, M M']","['Walker DL', 'Reid JM', 'Svingen PA', 'Rios R', 'Covey JM', 'Alley MC', 'Hollingshead MG', 'Budihardjo II', 'Eckdahl S', 'Boerner SA', 'Kaufmann SH', 'Ames MM']","['Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['6-Aminonicotinamide/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'NAD/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/06 00:00,1999/10/06 00:01,['1999/10/06 00:00'],"['1999/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1999 Sep 15;58(6):1057-66. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(99)00179-3.,,,"['S0006-2952(99)00179-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(99)00179-3 [doi]']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '329-89-5 (6-Aminonicotinamide)', '652-81-3 (6-amino-NAD)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']","['N01-CM57200/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA67818/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-I+ T-cells differed significantly from other T-lymphocyte-derived cells in also having a higher proportion of PDE4 activities, which apparently were not related to selective induction of any one PDE4 mRNA (judged by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) or expression of the HTLV-I regulatory protein Tax. In MJ cells (an HTLV-I+ T-cell line), Jurkat cells, and PBMC-PHA cells, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A strongly inhibited PDE activity. Growth of MJ cells was inhibited by herbimycin A and a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, and was arrested in G1 by rolipram, a specific PDE4 inhibitor. Proliferation of several HTLV-I+ T-cell lines, PBMC-PHA, and Jurkat cells was inhibited differentially by forskolin (which activates adenylyl cyclase), the selective PDE inhibitors cilostamide and rolipram, and the nonselective PDE inhibitors pentoxifylline and isobutyl methylxanthine.

The Mcl-1 gene product proved to be a member of the Bcl-2 gene family, and like Bcl-2 had the capacity to promote cell viability. Here, we investigated the pattern of expression of Mcl-1 in CHSE-214 cells infected by IPNV. We found that the Mcl-1 level decreased markedly in cells undergoing apoptosis after IPNV infection. This decrease was rapid during the first 8 h postinfection and preceded cell death. Furthermore, we found that drugs including cycloheximide, genistein and EDTA either prevented the decline in Mcl-1 levels or blocked the intense DNA laddering pattern. Other drugs like serine proteinase inhibitor, 400 microg/ml aprotinin, 400 microg/ml leupeptin and 100 microg/ml tryphostin did not. The virus gene expression pattern was examined by Western blot using antivirion polyclonal antibody and was blocked during treatment with cycloheximide, genistein and EDTA but not by serine proteinase, aprotinin, leupeptin or tryphostin.

One important effect is the occurrence of second malignancies, particularly in women treated with radiation therapy. Methodologic considerations raised in studying this issue include the effects of postmastectomy radiotherapy vs whole-breast irradiation, as currently employed following breast-conserving surgery; particularly germane are differences in the fields irradiated and the relative dosages to which various organs are exposed. Breast cancer radiotherapy does not appear to be a major factor in the occurrence of subsequent contralateral breast cancer. Such therapy may raise the risk of leukemia, particularly in association with certain types of adjuvant chemotherapy. Lung cancer risk is also increased, especially in cigarette smokers, and there are some indications that the risks of esophageal cancer and sarcomas may be elevated as well. Clinicians should be aware of these risks when trying to distinguish breast cancer recurrences from new primary malignancies. However, it should also be remembered that a high relative risk may represent only a slight increase in absolute risk. The benefits of breast cancer radiotherapy in improving survival or quality of life remain the principal factors to be weighed when deciding whether to treat patients with radiation.","['Neugut, A I', 'Weinberg, M D', 'Ahsan, H', 'Rescigno, J']","['Neugut AI', 'Weinberg MD', 'Ahsan H', 'Rescigno J']","['Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncology (Williston Park),"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",8712059,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*radiotherapy/surgery', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/diagnosis/*etiology/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sarcoma/etiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'United States/epidemiology']",1999/10/06 00:00,1999/10/06 00:01,['1999/10/06 00:00'],"['1999/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,"Oncology (Williston Park). 1999 Sep;13(9):1245-56; discussion 1257, 1261-5.",,,,,,,,84,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six patients with Ph-negative, BCR-ABL-positive CML were investigated. The Ph chromosome detection via fluorescence in situ hybridization after 24-hour mitotic arrest of bone marrow cultures resulting in several hundreds of metaphases (hypermetaphase FISH or HMF) was useful in explaining the nature of the six cases. RESULTS: Four patients had a low frequency of Ph-positive cells by HMF (5.7%, 4.8%, 3.9%, 0.2%), i.e., a typical Ph translocation. However, two cases involved a 9q34 inserted into chromosome 22q11 (74.2% and 92%), without a deletion from chromosome 22 and reciprocal translocation onto 9, i.e., not a typical Ph translocation. The pattern of UBCR gene rearrangement was characterized by the same genomic recombination of 5-BCR and c-ABL, both in the four cases of typical translocation (9;22) and in the two cases of insertion of 9q34 into chromosome 22q11. CONCLUSIONS: The HMF identified two different bases for Ph-negative, BCR-ABL-positive cells in CML-presence of low frequency of cells with typical Ph translocations or presence of cells with ABL insertions into the BCR gene on chromosome 22.","['Seong, D', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Albitar, M', 'Arlinghaus, R', 'Xu, J', 'Talpaz, M', 'Rios, M B', 'Guo, J Q', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Siciliano, M']","['Seong D', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Albitar M', 'Arlinghaus R', 'Xu J', 'Talpaz M', 'Rios MB', 'Guo JQ', ""O'Brien S"", 'Siciliano M']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adult', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1999/10/06 00:00,1999/10/06 00:01,['1999/10/06 00:00'],"['1999/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1999 Aug;10(8):955-9. doi: 10.1023/a:1008349405763.,,,"['10.1023/a:1008349405763 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)57311-2 [pii]']","['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondary leukemias account for 10-30% of all AML. The majority of secondary leukemias resulting from the use of cytotoxic drugs can be divided into two well defined groups depending on whether the patient has received 1) alkylating agents or 2) drugs binding to the enzyme DNA-topoisomerase II. Alkylating agents related leukemias are very similar to post MDS leukemias being characterized frequently by a preleukemic phase, tri-lineage dysplasia, frequent cytogenetic abnormalities involving chromosomes 5 and 7 and a poor prognosis. Secondary leukemias related to therapy with topoisomerase II inhibitors are not preceded by a preleukemic phase and show frequently balanced translocations involving chromosome 11q23. Among therapy-related leukemias, AML is generally a second neoplasm, thus a predisposition to malignancy, independently from previous chemotherapy, cannot be excluded. This review article examines the incidence of all secondary AMLs and the risk of therapy-related leukemia in relation to the different primary malignancies and treatments. INFORMATION SOURCES: The authors have been working in this field, both experimentally and at clinical level, contributing original papers for many years. In addition, the material examined in this review includes articles published in journals covered by MedLine, reviews in journals with high impact factor and recent reports presented at the Secondary Leukemia. An Update Symposium held in Rome in November 1998. STATE OF THE ART AND PERSPECTIVES: The incidence of secondary leukemias is increasing because of aging of the population (MDS is more frequent in elderly people) and widespread and successful use of chemoradiotherapy in cancer patients. In the GIMEMA archive of adult acute leukemia (2,964 AML pts from June 1992 to June 1996) an antecedent hematologic disorder (AHD) and/or MDS was found in 8% of all patients (10% of 2,118 patients aged more than 45 years and in 4% of 848 patients aged less than 45). In this series of patients, 6% of all myeloid leukemias were therapy-related leukemia. Therapy-related leukemias are a major problem in patients treated for Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, myeloma, polycythemia, breast cancer, ovarian carcinoma, or testicular carcinoma. In the GIMEMA archive more than 50% of patients with secondary AML have breast cancer, NHL, and HD. Alkylating agents, nitrosureas and procarbazine appear to have the highest leukemogenic potential. Furthermore aggressive chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed or not by hematopoietic stem cell infusion will produce a more and more prolonged survival but also a greater incidence of secondary AML. Assessment of the risk of secondary leukemia should become part of any therapeutic plan for cancer patients. Avoidance of drugs with more leukemogenic potential will produce a marked reduction of secondary AML.","['Leone, G', 'Mele, L', 'Pulsoni, A', 'Equitani, F', 'Pagano, L']","['Leone G', 'Mele L', 'Pulsoni A', 'Equitani F', 'Pagano L']","['Istituto di Semeiotica Medica, Universita Cattolica S.

However, 20-30% of cases relapse in the five years following treatment and consequently need further therapy. This study examines the occurrence of relapse and other complications in patients with pathologic stage IIA Hodgkin's disease and mediastinal involvement treated in different ways: radiotherapy alone vs radiotherapy plus one cycle of adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD). DESIGN AND METHODS: Our series consisted of 73 HD patients with mediastinal involvement treated by the Department of Radiation Oncology and the Hematology Department of ""La Sapienza"" University of Rome from 1983 to 1989. The patients were randomized into two groups according to their initial treatment. The first group contained 37 patients treated, initially, with supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy and para-aortic irradiation (STNI); the second group was made up of 36 patients treated, initially, with supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy and para-aortic irradiation (STNI) combined with one course of adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD). For 28 (38%) of the patients, the follow-up period was longer than 10 years. The average follow-up period was 114 months (range 22-174 months). Overall survival and relapse-free survival were assessed using the Kaplan and Meier method, while differences were tested by the log-rank test. RESULTS: We recorded twelve cases of relapse after initial treatment. The period of time which elapsed between the end of treatment and the evidence of relapse ranged from 6 to 51 months, with an average of 22 months. Ten relapses occurred in the STNI group and two in the ABVD/STNI group. No statistically significant differences emerged between the two groups in the overall survival analysis but did in the relapse-free survival analysis (p<0.01). In the group treated with ABVD and STNI one patient developed acute non-lymphocytic leukemia and another patient treated at the age of 44 developed primary breast cancer. X-ray-related asymptomatic pulmonary fibrosis was observed in 12 patients: 10 cases in the STNI and ABVD group and 2 cases in the group treated with RT alone. The other sequelae of combined CT/RT treatment in our study were thyroid dysfunction (2 cases, hypothyroidism), whereas the sequela of RT treatment was cardiac disease (2 cases). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that one cycle of ABVD and radiotherapy in early-stage HD patients with mediastinal involvement may reduce the risk of relapse.

We assessed the apoptotic effects of stable butyrate derivatives on CLL lymphocytes: in these molecules a mannose molecule is bound as ester to one-five butyrate moieties, conferring pharmacological stability to the pro-drugs which are able to induce apoptosis in primary AML blasts. DESIGN AND METHODS: Peripheral blood samples obtained from 17 patients with typical B-CLL were cultured in the presence of 0.5-1mM D1 (O-n-butanoyl-2, 3-O-isopropylidene-a-D-mannofuranoside), F1 (1-O-n-butanoyl-2, 3-O-isopropylidene-D,L-xylitol) and G1 (1-O-n-butanoyl-D,L-xylitol) derivatives for 4 days and equimolar sodium butyrate as comparison. After culture, apoptosis was evaluated by cell morphology, cellular DNA content, pattern of DNA fragmentation, annexin V exposure on cell membrane, and cell cycle parameters. Bcl2, bax, and fas oncogene expression were also evaluated by the APAAP method. RESULTS: The addition to cell cultures of D1 or F1 or G1 butyrate monosaccharides as well as sodium butyrate 0.5 and 1 mM determined to different extents an increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells in all CLL samples, relatively to the method and butyrate molecule added in culture. Heterogeneity in CLL cell sensitivity to the three butyrates was observed. Up to 60-68% apoptotic bodies were present in treated cultures after exposure to D1 0.5-1 mM, 60-72% after F1 0.5-1 mM and 48-60% after G1 0.5-1 mM. Comparison of untreated versus treated cultures yielded important significance (p< 0.001). At DNA content analysis, analyzed by flow cytometry, apoptotic events were accounting for up to 70-77% of D1-treated and 68-74% of F1-treated CLL cells at 0.5 and 1 mM concentrations (p= 0. 0001, vs controls 0-39%), and for 72-81% of G1 (0.5-1 mM) treated cells (overall, p=0.005). Cell cycle parameters were not altered by addition of butyrates, but expression of Annexin V was greatly enhanced. In a limited number of CLL cases fas, bcl2/bax ratio was analyzed and found unmodified. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Monosaccharide butyrate stable derivatives are potent inducers of primary CLL cell apoptosis, both in untreated and alkylating agent pre-treated cases. Our results suggest that the apoptotic pathways elicited by butyrate in CLL lymphocytes are direct, specific and most probably do not involve bcl2/bax. Pro-apoptotic agents like the stable monosaccharide butyrate derivatives here studied could bring more insights into CLL biology and resistance to apoptosis, and possibly originate alternative treatments for CLL.","['Santini, V', 'Gozzini, A', 'Scappini, B', 'Caporale, R', 'Zoccolante, A', 'Rigacci, L', 'Gelardi, E', 'Grossi, A', 'Alterini, R', 'Ferrini, P R']","['Santini V', 'Gozzini A', 'Scappini B', 'Caporale R', 'Zoccolante A', 'Rigacci L', 'Gelardi E', 'Grossi A', 'Alterini R', 'Ferrini PR']","['Dept. of Hematology, Policlinico di Careggi, viale Morgagni 85, 50134 Florence, Italy. santini@unifi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Aged', 'Annexin A5/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blood Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Monosaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1999/10/06 00:00,1999/10/06 00:01,['1999/10/06 00:00'],"['1999/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 Oct;84(10):897-904.,,,,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Monosaccharides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the usefulness of the PCR-SSCP analysis is not fully assessed in B cell malignancies. For example, we did not know whether the PCR-SSCP method can be used to detect tumor-related clones in peripheral blood of patients with multiple myeloma and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. In addition, because genomic DNA is used in the PCR-SSCP method, we could obtain no information about the isotype of the expanded B cell clone. In this study, we combined the reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR of immunoglobulin heavy chain transcripts with an SSCP analysis and thus analyzed eight healthy individuals, five patients with B chronic lymphocytic leukemia, four patients with multiple myeloma and three patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Clonal B cell populations were detected as discrete bands in the RT-PCR-SSCP analysis that can be readily detected over the background of polyclonal rearrangements. Circulating tumor-related clones were detected in all but one peripheral blood sample from multiple myeloma and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia patients and B cell clones in peripheral blood and bone marrow from these patients showed a similar mobility on SSCP gel. Because the transcripts of different isotypes were separately analyzed, we could thus determine the isotype of B cell clones as well. When monoclonal Igs of different isotypes were detected in the individual samples, we analyzed the relationship of each monoclonal band by excising the band and then further analyzing it by a PCR-SSCP analysis. RT-PCR amplification in conjunction with the SSCP analysis is thus considered to be a useful method to detect and characterize the B cell clones in hematological diseases.","['Shiokawa, S', 'Nishimura, J', 'Uike, N', 'Saburi, Y', 'Suehiro, T', 'Yamamoto, K']","['Shiokawa S', 'Nishimura J', 'Uike N', 'Saburi Y', 'Suehiro T', 'Yamamoto K']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Beppu, Oita, Japan. sahusa@tsurumi.beppu.kyushu-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/pathology', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Probes', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Isotypes/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/*immunology', '*Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Reference Values', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/genetics/*immunology']",1999/10/06 00:00,1999/10/06 00:01,['1999/10/06 00:00'],"['1999/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1999 Oct;62(2):74-81. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199910)62:2<74::aid-ajh2>3.0.co;2-f.,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199910)62:2<74::AID-AJH2>3.0.CO;2-F [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199910)62:2<74::aid-ajh2>3.0.co;2-f [doi]']","['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Isotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Cell cycle control in G1 phase has attracted considerable attention in recent cancer research, because many of the important proteins involved in G1 progression or G1/S transition have been found to play a crucial role in proliferation, differentiation, transformation, and programmed cell death (apoptosis). We previously reported our first antitumor sulfonamide E7010 as a novel tubulin polymerization inhibitor. Interestingly enough, continuous research on structurally related compounds led us to the finding of another class of antitumor sulfonamides that block cell cycle progression of P388 murine leukemia cells in G1 phase, but not in M phase. Of the compounds examined, N-(3-chloro-7-indolyl)-1,4-benzenedisulfonamide (E7070) showed significant antitumor activity against HCT116 human colon carcinoma both in vitro (IC(50) 0.11 microg/mL in cell proliferation assay) and in vivo (not only growth suppression but also a marked reduction of tumor size in nude mice). Because of its promising efficacy against human tumor xenografts and its unique mode of action, E7070 is currently undergoing phase I clinical trials in European countries.","['Owa, T', 'Yoshino, H', 'Okauchi, T', 'Yoshimatsu, K', 'Ozawa, Y', 'Sugi, N H', 'Nagasu, T', 'Koyanagi, N', 'Kitoh, K']","['Owa T', 'Yoshino H', 'Okauchi T', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Ozawa Y', 'Sugi NH', 'Nagasu T', 'Koyanagi N', 'Kitoh K']","['Tsukuba Research Laboratories, Eisai Company, Ltd., 5-1-3 Tokodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 300-2635, Japan. t1-oowa@eisai.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Drug Design', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Models, Chemical', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/03 00:00,1999/10/03 00:01,['1999/10/03 00:00'],"['1999/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1999 Sep 23;42(19):3789-99. doi: 10.1021/jm9902638.,,,"['jm9902638 [pii]', '10.1021/jm9902638 [doi]']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Sulfonamides)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested the hypothesis that agonist-induced desensitization involves C3aR and C5aR phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK). When expressed in rat basophilic leukemia cells and exposed to C3a, the C3aR underwent rapid (t(1/2) approximately 15 s), dose-dependent (EC50 approximately 10 nM) and reversible phosphorylation by a kinase refractory to the effects of PKC inhibitors. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that the C3aR is phosphorylated on serine and threonine, but not on tyrosine residues. Overexpression of GRK2, GRK3, GRK5 or GRK6 together with C3aR in COS-7 cells enhanced the C3a-induced C3aR phosphorylation 1.5 - 1.9-fold (p < 0.05), but each kinase reduced ligand-stimulated phospholipase C activity differently. Conversely, antibody-mediated inhibition of endogenous GRK2 and GRK3 significantly inhibited C3aR phosphorylation in permeabilized cells. GRK overexpression in cells which co-expressed C5aR and were exposed to C5a resulted in the hyperphosphorylation of the C5aR. These findings are of physiological relevance, since we observed anaphylatoxin-induced phosphorylation of C3aR and C5aR endogenously expressed in human mast cells (HMC-1) which contain significant intracellular levels of GRK2 and GRK3.","['Langkabel, P', 'Zwirner, J', 'Oppermann, M']","['Langkabel P', 'Zwirner J', 'Oppermann M']","['Department of Immunology, University of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/*metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Complement C3a/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/immunology/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 3', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 5', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinases', 'Humans', 'Ligands', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/immunology/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a', 'Receptors, Complement/immunology/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Adrenergic Receptor Kinases']",1999/10/03 00:00,1999/10/03 00:01,['1999/10/03 00:00'],"['1999/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1999 Sep;29(9):3035-46. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199909)29:09<3035::AID-IMMU3035>3.0.CO;2-Z.,,,['10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199909)29:09<3035::AID-IMMU3035>3.0.CO;2-Z [doi]'],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (complement C3a receptor)', '80295-42-7 (Complement C3a)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.15 (G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.15 (GRK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.15 (Grk3 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.11.15 (beta-Adrenergic Receptor Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.16 (G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 5)', 'EC 2.7.11.16 (G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.16 (G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 6)', 'EC 2.7.11.16 (GRK5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.16 (Grk5 protein, rat)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore substances which are structurally similar to 17beta-oestradiol and possess oestrogenic activity may also modulate LIF synthesis and influence the reproductive process. We used primary cultures of bovine and human oviduct cells (epithelial cells:fibroblasts 1:1) to compare the effects of 17beta-oestradiol, phyto-oestrogens (genistein, biochanin A, daidzein, formononetin, and equol) and xeno-oestrogens [polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB): trichlorobiphenyl, 4-hydroxy-trichlorobiphenyl and 4-hydroxy-dichlorobiphenyl] on LIF synthesis. Immunoreactive LIF-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the concentration of LIF in the culture medium. Similar to 17beta-oestradiol, genistein (0.02-2 micromol/l) induced LIF synthesis in bovine oviduct cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Equol, biochanin A and daidzein (2 micromol/l), 4-hydroxy-trichlorobiphenyl and 4-hydroxy-dichlorobiphenyl (0.01-10 micromol/l) but not formononetin (2 micromol/l) also induced LIF synthesis in bovine cells. Phyto-oestrogens and xeno-oestrogens also induced LIF synthesis in human oviduct cells (P < 0.05). The stimulatory effects of PCB, phyto-oestrogens and 17beta-oestradiol were blocked by ICI 182,780 (1 micromol/l). Moreover, 17beta-oestradiol, 4-hydroxy-trichlorobiphenyl, 4-hydroxy-dichlorobiphenyl, genistein, tamoxifen and ICI 182,780 displaced [(3)H]17beta-oestradiol from cytosolic oestrogen receptors in bovine oviduct cells. These results suggest that phyto-oestrogens and PCB mimic the effects of oestradiol in inducing LIF synthesis by bovine and human oviduct cells and that these stimulatory effects are oestrogen receptor-mediated. Environmental oestrogens act as endocrine modulators/disrupters and may induce deleterious effects on the reproductive process by influencing LIF synthesis in a non-cyclic fashion leading to tubal infertility.","['Reinhart, K C', 'Dubey, R K', 'Keller, P J', 'Lauper, U', 'Rosselli, M']","['Reinhart KC', 'Dubey RK', 'Keller PJ', 'Lauper U', 'Rosselli M']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Clinic for Endocrinology, University Hospital, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Hum Reprod,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Estradiol/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Estrogen Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Estrogens, Non-Steroidal/*toxicity', 'Fallopian Tubes/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fulvestrant', 'Genistein/toxicity', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/etiology', '*Interleukin-6', '*Isoflavones', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Phytoestrogens', 'Plant Preparations', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls/toxicity']",1999/10/03 00:00,1999/10/03 00:01,['1999/10/03 00:00'],"['1999/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Hum Reprod. 1999 Oct;5(10):899-907. doi: 10.1093/molehr/5.10.899.,,,['10.1093/molehr/5.10.899 [doi]'],"['0 (Estrogen Antagonists)', '0 (Estrogens, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Phytoestrogens)', '0 (Plant Preparations)', ""03KW6RT30C (4-hydroxy-2',4',6'-trichlorobiphenyl)"", '22X328QOC4 (Fulvestrant)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'DFC2HB4I0K (Polychlorinated Biphenyls)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, its use has extended from clinical research to diagnostic laboratories. The aim of this report is to critically review the type of information provided by the flow cytometric immunophenotyping of hematological malignancies and its clinical impact as well as to highlight its potential future applications. METHODS: The currently available information, including that provided by different international consensus groups on the phenotypic characterization of hematologic malignancies, was reviewed. Additionally, recent reports on the immunophenotypic analysis of hematological malignancies published in hematology, oncology, pathology, immunology, and cell biology journals were also analyzed. RESULTS: A careful review of the literature showed that in spite of the well-established utility of immunophenotyping for the diagnosis, classification, prognostic stratification, and monitoring of hematological malignancies, only a small part of the information on the immunophenotypic characteristics of pathological hemopoietic cells has been used routinely. Specific and sensitive identification of neoplastic cells and their accurate enumeration and phenotypic characterization represent the major aims of these procedures. Similarities between leukemic and healthy cells allow the establishment of the lineage and maturation stage of the pathologic cells, this information being of great utility for the diagnosis, classification, and prognostic evaluation of different subtypes of hematological malignancies.

This seasonal variation has been suggested to represent an underlying viral aetiology for these malignancies. Some studies have shown the highest frequency of diagnoses in the summer months, although this has been inconsistent. Data from the Children's Cancer Group and the Pediatric Oncology Group were analysed for seasonal incidence patterns. A total of 20,949 incident cancer cases diagnosed in the USA from 1 January 1989 through 31 December 1991 were available for analyses. Diagnosis-specific malignancies available for evaluation included ALL, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), Hodgkin's disease, NHL, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, osteosarcoma, Wilms' tumour, retinoblastoma, Ewings' sarcoma, central nervous system (CNS) tumours and hepatoblastoma. Overall, there was no statistically significant seasonal variation in the month of diagnosis for all childhood cancers combined. For diagnosis-specific malignancies, there was a statistically significant seasonal variation for ALL (P = 0.01; peak in summer), rhabdomyosarcoma (P = 0.03; spring/summer) and hepatoblastoma (P = 0.01; summer); there was no seasonal variation in the diagnosis of NHL. When cases were restricted to latitudes greater than 40 degrees ('north'), seasonal patterns were apparent only for ALL and hepatoblastoma. Notably, 33% of hepatoblastoma cases were diagnosed in the summer months. In contrast, for latitudes less than 40 degrees ('south'), only CNS tumours demonstrated a seasonal pattern (P = 0.002; winter). Although these data provide modest support for a summer peak in the diagnosis of childhood ALL, any underlying biological mechanisms that account for these seasonal patterns are likely complex and in need of more definitive studies.","['Ross, J A', 'Severson, R K', 'Swensen, A R', 'Pollock, B H', 'Gurney, J G', 'Robison, L L']","['Ross JA', 'Severson RK', 'Swensen AR', 'Pollock BH', 'Gurney JG', 'Robison LL']","['University of Minnesota Division of Pediatric Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/epidemiology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Databases, Factual', 'Eye Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Liver Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Neuroblastoma/epidemiology', 'Osteosarcoma/epidemiology', 'Retinoblastoma/epidemiology', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/epidemiology', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/epidemiology', '*Seasons', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",1999/10/03 00:00,1999/10/03 00:01,['1999/10/03 00:00'],"['1999/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 Oct;81(3):549-53. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690729.,,['Br J Cancer. 2000 Sep;83(5):699-700.

Conventional ultrasound backscatter imaging techniques were used to observe apoptosis occurring in response to anticancer agents in cells in vitro, in tissues ex vivo and in live animals. The mechanism behind this ultrasonic detection was identified experimentally to be the subcellular nuclear changes, condensation followed by fragmentation, that cells undergo during apoptosis. These changes dramatically increase the high frequency ultrasound scattering efficiency of apoptotic cells over normal cells (25- to 50-fold change in intensity). The result is that areas of tissue undergoing apoptosis become much brighter in comparison to surrounding viable tissues. The results provide a framework for the possibility of using high frequency ultrasound imaging in the future to non-invasively monitor the effects of chemotherapeutic agents and other anticancer treatments in experimental animal systems and in patients.","['Czarnota, G J', 'Kolios, M C', 'Abraham, J', 'Portnoy, M', 'Ottensmeyer, F P', 'Hunt, J W', 'Sherar, M D']","['Czarnota GJ', 'Kolios MC', 'Abraham J', 'Portnoy M', 'Ottensmeyer FP', 'Hunt JW', 'Sherar MD']","['Ontario Cancer Institute and Department of Medical Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Brain/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Dihematoporphyrin Ether/therapeutic use', 'Hematoporphyrin Photoradiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*diagnostic imaging', 'Ultrasonography']",1999/10/03 00:00,1999/10/03 00:01,['1999/10/03 00:00'],"['1999/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 Oct;81(3):520-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690724.,,,['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690724 [doi]'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '97067-70-4 (Dihematoporphyrin Ether)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,PMC2362928,,,,,,,,,,

High-dose therapy with autologous stem cell support has become the standard salvage therapy for patients failing chemotherapy, but there have been reports of a high incidence of myelodysplasia/acute myeloid leukaemia (MDS/AML) following such treatment. Patients who receive such therapy form a selected group, however, who have already been subjected to other leukaemogenic factors, such as treatment with alkylating agents. In order to ascertain the true risk of MDS/AML, comparison must be made with other patients subjected to the same risks but not undergoing transplantation. We report a retrospective comparative study of 4576 patients with Hodgkin's disease from the BNLI and UCLH Hodgkin's databases, which includes 595 patients who have received a transplant. Statistical analysis including Cox's proportional hazards multivariate regression model with time-dependent covariates was employed. This analysis reveals that the risk of developing MDS/AML was dominated by three factors, namely quantity of prior therapy (relative risk [RR] 2.01, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.49-2.71, for each treatment block, P < 0.0001) and whether the patient had been exposed to MOPP (RR 3.61, 95% CI 1.64-7.95, P = 0.0009) or lomustine chemotherapy (RR 4.53, 95% CI 1.96-10.44, P = 0.001). Following adjustment for these factors in the multivariate model the relative risk associated with transplantation was 1.83 (95% CI 0.66-5.11, P = 0.25). This study provides no evidence of a significantly increased risk of MDS/AML associated with BEAM therapy and autologous transplantation in Hodgkin's disease.

However, in vitro experiments on a scale large enough to detect rare cancer-initiating events, such as primary cell immortalization following residential level exposures, have not thus far been reported.

In many malignancies, specific oncogenic mutations correlate with phenotypic characteristics, inferring lineage-specific pathogenic mechanisms. To characterize these relationships in a unique feline tumor, we studied primary cells and two-cell lines independently-derived from a thymic lymphoma that contained and actively expressed a novel feline leukemia virus (FeLV) recombinant with transduced host Notch2 sequences. All three tumor cell populations contained similar FeLV/Notch2 proviral variants and phenotypically resembled mature thymocytes. Multiple Notch2 transcripts were expressed in the cell lines, including species that correspond to viral genomes and spliced subgenomic viral mRNA. Tumor cell line FeLV/Notch2 virus was packaged into virions; however, the variant was not efficiently transmitted to feline cells in vitro. Primary tumor cells constitutively expressed mRNA for interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-6 and the p40 subunit of IL-12. Lymphokine mRNA was not detected in established tumor cell lines nor was T-cell growth-promoting activity found in culture supernatants. Exogenous IL-4 enhanced primary tumor cell survival, but inhibited proliferation of the cell lines. Interleukin-4 abrogated hydrocortisone-induced apoptosis in all three populations and had divergent effects on cell line clonogenic colony formation. Exogenous IL-7 and, to a lesser degree, IL-6 also had variable positive effects on the growth and viability of the tumor cell populations. Collectively, these data suggest that thymocytes are susceptible to the transforming potential of dysregulated Notch2 and that thymopoietic factors could, through overlapping and distinct mechanisms, promote the survival and outgrowth of FeLV/Notch2-containing neoplastic cells.","['Linenberger, M L', 'Rohn, J L', 'Deng, T', 'Ellis-Smith, S', 'Ingber, R', 'Overbaugh, J']","['Linenberger ML', 'Rohn JL', 'Deng T', 'Ellis-Smith S', 'Ingber R', 'Overbaugh J']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA. linen@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cat Diseases/pathology/*virology', 'Cats', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Hydrocortisone/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology', '*Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Receptor, Notch2', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*analysis', 'Retroviridae Infections/pathology/*veterinary/virology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/pathology/*veterinary/virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Virus Infections/pathology/*veterinary/virology']",1999/10/03 00:00,1999/10/03 00:01,['1999/10/03 00:00'],"['1999/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1999 Sep 20;70(3-4):223-43. doi: 10.1016/s0165-2427(99)00075-6.,,,"['S0165-2427(99)00075-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-2427(99)00075-6 [doi]']","['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptor, Notch2)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']","['CA51080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK49888/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Northern blot analysis demonstrated approximately 3-fold higher FPGS mRNA expression in K562 cells than that in MOLT-3 cells, being consistent with graded polyglutamation capacities of these cell lines. A slight increase in the expression of the FPGS gene was observed in the TMQ-resistant MOLT-3 cells (MOLT-3/TMQ800); moreover, sequential development of MTX resistance in the TMQ-resistant cells (MOLT-3/TMQ800-MTX10,000) resulted in a further enhancement of FPGS mRNA expression despite of decreased polyglutamation capacity in this subline. Another MTX-resistant subline with impaired reduced folate carrier (MOLT-3/MTX10,000) also showed overexpression of FPGS mRNA. Conversely, both raltitrexed-resistant sublines (MOLT-3/ZD1694 x C and K562/ZD1694 x C) displayed a moderately decreased expression of FPGS mRNA. These findings did not correspond to the virtual absence of ZD1694 polyglutamates inside the former cells nor to possibly intact polyglutamation capacity in the latter cells. These results indicate that FPGS mRNA expression may predict cellular ability to produce polyglutamate metabolites of antifolate drugs in the sensitive cells, but does not necessarily reflect FPGS function at the enzyme level in the antifolate-resistant tumor cells.","['Takemura, Y', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Miyachi, H']","['Takemura Y', 'Kobayashi H', 'Miyachi H']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan. takemura@bcm.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,IM,"['Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Peptide Synthases/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/03 00:00,1999/10/03 00:01,['1999/10/03 00:00'],"['1999/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1999 Aug;10(7):677-83. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199908000-00008.,,,['10.1097/00001813-199908000-00008 [doi]'],"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Utilizing a panel of thirty monoclonal antibodies, canine leukemias were assessed by flow cytometry alone or by flow cytometry in combination with immunocytochemical staining of smears. Canine chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) occurred in older dogs (mean age 9.75 years; range 1.5-15 years; n = 73 cases). Blood lymphocyte counts ranged from 15,000 to 1,600,000/microl. Surprisingly, 73% of CLL cases involved proliferation of T lymphocytes (CD3+), and 54% of CLL cases had large granular lymphocyte (LGL) morphology. LGL CLL's were almost exclusively proliferation's of T cells that expressed CD8 and the leukointegrin alphaDbeta2 and more frequently expressed T cell receptor (TCR) alphabeta (69%) than TCRgammadelta (31%). The non-LGL T cell CLL cases (19% of CLL) involved proliferation of TCRalphabeta T cells in which no consistent pattern of CD4 or CD8 expression was found. B cell CLL, based on expression of CD2 or CD79a, comprised 26% of canine CLL cases. These results are in marked contrast to people where greater than 95% of CLL cases involve proliferation of B lymphocytes. Thirty eight (38) acute leukemias were also immunophenotyped. The majority (55%) of these leukemias had a phenotype most consistent with a myeloid origin. Acute LGL leukemias were also observed (7/38), although less commonly than the CLL counterpart. CD34 expression was common in acute, non-LGL leukemias of dogs, both myeloid and lymphoid. In some circumstances, it can be difficult to differentiate a reactive (polyclonal) lymphoid proliferation from a neoplastic (monoclonal) one. Therefore, as an adjunct to phenotypic studies, we have developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based test for assessment of clonality in T cell proliferations. The test amplifies the junction of the variable gamma (Vgamma) and joining gamma (Jgamma) gene segments region of the TCR gamma genes. Preliminary data indicates that our test is effective and is capable of differentiating a neoplastic from a reactive lymphoproliferative process.","['Vernau, W', 'Moore, P F']","['Vernau W', 'Moore PF']","['Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis 95616, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,IM,"['Animals', 'Clone Cells', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Dog Diseases/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Dogs', 'Flow Cytometry/veterinary', 'Immunophenotyping/*veterinary', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/immunology/*veterinary', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/veterinary', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*veterinary', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics']",1999/10/03 00:00,1999/10/03 00:01,['1999/10/03 00:00'],"['1999/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1999 Aug 2;69(2-4):145-64. doi: 10.1016/s0165-2427(99)00051-3.,,,"['S0165-2427(99)00051-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-2427(99)00051-3 [doi]']","['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the DNA sequences of the resulting clones and the canine Vbeta gene sequences in the literature, seven distinct canine TCR Vbeta genes were identified. Vbeta specific PCR primers were designed for each of the seven TCR Vbeta genes such that under defined conditions, each primer could only amplify a specific TCR Vbeta gene in conjunction with the same 3' constant region (Cbeta) primer. By performing RT-PCR on RNA derived from a source containing T lymphocytes, the presence and expansion of T cells expressing a particular Vbeta gene could be detected. Moreover, the clonality or diversity of a T cell population under analysis could be easily determined by the VDJ junctional sequence of the amplified Vbeta PCR product, in the form of a ""DNA fingerprint"". These findings have been used to detect canine T cell lymphoma, and could potentially be used to monitor the remission of T cell malignancies in response to treatment.","['Dreitz, M J', 'Ogilvie, G', 'Sim, G K']","['Dreitz MJ', 'Ogilvie G', 'Sim GK']","['HESKA Corporation, Ft.

Cell lineages involved to a variable extent consist not only of neutrophil granulopoiesis, but include also megakaryocytes, erythroid precursors, resident macrophages and lymphocytes. Moreover, the stromal compartment, in particular reticulin and collagen fibers, plays a pivotal role in the disease process. Following morphometric analysis significant correlations may be calculated between histological parameters and clinical-laboratory findings. Relevant interactions are detectable between number of megakaryocytes and their precursors with fiber density. This findings is in line with the close functional relationships between megakaryopoiesis and fibroblasts regarding the complex pathomechanisms of myelofibrosis. Moreover, other correlations are observable between reduction of erythropoiesis or increase in fibers with clinical features like anemia, percentages of myelo- and erythroblasts in the peripheral blood, spleen size or LDH level. These variables are in keeping with more advanced stages of CML which indicate a transition to myeloid metaplasia and thus exert a significant impact on survival. Consequently, the different risk profiles of patients are determined by both clinical and morphological parameters of predictive value. Regarding the latter, extent of myelofibrosis, amount of erythroid precursors and numbers of myeloerythroblasts in the peripheral blood are significantly associated with prognosis. For this reason, it should be mandatory to enter morphological criteria into prospective clinical trials on CML, not only for diagnostic purpose, but also for a proper evaluation of different survival patterns.","['Thiele, J', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Fischer, R']","['Thiele J', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Fischer R']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany. j.thiele@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Spain,Histol Histopathol,Histology and histopathology,8609357,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology']",1999/10/03 09:00,2000/03/11 09:00,['1999/10/03 09:00'],"['1999/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '1999/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Histol Histopathol. 1999 Oct;14(4):1241-56. doi: 10.14670/HH-14.1241.,,,['10.14670/HH-14.1241 [doi]'],,,,,129,['Histol Histopathol 2000 Jan;15(1):335'],,,10.14670/HH-14.1241 [doi],,,,,

The ploidy of rabbit megakaryocytes was analyzed by microspectrophotometry in 1964, and the analysis of the ploidy in human megakaryocytes was first performed in 1968. Presently, microphotometry and flow cytometry are the primary methods for the evaluation of the ploidy, but they have their merits and demerits. In the ploidy of human megakaryocytes, a peak has often been reported at 16N in healthy individuals, and the next peaks have been observed at 32N and 8N. The results of ploidy analyses have been reported by many investigators to be comparable between patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and normal subjects, but various shifts of the peaks have also been documented. The ploidy is often reported to shift to a larger ploidy class in polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, but it has invariably been reported to shift to a smaller class in chronic myelogenous leukemia. In reactive thrombocytosis, the ploidy pattern was reported to be the same as that in normal individuals by some investigators but to shift to a larger ploidy by others. These differences are considered to be due to heterogeneity of the subjects. In myelodysplastic syndrome, the ploidy shifts mostly to a smaller class, but it may show various patterns. We also reviewed the ploidy in other rare hematological disorders, the relationships of the ploidy with diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic disorders, and its changes in the ontogeny. Details of the mechanism of polyploidization and its biological significance remain unknown, and further advances in the studies of these topics are anticipated.","['Kobayashi, Y', 'Kondo, M']","['Kobayashi Y', 'Kondo M']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan. kobataka@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Spain,Histol Histopathol,Histology and histopathology,8609357,IM,"['Animals', 'Hematologic Diseases/genetics', 'Humans', '*Megakaryocytes', '*Ploidies', 'Rabbits']",1999/10/03 00:00,1999/10/03 00:01,['1999/10/03 00:00'],"['1999/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Histol Histopathol. 1999 Oct;14(4):1223-9. doi: 10.14670/HH-14.1223.,,,['10.14670/HH-14.1223 [doi]'],,,,,79,,,,10.14670/HH-14.1223 [doi],,,,,

One of the genes encoding the alpha subunit, AML1/PEBP2 alpha B, was identified at the breakpoints of various chromosome translocations, including t(8;21) and t(12;21) associated with acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, respectively. The gene encoding the beta subunit (PEBP2 beta/CBFB) was also shown to be the target of the inversion of chromosome 16, another chromosomal anomaly associated with acute myeloid leukemia. Targeted disruption of either the Aml1/Pebp2 alpha B or Pebp2 beta/Cbfb gene resulted in strikingly similar phenotypes such as lack of definitive hematopoiesis of the fetal liver and accompanying hemorrhage of the central nervous system. These observations suggest that both alpha and beta subunits of PEBP2 are indispensable for its in vivo function. However, the heterodimerization of the alpha and beta subunit does not seem to occur readily suggesting that their capacity to associate might be an important rate limiting step in PEBP2 site-dependent transcription regulation.

METHODS: Fifteen patients were treated with a 96-hour continuous infusion of etoposide, vincristine, doxorubicin, bolus cyclophosphamide, and oral prednisone, followed by granulocyte-colony stimulating factor support and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis. The median age of the patients was 53 years (range, 17-82 years). Six patients had Sezary syndrome (SS), four patients had visceral involvement, and four patients had anaplastic large cell morphology, three with Ki-1 (CD30) positivity. All patients had disease that was refractory to prior chemotherapy or electron beam irradiation and eight of these patients had received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. Seven patients had received prior interferon therapy and nine patients had received fludarabine and/or 2-CDA. RESULTS: After a median of 5 cycles (range, 1-9 cycles), 4 patients achieved a complete response (27%) and 8 patients achieved a partial response (53%) for an overall response rate of 80% (95% confidence interval, 52-96%). Three patients with visceral involvement, two of three patients with anaplastic large cell morphology, and one patient with human T-cell lymphoma virus leukemia/lymphoma did not respond. All 12 responders had improvement in skin disease; 2 of 6 patients with SS had complete disappearance of circulating Sezary cells. The median progression free survival was 8.0 months (range, 3-22 months). After a median follow-up of 11.4 months (range, 2-56+ months), the median patient survival was 13.5 months. Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity occurred in 8 patients (61%); 5 of these 8 patients had febrile neutropenia. Six patients developed staphylococcal bacteremia, two patients had disseminated herpes infection, and one patient had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Grade 3 neurotoxicity occurred in one patient. Two patients had a significant decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction and one patient had supraventricular tachycardia.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study of sexual health and infertility was conducted in 479 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR) who were entered into the UK MRC AML 10 trial comparing allogeneic BMT (Allo-BMT), autologous BMT (A-BMT), and intensive consolidation chemotherapy (CCT). Assessment was made by patient questionnaire via the treating centers for completion and returned directly to the coordinating center. RESULTS: Both Allo-BMT and A-BMT were observed to have severe, highly significant adverse effects on the patients' sexual health. Significantly more BMT patients than CCT patients reported a decrease in interest in sex (48% vs. 24%), sexual activity (53% vs. 35%), pleasure from sex (36% vs. 18%), and ability to have sex (38% vs. 18%) (P < 0.001 in each case). Hormonal disorders and infertility also were more common in BMT patients than in CCT patients. These differences were more apparent in women and remained after adjustment for age.

New therapies generally are first tested in the salvage setting prior to incorporation into frontline regimens. Defining the prognosis at relapse (or at failure of induction) and subsequently predicting outcome would be useful to select the population in whom to test new strategies, rather than attempting traditional reinduction therapy. METHODS: Between March 1980 and March 1997, 314 eligible adults with primary refractory (24%) or primary relapsed (76%) ALL were treated with various chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation (SCT) regimens. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess biologic factors and disease history in relation to survival. RESULTS: A complete remission (CR) was achieved in 97 patients (31%), 21% died prior to a response, and 49% were refractory to salvage therapy. Of the 76 patients refractory to induction therapy for their de novo ALL, 26 patients (34%) achieved a CR with salvage therapy. The median overall CR duration was 6 months. The median overall survival was 5 months; 24% of the patients were alive at 1 year, and the projected survival at 5 years was 3%. Nineteen patients were alive at the time of last follow-up, 10 with 6 weeks to 10 years of continuous CR from the time of their first salvage therapy. SCT consolidation in second CR was performed in 25% of patients; 28% of those who received allogeneic SCT remain in continuous CR at 4 months, 2(1/2) years, 3(1/2) years, and 10 years, whereas all 8 who received autologous SCT have relapsed. Favorable factors for longer survival by multivariate analysis were age <40 years, absence of circulating blasts, and first CR duration longer than 1 year. Patients were stratified into 4 risk groups: Group 1, with no unfavorable features or only short initial CR duration; Group 2, with only increased age or peripheral blasts; Group 3, with any 2 unfavorable features; and Group 4, with all 3 unfavorable features. The median survival times for each group were 11, 6, 4, and 2 months, respectively; 1-year survival rates were 44%, 25%, 12%, and 9%, respectively (P < 0.01). The resulting model was also predictive for CR rates; the corresponding CR rates were 47%, 35%, 14%, and 9%, respectively (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Salvage therapy for adult ALL patients continues to yield poor results, but it is an area of research where it may be possible to discover new agents or strategies to be incorporated into frontline therapy. The prognostic model derived will be utilized prospectively to select patients for new therapeutic strategies involving such novel agents as liposomal compounds, purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies.","['Thomas, D A', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Smith, T L', 'Koller, C', 'Cortes, J', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Giles, F J', 'Gajewski, J', 'Pierce, S', 'Keating, M J']","['Thomas DA', 'Kantarjian H', 'Smith TL', 'Koller C', 'Cortes J', ""O'Brien S"", 'Giles FJ', 'Gajewski J', 'Pierce S', 'Keating MJ']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

A new preparation of L-asparaginase, polyethylene-glycol conjugated (PEG)-asparaginase, is a pharmacologically different formulation of L-asparaginase with distinct properties including a longer half-life and less immunogenic properties. METHODS: Patients with refractory or recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were treated with a combination of methotrexate (MTX), vincristine, PEG-asparaginase, and prednisone (MOAP). The treatment was comprised of MTX, 100 mg/m(2) intravenously (i.v.), over 15 minutes on Days 1 and 14; PEG-asparaginase, 2500 IU/m(2), with a maximum dose of 3750 IU i.v. approximately 4-6 hours after MTX on Days 1 and 14; vincristine, 1.4 mg/m(2) (maximum dose, 2 mg) i.v., over 15 minutes on Days 1, 7, and 14; and prednisone, 200 mg daily orally, on Days 1-5 and 14-19. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with a median age of 34 years (range, 20-74 years) were treated. Eight patients (25%) had ALL that was refractory to prior therapy and 24 patients (75%) had recurrent disease. Seven patients (22%) achieved a complete remission (CR). Five patients (16%) died early due to infections. Features associated with a poor response were high pretreatment lactate dehydrogenase levels and Philadelphia chromosome positive disease. The median duration of CR was 16 weeks and the overall median survival after MOAP therapy was 12 weeks. Anaphylactic reactions were not observed during MOAP combination therapy. CONCLUSIONS: MOAP is an active regimen in patients with refractory or recurrent ALL. This regimen is well tolerated and is not associated with allergic reactions. However, further studies regarding the pharmacologic interaction of MTX with PEG-asparaginase are needed to optimize this regimen.","['Aguayo, A', 'Cortes, J', 'Thomas, D', 'Pierce, S', 'Keating, M', 'Kantarjian, H']","['Aguayo A', 'Cortes J', 'Thomas D', 'Pierce S', 'Keating M', 'Kantarjian H']","['The Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, M.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1980 and 1998, 1,132 patients were prospectively enrolled onto the German nontesticular GCT studies. A total of 442 patients received chemotherapy using combinations of the drugs cisplatin, ifosfamide, etoposide, vinblastine, and bleomycin, and 174 patients were treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Median follow-up duration was 38 months (range, 6 to 199 months). RESULTS: Six patients developed therapy-related acute myelogenous leukemia (t-AML). There was no t-AML among patients treated with surgery (n = 392) or radiotherapy only (n = 124). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative incidence (at 10 years) of t-AML were 1.0% for patients treated with chemotherapy (three of 442) and 4.2% for patients treated with combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy (three of 174). Notably, four of these six patients had been treated according to a standard protocol with modest cumulative chemotherapy doses. Five patients had received less than 2 g/m(2) epipodophyllotoxins, and four patients had received less than 20 g/m(2) ifosfamide. Four patients presented with AML, two with myelodysplasia in transformation to AML. In five patients, cytogenetic aberrations were found, four of which were considered characteristic for t-AML. Four patients died despite antileukemic therapy. One patient is alive but suffered a relapse of his GCT, and one patient is alive and well. No secondary solid neoplasm was observed. CONCLUSION: In patients with AML after treatment for GCT, several pathogenetic mechanisms must be considered. AML might evolve from a malignant transformation of GCT components without any influence of the chemotherapy. On the other hand, the use of alkylators and topoisomerase II inhibitors is associated with an increased risk of t-AML. Future studies will show if the reduction of treatment intensity in the current protocol reduces the risk of secondary leukemia in these patients.","['Schneider, D T', 'Hilgenfeld, E', 'Schwabe, D', 'Behnisch, W', 'Zoubek, A', 'Wessalowski, R', 'Gobel, U']","['Schneider DT', 'Hilgenfeld E', 'Schwabe D', 'Behnisch W', 'Zoubek A', 'Wessalowski R', 'Gobel U']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Heinrich-Heine-University Dusseldorf, Medical Center, Dusseldorf, Germany. dominik.schneider@uni-duesseldorf.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Germinoma/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced', 'Risk Factors', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1999/10/03 00:00,1999/10/03 00:01,['1999/10/03 00:00'],"['1999/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 Oct;17(10):3226-33. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.10.3226.,,,['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.10.3226 [doi]'],"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell death, reactive gliosis, and axonal sprouting are among the best studied alterations in the epileptic brain. Previous work in both the peripheral and the central nervous systems suggests that cytokines are capable of affecting each of these processes. To better understand the role of cytokines in seizures and their sequelae, we have characterized cytokine expression in an animal model of epilepsy. Using pilocarpine to chemically induce seizures, and RNase protection assays to assess mRNA levels, we have quantified changes in expression of several members of the neuropoietic cytokine family following a single, prolonged seizure. Levels of oncostatin M (OSM), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cardiotrophin-1, and ciliary neurotrophic factor were all increased in the hippocampus after seizure, though to differing extents and with markedly different time courses. Cells expressing the most dramatically up-regulated cytokines, LIF and OSM, were identified by combined in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The majority of LIF(+) cells in the hippocampus were glial fibrillary acidic protein(+) astrocytes, while the majority of OSM(+) cells had the morphology of interneurons and were occasionally colabeled with neurofilament markers. Both the time course and the localization of cytokine up-regulation following seizure suggest possible roles for these intercellular signaling molecules in epilepsy.","['Jankowsky, J L', 'Patterson, P H']","['Jankowsky JL', 'Patterson PH']","['Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, 91125, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Neurol,Experimental neurology,0370712,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Death', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/genetics', 'Cytokines/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*immunology', 'Gliosis', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics', 'Hippocampus/drug effects/*immunology/pathology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics', 'Male', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/genetics', 'Pilocarpine/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reference Values', 'Seizures/chemically induced/*immunology/pathology', 'Status Epilepticus/chemically induced/*immunology/pathology', 'Time Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1999/10/03 00:00,1999/10/03 00:01,['1999/10/03 00:00'],"['1999/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Neurol. 1999 Oct;159(2):333-46. doi: 10.1006/exnr.1999.7137.,,,"['10.1006/exnr.1999.7137 [doi]', 'S0014-4886(99)97137-6 [pii]']","['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '01MI4Q9DI3 (Pilocarpine)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)']","['5 T32 GM 07737/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 20916/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Hoechst 33342 induces apoptosis in BC3H-1 myocytes and hepatoma cells. OBJECTIVE: To determine if Hoechst 33342 or Hoechst 33258 induces apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) and inhibits topoisomerase I activity. DESIGN: A variety of methods were used to detect apoptosis: cell viability (trypan blue exclusion), nuclear fluorescence staining (Hoechst 33342 or Hoechst 33258 stained for 10 minutes), flow cytometric quantitation of annexin binding to phosphatidylserine, and DNA fragmentation (agarose gel electrophoresis). Topoisomerase I activity was determined by a plasmid unwinding assay. SETTING: A large teaching hospital and research laboratories. PATIENTS: None. INTERVENTION: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Apoptosis is characterized by decreased cell viability, condensation of nuclear chromatin, increased phosphatidylserine translocation, and DNA fragmentation into oligonucleosomes composed of multiples of 180 to 200 base pairs. Inhibition of endogenous nuclear topoisomerase I is detected by the absence of plasmid unwinding from a tightly coiled to relaxed form. RESULTS: Hoechst 33342, but not Hoechst 33258, induced apoptosis in the HL-60 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Endogenous nuclear topoisomerase I activity in HL-60 cells was inhibited by treatment with Hoechst 33342 but not Hoechst 33258. CONCLUSION: Hoechst 33342-induced HL-60 cell apoptosis may be related to the dye's inhibition of topoisomerase I activity.","['Zhang, X', 'Chen, J', 'Davis, B', 'Kiechle, F']","['Zhang X', 'Chen J', 'Davis B', 'Kiechle F']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, Mich. 48073-6769, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzimidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Bisbenzimidazole/pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/pathology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Plasmids/drug effects', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors']",1999/10/03 00:00,1999/10/03 00:01,['1999/10/03 00:00'],"['1999/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 1999 Oct;123(10):921-7. doi: 10.5858/1999-123-0921-HIAIHC.,,['Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2000 Jun;124(6):802-5.

We previously showed that a recombinant IL-3 fusion immunotoxin (DT(390)IL-3) expressed by splicing the murine IL-3 gene to a truncated diphtheria toxin (DT(390)) gene selectively killed IL-3R(+) expressing cells and was not uniformly toxic to uncommitted BM progenitor cells (Chan,C.-H., Blazar,B.R., Greenfield,L., Kreitman,R.J. and Vallera,D.A., 1996, Blood, 88, 1445-1456). Thus, we explored the feasibility of using DT(390)IL-3 as an anti-leukemia agent. DT(390)IL-3 was toxic when administered to mice at doses as low as 0.1 microg/day. The dose limiting toxicity appeared to be related to platelet and bleeding effects of the fusion toxin. Because of these effects, DT(390)IL-3 was studied ex vivo as a means of purging contaminating leukemia cells from BM grafts in a murine autologous BM transplantation. In this setting, as few as 1000 IL-3R-expressing, bcr/abl transformed myeloid 32Dp210 leukemia cells were lethal. An optimal purging interval of 10 nM/l for 8 h eliminated leukemia cells from 32Dp210/BM mixtures given to lethally irradiated (8 Gy) C3H/HeJ syngeneic mice. Mice given treated grafts containing BM and a lethal dose of 32Dp210 cells survived over 100 days while mice given untreated grafts did not survive (P < 0.00001). DT(390)IL-3 may prove highly useful for ex vivo purging of lethal malignant leukemia cells from autologous BM grafts.","['Vallera, D A', 'Seo, S Y', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari, A', 'Griffin, J D', 'Blazar, B R']","['Vallera DA', 'Seo SY', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari A', 'Griffin JD', 'Blazar BR']","['University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Department of Therapeutic Radiology (Section on Experimental Cancer Immunology) Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Protein Eng,Protein engineering,8801484,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Diphtheria Toxin/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hemorrhage/chemically induced', 'Immunotoxins/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-3/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/adverse effects/genetics/*therapeutic use']",1999/10/03 00:00,1999/10/03 00:01,['1999/10/03 00:00'],"['1999/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Protein Eng. 1999 Sep;12(9):779-85. doi: 10.1093/protein/12.9.779.,,,['10.1093/protein/12.9.779 [doi]'],"['0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']","['R01-CA36725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA72669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the high doses required to produce effective gene transfer in vivo can also cause unwanted cellular toxicity. To improve replication-deficient adenovirus transgene expression while minimizing adverse reactions, we have tested polycationic compounds for their ability to enhance adenovirus adsorption. We demonstrate increased transgene expression after mixing adenovirus preparations with polycations, cationic lipids, and CaCl2 prior to transduction in vitro. An E1-deleted adenovirus vector was admixed with various polycations, and beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) activity was evaluated. The optimal polycation concentrations for augmenting adenovirus-mediated gene transfer were 5-10 microg/mL polybrene, 400 microg/mL protamine sulfate, 10 microg/mL N-(1-[2,3-dioleoyloxy]propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (DOTAP), 2.5 microg/mL Lipofectamine, and 62.5 mM CaCl2. Polycations enhanced beta-gal expression in three of six established cell lines. Similar results were obtained using primary tumor cell cultures, where beta-gal expression was increased 1.5- to 10.7-fold (mean = 3.6) by polybrene, 1.8- to 7.5-fold (mean = 3.4) by DOTAP, and 2.3- to 10.4-fold (mean = 4.8) by protamine sulfate.

Few investigations into the regulation of CD38 expression by physiologic stimuli have been reported. As the CD38 promoter contains potential binding sites for interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), we investigated the influence of IFN type I (alpha and beta) and type II (gamma) on CD38 gene expression of leukemic B cells. Using the IFN-responsive B cell line Eskol, we found by RT-PCR analysis a rapid time-dependent induction in CD38 mRNA (starting at 6 h) with each type of IFN. This induction was independent of protein synthesis, suggesting that CD38 gene activation does not require IRF-1 but is merely under direct transcriptional regulation by latent IFN-inducible factors. mRNA stimulation was followed within 24 h by induction of membrane CD38, which coincided with rises of CD38-specific ectoenzymatic activities, that is, NAD+ glycohydrolase, (A/G)DP-ribosyl cyclase, and cyclic ADP ribose hydrolase activities. IFN failed to induce or upregulate the other CD38-related ectoenzymes analyzed, that is, CD39, CD73, CD157, and PC-1. Similarly, treatment of leukemic cells of patients with B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) with IFN resulted in an increase in CD38 mRNA mirrored by plasma membrane upregulation of CD38 and NAD+ glycohydrolase activity. Further investigation in relation to CD38 gene activation and B-CLL behavior remains to be defined.","['Bauvois, B', 'Durant, L', 'Laboureau, J', 'Barthelemy, E', 'Rouillard, D', 'Boulla, G', 'Deterre, P']","['Bauvois B', 'Durant L', 'Laboureau J', 'Barthelemy E', 'Rouillard D', 'Boulla G', 'Deterre P']","['Unite 365 INSERM, Institut Curie, Paris, France. bbauvois@curie.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/*genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1999/10/03 00:00,1999/10/03 00:01,['1999/10/03 00:00'],"['1999/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999 Sep;19(9):1059-66. doi: 10.1089/107999099313299.,,,['10.1089/107999099313299 [doi]'],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we characterized a lentiviral vector system consisting of a packaging vector (pHP) and a transducing vector (pTV) derived from a recombinant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). In pHP, the long terminal repeats (LTRs), the 5' untranslated leader and portions of the env and nef genes were deleted. The leader sequence of pHP was substituted with a modified Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) 59 bp leader containing a mutated RSV gag AUG and a functional 5' splice site. The pHP construct was found to direct Gag-Pol synthesis as efficiently as wild-type HIV-1. The pTV construct contains sequences required for RNA packaging, reverse transcription and integration, but lacks viral genes. Co-transfection of pHP, pTV and a vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) envelope plasmid produced vectors at titers of 10(5)-10(6) transducing units per milliliter in 48 h. Replication-competent virus (RCV) was not detected when deletions were made in the env gene in pHP. The ability of this vector system to transduce dividing and nondividing cell in vitro and in vivo was also demonstrated. Compared with a Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) vector, the HP/TV vectors transduced human muscle-, kidney-, liver-derived cell lines and CD34+ primary hematopoietic progenitor cells more efficiently. Although the levels of the pTV transgene expression were high soon after transduction, the expression tended to decrease with time due either to the loss of proviral DNA or to the inactivation of promoter activity, which was found to be cell type-dependent. Analyses of extrachromosomal DNA showed that the unintegrated proviral DNA of lentiviral vectors survived much longer than that of the retroviral vectors. We demonstrate that the HP/TV vector is capable of high efficiency transduction and that long-term expression of lentiviral vectors is dependent on target cell type, the internal promoter and the transgene itself in the transducing vector.","['Chang, L J', 'Urlacher, V', 'Iwakuma, T', 'Cui, Y', 'Zucali, J']","['Chang LJ', 'Urlacher V', 'Iwakuma T', 'Cui Y', 'Zucali J']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of Florida Brain Institute, Gainesville, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/administration & dosage/*genetics', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Engineering', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/03 00:00,1999/10/03 00:01,['1999/10/03 00:00'],"['1999/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 1999 May;6(5):715-28. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3300895.,,,['10.1038/sj.gt.3300895 [doi]'],,['HL-59412/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed the case histories of 91 patients treated at our institution from 1981 to 1998 with primary mediastinal nonseminomatous germ cell tumors to evaluate variables that may influence survival after surgery. METHODS: Twelve of the 91 patients did not undergo postchemotherapy resection because of progressive disease. Seventy-nine of them underwent 82 thoracic surgical procedures and are the basis of this review. The majority (71/75) had elevated serum tumor markers, 75% (n = 50) of which returned to normal levels after first- or second-line chemotherapy. RESULTS: There were 3 operative deaths and 1 late death, attributed to pulmonary complications. Twenty-four patients died of recurrent disease and 3 of leukemia, for an overall survival of 61% after an average follow-up of 48 months. The pathologic findings of complete tumor necrosis (n = 19) and benign teratoma (n = 28) in the surgical specimen predicted excellent and good long-term survival, respectively, which was statistically better than that of patients having persistent nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (n = 24) or carcinomatous/sarcomatous degeneration (n = 8). CONCLUSIONS: Primary nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of the mediastinum can be cured with a multimodality therapy, particularly in the subset of patients with postchemotherapy pathologic findings of tumor necrosis and teratoma. Survival is poor but possible in patients with unfavorable pathologic findings after chemotherapy, currently justifying an aggressive surgical approach in patients with otherwise operable disease.","['Kesler, K A', 'Rieger, K M', 'Ganjoo, K N', 'Sharma, M', 'Fineberg, N S', 'Einhorn, L H', 'Brown, J W']","['Kesler KA', 'Rieger KM', 'Ganjoo KN', 'Sharma M', 'Fineberg NS', 'Einhorn LH', 'Brown JW']","['Indiana University School of Medicine, Department of Surgery, Thoracic Division, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. kkesler@iupui.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,0376343,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Carcinoma/pathology', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Child', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Germinoma/drug therapy/*pathology/surgery', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology/surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Necrosis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoma/pathology', 'Survival Rate', 'Teratoma/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/10/03 00:00,1999/10/03 00:01,['1999/10/03 00:00'],"['1999/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 1999 Oct;118(4):692-700. doi: 10.1016/S0022-5223(99)70015-2.,,,"['S0022-5223(99)70015-2 [pii]', '10.1016/S0022-5223(99)70015-2 [doi]']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are several reports that some hematological malignancies, such as T/NK cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma (MM) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), express this molecule. In B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), however, very limited number of cases have been reported to express CD56 molecule. Although one study has recently described that half of microvillous B cell lymphoma (MVL), an uncommon subset of large cell lymphoma, expressed CD56, there have been no reports about most common type of B-NHL, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBL) other than a mention of weak CD56 expression in one of 83 DLBL. We herein presented the first case of diffuse large B cell lymphoma expressing CD56 clearly. The immunophenotype determined by immunostaining and flow cytometric analysis was CD10+, CD19+, CD20+, CD45RO-, CD3- and CD56+. On immunohistochemical study, neither bcl-2 nor TIA-1 was positive for tumor cell. Monoclonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement was detected, and the sequence analysis of the variable region of IgH (VH) suggested that this tumor was derived from antigen selected post germinal center B cell.

A 71-year-old female was diagnosed as having acute myelogenous leukemia and treated with chemotherapy. During her course, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was noted in blood culture and she was diagnosed as having MRSA sepsis. She died of respiratory failure 5 months after the onset of leukemia and 10 days after the MRSA sepsis. Ante-mortem liver function tests were within normal ranges. At autopsy, myeloblastic leukemia cells positive for CD13 were present in the bone marrow and, to a much lesser extent, in the spleen and liver. Numerous histiocytes of a bland appearance with erythrophagocytosis were noted in the bone marrow and spleen. The histiocytes were positive for CD68, but negative for S-100 and lysozymes. In the liver, many histiocytes of bland appearance with erythrophagocytosis and CD68 positivity were present in the portal tracts with no Kupffer cell hyperplasia. There were no hepatocellular degeneration, fatty changes or sinusoidal dilations. We consider that this histiocytosis was associated with MRSA infection and diagnosed this as infection-associated hemophagocytic syndrome. In previously reported cases, hemophagocytosis in hyperplastic Kupffer cells was the main liver change of reactive hemophagocytic syndrome. The present case suggests that marked histiocytosis in portal tracts only may be a main feature of liver changes in reactive hemophagocytic syndrome and that such cases may not show abnormal liver function tests.","['Terada, T', 'Maeta, H', 'Endo, K', 'Horie, S', 'Matsunaga, Y', 'Ohta, T']","['Terada T', 'Maeta H', 'Endo K', 'Horie S', 'Matsunaga Y', 'Ohta T']","['Second Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Tottori University, Yonago, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'CD13 Antigens/analysis', 'Female', 'Histiocytosis, Non-Langerhans-Cell/complications/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/pathology', 'Liver Diseases/complications/metabolism/*pathology', 'Portal System/*pathology', 'Sepsis/complications/pathology']",1999/10/03 00:00,1999/10/03 00:01,['1999/10/03 00:00'],"['1999/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathol Int. 1999 Jul;49(7):672-5. doi: 10.1046/j.1440-1827.1999.00917.x.,,,"['pin917 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1440-1827.1999.00917.x [doi]']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We immunohistochemically evaluated the density of macrophages in bone marrow trephine biopsies. In reactive erythroid hyperplasia (hemolytic anemia and megaloblastic anemia), the macrophages slightly increased in density, extending their cytoplasmic processes between hematopoietic cells. In erythroid hypoplasia (pure red cell aplasia), they became rounded and frequently had hemosiderin granules. There was no significant difference in the macrophage density in the hematopoietic area between erythroid hyperplasia and hypoplasia. The macrophages increased in density in myeloproliferative disorders (polycythemia vera, chronic myelogenous leukemia and primary thrombocythemia). In myelofibrosis, some macrophages became extremely elongated along the line of the fibroblastic cells. In contrast, in conditions in which myelopoietic activity is considerably impaired (aplastic anemia, acute leukemia and multiple myeloma), they significantly decreased in density.

While most mantle cell lymphoma cases (11/13) showed germline or low frequency of somatic mutation, all cases of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma (11/11), follicular lymphoma (three of three cases), plasma cell myeloma (seven of seven cases) and most cases of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL; 42/47) belonged to the latter group. These 76 cases, therefore, may be considered to show somatic hypermutation. More than half of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma cases (CLL/SLL; eight of 13) showed a hypermutated VH gene and the ratio of replacement mutation: silent mutation in CDR2 of CLL/SLL was considerably higher compared with DLBCL and MALT lymphoma, showing somatic hypermutation. When comparing VH gene type of B cell-CLL (B-CLL) among our series and those in the literature, more cases of CD5+ B-CLL in the Western literature have the VH5 and VH6 family types, while more cases in Japan are reported to have VH4 family.

IL-11 acts on cells expressing gp130 and the IL-11 receptor (IL-11R) alpha-subunit (IL-11Ralpha). The structural epitopes of IL-11 required for the recruitment of the individual receptor subunits have not yet been defined. Based on the structure of CNTF, a three-dimensional model of human IL-11 was built. Using this model, 10 surface exposed amino acid residues of IL-11 were selected for mutagenesis using analogies to the well-characterized receptor recruitment sites of IL-6, CNTF, and LIF. The respective mutants of human IL-11 were expressed as soluble fusion proteins in bacteria. Their biological activities were determined on HepG2 and Ba/F3-130-11alpha cells. Several mutants with substantially decreased bioactivity and one hyperagonistic mutant were identified and further analyzed with regard to recruitment of IL-11Ralpha and gp130. The low-activity mutant I171D still binds IL-11Ralpha but fails to recruit gp130, whereas the hyperagonistic variant R135E more efficiently engages the IL-11R subunits. The low-activity mutants R190E and L194D failed to bind to IL-11Ralpha. These findings reveal a common mechanism of receptor recruitment in the family of IL-6-type cytokines and offer considerable perspectives for the rational design of IL-11 antagonists and hyperagonists.","['Tacken, I', 'Dahmen, H', 'Boisteau, O', 'Minvielle, S', 'Jacques, Y', 'Grotzinger, J', 'Kuster, A', 'Horsten, U', 'Blanc, C', 'Montero-Julian, F A', 'Heinrich, P C', 'Muller-Newen, G']","['Tacken I', 'Dahmen H', 'Boisteau O', 'Minvielle S', 'Jacques Y', 'Grotzinger J', 'Kuster A', 'Horsten U', 'Blanc C', 'Montero-Julian FA', 'Heinrich PC', 'Muller-Newen G']","['Institut fur Biochemie, Rheinisch-Westfalische Technische Hochschule Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Division', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/chemistry/*genetics', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', '*Lymphokines', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Thioredoxins/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/10/03 00:00,1999/10/03 00:01,['1999/10/03 00:00'],"['1999/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1999 Oct;265(2):645-55. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-1327.1999.00755.x.,,,"['ejb755 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-1327.1999.00755.x [doi]']","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its human counterpart encodes a product that interacts with the Tax viral oncoprotein of the human T cell leukaemia virus type 1. This interaction impedes the localisation of over-expressed Int-6 in nuclear bodies containing the promyelocytic leukaemia gene product (PML). In this study, Int-6 is characterised as a 52 kDa protein that is localised within nuclear bodies in primary lymphocytes. Screening of a human B cell cDNA library for proteins that interact with Int-6 led to isolation of four clones coding for the p110 subunit of eIF3, in accordance with previous detection of Int-6 in purified forms of this translation initiation factor. Another clone was interesting with respect to the subcellular localisation of Int-6. It encodes the Ret finger protein (Rfp) which interacts with PML and localises within a subset of PML nuclear bodies. The interaction of Rfp with Int-6 is mediated through a region in Rfp designated 'Rfp domain', distinct from that involved in the interaction with PML. Int-6 and Rfp are co-localised in certain PML nuclear bodies in lymphocytes and transfection studies in HeLa cells strongly suggest that Rfp triggers translocation of Int-6 to nuclear bodies.","['Morris-Desbois, C', 'Bochard, V', 'Reynaud, C', 'Jalinot, P']","['Morris-Desbois C', 'Bochard V', 'Reynaud C', 'Jalinot P']","[""Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, UMR 5665 CNRS-ENSL, Allee d'Italie, France. pjalinot@ens-lyon.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Nucleus/*chemistry/genetics', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-3', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Deletion', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transfection', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",1999/10/03 00:00,1999/10/03 00:01,['1999/10/03 00:00'],"['1999/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1999 Oct;112 ( Pt 19):3331-42.,,,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-3)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TRIM27 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Trim27 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The functions of ND10 have not been well defined, but they are sensitive to external stimuli such as stress and virus infection, and they are disrupted in malignant promyelocytic leukaemia cells. Herpes simplex virus type 1 regulatory protein Vmw110 induces the proteasome-dependent degradation of ND10 component proteins PML and Sp100, particularly the species of these proteins which are covalently conjugated to the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1. We have recently reported that Vmw110 also induces the degradation of centromere protein CENP-C with consequent disruption of centromere structure. These observations led us to examine whether there were hitherto undetected connections between ND10 and centromeres. In this paper we report that hDaxx and HP1 (which have been shown to interact with CENP-C and Sp100, respectively) are present in a proportion of both ND10 and interphase centromeres. Furthermore, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 induced an association between centromeres and ND10 proteins PML and Sp100 in a significant number of cells in the G(2) phase of the cell cycle. These results imply that there is a dynamic, cell cycle regulated connection between centromeres and ND10 proteins which can be stabilised by inhibition of proteasome-mediated proteolysis.","['Everett, R D', 'Earnshaw, W C', 'Pluta, A F', 'Sternsdorf, T', 'Ainsztein, A M', 'Carmena, M', 'Ruchaud, S', 'Hsu, W L', 'Orr, A']","['Everett RD', 'Earnshaw WC', 'Pluta AF', 'Sternsdorf T', 'Ainsztein AM', 'Carmena M', 'Ruchaud S', 'Hsu WL', 'Orr A']","['MRC Virology Unit, Church Street, Glasgow G11 5JR, Scotland UK. r.everett@vir.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', '*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Autoantigens/analysis/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Centromere/drug effects/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Chromobox Protein Homolog 5', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/analysis/metabolism', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Multienzyme Complexes/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Recombinant Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitins/analysis']",1999/10/03 00:00,1999/10/03 00:01,['1999/10/03 00:00'],"['1999/10/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/10/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/10/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1999 Oct;112 ( Pt 20):3443-54.,,,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '0 (centromere protein C)', '107283-02-3 (Chromobox Protein Homolog 5)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",['073915/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The hematotoxicity of benzene is related to the amount and duration of exposure. Most risk predictions for benzene exposures have been based on rubber workers who were exposed to high concentrations. In the petroleum industry, the concentration of benzene is relatively low, and there are disputes over the toxicity of low-level benzene because of a lack of evidence. In this paper we report the case of aplastic anemia induced by low-level benzene exposure.","['Baak, Y M', 'Ahn, B Y', 'Chang, H S', 'Kim, J H', 'Kim, K A', 'Lim, Y']","['Baak YM', 'Ahn BY', 'Chang HS', 'Kim JH', 'Kim KA', 'Lim Y']","[""Department of Industrial Medicine, St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*chemically induced', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Petroleum/*toxicity', 'Risk Assessment']",1999/09/30 00:00,1999/09/30 00:01,['1999/09/30 00:00'],"['1999/09/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1999 Oct;107(10):851-3. doi: 10.1289/ehp.99107851.,,,"['sc271_5_1835 [pii]', '10.1289/ehp.99107851 [doi]']","['0 (Petroleum)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",,,PMC1566621,,,,,,,,,,

This reaction may be more severe after transplantation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs). CASE REPORT: A 16-year-old boy underwent an allogeneic PBPC transplant from his HLA-mismatched mother as treatment for acute myeloblastic leukemia that had proved resistant to induction chemotherapy. Transfusion of the unmanipulated PBPCs proceeded without any complication, despite the difference in ABO blood group (donor, O Rh-positive; recipient, A Rh-positive). On Day 7, a rapid drop in hemoglobin to 4 g per dL was observed, which was attributed to a massive hemolysis. All the recipient's group A red cells were destroyed within 36 hours. This delayed and rapidly progressive hemolytic anemia was not associated with the transfusion of the donor's plasma. Rather, the anti-A titer increased in parallel with marrow recovery, which suggested an active synthesis of these antibodies by immunocompetent cells from the donor against the recipient's red cells. The mother's anti-A titer was retrospectively found to be 2048. Her unusually high titer is probably due to prior sensitization during pregnancies. On Day 12, the patient developed grade IV graft-versus-host disease, which proved resistant to all treatments instituted and led to his death on Day 35. CONCLUSION: PBPC transplantation with minor ABO incompatibility may be associated with significant risk of massive delayed hemolysis.","['Salmon, J P', 'Michaux, S', 'Hermanne, J P', 'Baudoux, E', 'Gerard, C', 'Sontag-Thull, D', 'Fillet, G', 'Beguin, Y']","['Salmon JP', 'Michaux S', 'Hermanne JP', 'Baudoux E', 'Gerard C', 'Sontag-Thull D', 'Fillet G', 'Beguin Y']","['Department of Medicine, Blood Transfusion Center, University of Liege, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['*ABO Blood-Group System', 'Adolescent', 'Blood Group Incompatibility/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hemolysis/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Male']",1999/09/30 00:00,1999/09/30 00:01,['1999/09/30 00:00'],"['1999/09/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 1999 Aug;39(8):824-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1999.39080824.x.,,,['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1999.39080824.x [doi]'],['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The modifying effects of pulverized Selaginella tamariscina on cell turnover in the stomach were also investigated in rats given 150 mg/kg of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) by gavage and then fed a diet containing 5, 1 or 0% Selaginella tamariscina. Fractions I-V showed significant tumoricidal effects against cultured human leukemia cells whereas these fractions did not affect normal human lymphocytes. Among the effective fractions, the water-extracted fraction (V) efficiently increased p53 gene expression and induced G1 arrest. The 1% Selaginella tamariscina feeding caused a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-(PCNA) labeling index of the glandular stomach epithelium as compared with the MNNG-alone group value although 5% Selaginella tamariscina feeding was only associated with a tendency for decrease.

Treatment of HL-60 cells with various concentrations of 2-AP (1-100 microM) for 7 days showed the induction of granulocytic differentiation following both morphological examination and NBT (nitroblue tetrazolium) testing (up to 40 and 52%, respectively). The expressions of bcl-2 and c-myc were down-regulated during granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells (up to 40%).

Effective prevention and management of mucositis will reduce the pain and suffering experienced during cancer treatment. Oropharyngeal pain in cancer patients frequently requires systemic analgesics, adjunctive medications, physical therapy, and psychologic therapy in addition to oral care and topical treatments. Good oral hygiene reduces the severity of oral mucositis and does not increase the risk of bacteremia. Current approaches to management include frequent oral rinsing with saline or bicarbonate rinses, maintaining excellent oral hygiene, and using topical anesthetics and analgesics. Cryotherapy is a potential adjunctive approach in some cases. There are a number of approaches that appear to represent viable candidates for further study. Biologic response modifiers offer the potential for prevention and for acceleration of healing. Various cytokines will enter clinical trials in the near future; these offer the potential for reduction of epithelial cell sensitivity to the toxic effects of cancer therapy or for stimulation of repair of the damaged tissue. Other approaches include the use of medications to reduce exposure of the oral mucosa to chemotherapeutic drugs that are secreted in saliva. Antimicrobial approaches have met with conflicting results, little effect being seen with chlorhexidine and systemic antimicrobials in the prevention of mucositis in radiation patients. In patients with BMT and patients with leukemia, chlorhexidine may not be effective in preventing mucositis, although there may be reduction in oral colonization by Candida. Initial studies of topical antimicrobials that affect the gram-negative oral flora have shown reductions in ulcerative mucositis during radiation therapy but have not been assessed in leukemia/BMT. Among other approaches that require further study are low-energy lasers and anti-inflammatory medications. These approaches to management have undergone initial study, but additional investigation is needed to determine their effectiveness with respect to the prevention of mucositis and symptom management and to determine appropriate doses and frequencies of intervention. Current studies and our increasing understanding of the pathogenesis of oral mucositis will lead to new approaches to management and improved quality of life for these patients.","['Epstein, J B', 'Schubert, M M']","['Epstein JB', 'Schubert MM']","['Vancouver Hospital, Dentistry Department, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod,"Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology, oral radiology, and endodontics",9508562,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cranial Irradiation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Mouth Mucosa/*pathology', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Stomatitis/*etiology/therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects']",1999/09/30 00:00,1999/09/30 00:01,['1999/09/30 00:00'],"['1999/09/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod. 1999 Sep;88(3):273-6. doi: 10.1016/s1079-2104(99)70026-0.,,,"['S1079-2104(99)70026-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s1079-2104(99)70026-0 [doi]']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,12,,,,,,,,,

Evidence for the release relies on an internal report of the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston, the authors of which postulated that it resulted from a fire in 1958 involving a B47 bomber standing on the runway. Their report contained a much publicised contour map of excess 235U levels estimated from the ratio of 235U to 238U in 26 evergreen leaf samples examined. The current concern of the inhabitants of Newbury centres mostly on the incidence of leukaemia, which was known beforehand to be slightly elevated in parts of West Berkshire, at least for young children. A number of cases have received considerable press publicity, with suggestions that their homes are located close to the base or the flight-path. The reports are, however, anecdotal and are not based on a complete register of cases. We have examined the evidence for this putative association by re-analysing the uranium data and determining the spatial relationship to the base of cases of childhood leukaemia diagnosed in the years 1966-87. We conclude that, although the excess uranium found has a non-random distribution, it does not support the pattern depicted by the contours and bears no relation to the incidence of childhood leukaemia for the period we examined. In any case, the increase in level of environmental radiation as a result of the putative release must be very small and is at variance with the reporting in some of the national press.","['Bithell, J F', 'Draper, G J']","['Bithell JF', 'Draper GJ']","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', '*Radioactive Hazard Release', 'Radioactive Pollutants/*adverse effects', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'Uranium/*adverse effects']",1999/09/30 00:00,1999/09/30 00:01,['1999/09/30 00:00'],"['1999/09/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 1999 Sep;19(3):253-9. doi: 10.1088/0952-4746/19/3/303.,,,['10.1088/0952-4746/19/3/303 [doi]'],"['0 (Radioactive Pollutants)', '4OC371KSTK (Uranium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Owing to the fact that the increase occurred six years after the start-up of the plant, radioactive discharges were suspected as being implicated in the development of the cases. Previous investigations have failed to identify any exposure which might be associated with the cluster. Nonetheless, concern regarding the increased tritium burden in the environment remains. To further assess the impact of tritium releases to the environment upon population cancer rates, the releases and leukaemia rates at the Savannah River site, USA, were compared with the Kruemmel site. Based on the data from 1991 to 1995, the incidence of childhood leukaemia in the vicinity of the Savannah River site was non-significantly less than expected compared with the significantly higher than expected rates close to the German plant. In contrast, tritium releases from the Savannah River site exceed those from the Kruemmel site by several orders of magnitude.

We have developed an automated, high-resolution analysis of PCR fragments to identify clonally rearranged TCR-gamma (TCR gamma) genes and IgH genes. Consensus primers are used to detect the majority of possible rearrangements in multiplex PCR assays, and the PCR products are fluorescently labelled for visualisation with ABI Genescan software. Polyclonal populations of lymphoid cells are represented by a spectrum of fragments, whereas a monoclonal population of cells is represented by one or two discrete bands, indicating rearrangement of one or both alleles. For TCR-gamma PCR, the rearranged DNA fragment from a monoclonal population of T-cells diluted to 0.1% in DNA from a polyclonal population of cells is still readily distinguishable from the polyclonal background. Similarly, for IgH PCR, the gene rearrangement from a monoclonal population of B-cells is still distinguishable to 0.5% in a polyclonal background. As this technique allows semi-quantitative resolution of fragments one base different in size, it is ideal for detecting monoclonal and oligoclonal populations of B- and T-cells. The accurate size determination of PCR fragments also minimises the risk of false positives resulting from contamination, as individual monoclonal rearrangements are frequently patient-specific on the basis of size alone.","['Ayling, J F', 'Iland, H J']","['Ayling JF', 'Iland HJ']","['Kanematsu Laboratories, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,IM,"['Clone Cells', 'Fluorescence', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sezary Syndrome/genetics']",1999/09/30 00:00,1999/09/30 00:01,['1999/09/30 00:00'],"['1999/09/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathology. 1999 Aug;31(3):252-6. doi: 10.1080/003130299105070.,,,['10.1080/003130299105070 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact that neither Rb1 nor BRCA2 appears to be inactivated in the majority of head-and-neck cancers suggests that novel tumor-suppressor genes are involved. We have used microsatellite repeat polymorphisms and PCR to detect several distinct minimal regions of deletion on 13q in supraglottic and oral squamous-cell carcinomas. One region maps to 13q34, the second to 13q14.3 and a potential third region, not reported in previous studies, maps to 13q12.1. Overall, 69% of the 145 tumors examined demonstrated allelic loss at one or more loci on 13q. We investigated whether a novel suppressor candidate mapping to 13q14. 3-q21, leukemia-associated gene 1, might also be involved in the progression of squamous-cell carcinomas. Multiplexed PCR revealed homozygous deletion of leu1 in one oral cavity tumor. This suggests that this gene or one nearby may be the actual target of deletions in this region of the chromosome arm.","['Gupta, V K', 'Schmidt, A P', 'Pashia, M E', 'Sunwoo, J B', 'Scholnick, S B']","['Gupta VK', 'Schmidt AP', 'Pashia ME', 'Sunwoo JB', 'Scholnick SB']","['Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['3-Isopropylmalate Dehydrogenase', 'Alcohol Oxidoreductases/genetics', 'Alleles', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*genetics', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1999/09/30 00:00,1999/09/30 00:01,['1999/09/30 00:00'],"['1999/09/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/30 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1999 Oct 22;84(5):453-7. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19991022)84:5<453::aid-ijc1>3.0.co;2-f.,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19991022)84:5<453::AID-IJC1>3.0.CO;2-F [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19991022)84:5<453::aid-ijc1>3.0.co;2-f [doi]']","['0 (DLEU1 lncRNA, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.85 (3-Isopropylmalate Dehydrogenase)']",['CA58743/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

One type of defective provirus contains internal deletions spanning gag, pol, and env genes but retains portions of open reading frames for trans-regulatory proteins. The deleted proviruses could potentially contribute to viral pathology by producing novel gene products that directly affect cell metabolism or that modulate expression of resident, wild-type proviruses. Virus gene products and the control of their expression were examined in cells transfected with defined molecular clones of wild-type and defective proviruses. Internally deleted provirus clones, which are unable to produce functional Tax and Rex proteins, were transcriptionally inactive in transfected cells. Ectopic expression of p40Tax activated transcription of the deleted provirus, resulting in the accumulation of a two-exon mRNA that yields a truncated form of Rex (p21Rex). Although this two-exon mRNA also has a potential initiation codon in the tax frame, a truncated form of Tax was not detected by immunoblotting or in transactivation assays. When complemented with p40Tax and p27Rex, cells transfected with deleted proviruses accumulated an unspliced mRNA that could potentially encode gag-pX fusion proteins.

In contrast to previous results, full-length viral DNA was synthesized in resting B lymphocytes, but in agreement with earlier reports, reverse transcription was abortive in resting T lymphocytes. The addition of exogenous nucleosides in the culture medium of resting T lymphocytes allowed reverse transcription to proceed in these cells, without inducing cell cycling.

In MCL, the high rate (12/32; 38%) of hemizygous deletions and especially a deletion pattern similar to B-CLL in four of the cases provide further evidence that a substantial proportion of MCL cases may share a common way of pathogenesis with B-CLL. In other B-cell NHL, the frequency of allelic loss affecting 13q14 was overall low. However, the finding of 13q14 microdeletions in seven cases without detectable alterations of chromosome 13 at G-banding analysis might indicate a possible involvement of this genetic region also for the lymphomagenesis of single cases of B-cell NHL other than B-CLL and MCL. In T-cell NHL, allelic loss at 13q14 was encountered in three of 13 peripheral T-NHL, NOS.

ACS2 is expressed in the brain and bone marrow and is highly conserved in man and rats. The resulting ETV6/ACS2 fusion transcripts showed an out-frame fusion of exon 1 of ETV6 to exon 1 of ACS2 in the AEL case, an out-frame fusion of exon 1 of ETV6 to exon 11 of ACS2 in the AML case, and a short in-frame fusion of ETV6 exon 1 to the 3' untranslated region of ACS2 in the RAEB case. Reciprocal ACS2/ETV6 transcripts were identified in two of the cases. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with ETV6 cosmids on 12p13, and BACs and P1s on 5q31, demonstrated that the 5q31 breakpoints of the AML and AEL cases involved the 5' portion of the ACS2 gene, and that the 5q31, breakpoint of the RAEB case involved the 3' portion of the ACS2 gene.

METHODS: Both short-term (</=1 week) and long-term exposure (>/=2 weeks) to CGP57148B were investigated using suspension culture, semisolid (methylcellulose) assay or stroma-dependent long-term culture (LTC). The proportion of bcr/abl-positive progenitors was determined after direct plating [2 weeks in colony-forming cell (CFC) assay] as well as after 2 or 6 weeks LTC (LTC always followed by CFC replates). RESULTS: Incubation of CML PBPC over 48 h in suspension culture with 100 microM CGP57148B reduced the proportion of bcr/abl-positive colonies to 4.4 +/- 4.3% (n = 5) after direct plating, 6.6 +/- 4.2% (n = 5) after 2 weeks LTC and 5 +/- 5.6% (n = 2) after 6 weeks LTC. At this dose, survival of drug-exposed normal PBPC was 53 +/- 4.2%, 51 +/- 2.8% and 54.5 +/- 4.9% (n = 2), respectively. Incubation with CGP57148B at a concentration of 10 microM over 1 week under LTC conditions reduced the number of bcr/abl-positive colonies to 11.8 +/- 6.1% (n = 5) after direct plating, 12 +/- 6.4% (n = 4) after 2 weeks LTC and 14.3 +/- 11.4% (n = 3) after 6 weeks LTC; survival of normal PBPC was 84.5 +/- 2.1%, 93 +/- 4.2% and 86 +/- 1.4% (n = 2), respectively. Following long-term exposure to CGP57148B at a concentration of 1 microM, the proportion of remaining bcr/abl-positive colonies was 35%, 9% and 25% of untreated CML samples after direct plating as well as after 2 and 6 weeks LTC, respectively. The respective values for 10 microM CGP57148B were 10%, 11% and 19%. Long-term exposure of normal progenitors to CGP57148B yielded a survival of 98%, 100% and 93% (1 microM) or 77%, 86% and 80% (10 microM), respectively. CONCLUSION: The results support the use of CGP57148B either for short-term exposure in vitro (e.g. purging) or for continuous treatment of CML in vivo.","['Kasper, B', 'Fruehauf, S', 'Schiedlmeier, B', 'Buchdunger, E', 'Ho, A D', 'Zeller, W J']","['Kasper B', 'Fruehauf S', 'Schiedlmeier B', 'Buchdunger E', 'Ho AD', 'Zeller WJ']","['German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Diagnostics and Experimental Therapy, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Benzamides', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*pathology', 'Piperazines/*toxicity', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*toxicity', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/09/29 00:00,1999/09/29 00:01,['1999/09/29 00:00'],"['1999/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1999;44(5):433-8. doi: 10.1007/s002800051001.,,,"['90440433.280 [pii]', '10.1007/s002800051001 [doi]']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we have shown that both As(2)O(3 )and melarsoprol, an organic arsenical used for the treatment of trypanosomiasis, exhibit broad antileukemic activity against both chronic and acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cell lines. Given the breadth of this activity, we initiated a clinical study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and potential efficacy of melarsoprol in patients with refractory or resistant leukemia. Using the antitrypanosomal dose and schedule, patients received escalating intravenous doses daily for 3 days, repeated weekly for 3 weeks. Doses were 1 mg/kg on day 1, 2 mg/kg on day 2, and 3.6 mg/kg on day 3 and on all days thereafter, up to a maximum daily dose of 200 mg. Eight patients [6 AML (2 morphologic APL), 1 CML, 1 CLL] were treated. Mean peak plasma concentrations of the parent drug were obtained immediately after injection, ranged from 1.2 microg/ml on day 1 to 2.4 microg/ml on day 3, were dose proportional, and decayed with a t(1/2) congruent with 15 min. A minor clinical response (regression of splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy) was observed in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Central nervous system (CNS) toxicity proved limiting on this dose and schedule. Three patients experienced generalized grand mal seizures during the second week of therapy. We concluded that this dose and schedule of melarsoprol is associated with excessive CNS toxicity and that verification of the striking preclinical activity in patients with leukemia will require developing an alternative dose and schedule.","['Soignet, S L', 'Tong, W P', 'Hirschfeld, S', 'Warrell, R P Jr']","['Soignet SL', 'Tong WP', 'Hirschfeld S', 'Warrell RP Jr']","['Developmental Chemotherapy, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Cornell University Medical College, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA. soignets@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Area Under Curve', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia/blood/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Melarsoprol/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Middle Aged']",1999/09/29 09:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/09/29 09:00'],"['1999/09/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/09/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1999;44(5):417-21. doi: 10.1007/s002800050998.,,,"['90440417.280 [pii]', '10.1007/s002800050998 [doi]']",['ZF3786Q2E8 (Melarsoprol)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparative pharmacology and optimal use in childhood leukemia.,621-9,"Asparaginase (ASP) is a standard component of the antileukemia armamentarium. There are currently 3 preparations of asparaginase available: (1) E. coli (ASP, Elspar); (2) the enzyme derived from Erwinia chrysanthemi (ERW, Erwinase); (3) pegaspargase (PEG, Oncaspar), the E. coli enzyme modified by covalent attachment of polyethylene glycol. This report describes the findings of 3 pharmacologic end points: ASP enzyme activity in patients' sera, depletion of asparagine and the development of anti-ASP antibodies. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic studies in a group of naive children with newly diagnosed ALL demonstrate a significant difference in apparent half-life (1.24 days E. coli vs. 0.65 ERW vs. 5.73 PEG; p < 0.001) and days of asparagine depletion (14-23 E. coli vs. 7-15 ERW vs. 26-34 PEG; p < 0.01) for the 3 different preparations. Data from Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) Protocol #8866 show that high antibody levels correlated with rapid ASP clearance and a significantly lower response rate (NR = 26% vs. CR + PR + 64%). The pharmacologic characteristics of ASP in terms of clearance of enzyme activity and ability to deplete serum asparagine was dependent upon the nature of the enzyme and are significantly altered in patients who develop anti-ASP antibodies regardless of their clinical status. In addition, these data demonstrate that ASP pharmacokinetics are directly related to its anti-leukemic effect. In order to maximize the therapeutic benefits of ASP, the optimal dose and schedule of treatment should be determined based on pharmacologic testing rather than by clinical criteria alone. Future studies will focus on the role of ""silent hypersensitivity"" as a mechanism of resistance to ASP and strategies to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of ASP as part of ALL therapy.","['Asselin, B L']",['Asselin BL'],"[""Children's Hospital at Strong, University of Rochester Medical Center, New York 14642, USA. basselin@mail.urmc.rochester.edu""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects/*blood/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Drug Hypersensitivity', 'Erwinia/enzymology', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction']",1999/09/29 00:00,1999/09/29 00:01,['1999/09/29 00:00'],"['1999/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1999;457:621-9.,,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In ALL 20% of patients are resistant to glucocorticoids at presentation but this rises to greater than 70% on relapse. It has recently been reported that the glucocorticoid receptor inhibits activity of the AP-1 transcription factor by the ligand-dependant binding of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to the fos and jun components of AP-1. Since AP-1 is necessary for cell proliferation, the upregulation or over-expression of AP-1 may be a mechanism of resistance to glucocorticoids. The aim of the study was to investigate whether AP-1 levels correlate with in vitro glucocorticoid resistance. In vitro sensitivity to glucocorticoids was measured using the MTT assay. AP-1 levels were quantified using gel shift analysis: a consensus sequence for the AP-1 binding site was synthesised, labelled with 32P and incubated with nuclear extracts of leukaemic blasts from 14 ALL and 26 CLL patients. Leukaemic blasts were treated with prednisolone or with vehicle alone before preparation of nuclear extracts. The gels were dried and bands quantified using a phosphorimager, using an appropriate internal standard and correcting for protein loading and cytoplasmic contamination of nuclear extracts. The patient samples fell into two distinct groups with respect to their sensitivity to glucocorticoids: AP-1 levels were significantly higher (p < 0.02) in sensitive blasts than resistant ones. There was no significant change in AP-1 levels after treating blasts for 4 hours with 0.2 mM prednisolone. No change was seen in CLL samples. These data show that glucocorticoid resistance is not associated with increased AP-1. Conversely, glucocorticoid resistance in these samples was apparently associated with decreased AP-1 levels in ALL samples. Whether this has any causal relationship to glucocorticoid resistance is unknown. Clearly, further studies on the role of AP-1 and related transcription factors is essential for understanding the control of proliferation and apoptosis in ALL.","['Bailey, S', 'Hall, A G', 'Pearson, A D', 'Reid, M M', 'Redfern, C P']","['Bailey S', 'Hall AG', 'Pearson AD', 'Reid MM', 'Redfern CP']","['Department of Child Health, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, England.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['Adult', 'Blast Crisis/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*metabolism']",1999/09/29 00:00,1999/09/29 00:01,['1999/09/29 00:00'],"['1999/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1999;457:615-9. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_68.,,,['10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_68 [doi]'],"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Glucocorticoids are the subject of renewed interest. In one randomized trial, deferral of glucocorticosteroids from the initial month of induction therapy to the second month of therapy decreased event free survival despite preservation of remission induction rate. Dexamethasone in induction and maintenance provides a better event free survival than prednisone for standard risk patients in an isotoxic comparison even though all patients received dexamethasone in Delayed Intensification (protocol II). In a third report, patients with prior glucocorticosteroid therapy who achieved remission with subsequent multiagent therapy had a relapse rate similar to that of patients in second remission after failure of multiagent therapy. In vitro and in vivo response of leukemic cells to glucocorticosteroids is highly predictive of outcome. At relapse, loss of in vitro sensitivity to glucocorticosteroids is common and out of proportion to the loss of sensitivity to other agents. Glucocorticoid induced cell kill does not require p53 function. Investigation of leukemic cell lines finds that glucocorticosteroid resistance is most commonly linked to altered receptor number or function. Not all ligands are equivalent. Cortivazol, a pyrazolosteroid, may bind to altered receptor in some cases and induce apoptosis in dexamethasone resistant leukemic cells. Host response to exogenous glucocorticosteroid also varies. Associations between host sensitivity, disease sensitivity, and glucocorticosteroid side effects like avascular necrosis of bone remain to be investigated.","['Gaynon, P S', 'Carrel, A L']","['Gaynon PS', 'Carrel AL']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine, Madison 53792, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Child', 'Dexamethasone/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glucocorticoids/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction']",1999/09/29 00:00,1999/09/29 00:01,['1999/09/29 00:00'],"['1999/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1999;457:593-605. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_66.,,,['10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_66 [doi]'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,88,,,,,,,,,

For VP-16 and DOX all pts (ALL, AML) except two had equal or increased LC50 of ""CH+CSF"" (compared with LC50 of CH alone). These data show: 1) AML LB were less sensitive to the investigated CH than ALL LB. 2) The LC50 of ""CH+CSF"" was equal or increased compared to the LC50 of CH for the absolute majority of cases with VP-16 and DOX. The same results were obtained with AML and in about 60% cases of ALL.

Fifty cases of childhood ALL, 22 cases of adult ALL and 7 normal marrows have been studied. Expression of MSH2, and of MLH1 in all but three cases, was detectable in all the blasts studied.

Aphidicolin can inhibit this DNA repair. We describe a study of the effect of aphidicolin to modulate the sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs of blast cells from 13 patients with AML, 11 with de novo disease on presentation and 2 secondary to MDS. Three patients had relapsed following previous therapy and samples were received from 1 patient both on presentation and relapse. Blast cells were exposed to anthracyclines, antimetabolites or etoposide +/- aphidicolin (15 microM) for 48 hours. The MTT assay was used to measure cell survival and the LC50 (concentration of drug required for 50% cell kill) was calculated. Overall, there was a significant increase in sensitivity to ara-C on co-incubation with aphidicolin in 12/14 samples (p = 0.007). The median increase in sensitivity was 3.88-fold (range 1.26- to 80-fold). Interestingly, when patients were grouped according to in vitro sensitivity to ara-C, cells from resistant patients demonstrated the greatest increase in sensitivity (median 14-fold compared to 2-fold for the sensitive group, p = 0.02). Despite the documented evidence for altered DNA repair as a mechanism of resistance to the topoisomerase II inhibitors, we found no significant increase in sensitivity to daunorubicin, doxorubicin or etoposide on co-incubation with aphidicolin.

Proliferation induction of leukemia blasts with growth factors in vitro resulted in an increased toxicity of Ara-C and anthracyclines.

A preliminary analysis.,551-5,"We studied the cross-resistance between prednisolone (PRD) and methotrexate (MTX) in children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This was done because of a previous observation that such patients could show a good clinical response to systemic PRD monotherapy plus intrathecal MTX, despite in vitro PRD resistant ALL cells (as determined with the MTT assay). This suggests an antileukemic effect of MTX, and thus the lack of cross-resistance between PRD and MTX. A systemic antileukemic effect of intrathecally administered MTX has been reported in the literature. Clinical good responders with PRD resistant ALL cells (n = 15) did not show unfavorable MTX-polyglutamylation nor unfavorable low inhibition of thymidylate synthase by MTX, as compared to a heterogeneous group of newly diagnosed ALL children (n = 47). In addition, we did not find a significant correlation between these two parameters and in vitro PRD resistance within the clinical good responders with PRD resistant ALL cells. In conclusion, we did not find a significant cross-resistance between PRD and MTX in vitro. It therefore may be that the good clinical response to systemic PRD plus intrathecal MTX in patients with in vitro PRD resistant ALL cells was caused by a systemic antileukemic activity of the intrathecally administered MTX.","['Hegge, I R', 'Kaspers, G J', 'Rots, M G', 'Jansen, G', 'Pieters, R', 'Veerman, A J']","['Hegge IR', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Rots MG', 'Jansen G', 'Pieters R', 'Veerman AJ']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cryopreservation', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/09/29 00:00,1999/09/29 00:01,['1999/09/29 00:00'],"['1999/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1999;457:551-5. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_60.,,,['10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_60 [doi]'],"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decreased transport and polyglutamylation.,543-50,"Drug resistance limits the effectiveness of methotrexate (MTX) for the treatment of acute leukemia. An increased understanding of the pathways involved in folate metabolism has allowed investigations of the mechanisms of resistance observed in leukemic blasts obtained from patients. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) was studied for mechanisms of acquired MTX resistance. MTX transport in 27 patients with untreated ALL and 31 patients with relapsed ALL was measured using a previously described competitive displacement assay. Only 13% of the untreated patients were considered to have impaired MTX transport whereas over 70% of the relapsed patients had evidence of impaired MTX transport. Northern analyses and quantitative RT-PCR for the reduced folate carrier (RFC) were performed on the RNA available from the leukemic blasts of 24 patients in whom MTX transport had been measured. Six of 9 samples with impaired MTX transport had decreased RFC expression (one had no detectable RFC expression), while three had no decrease in RFC expression. Acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) was studied to determine the basis of the decreased MTX polyglutamylation. Enzyme kinetics of the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) were studied, demonstrating FPGS in the myeloid cell lines and patient samples had a higher K(m) for MTX as a substrate than lymphoid cells. Measuring gamma-glutamyl hydrolase enzyme activity allowed a more accurate prediction of steady state levels of MTX polyglutamates. A knowledge of the mechanisms of MTX resistance that occur in leukemic blasts obtained from patients may allow the development of therapeutic strategies to circumvent resistance.","['Gorlick, R', 'Cole, P', 'Banerjee, D', 'Longo, G', 'Li, W W', 'Hochhauser, D', 'Bertino, J R']","['Gorlick R', 'Cole P', 'Banerjee D', 'Longo G', 'Li WW', 'Hochhauser D', 'Bertino JR']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA. gorlickr@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Peptide Synthases/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase/metabolism']",1999/09/29 00:00,1999/09/29 00:01,['1999/09/29 00:00'],"['1999/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1999;457:543-50. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_59.,,,['10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_59 [doi]'],"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 3.4.19.9 (gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",['CA09512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,37,,,,,,,,,

In addition to MTT testing direct assessment of DNA excision repair activity after direct exposure of marrow cells may provide information on relative DNA effects in vitro. AIMS: To assess the ability of SCGE/high resolution CLSM to detect differences in drug resistance between human neoplastic cell lines in the DNA excision repair response to chemotherapy. METHODS: Eight human leukaemia samples (4 childhood, 4 adult) were exposed to 1 hour of single concentrations of daunorubicin, DaunoXome (courtesy NeXstar Pharmaceuticals Inc, USA), cyclophosphamide and 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC, courtesy Dr. M. Colvin, Duke University, USA), followed by SCGE/high resolution CLSM with quantitation of total excised DNA. Differences between cases/drug moieties/exposures were analysed. RESULTS: Although generally equal effect dose levels for DaunoXome were lower than for standard daunorubicin, patients/individual neoplastic cells differed considerably in optimal dose levels. Conventional cyclophosphamide in comparison to 4-HC showed inconsistent results indicating considerable differences in the level of drug resistance to the conventional product. CONCLUSIONS: Direct testing for drug resistance patterns in DNA directed drug moieties by SCGE/CLSM reveals individual variability of human malignant cell lines warranting comparison with results of MTT testing and in-vivo patient response.","['Ball, L M', 'Lannon, C L', 'Langley, G R', 'Pyesmany, A F', 'Yhap, M', 'van Velzen, D']","['Ball LM', 'Lannon CL', 'Langley GR', 'Pyesmany AF', 'Yhap M', 'van Velzen D']","['Department of Clinical Haemato-Oncology, Dalhousie University, JWK Grace Health Centre, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Child', 'Comet Assay/*methods', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Confocal/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/09/29 00:00,1999/09/29 00:01,['1999/09/29 00:00'],"['1999/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1999;457:501-8. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_54.,,,['10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_54 [doi]'],['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed long-term outcome of 76 adults with Ph/BCR+ ALL, in order to detect which factors were associated with longer survival. Modifiable prognostic factors included type of treatment, allogeneic marrow transplant (allo-BMT), and early anthracycline dose intensity (high = H/A, low = L/A); unmodifiable factors were age, gender, FAB morphology, phenotype, blast count, P190/210 transcript, hepatospleno-lymphadenopathy, LDH level. Median patient age was 43 years (range 15-71). Four favorable prognostic factors (FPF) were found associated with greater likelihood of complete remission (blast count < 50 x 10(9)/l, p = 0.08), longer remission duration (age < 50 years, p < 0.001; H/A, p < 0.05), and lower relapse rate (allo-BMT, p = 0.017). Age and anthracycline dose intensity exerted a synergistic prognostic effect. According to the cumulative incidence of FPF in each patient (FPF 0-1 = 29, 2-3 = 42, 4 = 5), the probability of survival increased from nil to 0.22 to 0.60 at 5 years (p < 0.005).

METHODS: MTT tests were performed according to Pieters et al., Blood 76: 2327, 1990. Up to 18 cytostatic drugs were tested in a wide range of concentrations over 4 days and compared with controls. If necessary, blasts were enriched > 80% by negative selection with dynabeads (Kaspers et al., Br. J. Cancer 70: 1047, 1994). Percent S-phase was measured at begin of assay and after 4 days. RESULTS: Technical success rate was 80-85% and the assay took about one day of work. IC50 values as a measure for drug resistance were highly reproducible with an interassay CV (range) of 28% (13-47) between days. Median cell viability of controls after 4 days was 80% (44-97);% S-phase at begin of assay was 3% (0.1-15) and after 4 days 9% (1-39). Leukemic blasts from 57 adult AML patients were prospectively tested in vitro at diagnosis. Large interindividual differences in drug resistance were observed (over 1000 fold on average). There was a trend for greater IC50 with higher cytogenetic risk and nonresponders to induction. Other clinical prognostic factors such as patient age, initial WBC, FAB subtype, prior MDS and % S-phase did not show a relationship with the in vitro data. There was a high correlation between the topoisomerase II related drugs regarding in vitro resistance. CONCLUSION: In vitro sensitivity tests like the MTT assay may provide a valuable tool for prediction of individual therapy outcome in combination with cytogenetics. However, longer follow-up is required.","['Stute, N', 'Kohler, T', 'Lehmann, L', 'Wetzstein, W', 'Ehninger, G']","['Stute N', 'Kohler T', 'Lehmann L', 'Wetzstein W', 'Ehninger G']","['Medical Clinic I, Technical University Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/09/29 00:00,1999/09/29 00:01,['1999/09/29 00:00'],"['1999/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1999;457:445-52. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_48.,,,['10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_48 [doi]'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We summarize the results of the studies published sofar that have focussed on drug resistance in childhood AML, using cell culture assays. We also briefly report our own results of an ongoing study. Finally, potential applications of cellular drug resistance testing are discussed. It appears that cellular drug resistance differs between AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia and between subgroups of AML patients, that AML cells of relapsed patients are more resistance to cytarabine than those of untreated patients, and that in vitro resistance to cytarabine and daunorubicin is related to a worse prognosis. However, more and larger studies are required to determine the exact role of cellular drug resistance testing in the treatment of childhood AML.","['Kaspers, G J', 'Zwaan, C M', 'Pieters, R', 'Veerman, A J']","['Kaspers GJ', 'Zwaan CM', 'Pieters R', 'Veerman AJ']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. gjl.kaspers@azvu.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Child', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/09/29 00:00,1999/09/29 00:01,['1999/09/29 00:00'],"['1999/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1999;457:415-21.,,,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,32,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, most of the therapeutic trials in acute leukemia that were based on in vitro drug sensitivity assays of patient samples have been disappointing. In order to show possible pitfalls of unphysiological alterations in vitro we investigated concentration versus time curves, metabolism and effects on the culture media for some antineoplastic drugs. Oxazaphosphorines and cytarabine were incubated in RPMI and in established cell lines and measured by HPLC. HPLC also served to measure enzyme activity and levels of related amino acids at various concentrations of asparaginase, ammonia release was photometrically determined. Etoposide was monitored by HPLC relative to different contents of FCS in RPMI. All oxazaphosphorines showed a rapid decrease of in vitro activity down to about 10% within 4-6 h, and 2% within 72 h. The level of cytarabine, when incubated in RPMI, was stable over 24h, and no change was seen with K562, while a rapid decrease to below 50% occurred within 6h in the presence of HL 60 and BLIN. 2 U/L of asparaginase led to asparagine depletion of the medium within 4h, while 200 U/L were associated with a preferential increase of glutamic acid and ammonia. Further, there was evidence of instability by rapid adsorption to plastic surfaces (paclitaxel) or isomerisation (etoposide) in RPMI with low FCS content. The instability of drugs in vitro is attributed to a variety of different factors: i.e. physico-chemical instability results in inactivation of oxazaphosphorines, cytarabine disappears by cellular metabolism without saturation depending on the cell-line. Epiphenomena like adsorption and isomerisation in vitro are unphysiological. Results of drug sensitivity assays should be interpreted with great caution.","['Wagner, A', 'Hempel, G', 'Gumbinger, H G', 'Jurgens, H', 'Boos, J']","['Wagner A', 'Hempel G', 'Gumbinger HG', 'Jurgens H', 'Boos J']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, WWU Munster, Germany.

Hyperdiploidy > 50 chromosomes and ETV6-CBFA2 fusions have been used to identify low-risk cases, and BCR-ABL and MLL-AF4 to define high-risk leukemias. Despite their clinical utility, the risk classification system based on these findings lack absolute precision and should be complemented with other variables, the most important of which is the early blast cell response to remission induction therapy. Studies of tumor suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes in the BCL2 family genes may unravel the mechanisms of leukemia cell progression and the development of drug resistance, leading to innovative therapies. As the cure rates for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) approach 80%, precise methods of risk assessment are needed to permit better selection of treatment that is neither excessive nor inadequate for individual patients. Because one or more genetic abnormalities underlie every case of leukemia, a risk assignment system based on primary genetic abnormalities has great intuitive appeal. Even though over 90% of childhood ALL cases can be readily classified according to numerical or gross structural chromosomal abnormalities, molecular analyses are essential to identify therapeutically relevant, submicroscopic genetic lesions not visible by karyotyping. This review focuses mainly on recent advances in genetic studies that have contributed to therapeutic advances or that hold promise for the future.","['Pui, C H', 'Evans, W E']","['Pui CH', 'Evans WE']","[""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Risk Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1999/09/29 00:00,1999/09/29 00:01,['1999/09/29 00:00'],"['1999/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1999;457:383-9. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_40.,,,['10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_40 [doi]'],"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']","['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37-CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,49,,,,,,,,,

We analysed the BCL-2 protein expression of blast cells from 19 patients by flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. This was compared to in vitro sensitivity to the anthracyclines and antimetabolites using the MTT assay. We found a significant correlation between BCL-2 expression and in vitro response to two antimetabolite drugs. One of 7 patients (14%) whose cells were sensitive to ara-C expressed BCL-2 compared to 4/4 patients (100%) whose cells were resistant to ara-C in vitro (p = 0.05). Furthermore, none of the three patients whose cells were sensitive to 6-TG expressed BCL-2 compared to 6/9 patients (67%) whose cells were resistant in vitro (p = 0.045). We found no other correlation between BCL-2 expression and any other chemotherapeutic drug analysed. The ratio of BCL-2 to BAX may be more relevant clinically, therefore cells from a further 9 patients were analysed for both proteins. Whilst there was no overall relationship between BCL-2/BAX ratios and sensitivity to ara-C and 6TG, individual patients could be identified whose blast cells were resistant to ara-C and had high BCL-2/BAX ratios. Further analysis of the significance of these ratios to drug resistance may be of future prognostic value.","['Balkham, S E', 'Sargent, J M', 'Elgie, A W', 'Williamson, C J', 'Taylor, C G']","['Balkham SE', 'Sargent JM', 'Elgie AW', 'Williamson CJ', 'Taylor CG']","['Pembury Hospital, Kent, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Blast Crisis/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cytarabine/*toxicity', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Thioguanine/*toxicity', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1999/09/29 00:00,1999/09/29 00:01,['1999/09/29 00:00'],"['1999/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1999;457:335-40. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_36.,,,['10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_36 [doi]'],"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several proto-oncogenes have been related to the regulation of this process. In this study we evaluated the relation between bcl-2 expression, spontaneous and dexamethasone (DXM) induced apoptosis, and in vitro resistance to DXM, prednisolone (PRD) and cytarabine (ARA) determined using the total cell kill colorimetric methyl-thiazol-tetrazolium salt (MTT) assay, in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Drug resistance was expressed as the LC50 value, the drug concentration lethal to 50% of the cells. Fourty-six samples taken at initial diagnosis (iALL) and 31 samples taken at relapse (rALL) were incubated in culture medium, with and without DXM. Bcl-2 expression and apoptosis were measured flowcytometrically, the latter using DNA histogram analysis. Bcl-2 expression was 1.4 fold higher in rALL than in iALL (p = 0.008). Both spontaneous and DXM induced apoptosis increased significantly from 0 to 48 hours (in up to 71%, 81% of the cells respectively). Bcl-2 expression was inversely correlated with the extent of spontaneous apoptosis after 24 hours in iALL (r = -0.40, p = 0.05). Relapsed samples, but not samples obtained at presentation, expressing high levels of bcl-2 displayed increased resistance to drug induced apoptosis (r = -0.63, p = 0.02). In iALL high bcl-2 expression appeared to be related to low LC50 values of ARA. No correlations were found for DXM or PRD. In conclusion, DXM excerts its cytotoxic effect at least partly by means of induction of apoptosis. Bcl-2 inhibits drug induced apoptosis in rALL. However in iALL bcl-2 expression is not associated with increased in vitro drug resistance, nor with increased resistance to drug induced apoptosis.","['Haarman, E G', 'Kaspers, G J', 'Pieters, R', 'van Zantwijk, C H', 'Broekema, G J', 'Hahlen, K', 'Veerman, A J']","['Haarman EG', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Pieters R', 'van Zantwijk CH', 'Broekema GJ', 'Hahlen K', 'Veerman AJ']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/toxicity', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', '*Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*genetics/*pathology', 'Prednisolone/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics']",1999/09/29 00:00,1999/09/29 00:01,['1999/09/29 00:00'],"['1999/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1999;457:325-33. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_35.,,,['10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_35 [doi]'],"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Firstly, to set experimental conditions, apoptosis was evaluated in CEM cells at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours from end of drug incubation, the maximal increase being noted at 24-48 hours. Net apoptosis rates were determined after subtraction of the spontaneous activity observed in untreated cells. The apoptotic effect from varying drug type and concentration was compared at 24 hours in CEM-MDR1+ cells, with and without co-incubation with MDR1 functional downregulator cyclosporin A (CSA) used at therapeutic concentration (1500 ng/ml). The results indicated that, at drug concentrations likely to be approached in vivo as a short-lasting peak level (IDA 100-200 ng/ml) with increased-dose IDA (> 12-15 mg/m2), pro-apoptotic effects by IDA+CSA in CEM-MDR1+ cells were significantly greater than by DNR+CSA, and corresponded to the levels observed with IDA 50 ng/ml without CSA in control CEM cells. This in vitro study demonstrates that it is possible to determine in the same sample cell fluorescence related to anthracyclines, apoptotic cells (FITC-annexin V positive), and necrotic cells (propidium iodide positive), and confirms that cytofluorimetric evaluation of apoptosis can reliably predict the effects of anthracycines in function of drug type, concentration and, in MDR1+ cells, concurrent MDR1 inhibition.

Work predominantly in murine systems has suggested that inhibitors of PARP might potentiate the effects of chemotherapeutic agents and be used as adjuncts to cancer therapy. Therefore, we studied the role of PARP in drug-induced apoptosis in HL-60, myeloid leukaemia cells and found that pre-treatment with 3-aminobenzamide (3AB) or 6(5H)-phenanthridinone, inhibitors of PARP, resulted in resistance to, rather than potentiation of apoptotic death induced by DNA-damaging agents, idarubicin, etoposide and fludarabine, as determined by flow cytometry, following propidium iodide staining. 3AB treated CEM/VLB100, mdr-expressing human lymphoblastic leukaemia cells were also found to be more resistant to idarubicin compared to cells treated with idarubicin alone, however, apoptosis was not reduced in parental CCRF-CEM cells under the same conditions. Similar results were obtained using agents with primary modes of action which do not involve DNA damage, vinblastine and a fas-ligating antibody (CH11). The precise role of PARP has yet to be defined but might involve effects on cell cycle progression. We conclude that PARP activation appears to be involved in apoptosis in certain leukaemic cell lines and that these effects are independent of lineage or p-glycoprotein.

Cell cycle analysis and quantitation of apoptosis were performed by flow cytometry following propidium iodide staining. HL-60 cells were found to be sensitive to the induction of apoptosis with all drugs tested but were highly resistant to treatment with a fas-ligating antibody (CH11). Apoptosis was neither inhibited in parental CEM cells nor their mdr-expressing drug resistant counterpart, CEM/VLB100 by pre-treatment with either ZB4 or NOK1. In addition, CEM/VLB100 were slightly more sensitive to treatment with CH11 (100 ng/ml) than parental CEM cells (% age apoptosis = 30.35 and 23.675, p = 0.024) and at least as sensitive to recombinant fas-ligand (50 ng/ml) (% age apoptosis = 26.6 and 20.2, p = NS).

Cellular-localization studies showed that Apoptin is not located in mitochondria, indicating once more that Bcl-2 does not interfere with Apoptin in normal cells.

GSH is an intracellular thiol implicated in the development of cytotoxic drug resistance and appears to be involved in the control of cell proliferation and apoptosis. In this study, total GSH was measured in cryopreserved blasts from 62 childhood ALL and 13 AML patients. In ALL, high GSH levels were associated with a relatively poor prognosis. A positive correlation was demonstrated between the GSH level and presenting white cell count (WCC). GSH levels were significantly higher in T lineage ALL compared with B lineage and in AML blasts compared with ALL. These results are supportive of GSH as prognostic indicator in childhood leukaemia and may suggest one mechanism of treatment failure.

There was a good correlation between MRP1 expression and the modulatory effect of probenecid (a specific modulator of MRP1) on the calcein efflux (r = 0.91, p = 0.0003) and between Pgp expression and the modulatory effect of CsA on calcein-AM uptake (r = 0.96, p < 0.0001). On light of the high correlations for both proteins, we tested calcein-AM uptake and efflux in fresh myeloid leukemic cells. In 53 AML patients, there was also a good correlation between MRP1 expression (measured by RT/PCR and by MRPm6 expression by flow cytometry) and the modulatory effect of probenecid on the calcein fluorescence (r = 0.92, p < 0.0001) and between Pgp expression as measured by UIC2 antibody binding on flow cytometry and the modulatory effect of CsA on calcein-AM uptake (r = 0.83, p < 0.0001). Pgp activity was higher in CD34+ leukemia than in CD34- leukemia (2.26 +/- 1.50 vs 1.46 +/- 1.21 respectively, p = 0.003) and MRP1 activity was higher in CD34- leukemia than in CD34+ leukemia (1.77 +/- 0.40 vs 1.4 +/- 0.29 respectively, p = 0.004). Pgp expression and activity (p = 0.004 and p = 0.01, respectively), MRP1 activity (p = 0.03) but not MRP1 expression were prognostic factors for achievement of CR. The effect of probenecid and CsA together were higher than the effect of either probenecid or CsA alone on calcein-AM uptake. These results suggest that functional testing (with calcein-AM +/- modulators) for the presence of both MRP1 and Pgp activities is of prognostic value and that MRP1 contributes to drug resistance in AML.","['Legrand, O', 'Simonin, G', 'Perrot, J Y', 'Zittoun, R', 'Marie, J P']","['Legrand O', 'Simonin G', 'Perrot JY', 'Zittoun R', 'Marie JP']","['EA1529, Universite Paris VI, Formation de Recherche Claude Bernard, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Base Pair Mismatch', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fluoresceins/*pharmacokinetics', 'Fluorescent Dyes', '*Genes, MDR', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', '*Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'MutS Homolog 3 Protein', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/09/29 00:00,1999/09/29 00:01,['1999/09/29 00:00'],"['1999/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1999;457:161-75. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_18.,,,['10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_18 [doi]'],"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (MSH3 protein, human)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (MutS Homolog 3 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '148504-34-1 (calcein AM)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'V0YM2B16TS (fluorexon)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our primary test is a standardised and reproducible assay for anthracycline accumulation in which we use carboxylate microspheres to bind the fluorescent drug daunorubicin (dnr). Cells and beads are incubated concurrently with dnr. Cellular dnr accumulation is quantified as a cell:bead fluorescence ratio. Confirmatory assays for MDR comprise the cyclosporin modulation assay for rhodamine 123 uptake and also measurement of lung resistance protein and multidrug resistance associated protein (with LRP-56 and MRPr1 respectively). 27/47 (57%) samples had both low and accumulation and at least one positive confirmatory test (a modulated functional assay and/or protein overexpression) and were categorised as ""confirmed MDR"". 15/47 patients (32%) were MDR negative in all 4 assays. 5/47 (11%) patients had unconfirmed low dnr accumulation.

Amplified DNA was screened using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). 139 patients and 93 normal controls were studied. Fifteen patients (11%) were found to have abnormal bands on the SSCP analysis.

Confirmation of the mutation was performed by oligonucleotide probe hybridization. All but two of the AML patients have died due to chemoresistant disease (one is lost to followup).

In humans two Pgp genes have been identified; mdr-1 and mdr-3. Classical Multiple Drug Resistance (MDR) is associated with over expression of the mdr-1 gene product, P-170. No role for mdr-3 in MDR has yet been proven. However there is evidence that mdr-3 overexpression may be associated with drug resistance in certain B-cell lymphocytic leukaemias. In an immunocytochemical study we have looked at a selection of B-cell leukaemias for mdr-1 and mdr-3 encoded Pgp expression using monoclonal antibodies specific for the mdr-1 and mdr-3 encoded gene products. In B-CLL patients a differential pattern of MDR-3 positive staining was observed; suggesting that MDR-3 positivity may be associated with a more malignant phenotype in B-CLL. This pattern was not observed with MDR-1 positivity. We also observed MDR-3 positivity in an AML stage M5a patient which is the first report of MDR-3 Pgp expression being detected in AML; suggesting that MDR-3 Pgp expression may be limited to particular subtypes of this disease. Results from B-NHL cases were inconclusive with varying expression of MDR-1 and MDR-3 Pgps observed.

A large number of studies have been published on the effect of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression on prognosis in AML. However, a consensus has been difficult to reach, due to the variable results obtained by different laboratories. Pgp expression was investigated here in bone marrow samples from 34 patients with AML including 19 newly diagnosed cases and 15 relapsing patients. Pgp expression was performed by immunocytochemistry (ICC) using the aviding-biotin-peroxydase technique with JSB1 and UIC2 MoAbs. Flow cytometry (FCM) analysis of Pgp expression was performed using UCI2 MoAbs in an indirect immunofluorescent assay without cell permeabilization. Rhodamine 123 (Rh 123) uptake was measured in the presence or absence of verapamil. Result was discordant in only 1/20 samples studied with both JSB1 and UIC2 by ICC. Results of Pgp expression were consistent on FCM and ICC in 23 of the 28 (82%) samples tested. Overall, Pgp expression was observed by ICC or FCM in 23 (67%) patients, including 11 (58%) newly diagnosed patients and 12 (80%) patients in relapse. Functional Rh123 efflux (Rh123+) was observed in 20 cases (59%): 10 de novo AML (53%) vs 10 AML in relapse (67%). The functional efflux was correlated with Pgp expression in 25 of the 34 cases analyzed (p = 0.013). 3 (9%) and 6 (18%) samples were Pgp-/Rh123+ and Pgp+/Rh123- respectively. Nine of the 14 pts (64%) treated with intensive anthracyclin-Ara C chemotherapy achieved complete remission, including 5/5 (100%) Pgp- cases vs 4/9 (44%) Pgp+ cases (p = 0.04) and 4/6 (67%) Rh 123- vs 4/7 (57%) Rh123+ cases (p = 0.5). In conclusion, assessment of Pgp expression by ICC and FMC using 2 different MoAbs coupled with functional efflux analysis confirms that Pgp expression is correlated with disease stage and response to treatment in AML. Discordant Pgp/Rh123 cases suggest a non functional Pgp or another alteration of drug transport.","['Poulain, S', 'Lepelley, P', 'Cambier, N', 'Cosson, A', 'Fenaux, P', 'Wattel, E']","['Poulain S', 'Lepelley P', 'Cambier N', 'Cosson A', 'Fenaux P', 'Wattel E']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie A, Chu, Lille, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*analysis/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence']",1999/09/29 00:00,1999/09/29 00:01,['1999/09/29 00:00'],"['1999/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1999;457:57-63. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_7.,,,['10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_7 [doi]'],"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PSC 833 is a non-competitive inhibitor of P-gp and has been shown in vitro and in vivo to restore sensitivity of resistant tumor cells to anticancer drugs (ACDs). Induction chemotherapy consisting of cytarabine (C) in combination with PSC 833 and escalating doses of mitoxantrone (M) and etoposide (E) over 5 or 6 days were tested in two phase I/II studies in poor prognosis AML. Overall, 59 patients were evaluated: their age ranged between 18 and 70 years. Fourteen patients had primary refractory disease, 25 had relapsed within 9 months from first complete remission (CR), 5 were in second relapse, 10 had secondary AML, and 4 had relapsed post-bone marrow transplantation. PSC 833 was given as a constant i.v. infusion at a rate of 10 mg/kg/24 h for 5 or 6 days, depending on the duration of chemotherapy. In both studies a loading dose of 2 mg/kg of PSC 833 was given on day 1. In the 5-day regimen, the final study doses of the cytotoxic agents were C 1 g/m2/d, M 4.0 mg/m2/d, and E 40 mg/m2/d. In the 6-day regimen, the final study doses of the cytotoxic agents were C 1 g/m2/d, M 4.5 mg/m2/d and E 30 mg/m2/d. The combined efficacy results of both studies indicate that PSC-MEC is active in all treatment indications, complete remission being achieved in 2/5 (40%) second relapses, 8/25 (32%) early relapses, 3/10 (30%) secondary AML, 3/15 (20%) refractory patients and 1/4 (25%) post-BMT relapses. Based on historical controls, this observed overall CR rate (29%) is higher than expected in this high risk patient population. Our data indicate that, in refractory/relapsed AML patients, PSC-MEC regimens had encouraging antileukemic effects, is well tolerated, and has led to Phase III trials in this setting.","['Advani, R', 'Visani, G', 'Milligan, D', 'Saba, H', 'Tallman, M', 'Rowe, J M', 'Wiernik, P H', 'Ramek, J', 'Dugan, K', 'Lum, B', 'Villena, J', 'Davis, E', 'Paietta, E', 'Litchman, M', 'Covelli, A', 'Sikic, B', 'Greenberg, P']","['Advani R', 'Visani G', 'Milligan D', 'Saba H', 'Tallman M', 'Rowe JM', 'Wiernik PH', 'Ramek J', 'Dugan K', 'Lum B', 'Villena J', 'Davis E', 'Paietta E', 'Litchman M', 'Covelli A', 'Sikic B', 'Greenberg P']","['Stanford Medical Center, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporins/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', '*Genes, MDR', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy']",1999/09/29 00:00,1999/09/29 00:01,['1999/09/29 00:00'],"['1999/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1999;457:47-56. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_6.,,,['10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_6 [doi]'],"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Updated results of a randomized study. Groupe Francais des Myelodysplasies (GFM) and Groupe GOELAMS.,35-46,"We designed a randomized trial of IC with or without quinine, an agent capable of reverting the multidrug resistance (mdr) phenotype, in patients aged < or = 65 years with high risk MDS. Patients were randomized to receive Mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2/d d2-5 + AraC 1 g/m2/12 h d1-5, with (Q+) or without (Q-) quinine (30 mg/kg/day). 131 patients were included. PGP expression analysis was successfully made in 91 patients and 42 patients (46%) had positive PGP expression. In PGP positive cases, 13 of the 25 (52%) patients who received quinine achieved CR, as compared to 3 of the 17 (18%) patients treated with chemotherapy alone (p = 0.02). In PGP negative cases, the CR rate was 35% and 49%, respectively in patients who received quinine or chemotherapy alone (difference not significant). In the 42 PGP positive patients, median Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival was 13 months in patients allocated to the quinine group, and 8 months in patients treated with chemotherapy alone (p = 0.01). In PGP negative patients, median KM survival was 14 months in patients allocated to the quinine group, and 14 months in patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Side effects of quinine mainly included vertigo and tinnitus that generally disappeared with dose reduction. Mucositis was significantly more frequently observed in the quinine group. No life threatening cardiac toxicity was observed. In conclusion, results of this randomized study show that quinine increases the CR rate and survival in PGP positive MDS cases treated with IC. The fact that quinine had no effect on the response rate and survival of PGP negative MDS suggests a specific effect on PGP mediated drug resistance rather than, for instance, a simple effect on the metabolism of Mitoxantrone and/or AraC.","['Wattel, E', 'Solary, E', 'Hecquet, B', 'Caillot, D', 'Ifrah, N', 'Brion, A', 'Milpied, N', 'Janvier, M', 'Guerci, A', 'Rochant, H', 'Cordonnier, C', 'Dreyfus, F', 'Veil, A', 'Hoang-Ngoc, L', 'Stoppa, A M', 'Gratecos, N', 'Sadoun, A', 'Tilly, H', 'Brice, P', 'Lioure, B', 'Desablens, B', 'Pignon, B', 'Abgrall, J P', 'Leporrier, M', 'Fenaux, P']","['Wattel E', 'Solary E', 'Hecquet B', 'Caillot D', 'Ifrah N', 'Brion A', 'Milpied N', 'Janvier M', 'Guerci A', 'Rochant H', 'Cordonnier C', 'Dreyfus F', 'Veil A', 'Hoang-Ngoc L', 'Stoppa AM', 'Gratecos N', 'Sadoun A', 'Tilly H', 'Brice P', 'Lioure B', 'Desablens B', 'Pignon B', 'Abgrall JP', 'Leporrier M', 'Fenaux P', 'et al.']","['Service des Maladies du Sang, CHU, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/physiopathology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Genes, MDR', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Phenotype', 'Quinine/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis']",1999/09/29 00:00,1999/09/29 00:01,['1999/09/29 00:00'],"['1999/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1999;457:35-46. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_5.,,,['10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_5 [doi]'],"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'A7V27PHC7A (Quinine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resistance to the anthracyclines can be overcome by several agents including Cyclosporin A (CsA), PSC833 and GF120918. We describe an investigation into the expression, using MRK16 and UIC2, and function of P-gp using daunorubicin with and without modulators by flow cytometric analysis on previously frozen blast cells from 27 patients with primary or secondary AML. We compared this with the in vitro chemosensitivity, using the MTT assay, of fresh blast cells from the same patients. Whilst we found a correlation between P-gp function using CsA and GF120918 and expression using MRK16 (p < 0.05) and (p < 0.02) respectively, we were unable to find any overall correlation between expression and function of P-gp with either in vitro sensitivity to the anthracyclines, previous treatment, or 1 degree or 2 degrees disease. However it was possible to identify individual patients whose cells exhibited P-gp expression and function teamed with in vitro resistance to, and modification of, the anthracyclines. Furthermore, it is possible to identify which modulator had the greatest effect. The fact that we obtained higher indications of resistance reversal using the MTT assay along with finding P-gp expression and function in patients sensitive to the anthracyclines, suggests studies of P-gp should be teemed with chemosensitivity testing to identify specific patients who will benefit.","['Elgie, A W', 'Sargent, J M', 'Williamson, C J', 'Lewandowicz, G M', 'Taylor, C G']","['Elgie AW', 'Sargent JM', 'Williamson CJ', 'Lewandowicz GM', 'Taylor CG']","['Haematology Research Department, Pembury Hospital, Kent, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Acridines/toxicity', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*toxicity', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*pathology', 'Recurrence', '*Tetrahydroisoquinolines', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/09/29 00:00,1999/09/29 00:01,['1999/09/29 00:00'],"['1999/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1999;457:29-33. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_4.,,,['10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_4 [doi]'],"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Acridines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Tetrahydroisoquinolines)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'N488540F94 (Elacridar)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results of a 6-year prospective study.,11-9,"UNLABELLED: P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a cellular drug-efflux pump is thought to be one of the major causes of multidrug resistance in malignancies. Since therapeutic strategies are being developed to circumvent drug resistance by inhibiting P-gp, prospective studies concerning the clinical relevance of P-gp in childhood leukemia are warranted. METHODS: P-gp was studied in 102 consecutive cases of de novo childhood ALL and in 34 relapsed patients. An immunocytochemical technique with two monoclonal antibodies (C219,4E3) was used on bone marrow and blood smears. RESULTS: 12/34 (35%) children were scored positive at relapse compared to 12/102 (12%) children with newly diagnosed ALL (p = 0.006). No correlation between P-gp expression and clinical and hematological parameters was seen. All patients were treated according to the EORTC-CLCG protocols (survival at 5 years = 85%). 20/102 patients relapsed. The mortality rate in the P-gp positive group was significantly worse (Logrank P = 0.009) than in the P-gp negative patients. In the relapsed patient population 10/12 P-gp positive cases experienced an unfavourable outcome compared with 10/22 P-gp negative patients [Risk Ratio 2.21 (0.90-5.45)]. CONCLUSIONS: P-glycoprotein expression in newly diagnosed childhood ALL is an independent prognostic parameter for dismal outcome. P-gp positivity at relapse tends towards an adverse clinical outcome compared to the P-gp negative relapsed population.","['Dhooge, C', 'De Moerloose, B']","['Dhooge C', 'De Moerloose B']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital, Gent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', 'Blast Crisis/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Genes, MDR', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality/physiopathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate']",1999/09/29 00:00,1999/09/29 00:01,['1999/09/29 00:00'],"['1999/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1999;457:11-9. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_2.,,,['10.1007/978-1-4615-4811-9_2 [doi]'],"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several large cohorts of newly diagnosed AML patients treated with a classical anthracycline + standard doses of cytosine arabinoside were tested for the prognosis value of MDR1 phenotype, and demonstrated an high correlation between a significant increase of MDR1 gene expression and treatment failure (or, better, drug resistance). This P-gp(+) drug resistance could be due either to a particular phenotype of bad prognosis AML, as it is suggested by the association of myelodysplasia, complex karyotype and advanced age with MDR1 phenotype, or due primarily to the active efflux of anthracyclines and VP16 in P-gp(+) leukemic cells. Several observations tend to confirm the functional role of the P-gp in clinical drug resistance; (i) using multivariate analysis, MDR1 phenotype appears to be an independent variable, as potent (or higher) as karyotype and age for predicting in vivo drug resistance; (ii) the prognostic value is limited to the CD34(+)/P-gp(+) phenotype, wich is linked to a functional P-gp; (iii) the in vitro sensitivity to anthracyclines and VP16 is highly correlated with P-gp expression. All these data argue for an early use of P-gp modifier agents in the treatment of AML.

Transplantable cells can be harvested from blood or the umbilical cord as well as from bone marrow, and CD34+ cells can be effectively isolated as a pure stem cell source. However, the clinical benefit of HSCT in the treatment of hematological malignancies has remained unclear. As HSCT is principally a measure of stem cell rescue after high-dose chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy, it is difficult to clarify its contribution to the cure of the disease. Given these circumstances, pediatric patients with extremely high-risk features like Ph1 ALL or 11q23 translocation are usually selected for allogeneic HSCT even in the 1st CR. Additionally, HSCT could also reasonably be applied to those in 2nd CR or later. These considerations are based upon the idea that transplant-related mortality (TRM) is still too high in allogeneic settings. Allogeneic HSCT may be the first choice for treatment of such patients, if TRM becomes low and it is scientifically proved to be effective. On the other hand, autologous HSC grafts may be contaminated with cancer cells and lack the potency of allogeneic cell-mediated immune function. To improve the clinical results in this setting, a new type of anticancer agent with lower toxicity and a new strategy including immunotherapy should be established.","['Kawano, Y', 'Takaue, Y']","['Kawano Y', 'Takaue Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Tokushima, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

In addition, autologous BMT or PBSCT can be used to facilitate hematologic reconstitution after marrow-ablative therapy for hematologic malignancies. At least 50% of patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) can be cured by treatment with allogeneic BMT. Autologous BMT has been studied in comparison with allogeneic BMT or intensive chemotherapy in the treatment of AML and ALL. A series of large-scale prospective randomized studies have provided controversial results: relapse rates are significantly low, but treatment-related mortality is significantly high, after allogeneic or autologous BMT as compared to intensive chemotherapy. At present, it is somewhat difficult to determine which treatment modality is indicated as a postremission therapy for AML and ALL. Therefore, risk factors such as leukemia subtype, age, karyotype, and initial response should be taken into consideration when deciding on a postremission therapy. In the 1990's, the use of autologous PBSCT has been replacing autologous BMT, as autologous PBSCT has several advantages over autologous BMT. Consequently, allogeneic PBSCT has come to be increasingly used instead of allogeneic BMT in the treatment of leukemia. Recent clinical data clearly indicate that allogeneic PBSCT can be used as an alternative to allogeneic BMT. With well-designed clinical trials, the places, of allogeneic or autologous BMT and PBSCT will be clarified in the treatment strategy for acute leukemia.","['Harada, M']",['Harada M'],"['Department of Internal Medicine II, Okayama University Medical School, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

The corresponding bis analogues, linked by a (CH2)3NMe(CH2)3 chain, were generally more potent, with the largest increases (dimer/monomer ratio 20- to 30-fold) seen for the nitronaphthalimides and the phenazines.

We prepared 3H-labelled DACA and investigated its uptake using cultured Lewis lung carcinoma cells (LLTC), P388 leukaemia cells and P/DACT cells that were multidrug resistant. The kinetics of uptake and efflux were very rapid and equilibrium was obtained within seconds of drug addition. Fluorescence microscopy of LLTC cells treated with DACA showed punctate fluorescence in the cytoplasm, consistent with uptake into vesicles. To investigate the role of lipophilicity in drug uptake, a fluorimetric assay was developed to measure uptake of a more hydrophilic derivative, 9-amino-5-sulphonylmethyl-DACA (as-DACA). The calculated n-octanol-water partition coefficient for as-DACA was 20-fold lower than that for DACA. On the other hand, as determined by ethidium displacement from DNA, as-DACA bound DNA 16-fold more strongly than did DACA. Uptake and efflux of DACA and as-DACA were very rapid and the uptake ratios in LLTC cells were 550 for DACA and 54 for as-DACA. At equitoxic concentrations (corresponding to the IC50 values), LLTC cell association was estimated to be approximately 1.6 x 10(8) molecules per cell for DACA and 3.0 x 10(6) molecules per cell for as-DACA. It is argued that DACA binds predominantly to lipophilic sites such as proteins and cellular membranes, while as-DACA associates predominantly with DNA. The high affinity of DACA for membranes may contribute to the rapidity of its uptake and efflux, as well as to its ability to overcome multidrug resistance.","['Haldane, A', 'Finlay, G J', 'Hay, M P', 'Denny, W A', 'Baguley, B C']","['Haldane A', 'Finlay GJ', 'Hay MP', 'Denny WA', 'Baguley BC']","['Auckland Cancer Society Research Centre, University of Auckland School of Medicine, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,IM,"['Acridines/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Lewis Lung/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Intercalating Agents/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/09/29 00:00,1999/09/29 00:01,['1999/09/29 00:00'],"['1999/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1999 Jun;14(3):275-80.,,,,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', ""89459-25-6 (N-(2'-(dimethylamino)ethyl)acridine-4-carboxamide)""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown to bind in the minor groove of DNA forming covalent adducts by reaction of the N2 of guanine with the carbinolamine moiety. We investigated ET-743 ability to inhibit the binding of different transcription factors to their consensus sequences by using gel shift assays. We have selected three types of factors: (i) oncogene products such as MYC, c-MYB and Maf; (ii) transcriptional activators regulated during the cell cycle as E2F and SRF; and (iii) general transcription factors such as TATA binding protein (TBP), Sp1 and NF-Y. We observed no inhibition of the binding of Sp1, Maf, MYB and MYC. Inhibition of DNA binding was observed for TBP, E2F, SRF at ET-743 concentrations ranging from 50 to 300 microM. The inhibition of binding of NF-Y occurs at even lower concentrations (i.e. 10-30 microM) when the recombinant subunits of NF-Y are preincubated with the drug, indicating that the inhibition of NF-Y binding does not require previous ET-743 DNA binding. Since NF-Y is a trimer containing two subunits with high resemblance to histones H2B and H2A, we have investigated the effect of ET-743 on nucleosome reconstitution. ET-743 caused a decrease of the nucleosomal band at 100 nM, with the complete disappearance of the band at 3-10 microM. These data suggest that the mode of action of this novel anticancer drug is related to its ability to modify the interaction between some DNA binding proteins and DNA.","['Bonfanti, M', 'La Valle, E', 'Fernandez Sousa Faro, J M', 'Faircloth, G', 'Caretti, G', 'Mantovani, R', ""D'Incalci, M""]","['Bonfanti M', 'La Valle E', 'Fernandez Sousa Faro JM', 'Faircloth G', 'Caretti G', 'Mantovani R', ""D'Incalci M""]","['Department of Oncology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Dioxoles/*pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotides/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'TATA-Box Binding Protein', 'Tetrahydroisoquinolines', 'Trabectedin', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",1999/09/29 00:00,1999/09/29 00:01,['1999/09/29 00:00'],"['1999/09/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1999 Jun;14(3):179-86.,,,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Dioxoles)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (TATA-Box Binding Protein)', '0 (Tetrahydroisoquinolines)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'ID0YZQ2TCP (Trabectedin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the occurrence of HAM/TSP was reported to be associated with MHC class II, the mechanism is still unclear. The WKA(RT1k) strain of rats was reported to develop HAM/TSP-like paraparesis after HTLV-1 infection, and was suggested to be an animal model of HAM/TSP. We asked whether MHC k-haplotype is specifically involved in the pathogenesis of paraparesis of WKA(RT1k) rats. We injected the HTLV-1 producing human T cells (MT-2 cells) intravenously into WKA(RT1k) rats and MHC congenic WKA.1L(RT1l) rats which have MHC l-haplotype of LEW rats on the WKA background. Positive antibody response to HTLV-1 antigens and presence of provirus in peripheral blood mononuclear cells confirmed that MT-2 cell-injected rats were infected with HTLV-1. Two of 13 MT-2 cell-injected WKA(RT1k) rats and five of 13 MT-2 cell-injected WKA.1L(RT1l) rats developed HAM/TSP-like hindlimb paraparesis between 16 and 26 months old.

The t(1;19) translocation results in the production of a chimeric transcription factor containing the N-terminal transactivation domain of E2A fused to the C-terminal DNA-binding homeodomain of Pbx1. Here, we show that the E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein activates the expression of a novel WNT gene, WNT-16. WNT-16 normally is expressed in peripheral lymphoid organs such as spleen, appendix, and lymph nodes, but not in bone marrow. In contrast, high levels of WNT-16 transcripts are present in bone marrow and cell lines derived from pre-B ALL patients carrying the E2A-Pbx1 hybrid gene. Inhibition of E2A-Pbx1 expression leads to a significant decrease in WNT-16 mRNA levels, suggesting that WNT-16 is a downstream target of E2A-Pbx1. Three putative WNT receptors, FZ-2, FZ-3, and FZ-5, are expressed in cells of the B lineage, including pre-B ALL cells aberrantly expressing WNT-16.

In this work, a 201-kilobase genomic DNA region containing the entire PLZF gene was sequenced. Repeated elements account for 19.83%, and no obvious coding information other than PLZF is present over this region. PLZF contains six exons and five introns, and the exon organization corresponds well with protein domains. There are at least four alternative splicings (AS-I, -II, -III, and -IV) within exon 1. AS-I could be detected in most tissues tested whereas AS-II, -III, and -IV were present in the stomach, testis, and heart, respectively. Although splicing donor and acceptor signals at exon-intron boundaries for AS-I and exons 1-6 were classical (gt-ag), AS-II, -III, and -IV had atypical splicing sites. These alternative splicings, nevertheless, maintained the ORF and may encode isoforms with absence of important functional domains. In mRNA species without AS-I, there is a relatively long 5' UTR of 6.0 kilobases. A TATA box and several transcription factor binding sites were found in the putative promoter region upstream of the transcription start site. PLZF is a well conserved gene from Caenorhabditis elegans to human. PLZF paralogous sequences are found in human genome.

Cell growth inhibition and drug-induced inhibition of de novo thymidylate and purine biosynthesis were used as measures of the cellular effects of the drugs. CCRF-CEM:RC2Tomudex cells had <11% of the FPGS activity of CCRF-CEM cells, whereas MTX uptake and TS activity were equivalent. In CCRF-CEM:RC2Tomudex cells, MTX polyglutamate formation was undetectable after exposure to 1 microM [3H]MTX for 24 h. After exposure to 0.1 microM raltitrexed, levels of total intracellular raltitrexed-derived material in CCRF-CEM:RC2Tomudex cells were 30- to 50-fold lower than in the CCRF-CEM cell line. CCRF-CEM: RC2Tomudex cells were >1000-fold resistant to raltitrexed and 6-fold resistant to lometrexol but sensitive to MTX and nolatrexed when exposed to these antifolates for 96 h. After 6 h of exposure, CCRF-CEM cells retained sensitivity to MTX and raltitrexed but were less sensitive to lometrexol-mediated growth inhibition. In contrast, CCRF-CEM: RC2Tomudex cells were markedly insensitive to raltitrexed, lometrexol, and to a lesser degree, MTX. Simultaneous measurement of de novo thymidylate and purine biosynthesis revealed 90% inhibition of TS activity by 100 nM MTX in both cell lines, whereas inhibition of de novo purine synthesis was only observed in CCRF-CEM cells, and only after exposure to 1000 nM MTX. Ten nM raltitrexed induced >90% inhibition of TS activity in CCRF-CEM cells, whereas in CCRF-CEM:RC2Tomudex cells, there was no evidence of inhibition after exposure to 1000 nM raltitrexed.

One biologically active form of vitamin A is all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), which binds to retinoic acid receptors, as does its intracellular metabolite, 9-cis-RA. Earlier studies have documented G1 cell cycle arrest and the induction of apoptosis in human adult T-cell leukemia cells after ATRA treatment. Previous work exploring the growth-inhibitory activity of ATRA in human malignancies has implicated several mechanisms that can arrest cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, including activation of p21Waf1 and inhibition of cyclin D1 expression. Therefore, we decided to examine the effects of ATRA exposure on G1 cell cycle components in human adult T-cell leukemia cells. Our data demonstrate a correlation between cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase activity and subunit complex formation with duration of drug exposure.

Furthermore, we observed a differential effect on cell cycle progression that was temporally related to length of ATRA exposure.

Records of 365 consecutive newly diagnosed adult ALL patients treated with: (a) vincristine-, doxorubicin-, and dexamethasone-based chemotherapy (VAD, n = 219; 1984-1992); or (b) fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone, alternating with methotrexate/high-dose cytarabine (HCVAD, n = 146; 1993-1996), were analyzed. The complete remission (CR) rates were 73% with VAD and 91% with HCVAD (P<0.0001). Three-year event-free survival (EFS) rates were 23 and 40%, respectively (P = 0.00003). The impact of D7PBb and D14BMb on outcome varied with the induction regimen. Patients treated with VAD who had D7PBb had similar EFS rates compared with patients without D7PBb (P = 0.12), but EFS was inferior if they had persistent D14BMb compared with those patients without D14BMb (P = 0.00006). In HCVAD-treated patients, EFS was significantly worse in patients with persistent D7PBb (P = 0.003) but not in patients with D14BMb (P = 0.19). By multivariate analysis, D14BMb was an independent adverse feature for patients treated with VAD, whereas D7PBb was an independent adverse feature for EFS in HCVAD-treated patients. Early clearance of leukemia cells from blood and bone marrow is associated with improved outcome in adult ALL, but the prognostic significance of D7PBb and D14BMb clearance varies with treatment efficacy.","['Cortes, J', 'Fayad, L', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Keating, M', 'Kantarjian, H']","['Cortes J', 'Fayad L', ""O'Brien S"", 'Keating M', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1999/09/28 00:00,1999/09/28 00:01,['1999/09/28 00:00'],"['1999/09/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/28 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1999 Sep;5(9):2491-7.,,,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'HCVAD protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have also made and characterized two cell lines that are not sensitive to the growth inhibitory and cytotoxic effects of CAFdA. Incubation of cells isolated from the blood of CLL and AML patients with various concentrations of CdA or of CAFdA accumulated CdA and CAFdA nucleotides in a dose-dependent manner. A significantly higher rate of phosphorylation to monophosphates was observed for CAFdA than for CdA in cells from CLL patients (n = 14; P = 0.04). The differences in the phosphorylation were even more pronounced for the respective triphosphates in both CLL (n = 14; P = 0.001) and AML (n = 4; P = 0.04) cells. Retention of CAFdA 5'-triphosphate (CAFdATP) was also longer than that for CdA 5'-triphosphate (CdATP) in cells from leukemic patients. The relative efficacy of CAFdA as a substrate for purified recombinant deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), the key enzyme in the activation of nucleoside analogues, was very high and exceeded that of CdA as well as the natural substrate, deoxycytidine, by a factor of 2 and 8, respectively. The Km for CAFdA with dCK was also lower than that for CdA, as measured in crude extracts from the human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CCRF-CEM and the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60. Acquired resistance to CAFdA in HL60 and in CCRF-CEM cell lines was directly correlated to the decreased activity of the nucleoside phosphorylating enzyme, dCK. Resistant cells also showed a considerable degree of cross-resistance to analogues that were activated by dCK. These observations demonstrated that dCK phosphorylates CAFdA more efficiently than CdA. Furthermore, CAFdATP is apparently more stable than CdATP and the mechanisms of resistance to CAFdA are similar to those leading to CdA resistance. These results encourage studies on the clinical effect of CAFdA in lymphoproliferative diseases.","['Lotfi, K', 'Mansson, E', 'Spasokoukotskaja, T', 'Pettersson, B', 'Liliemark, J', 'Peterson, C', 'Eriksson, S', 'Albertioni, F']","['Lotfi K', 'Mansson E', 'Spasokoukotskaja T', 'Pettersson B', 'Liliemark J', 'Peterson C', 'Eriksson S', 'Albertioni F']","['Department of Medicine and Care, Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Arabinonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Cladribine/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Clofarabine', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/09/28 00:00,1999/09/28 00:01,['1999/09/28 00:00'],"['1999/09/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/28 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1999 Sep;5(9):2438-44.,,,,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used a highly sensitive assay to quantify leukemic progenitor cells (LPCs) in the bone marrow of such patients. Multiparameter flow cytometry and blast colony assays were used to detect LPCs in the bone marrow of 31 pediatric B-lineage ALL patients with an isolated extramedullary first relapse. Sites of relapse were central nervous system (22 patients), testes (7 patients), and eye (2 patients). Bone marrow (BM) LPC counts ranged from 0/10(6) mononuclear cells (MNCs) to 356/10(6) MNCs (mean +/- SE, 27.8+/-13.1/10(6) MNCs). LPCs were undetectable in 19 patients (61%). The BM LPC burden at the time of extramedullary relapse was similar, regardless of site (Wilcoxon P = 0.77) or time of relapse (Wilcoxon P = 0.80). Compared with higher risk, standard risk at initial diagnosis showed a trend for increased BM LPC burden (mean +/- SE, 44.6+/-17.1 versus 7.5+/-3.3; Wilcoxon P = 0.22). After successful postrelapse induction chemotherapy, LPC counts in 21 evaluated patients ranged from 0/10(6) to 175/10(6) MNCs (mean +/- SE, 15.9+/-9.6/10(6) MNCs). By comparison, LPC burden was higher after successful induction chemotherapy among children with an early BM relapse (range, 0 to 3262/ 106 MNC; mean +/- SE, 166+/-107; Wilcoxon P = 0.11). Thus, not all patients with an extramedullary relapse have occult systemic failure with substantial involvement of the bone marrow, and after reinduction therapy, LPC counts were lower in these patients than in patients treated for an overt BM first relapse.","['Uckun, F M', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Stram, D O', 'Sensel, M G', 'Sarquis, M B', 'Lazarus, K H', 'Willoughby, M']","['Uckun FM', 'Gaynon PS', 'Stram DO', 'Sensel MG', 'Sarquis MB', 'Lazarus KH', 'Willoughby M']","['ALL Biology Reference Laboratory, Parker Hughes Cancer Center, Hughes Institute, St. Paul, Minnesota 55113, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/pathology/secondary', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Eye Neoplasms/pathology/secondary', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Testicular Neoplasms/pathology/secondary', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1999/09/28 00:00,1999/09/28 00:01,['1999/09/28 00:00'],"['1999/09/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/28 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1999 Sep;5(9):2415-20.,,,,,['CA-13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Fhit protein expression was detected in only 24% of primary ALLs and leukemia/lymphoma cell lines, but it was detected in all lymphoblastoid cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocyte samples. Interestingly, Fhit protein expression was lost in all T-cell ALLs but was lost in only half of the B-cell ALLs. Northern blotting of 7 normal lymphoblastoid cell lines and 13 of the neoplastic cell lines confirmed the results obtained by Western blotting regarding FHIT expression.

Here we demonstrate that these analogs, as well as the 6-cis-locked conformer, 1alpha,25-dihydroxy-lumisterol3 (JN) prime NB4 cells for monocytic differentiation. Previously, the action of MC903 and KH1060 was presumed to be mediated by the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDRnuc). Differentiation in response to all analogs was shown to be inhibited by 1beta,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (HL), the antagonist to the nongenomic activities of 1,25D3. These data suggest that although MC903 and KH1060 may bind the VDRnuc, that the differentiative activities of these agents requires nongenomic signaling pathways. Here we show that 1alpha,25(OH)2-d5-previtamin D3 (HF), JN, KH1060, and MC903 induce expression of PKC alpha and PKC delta and translocation of both isoforms to the particulate fraction, and PKC alpha to the nuclear fraction.

New standard of care, emerging strategies.","1075-88; discussion 1088, 1091-4","The optimal therapy for locally advanced, unresectable, stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) continues to evolve. The critical determinants of overall survival include local tumor control and the eradication of subclinical micrometastatic disease. Historically, standard radiation therapy resulted in a median survival of 7 to 10 months. In a randomized trial, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) established the superiority of induction cisplatin (Platinol) and vinblastine chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy. Additional studies revealed that induction chemotherapy improved survival rates by decreasing metastatic disease progression. Three independent meta-analyses confirmed the survival benefit afforded by cisplatin-based induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy, and helped to establish this as the new standard of care. Other investigators have demonstrated improvements in local tumor control and survival with either concurrent chemoradiotherapy or hyperfractionated radiotherapy. Most recently, attention has focused on radiation dose intensity and the utilization of newer, highly active chemotherapeutic agents with concurrent or sequential radiation therapy. These newer drugs, including paclitaxel (Taxol), docetaxel (Taxotere), gemcitabine (Gemzar), vinorelbine (Navelbine), and irinotecan (Camptosar), enhance radiation cytotoxicity and, when administered in systemically active dosages, may also control micrometastatic disease.

Certain 'high risk' groups in society, who were considered as susceptible to the disease, homosexuals and intravenous drug users in particular, became the victims of prejudice and discrimination. More recent research has indicated a possible shift to a more positive orientation, although the findings are far from conclusive. In this current study, the Prejudicial Evaluation and Social Interaction Scale (PESIS) was administered to four separate cohorts of student nurses approximately a year apart in training (n = 192). Each cohort was divided into four groups, each one completing the PESIS after reading a version of a vignette that described either a person with AIDS or leukaemia, and who was either homosexual or heterosexual. The design therefore allowed for within-group and between-group comparisons. Overall the results showed that the student nurses held positive attitudes although they reported a significantly greater prejudice towards AIDS. No significant differences were found for sexual orientation. Additionally significantly greater levels of blame and responsibility were associated with the person with AIDS, but again there was no effect for sexual orientation. The findings suggest that a slightly more negative attitude continues to be associated with a diagnosis of AIDS but no longer with homosexuality. No effect across cohorts was noted either, student nurses being as positive at the beginning of training as at the end. Some of the limitations of PESIS and the difficulties of attitude assessment in general are discussed and future areas of research are identified.","['Stewart, D']",['Stewart D'],"['Department of Psychology, University of Luton, Beds.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Adv Nurs,Journal of advanced nursing,7609811,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/nursing/psychology', '*Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Cohort Studies', '*Education, Nursing', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/nursing/psychology', 'HIV-1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/nursing/psychology', 'Male', 'Nurse-Patient Relations', 'Prejudice', 'Research Design', '*Sexuality/statistics & numerical data', 'Students, Nursing/*psychology/statistics & numerical data']",1999/09/28 00:00,1999/09/28 00:01,['1999/09/28 00:00'],"['1999/09/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/28 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Adv Nurs. 1999 Sep;30(3):740-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2648.1999.01140.x.,,,['10.1046/j.1365-2648.1999.01140.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a consequence of the translocation RARalpha variably fuses to the PML, PLZF, NPM and NUMA genes (X genes), leading to the generation of RARalpha-X and X-RARalpha fusion genes. The aberrant chimeric proteins encoded by these genes may exert a crucial role in leukemogenesis. Retinoic acid (RA), a metabolite of vitamin A, can overcome the block of maturation at the promyelocytic stage and induce the malignant cells to terminally mature into granulocytes resulting in complete albeit transient disease remission. APL has become, for this reason, the paradigm for 'cancer differentiation therapy'. Furthermore, APL associated with translocation between the RARalpha and the PLZF genes (PLZF-RARalpha) shows a distinctly worse prognosis with poor response to chemotherapy and little or no response to treatment with RA, thus defining a new APL syndrome. Here we will focus our attention on the recent progresses made in defining the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of this paradigmatic disease in vivo in the mouse. We will review the critical contribution of mouse modeling in unraveling the transcriptional basis for the differential response to RA in APL. We will also discuss how this new understanding has allowed to propose, develop and test in these murine leukemia models as well as in human APL patients novel therapeutic strategies.","['He, L Z', 'Merghoub, T', 'Pandolfi, P P']","['He LZ', 'Merghoub T', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Department of Human Genetics and Molecular Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Sloan-Kettering Division, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Cornell University, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/etiology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",1999/09/28 00:00,1999/09/28 00:01,['1999/09/28 00:00'],"['1999/09/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/28 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Sep 20;18(38):5278-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203088.,,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1203088 [doi]'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,119,,,,,,,,,

One of our synthetic compounds, MT-21, induced apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells similar to Fas. MT-21 activated caspase-3, an important cysteine aspartic protease for apoptosis induction. MT-21 also activated c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), a member of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily that is involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and cell death. Moreover, MT-21 treatment resulted in the activation of a 36 kDa kinase which uses myelin basic protein (MBP) as a substrate. However, MAPK and p38 were not activated by treatment with MT-21. The 36 kDa MBP kinase was shown to be a proteolytic product derived from the Krs protein with a molecular weight of 60 kDa. The Krs protein is a Ser/Thr protein kinase whose activity is enhanced by digestion of its C-terminal regulatory domain by caspase-3. When a kinase-inactive mutant form of Krs protein was overexpressed in HL-60 cells, JNK activation and apoptosis induction by MT-21 were suppressed. Furthermore, overexpression of dominant negative c-Jun also suppressed apoptosis induction by MT-21. These findings indicate that MT-21 induces apoptosis by the activation of JNK via the Krs protein, which is activated by caspase cleavage.","['Watabe, M', 'Kakeya, H', 'Osada, H']","['Watabe M', 'Kakeya H', 'Osada H']","['Laboratory of Antibiotics, The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Genes, jun', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/pharmacology', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Myelin Basic Protein/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*physiology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Serine-Threonine Kinase 3', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'U937 Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",1999/09/28 00:00,1999/09/28 00:01,['1999/09/28 00:00'],"['1999/09/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/28 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/28 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Sep 16;18(37):5211-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202901.,,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1202901 [doi]'],"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MT 21)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myelin Basic Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (STK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (STK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Serine-Threonine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This region was shown to be active in both EphA3-expressing and -nonexpressing cell lines, contrasting with the widely different levels of EphA3 expression. We noted a region rich in CpG dinucleotides downstream of the basal promoter. Using Southern blot analyses with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes and bisulfite sequencing of genomic DNA, sites of DNA methylation were identified in hematopoietic cell lines which correlated with their levels of EphA3 gene expression.

Because post-translational processing of Ras by farnesyltransferase is essential for biologic function, inhibitors of this enzyme have been developed as rational cancer therapeutics. We have investigated farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) L-744,832 in an in vivo murine model of myeloid leukemia that is associated with inactivation of the Nf1 tumor suppressor gene. Nf1 encodes a GTPase activating protein for Ras, and Nf1-deficient (Nf1-/-) hematopoietic cells show hyperactive Ras signaling through the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. L-744,832 inhibited H-Ras prenylation in cell lines and in primary hematopoietic cells and abrogated the in vitro growth of myeloid progenitor colonies in response to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). This FTI also partially blocked GM-CSF-induced MAP kinase activation, but did not reduce constitutively elevated levels of MAP kinase activity in primary Nf1-/- cells. Injection of a single dose of 40 or 80 mg/kg of L-744, 832 increased the amount of unprocessed H-Ras in bone marrow cells, but had no detectable effect on N-Ras. Adoptive transfer of Nf1-/- hematopoietic cells into irradiated mice induces a myeloproliferative disorder that did not respond to L-744,832 treatment. We speculate that the lack of efficacy in this model is due to the resistance of N-Ras and K-Ras processing to inhibition by this FTI.","['Mahgoub, N', 'Taylor, B R', 'Gratiot, M', 'Kohl, N E', 'Gibbs, J B', 'Jacks, T', 'Shannon, K M']","['Mahgoub N', 'Taylor BR', 'Gratiot M', 'Kohl NE', 'Gibbs JB', 'Jacks T', 'Shannon KM']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', 'Female', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Leukocyte Count/drug effects', 'Liver/cytology/embryology', 'Male', 'Methionine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neurofibromin 1', 'Protein Prenylation', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",1999/09/25 00:00,1999/09/25 00:01,['1999/09/25 00:00'],"['1999/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Oct 1;94(7):2469-76.,,,['S0006-4971(20)71120-1 [pii]'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (L 744832)', '0 (Neurofibromin 1)', '0 (Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']","['DK07636/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA72614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we queried whether both the Ph'-associated and normal ABL1 alleles undergo methylation; what may be the proportion of hematopoietic progenitors bearing methylated ABL1 promoters in chronic versus acute phase disease; whether methylation affects the promoter uniformly or in patches with discrete clinical relevance; and, finally, whether methylation of ABL1 reflects a generalized process or is gene-specific. To address these issues, we adapted the techniques of methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite-sequencing to study the regulatory regions of ABL1 and other genes with a role in DNA repair or genotoxic stress response. In cell lines established from CML blast crisis, which only carry a single ABL1 allele nested within the BCR-ABL fusion gene, ABL1 promoters were universally methylated. By contrast, in clinical samples from patients at advanced stages of disease, both methylated and unmethylated promoter alleles were detectable. To distinguish between allele-specific methylation and a mixed cell population pattern, we studied the methylation status of ABL1 in colonies derived from single hematopoietic progenitors. Our results showed that both methylated and unmethylated promoter alleles coexisted in the same colony. Furthermore, ABL1 methylation was noted in the vast majority of colonies from blast crisis, but not chronic-phase CML. Both cell lines and clinical samples from acute-phase CML showed nearly uniform hypermethylation along the promoter region. Finally, we showed that ABL1 methylation does not reflect a generalized process and may be unique among DNA repair/genotoxic stress response genes. Our data suggest that specific methylation of the Ph'-associated ABL1 allele accompanies clonal evolution in CML.","['Asimakopoulos, F A', 'Shteper, P J', 'Krichevsky, S', 'Fibach, E', 'Polliack, A', 'Rachmilewitz, E', 'Ben-Neriah, Y', 'Ben-Yehuda, D']","['Asimakopoulos FA', 'Shteper PJ', 'Krichevsky S', 'Fibach E', 'Polliack A', 'Rachmilewitz E', 'Ben-Neriah Y', 'Ben-Yehuda D']","['Department of Hematology, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Alleles', 'Blast Crisis/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', '*Oncogenes', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/09/25 00:00,1999/09/25 00:01,['1999/09/25 00:00'],"['1999/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Oct 1;94(7):2452-60.,,,['S0006-4971(20)71147-X [pii]'],"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Dinucleoside Phosphates)', ""2382-65-2 (cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine)"", 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore the relationship between patterns of methylation and gene transcription, we used bisulfite genomic sequencing to obtain a detailed analysis of methylation in acute leukemia, leukemia cell lines, and normal lymphocytes. The entire CpG island region of p15 was largely devoid of methylation in normal lymphocytes, but methylation of varying density was found in primary acute leukemia. Methylation density was generally conserved between the alleles from each sample, but marked heterogeneity for the specific CpG sites methylated was observed. Patterns of methylation were compared and expression assessed with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The density of methylation within the CpG island, and not any specific location, correlates best with transcriptional loss. Leukemias with methylation of approximately 40% of the CpG dinucleotides on each allele had complete gene silencing, with variable, but diminished expression with less dense CpG island methylation. Our results suggest that the transcriptional silencing of p15 in conjunction with aberrant hypermethylation is best understood as an evolutionary process that involves progressively increasing methylation of the entire p15 CpG island.","['Cameron, E E', 'Baylin, S B', 'Herman, J G']","['Cameron EE', 'Baylin SB', 'Herman JG']","['The Oncology Center, Department of Medicine, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', '*Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'DNA Methylation', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1999/09/25 00:00,1999/09/25 00:01,['1999/09/25 00:00'],"['1999/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Oct 1;94(7):2445-51.,,,['S0006-4971(20)71143-2 [pii]'],"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Dinucleoside Phosphates)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', ""2382-65-2 (cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine)""]",['CA43318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared microsatellite instability (MSI) at 10 loci in 37 lymphoid tumors, including 16 acute lymphoid leukemias (ALL) and 21 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), and in 29 acute myeloid leukemias (AML). Significant differences in MSI prevalence between AMLs and ALLs emerged, and MSI occurrence was more frequent in the NHLs versus AMLs. Indeed, only 3 of 29 (10%) AMLs exhibited MSI, thus confirming its paucity in myeloid tumors, while 10 of 37 (27%) lymphoid tumors, 6 ALLs and 4 NHLs, disclosed an RER(+) phenotype. In 1 ALL patient, the same molecular alterations were observed in correspondence with a relapse, but were not detected during remission over a 14-month follow-up; in another ALL patient, findings correlated with impending clinical relapse. These results suggest that the study of MSI in lymphoid tumors might provide a useful molecular tool to monitor disease progression in a subset of ALLs. To correlate MSI with other known genetic abnormalities, we investigated the status of the proto-oncogene, bcl-2, in the lymphoma patients and found that 4 of 4 NHL patients with MSI carried bcl-2 rearrangements, thus linking genomic instability to enhanced cell survival in NHL; moreover, no p53 mutations were found in these patients. Finally, we addressed the putative cause of MSI in hematopoietic tumors by searching for both mutations and deletions affecting DNA repair genes. A limited genetic analysis did not show any tumor-specific mutation in MLH1 exons 9 and 16 and in MSH2 exons 5 and 13. However, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of markers closely linked to mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, and PMS2 was demonstrated in 4 of 6 ALLs and 1 of 3 AMLs with MSI.

These cells appeared noncycling, in contrast to the proliferating rhodamine bright (RhoB) cells. We postulated that MDR expression can be downregulated by proliferation induction. Triggering rhodamine dull (RhoD) CD34(+) cells to proliferate indeed resulted in a higher rhodamine retention and significantly decreased efflux modulation by verapamil (P =.04). Also in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the proliferation rate (percentage S/G(2)+M and Iododeoxyuridine labelings index) was significantly less in the RhoD blasts (P </=. 008) and proliferation induction of RhoD blasts resulted in increased rhodamine retention. Anthracycline cytotoxicity was less for RhoD than RhoB cells in both normal progenitors and leukemic blasts. Proliferation induction of the RhoD cells resulted in increased anthracycline sensitivity. We conclude that noncycling progenitors, both normal and leukemic, have a relatively high MDR expression. Triggering these cells into proliferation downregulates MDR expression.

We clearly demonstrated here the production and release of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a matrix-degrading enzyme necessary for leukocyte transmigration, by interleukin-3-dependent mouse mast cell progenitors: bone marrow-derived cultured mast cells and IC-2 mast cells. Because several interleukin-3-independent mast cell lines with active mutations in the c-kit gene did not release MMP-9, the possible involvement of c-kit receptor activation in downregulation of MMP-9 production was predicted. c-kit receptor activation by stem cell factor led to a significant decrease in MMP-9 production of cultured mast cells and IC-2 mast cells transfected with the c-kit gene.

Both cell types derive from CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors. However, little is known about the cell subsets that become committed to and give rise to Ba and/or MC. We have generated a monoclonal antibody (MoAb), 97A6, that specifically detects human Ba, MC (lung, skin), and their CD34(+) progenitors. Other mature hematopoietic cells (neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, platelets) did not react with MoAb 97A6, and sorting of 97A6(+) peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) cells resulted in an almost pure population (>98%) of Ba. Approximately 1% of CD34(+) BM and PB cells was found to be 97A6(+). Culture of sorted CD34(+)97A6(+) BM cells in semisolid medium containing phytohemagglutinin-stimulated leukocyte supernatant for 16 days (multilineage assay) resulted in the formation of pure Ba colonies (10 of 40), Ba-eosinophil colonies (7 of 40), Ba-macrophage colonies (3 of 40), and multilineage Ba-eosinophil-macrophage and/or neutrophil colonies (12 of 40). In contrast, no Ba could be cultured from CD34(+)97A6(-) cells. Liquid culture of CD34(+) PB cells in the presence of 100 ng/mL interleukin (IL)-3 (Ba progenitor assay) resulted in an increase of 97A6(+) cells, starting from 1% of day-0 cells to almost 70% (basophils) after day 7. Culture of sorted BM CD34(+)97A6(+) cells in the presence of 100 ng/mL stem cell factor (SCF) for 35 days (mast cell progenitor assay) resulted in the growth of MC (>30% on day 35). Anti-IgE-induced IgE receptor cross-linking on Ba for 15 minutes resulted in a 4-fold to 5-fold upregulation of 97A6 antigen expression. These data show that the 97A6-reactive antigen plays a role in basophil activation and is expressed on multipotent CD34(+) progenitors, MC progenitors, Ba progenitors, as well as on mature Ba and tissue MC. The lineage-specificity of MoAb 97A6 suggests that this novel marker may be a useful tool to isolate and analyze Ba/MC and their progenitors.","['Buhring, H J', 'Simmons, P J', 'Pudney, M', 'Muller, R', 'Jarrossay, D', 'van Agthoven, A', 'Willheim, M', 'Brugger, W', 'Valent, P', 'Kanz, L']","['Buhring HJ', 'Simmons PJ', 'Pudney M', 'Muller R', 'Jarrossay D', 'van Agthoven A', 'Willheim M', 'Brugger W', 'Valent P', 'Kanz L']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany. hjbuehri@med.uni-tuebingen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/genetics', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis/genetics', 'Basophils/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Histamine Release', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Lung/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Skin/cytology']",1999/09/25 00:00,1999/09/25 00:01,['1999/09/25 00:00'],"['1999/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Oct 1;94(7):2343-56.,,,['S0006-4971(20)71150-X [pii]'],"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using this assay, we previously showed improved gene transfer into canine hematopoietic repopulating cells when CD34-enriched marrow cells were cocultivated on gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV)-based retrovirus vector-producing cells. In the present study, we have investigated the use of fibronectin fragment CH-296 and 2 growth factor combinations to further improve gene transfer efficiency. CD34-enriched marrow cells from each dog were prestimulated for 24 hours and then divided into 3 equal fractions. Two fractions were placed into flasks coated with either CH-296 or bovine serum albumin (BSA) and virus-containing medium supplemented with growth factors, and protamine sulfate was replaced 4 times over a 48-hour period. One fraction was cocultivated on irradiated PG13 (GALV-pseudotype) packaging cells for 48 hours. In 2 animals, cells of the different fractions were transduced in the presence of human FLT-3 ligand (FLT3L), canine stem cell factor (cSCF), and human megakaryocyte growth and development factor (MGDF), and in 2 other dogs, transduction was performed in the presence of FLT3L, cSCF, and canine granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (cG-CSF). The vectors used contained small sequence differences, allowing differentiation of cells genetically marked by the different vectors. After transduction, nonadherent and adherent cells from all 3 fractions were pooled and infused into lethally irradiated dogs. Polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analysis were used to determine the persistence of the transferred vectors in the peripheral blood and marrow cells after transplantation. The highest levels of gene transfer were obtained when cells were transduced in the presence of FLT3L, cSCF, and cG-CSF (gene transfer levels of more than 10% for more than 8 months so far). Compared with the 2 animals that received cells transduced with FLT3L, cSCF, and MGDF, gene transfer levels were significantly higher when dogs received cells that were transduced in the presence of cG-CSF. Transduction on CH-296 resulted in gene transfer levels that were at least as high as transduction by cocultivation. In summary, the overall levels of gene transfer obtained with these conditions should be sufficiently high to allow stem cell gene therapy studies aimed at correcting genetic diseases in dogs as a model for human gene therapy.","['Goerner, M', 'Bruno, B', 'McSweeney, P A', 'Buron, G', 'Storb, R', 'Kiem, H P']","['Goerner M', 'Bruno B', 'McSweeney PA', 'Buron G', 'Storb R', 'Kiem HP']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Cattle', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dogs', 'Fibronectins/*pharmacology', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Thrombopoietin/pharmacology', 'Transfection/methods']",1999/09/25 00:00,1999/09/25 00:01,['1999/09/25 00:00'],"['1999/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Oct 1;94(7):2287-92.,,,['S0006-4971(20)71151-1 [pii]'],"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']","['DK42716/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL03701/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We have compared the outcome of matched and mismatched transplants from unrelated donors in 137 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Their disease status was complete remission (CR)-1, 24 patients; CR-2, 88 patients; CR-3, 18 patients; CR-4, 2 patients; and relapse, 5 patients. CAMPATH monoclonal antibodies were used for T-cell depletion and cyclosporin A was given to 134 children together with short-course methotrexate in 43, mainly when there was HLA disparity. Fifty-two donor/recipient pairs were HLA-mismatched, 41 at HLA-A and -B and 11 at HLA-DR and -DQ loci. Overall graft failure was increased in recipients of marrow mismatched at either HLA-A, -B, -DR, or -DQ (15.7% v 4.8%; P =.057) mainly because there was a higher proportion of children with primary graft failure (11. 8% v 1.2%; P =.012). The presence of an HLA-C locus mismatch did not independently increase the likelihood of graft failure. There was no significant difference in the incidence of acute GVHD >/= grade 2 between the matched and mismatched groups (P =.849). For patients in CR-2, the risk of relapse post-BMT was significantly lower if leukemic relapse occurred off-treatment (P =.005). The Kaplan-Meier overall and leukemia-free survival (LFS) estimates for recipients of matched and mismatched BMT, respectively, at 36 months were 49% versus 42% (P =.380) and 45% versus 40% (P =.654).

Because serum tretinoin concentrations are higher, and maintained longer, after use of liposomal-encapsulated ATRA (lipoATRA) rather than oral ATRA, we investigated lipoATRA monotherapy in newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Patients received lipoATRA 90 mg/m(2) every other day for remission induction. The same dose was given 3 times a week until 9 months had elapsed from HCR date. Treatment then stopped. Chemotherapy (idarubicin 12 mg/m(2) daily days 1-2 for 2 courses) was to be added only if 2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, performed 2 weeks apart, were positive at 3, 6, or 9 months from HCR date. The sensitivity level of the PCR was 10(-4). We treated 18 patients (median age, 54 years; median white blood cell [WBC] count 4,500/microL). The HCR rate was 12/18 (67%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 41% to 87%). This rate was similar to that we observed in a previous study using oral ATRA + idarubicin. Nine of 10 patients studied at HCR date were PCR-positive. Subsequently, however, overall (+/- idarubicin) rates of PCR positivity were 0/12 at 3 months, 1/10 at 6 months, 1/7 at 9 and 12 months, and 0/4 at 15 to 17 months. Idarubicin has been added in 3 patients, with this addition occurring at 6 months in 2 patients and at 9 months in 1 patient. Among patients who had not received idarubicin when the PCR was evaluated, 0 of 12 were PCR-positive at 3 months, 1 of 10 was positive at 6 months, 1 of 6 was positive at 9 months, 0 of 4 were positive at 12 months, and 0 of 3 were positive at 15 to 17 months. Morphologic APL has recurred in 1 patient, with a median follow-up time of 13 months in the 11 patients remaining in first CR. The median follow-up time is 91/2 months (range, 3 to 17) in the 9 patients who have received only lipoATRA and who remain PCR-negative and in first CR.

All patients had achieved first molecular remission after the AIDA protocol (all-trans retinoic acid [ATRA] + idarubicin) and were being prospectively monitored by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Molecular relapse was defined as reappearance of RT-PCR-positivity for the PML/RARalpha fusion (sensitivity 10(-4)) in 2 successive marrow samples collected during postconsolidation monitoring. The median duration of first molecular remission was 7.5 months (range, 2 to 25). Salvage therapy consisted of oral ATRA for 30 days followed by 4 daily courses of chemotherapy (CHT) with cytarabine 1 g/m(2)/d and mitoxantrone 6 mg/m(2)/d. Second molecular remission was obtained in 12 of 14 patients (86%). Seven of these 12 attained molecular remission after ATRA alone. Of the 2 patients who persisted PCR(+) after CHT, 1 died in remission and 1 progressed to hematologic relapse. Of 12 patients PCR(-), 8 received consolidation with autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT), and 4 received ATRA-containing maintenance.

Peripheral lymphocyte counts at baseline varied from 0.2 to 294.3 x 10(9)/L. During the first rituximab infusion, patients with lymphocyte counts exceeding 50.0 x 10(9)/L experienced a severe cytokine-release syndrome. Ninety minutes after onset of the infusion, serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) peaked in all patients. Elevated cytokine levels during treatment were associated with clinical symptoms, including fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and dyspnea. Lymphocyte and platelet counts dropped to 50% to 75% of baseline values within 12 hours after the onset of the infusion. Simultaneously, there was a 5-fold to 10-fold increase of liver enzymes, d-dimers, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as well as a prolongation of the prothrombin time. Frequency and severity of first-dose adverse events were dependent on the number of circulating tumor cells at baseline: patients with lymphocyte counts greater than 50.0 x 10(9)/L experienced significantly more adverse events of National Cancer Institute (NCI) grade III/IV toxicity than patients with less than 50.0 x 10(9)/L peripheral tumor cells (P = .0017). Due to massive side effects in the first patient treated with 375 mg/m(2) in 1 day, a fractionated dosing schedule was used in all subsequent patients with application of 50 mg rituximab on day 1, 150 mg on day 2, and the rest of the 375 mg/m(2) dose on day 3. While the patient with the leukemic variant of the mantle-cell NHL achieved a complete remission (9 months+) after treatment with 4 x 375 mg/m(2) rituximab, efficacy in patients with relapsed fludarabine-resistant B-CLL was poor: 1 partial remission, 7 cases of stable disease, and 1 progressive disease were observed in 9 evaluable patients with CLL.

PTLD developed in 78 recipients, with 64 cases occurring less than 1 year after transplantation. The cumulative incidence of PTLD was 1.0% +/- 0.3% at 10 years. Incidence was highest 1 to 5 months posttransplant (120 cases/10,000 patients/yr) followed by a steep decline to less than 5/10,000/yr among >/=1-year survivors. In multivariate analyses, risk of early-onset PTLD (<1 year) was strongly associated (P <.0001) with unrelated or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatched related donor (relative risk [RR] = 4.1), T-cell depletion of donor marrow (RR = 12.7), and use of antithymocyte globulin (RR = 6.4) or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (RR = 43.2) for prophylaxis or treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). There was a weaker association with the occurrence of acute GVHD grades II to IV (RR = 1.9, P =.02) and with conditioning regimens that included radiation (RR = 2.9, P =.02). Methods of T-cell depletion that selectively targeted T cells or T plus natural killer (NK) cells were associated with markedly higher risks of PTLD than methods that removed both T and B cells, such as the CAMPATH-1 monoclonal antibody or elutriation (P =.009). The only risk factor identified for late-onset PTLD was extensive chronic GVHD (RR = 4.0, P =.01). Rates of PTLD among patients with 2 or >/=3 major risk factors were 8.0% +/- 2.9% and 22% +/- 17.9%, respectively.

We used a very sensitive quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to investigate the levels of hybrid BCR/ABL mRNA in bone marrow cells of 20 patients with Philadelphia positive (Ph(+)) CML treated with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) as a single agent. Bone marrow samples were collected at diagnosis and at hematologic remission induced by IFN-alpha, or by hydroxyurea in case of resistance to IFN-alpha. The mean levels of BCR/ABL transcripts in bone marrow mononuclear cells of patients who showed a complete hematologic response to IFN-alpha were significantly reduced with respect to those at diagnosis (48 x 10(3) v 168 x 10(3); P <.001), whereas no difference was detected between the values at diagnosis and at hematologic remission in patients resistant to IFN-alpha. In cell culture experiments, IFN-alpha priming significantly reduced the levels of BCR/ABL hybrid transcripts in a dose-dependent manner in Ph+ bone marrow precursors obtained at diagnosis from patients who subsequently responded to IFN-alpha treatment (P < .005). No downmodulation was observed in bone marrow precursors from patients who subsequently proved to be IFN-resistant. These results indicate that downmodulation of BCR/ABL gene expression could be one of the mechanisms involved in the response of CML patients to IFN-alpha treatment.","['Pane, F', 'Mostarda, I', 'Selleri, C', 'Salzano, R', 'Raiola, A M', 'Luciano, L', 'Saglio, G', 'Rotoli, B', 'Salvatore, F']","['Pane F', 'Mostarda I', 'Selleri C', 'Salzano R', 'Raiola AM', 'Luciano L', 'Saglio G', 'Rotoli B', 'Salvatore F']","['CEINGE-Biotecnologie Avanzate, Dipartimento di Biochimica e Biotecnologie Mediche and Divisione di Ematologia, Facolta di Medicina, Universita Federico II, Naples, Italy. fabpane@unina.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Monocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Platelet Count', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1999/09/25 00:00,1999/09/25 00:01,['1999/09/25 00:00'],"['1999/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Oct 1;94(7):2200-7.,,,['S0006-4971(20)71123-7 [pii]'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cases were identified from the German Childhood Cancer Registry; controls came from population registration offices. Exposure was assessed via questionnaires and parental interviews. The study comprises 1184 leukemia cases, 234 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, 940 solid tumors, and 2588 controls. Preconception parental occupational exposures were positively but not statistically significantly related to all of the cancer types in the study. Maternal occupational exposure during pregnancy was a risk factor for childhood lymphomas [odds ratio (OR) = 3.87, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.54-9.75] but not for leukemia or solid tumors. ORs for parental occupational exposures were noticeably more pronounced in leukemia cases who were diagnosed in their first 18 months of life. A preconception paternal occupation in the nuclear industry under dosimetric surveillance yielded an OR of 1.80 (95% CI: 0.71-4.58). However, radiation doses of these fathers were often unknown or below the level of detection, and no dose exceeded 30 mSv. Prenatal X-ray examinations of the father (but not of the mother) were significantly related to childhood leukemia (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.10-1.61). No effects were observed for postnatal X-ray examinations of the child. The results suggest that, in Germany at present, exposures to ionizing radiation do not play a noticeable role in the development of childhood cancers. The major strengths of the study are its size and the population basis. The validity of the data from parental questionnaires and the possibility of residual confounding by socioeconomic factors are potential drawbacks.","['Meinert, R', 'Kaletsch, U', 'Kaatsch, P', 'Schuz, J', 'Michaelis, J']","['Meinert R', 'Kaletsch U', 'Kaatsch P', 'Schuz J', 'Michaelis J']","['Institut fur Medizinische Statistik und Dokumentation der Johannes Gutenberg-Universitat Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Odds Ratio', '*Parents', 'Pregnancy', 'Registries', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",1999/09/25 00:00,1999/09/25 00:01,['1999/09/25 00:00'],"['1999/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 1999 Sep;8(9):793-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence, however, is not entirely consistent. Very few studies have evaluated the potential parental occupational hazards by exposure time windows. The Children's Cancer Group recently completed a large-scale case-control study involving 1842 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cases and 1986 matched controls. The study examined the association of self-reported occupational exposure to various hydrocarbons among parents with risk of childhood ALL by exposure time window, immunophenotype of ALL, and age at diagnosis. We found that maternal exposure to solvents [odds ratio (OR), 1.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.3-2.5] and paints or thinners (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.2) during the preconception period (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3) and during pregnancy (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.3) and to plastic materials during the postnatal period (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.0-4.7) were related to an increased risk of childhood ALL. A positive association between ALL and paternal exposure to plastic materials during the preconception period was also found (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.9). The ALL risk associated with parental exposures to hydrocarbons did not vary greatly with immunophenotype of ALL. These results suggest that the effect of parental occupational exposure to hydrocarbons on offspring may depend on the type of hydrocarbon and the timing of the exposure.","['Shu, X O', 'Stewart, P', 'Wen, W Q', 'Han, D', 'Potter, J D', 'Buckley, J D', 'Heineman, E', 'Robison, L L']","['Shu XO', 'Stewart P', 'Wen WQ', 'Han D', 'Potter JD', 'Buckley JD', 'Heineman E', 'Robison LL']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55454, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons/*adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Odds Ratio', '*Parents', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Factors', 'Solvents/adverse effects', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States/epidemiology']",1999/09/25 00:00,1999/09/25 00:01,['1999/09/25 00:00'],"['1999/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 1999 Sep;8(9):783-91.,,,,"['0 (Hydrocarbons)', '0 (Solvents)']",['CA 48051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Methotrexate is eliminated from systemic blood circulation by the liver and its transport into hepatocytes is therefore described in detail in this paper. Methotrexate uptake is energy- and sodium-dependent. The Km and the Vmax are 23 microM and 36 pmol/mg protein min, respectively. The apparent activation energy (E(app)) of methotrexate uptake (5 microM [3H]methotrexate) is 53.73 kJ/mol, which indicates an energy-dependent carrier-mediated process. Although methotrexate is a folate derivative, folate itself does not inhibit methotrexate uptake, whereas the reduced folates, dihydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate are weak uncompetitive inhibitors. In contrast, the bile acids taurocholate and cholate are effective competitive inhibitors of methotrexate uptake into hepatocytes. Further strong inhibitors are the loop diuretic bumetanide, the mycotoxin ochratoxin A and bromosulfophthalein. Because tumor patients develop drug resistance during methotrexate therapy, the uptake of methotrexate was tested in different hepatoma cell lines. In HepG2-cells and Reuber hepatoma Fao-cells the transport was non-existent or very small. However, the hepatocytoma fusion cell line HPCT-1E3, a hybrid cell line between primary rat hepatocytes and rat Reuber Fao-cells, shows an intermediate transport activity with a threefold increase of the methotrexate uptake. These results indicate the presence of a bile acid sensitive methotrexate carrier in hepatocytes which is absent in dedifferentiated hepatoma cells. The carrier differs from previously described transporters for the uptake of organic anions.","['Honscha, W', 'Petzinger, E']","['Honscha W', 'Petzinger E']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Giessen, Germany.

Compared with transduced T cells expanded in IL-2 or reactivated with soluble antibodies to CD3 or CD28, transgene expression was significantly increased after activation on immobilized anti-CD3 antibodies (CD3i) or by simultaneous activation on immobilized anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (CD3i/CD28i). A similar pattern of transgene expression was observed in T cells transduced with Mo-MuLV LNC-EGFP. Proviral copy number was maintained in LNC-mB7-1-transduced T cells expanded in IL-2 or reactivated on CD3i/CD28i. Substantial increases in LNC-mB7-1 steady state mRNA in reactivated T lymphocytes, compared with those maintained in IL-2, correlated with increased transcription of the LNC-mB7-1 proviral DNA. Furthermore, T cells transduced with the Mo-MuLV ZIPPGK-mADA, in which the mADA cDNA is driven by an internal human phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter, showed increases in steady state ZIPPGK-mADA RNA on reactivation. High levels of transgene expression were evident irrespective of cell cycle position in both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. After reactivation, increases in LNC-mB7-1 mRNA were observed in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, indicating that proteins involved in upregulating transgene expression preexisted in transduced lymphocytes. Induction of transgene expression on CD3i/CD28i showed a dose-dependent decrease in transgene expression when incubated with selective protein kinase inhibitors.

One approach has been transcriptional targeting through the use of tissue-specific regulatory elements. A more versatile approach would be to use a regulatory element that is controlled via a parameter common to a broad range of diseases. Ischemia is characteristic of a number of pathologies that range from vascular occlusion through to cancer. The state of low oxygen, hypoxia, triggers a transcriptional signaling pathway that is mediated by transcription factors binding to a specific enhancer, the hypoxia response element (HRE). These observations have therefore led to the use of HREs to drive gene expression in a number of target tissues from tumors to cardiac muscle. To translate these observations into a clinically useful vector system we have now assessed the potency of a number of naturally derived HREs in various configurations combined with minimal promoters. The optimal HRE has been introduced into a single transcription unit retroviral vector that can deliver regulated gene expression in response to hypoxia. An important feature of this new physiologically regulated vector is the combination of low basal expression and high-level activated expression that is on a par with that obtained with the cytomegalovirus immediate-early (CMV IE) promoter. The role of elements that stabilize mRNA in the presence of hypoxia has also been assessed. These hypoxia-regulated vectors may have utility for restricting the delivery of therapeutic proteins to tumors and ischemic sites.","['Boast, K', 'Binley, K', 'Iqball, S', 'Price, T', 'Spearman, H', 'Kingsman, S', 'Kingsman, A', 'Naylor, S']","['Boast K', 'Binley K', 'Iqball S', 'Price T', 'Spearman H', 'Kingsman S', 'Kingsman A', 'Naylor S']","['Biochemistry Department, Oxford University, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,IM,"['Cell Line', 'DNA, Recombinant/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genes, Regulator', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Response Elements', 'Retroviridae/genetics']",1999/09/25 00:00,1999/09/25 00:01,['1999/09/25 00:00'],"['1999/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1999 Sep 1;10(13):2197-208. doi: 10.1089/10430349950017185.,,,['10.1089/10430349950017185 [doi]'],"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mice injected with viable BM185 leukemia cells modified to express CD80 and GM-CSF (BM185/CD80+GM-CSF) showed the highest leukemia rejection rates.

Histological examination of the vaccination site showed a large concentration of immune cells. Administration of the BM185/CD80+GM-CSF cell vaccine before intravenous challenge with parental cells caused strong inhibition of leukemia development. Vaccination after subcutaneous challenge with BM185 cells caused efficient elimination of leukemia promoting 40-60% long-term survival rates. The immunization efficacy of the BM185/CD80+ GM-CSF cell vaccine was directly correlated with the percentage of cells expressing the transgenes.

Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group.",97-104,"To assess the efficacy of etoposide added to the standard remission induction therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), newly diagnosed adult AML patients were randomized to receive either daunorubicin (40 mg/m2/day x 4 or more), behenoyl cytarabine (200 mg/m2/day x 10 or more), and 6-mercaptopurine (70 mg/m2/day x 10 or more) (BHAC-DM), or the same three drugs plus etoposide (100 mg/m2/day x 5) (BHAC-EDM) for response-oriented individualized induction therapy. The patients achieving complete remission (CR) received the same 3 courses of consolidation therapy followed by 6 courses of maintenance/intensification therapy. M3 patients were excluded because all-trans retinoic acid was used. Of 667 patients registered, 655 were evaluable. The median age was 49 (range 15 to 85). CR rates were 77% in the BHAC-DM group and 75% in the BHAC-EDM group.

Ficoll-separated mononuclear cells from 18 bone marrow aspirate specimens obtained from 17 MDS patients, 4 normal healthy donors, and 3 acute myeloid leukemia patients transformed from MDS (t-AML) were studied for mRNA expression of Fas-L, Fas, and the effectors of their signaling, Caspase 1 and Caspase 3, using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Fas-L, Fas, and Caspase 1 were detectable in all of the samples in the three groups. Caspase 3 was detectable both in MDS and t-AML specimens but was negligible in normal cells. The apoptotic index (AI%) determined by in situ end labeling of fragmented DNA in 4-hour cultures of mononuclear cells was significantly higher in MDS cells compared to normal or t-AML cells (mean +/- SEM: 2.3% +/- 0.4% in MDS, n = 10 vs. 0.6% +/- 0.2%, n = 4, P = 0.014 in normal cells, and 0.2% +/- 0.2%, n = 3, P = 0.007 in t-AML cells). Treatment of MDS cells with anti-Fas-L antibody suppressed apoptosis (AI%: 2.1% +/- 0.6% in untreated vs. 1.37% +/- 0.5% in treated, n = 6, P = 0.02), indicating functional participation of Fas-signaling in MDS. Further, it was found that Fas-L, Fas, and Caspase 1 mRNA expression remained unchanged in 4 hours. Caspase 3 expression appeared in normal cells after 4 hours and was present at both 0 and 4 hours in MDS and t-AML cells. In contrast to persistent expression in normal and t-AML cells, cells from the 5 MDS patients studied consistently showed significantly lowered or undetectable expression of a negative regulator of Fas, called Fas-associated phosphatase-1 (Fap-1) after 4 hours. Thus, the high AI% in MDS corresponds to a rapid decline in Fap-1. Furthermore, in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) treated HL60 promyelocytic cells, a definite periodicity in the expression of different mRNAs was observed with upregulation of TNF-alpha itself at 30 minutes, increased expression of Fas and the appearance of Fas-L after 2 hours, and a decrease in Fap-1 expression after 8 hours. These results suggest that TNF-alpha not only induces the effectors of Fas-signaling but also may downregulate the inhibitor. We conclude that a spontaneous and rapid down-regulation of Fap-1, possibly induced by TNF-alpha, a cytokine shown to be present in excess in MDS marrows, may underlie the increased apoptotic death of hematopoietic cells in these patients. Interference with Fap-1 turnover may provide a new therapeutic modality for MDS.","['Mundle, S D', 'Mativi, B Y', 'Bagai, K', 'Feldman, G', 'Cheema, P', 'Gautam, U', 'Reza, S', 'Cartlidge, J D', 'Venugopal, P', 'Shetty, V', 'Gregory, S A', 'Robin, E', 'Rifkin, S', 'Shah, R', 'Raza, A']","['Mundle SD', 'Mativi BY', 'Bagai K', 'Feldman G', 'Cheema P', 'Gautam U', 'Reza S', 'Cartlidge JD', 'Venugopal P', 'Shetty V', 'Gregory SA', 'Robin E', 'Rifkin S', 'Shah R', 'Raza A']","[""Rush Cancer Institute, Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois 60612, USA. smundle@rush.edu""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['*Apoptosis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 13', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",1999/09/25 00:00,1999/09/25 00:01,['1999/09/25 00:00'],"['1999/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1999 Aug;70(2):83-90.,,,,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN13 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 13)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have demonstrated that in three murine cell lines, Balb/3T3A31, MC3T3-E1, and C3H-2K, which constitutively produced SCF with different quantity, the SCF mRNA expression was greatly enhanced in response to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1). The study was carried out by in situ hybridization utilizing nonradioactive oligonucleotide probes and quantitative image analysis. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or interleukin-4 (IL-4) moderately increased SCF mRNA in all cell lines, but IL-3 did not. The dot-blot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) further confirmed that SCF protein production in these cell lines and bone marrow stromal cells was markedly enhanced by TGF-beta1, although TGF-beta1 suppressed the proliferation of all these cells. bFGF also enhanced the SCF production in these cell lines, but did not in bone marrow stromal cells, suggesting a difference in their susceptibility to the cytokine.

At the onset of M1 differentiation, a set of myeloid differentiation primary response (MyD) genes are induced, including the proto-oncogene for JunB. In order to examine the molecular nature of the mechanisms by which IL-6 activates the immediate early expression of MyD genes, JunB was used as a paradigm. A novel IL-6 response element, -65/-52 IL-6RE, to which a 100-kDa protein complex is bound, has been identified on the JunB promoter. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-induced activation of JunB in M1 cells was also mediated via the -65/-52 IL-6RE. The STAT3 and CRE-like binding sites of the JunB promoter, identified as IL-6-responsive elements in HepG2 liver cells were found, however, to play no role in JunB inducibility by IL-6 in M1 myeloid cells. Conversely, the -65/-52 IL-6RE is shown not to be necessary for JunB inducibility by IL-6 or LIF in liver cells. It appears, therefore, that immediate early activation of JunB is regulated differently in M1 myeloid cells than in HepG2 liver cells. This indicates that distinct cis-acting control elements participate in cell type-specific induction of JunB by members of the IL-6 cytokine superfamily.","['Sjin, R M', 'Lord, K A', 'Abdollahi, A', 'Hoffman, B', 'Liebermann, D A']","['Sjin RM', 'Lord KA', 'Abdollahi A', 'Hoffman B', 'Liebermann DA']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research, Department of Biochemistry, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/09/25 00:00,1999/09/25 00:01,['1999/09/25 00:00'],"['1999/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Oct 1;274(40):28697-707. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.40.28697.,,,"['10.1074/jbc.274.40.28697 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)52103-2 [pii]']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate these possibilities, a semiquantitative RT-PCR approach was utilized to permit a broad screening of cytokine mRNAs in a large number of tissue samples. Examination of MuLV-induced end-stage lymphomas revealed the absence of mRNA for cytokines known to stimulate the proliferation of T cells (i.e., IL-2, IL-9), the absence of mRNA for cytokines known to enhance cell-mediated antitumor immune responses (i.e., IL-2, IFNgamma), and the presence of mRNA for cytokines known to diminish such responses (i.e., IL-4, IL-10). Similar patterns of cytokine mRNA expression were detected in tumor-derived cell lines. Spleen and thymus from animals collected longitudinally during infection and from age-matched uninfected mice also demonstrated a similar pattern, except that IFNgamma mRNA was readily detectable.

The findings suggest that cytokines in the immediate environment of the lymphoma support tumor development by acting to diminish an effective antitumor immune response.","['Beaty, R M', 'Rulli, K', 'Bost, K L', 'Pantginis, J', 'Lenz, J', 'Levy, L S']","['Beaty RM', 'Rulli K', 'Bost KL', 'Pantginis J', 'Lenz J', 'Levy LS']","['Program in Molecular and Cellular Biology, Tulane Medical School, New Orleans, Louisiana 70112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-10/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-9/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/*immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/*immunology']",1999/09/25 00:00,1999/09/25 00:01,['1999/09/25 00:00'],"['1999/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1999 Sep 1;261(2):253-62. doi: 10.1006/viro.1999.9846.,,,"['10.1006/viro.1999.9846 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(99)99846-X [pii]']","['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-9)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']","['CA-09060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-44822/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-57337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Using low-density lipoprotein as well as model systems, it has been demonstrated that (*)NO can serve as a chain-breaking antioxidant to blunt lipid peroxidation. To test the hypothesis that (*)NO can serve as a chain-breaking antioxidant in cell membranes, we examined the effect of (*)NO on iron-induced lipid peroxidation in human leukemia cells. We exposed HL-60 cells to an oxidative stress (20 microM Fe(2+)) and monitored the consumption of oxygen as a measure of lipid peroxidation. Oxygen consumption was arrested by the addition of (*)NO as a saturated aqueous solution. The duration of inhibition of oxygen consumption by (*)NO was concentration-dependent in the 0.4-1.8 microM range. The inhibition ended upon depletion of (*)NO. The addition of (*)NO prior to initiation of peroxidation delayed the onset of peroxidation; the nearer in time it was before Fe(2+) addition, the longer the inhibition. Depletion of cellular glutathione levels by d, l-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine prior to Fe(2+) addition resulted in a more rapid initial rate of oxygen depletion and a shorter time for the (*)NO-induced inhibition of oxygen consumption. Complementary studies of this iron-induced lipid peroxidation, using thiobarbituric acid reactive substances as a marker, also demonstrated the protective effects of (*)NO. This protection of cells against lipid peroxidation also manifested itself as a reduction in trypan blue uptake, an observation demonstrating the protective effects of (*)NO on membrane integrity. We conclude that (*)NO protects HL-60 human leukemia cells from lipid peroxidation and that this protection ameliorates the toxicity of the oxidation processes initiated by Fe(2+) and dioxygen.","['Kelley, E E', 'Wagner, B A', 'Buettner, G R', 'Burns, C P']","['Kelley EE', 'Wagner BA', 'Buettner GR', 'Burns CP']","['Department of Medicine, The University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa, 52242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,IM,"['Cell Membrane/drug effects/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Iron/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Models, Chemical', 'Nitric Oxide/*pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/*physiology', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects', 'Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances/analysis']",1999/09/25 00:00,1999/09/25 00:01,['1999/09/25 00:00'],"['1999/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1999 Oct 1;370(1):97-104. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1999.1386.,,,"['10.1006/abbi.1999.1386 [doi]', 'S0003-9861(99)91386-3 [pii]']","['0 (Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",['P01 CA66081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,

We initially determined that the level of dG(s) incorporation into DNA of human T- and B-lineage leukemia cell lines did not correlate significantly with the extent of cytotoxicity (IC(50)), except that there was no cytotoxicity in the absence of dG(s) incorporation. To elucidate biological processes perturbed by dG(s) incorporation into DNA, we chemically synthesized oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing a single dG(s) (11 mer and 19 mer), which decreased the melting temperature (T(m)) of DNA-DNA duplexes without major structural changes, as evidenced by circular dichroism spectra. Using nuclear extracts from human lymphoblastic leukemia cells (CCRF-CEM, NALM6, and Molt4), we documented that dG(s) incorporation into the DNA strand of DNA-RNA heteroduplexes significantly inhibited human RNase H-catalyzed RNA cleavage (80-90% inhibition) and that a similar inhibition was evident with bacterial RNase H. These data provide the first evidence that thiopurines inhibit the function of RNase H, indicating that their mechanism of cytotoxicity may involve interference with this component of the replication machinery.","['Krynetskaia, N F', 'Krynetski, E Y', 'Evans, W E']","['Krynetskaia NF', 'Krynetski EY', 'Evans WE']","[""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and Colleges of Pharmacy and Medicine, University of Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Deoxyguanosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis/drug effects', 'Nucleic Acid Heteroduplexes/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Thionucleosides/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/09/25 00:00,1999/09/25 00:01,['1999/09/25 00:00'],"['1999/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1999 Oct;56(4):841-8.,,,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Heteroduplexes)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', ""2133-81-5 (alpha-2'-deoxythioguanosine)"", 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors give an overview of the current role of HDCT in lympho-hematopoietic malignancies and solid tumors. METHODS: The use of allogenic or autologous hematopoietic stem cells allows an increase of the dose of chemotherapeutic drugs by a factor of between 4- and 30-fold compared to conventional chemotherapy protocols. In recent years mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) have largely replaced the use of autologous bone marrow due to more rapid hematopoietic reconstitution and are increasingly used in the allogenic setting. This article reviews the data of high-dose chemotherapy in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, acute leukemias, chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphatic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, germ cell cancer, and lung cancer. Current clinical trials further evaluating the role of HDCT are described. RESULTS: Data on results of HDCT are available for a variety of malignancies showing the feasibility and efficacy of the procedure with tolerable toxicity. Although numerous clinical trials of HDCT have been performed, only few randomized trials have demonstrated that such strategies are statistically significantly better than conventional forms of therapy. CONCLUSION: HDCT has been shown to be useful in the treatment of certain patients with lymphomas, leukemias, myeloma, breast cancer, and testicular cancer. Most of these findings still have to be confirmed by randomized clinical trials. Therefore, HDCT should only be given in controlled studies and at suitable centers.","['Engert, A', 'Josting, A', 'Reiser, M', 'Sohngen, D', 'Diehl, V']","['Engert A', 'Josting A', 'Reiser M', 'Sohngen D', 'Diehl V']","['Klinik I fur Innere Medizin, Universitat zu Koln.

At diagnosis, the predominant clinical sub-type was the acute type (60%), followed by lymphoma (22%), chronic (10%) and smoldering (8%) types. Although we expected that different sub-types would be present in different regions, on the basis of immunogenetic factors determined by ethnicity, we did not demonstrate these differences. There were no significant differences among ATLL subtypes by age or gender. No ethnic group predominated in the total population of patients, but significant differences were noted when examining ethnic distribution by region. Reflecting the general population distribution, white patients were seen more often in Sao Paulo and black patients in Bahia, than in other regions. In most regions, cases were equally distributed between blacks and mulattos, except in Pernambuco, where blacks were less frequent. The main clinical features were lymphadenopathy, skin lesions, hypercalcemia and hepatomegaly. Fourteen patients (9%) suffered from HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM/TSP), either at diagnosis or during follow-up of ATLL. All cases but one had antibodies to HTLV-I, with concordant results with ELISA, WB and PCR analyses. For the antibody-negative case, pol and tax gene sequences were present in tumor cells when subjected to PCR analyses.

Although the measured fields had no association with childhood leukemia (P for trend=.88), the risks were significant for predicted magnetic fields above 1.25 mG (odds ratio=2.00, 95% confidence interval=1.03-3.89), and a significant dose-response was seen (P for trend=.02). When exposures were determined by a combination of predictions and measurements that corrects for errors, the odds ratio (odd ratio=2.19, 95% confidence interval=1.12-4.31) and the trend (p =.007) showed somewhat greater significance. These findings support the hypothesis that magnetic fields from electrical lines are causally related to childhood leukemia but that this association has been inconsistent among epidemiologic studies due to different types of exposure assessment error. In these data, the leukemia risks from a child's residential magnetic field exposure appears to be better assessed by wire configurations than by 24-h area measurements. However, the predicted fields only partially account for the effect of the Wertheimer-Leeper wire code in a multivariate analysis and do not completely explain why these wire codes have been so often associated with childhood leukemia. The most plausible explanation for our findings is that the causal factor is another magnetic field exposure metric correlated to both wire code and the field's time-averaged magnitude.","['Thomas, D C', 'Bowman, J D', 'Jiang, L', 'Jiang, F', 'Peters, J M']","['Thomas DC', 'Bowman JD', 'Jiang L', 'Jiang F', 'Peters JM']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Bioelectromagnetics,Bioelectromagnetics,8008281,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Electricity', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Forecasting', '*Housing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Los Angeles/epidemiology', 'Magnetics/*adverse effects', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Odds Ratio', 'Power Plants', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",1999/09/24 00:00,1999/09/24 00:01,['1999/09/24 00:00'],"['1999/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bioelectromagnetics. 1999 Oct;20(7):414-22.,,,['10.1002/(SICI)1521-186X(199910)20:7<414::AID-BEM2>3.0.CO;2-X [pii]'],,,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure model.,399-413,"A physically based model for residential magnetic fields from electric transmission and distribution wiring was developed to reanalyze the Los Angeles study of childhood leukemia by London et al. For this exposure model, magnetic field measurements were fitted to a function of wire configuration attributes that was derived from a multipole expansion of the Law of Biot and Savart. The model parameters were determined by nonlinear regression techniques, using wiring data, distances, and the geometric mean of the ELF magnetic field magnitude from 24-h bedroom measurements taken at 288 homes during the epidemiologic study. The best fit to the measurement data was obtained with separate models for the two major utilities serving Los Angeles County. This model's predictions produced a correlation of 0.40 with the measured fields, an improvement on the 0.27 correlation obtained with the Wertheimer-Leeper (WL) wire code. For the leukemia risk analysis in a companion paper, the regression model predicts exposures to the 24-h geometric mean of the ELF magnetic fields in Los Angeles homes where only wiring data and distances have been obtained. Since these input parameters for the exposure model usually do not change for many years, the predicted magnetic fields will be stable over long time periods, just like the WL code. If the geometric mean is not the exposure metric associated with cancer, this regression technique could be used to estimate long-term exposures to temporal variability metrics and other characteristics of the ELF magnetic field which may be cancer risk factors.","['Bowman, J D', 'Thomas, D C', 'Jiang, L', 'Jiang, F', 'Peters, J M']","['Bowman JD', 'Thomas DC', 'Jiang L', 'Jiang F', 'Peters JM']","['National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, Ohio 45266, USA. jdb0@cdc.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Bioelectromagnetics,Bioelectromagnetics,8008281,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Child', 'Electricity', '*Electromagnetic Fields/adverse effects', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Forecasting', '*Housing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Los Angeles/epidemiology', '*Magnetics/adverse effects', 'Models, Biological', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Power Plants', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors']",1999/09/24 00:00,1999/09/24 00:01,['1999/09/24 00:00'],"['1999/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bioelectromagnetics. 1999 Oct;20(7):399-413.,,,['10.1002/(SICI)1521-186X(199910)20:7<399::AID-BEM1>3.0.CO;2-G [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The isolates were classified as ALV-J by 1) their ability to propagate in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) that are resistant to avian leukosis virus (ALV) subgroups A and E (C/AE) and 2) positive reaction in a polymerase chain reaction with primers specific for ALV-J. The prototype strain of these isolates, an isolate termed ADOL-Hc1, was obtained from an adult BB flock that had a history of ML. The ADOL-Hc1 was isolated and propagated on C/AE CEF and was distinct antigenically from ALV of subgroups A, B, C, D, and E, as determined by virus neutralization tests. Antibody to ADOL-Hc1 neutralized strain HPRS-103, the prototype of ALV-J isolated from meat-type chickens in the United Kingdom, but antibody to HPRS-103 did not neutralize strain ADOL-Hc1. On the basis of both viremia and antibody, prevalence of ALV-J infection in affected flocks was as high as 87%. Viremia in day-old chicks of three different hatches from a BB flock naturally infected with ALV-J varied from 4% to 25%; in two of the three hatches, 100% of chicks that tested negative for virus at hatch had evidence of viremia by 8 wk of age. The data document the isolation of ALV-J from meat-type chickens experiencing ML as young as 4 wk of age.

This receptor binds retinoids inadequately so that extra retinoids (in the form of tretinoin) are required to restart the normal cellular maturation, after which the promyelocytes can mature into granulocytes. Arsenic trioxide has a different mode of action, possibly related to its effects on sulfhydryl-rich proteins, resulting in dysplastic leukaemic promyelocytes, ending up in apoptotic cell death.

DESIGN: Descriptive analysis of population-based leukaemia incidence data, review of evidence related to the causation of leukaemia, assessment of environmental exposures to known leukaemogens, and resulting risks of leukaemia. SETTING: Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia, focusing on suburbs between the Port Kembla industrial complex and Lake Illawarra (the Warrawong area). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for leukaemia; current measured and past estimated ambient air benzene concentrations; and expected leukaemia cases attributable to estimates of ambient air benzene concentrations. RESULTS: In 1989-1996, 12 leukaemia cases among Warrawong residents aged less than 50 years were observed, more than the 3.49 cases expected from the rate in the rest of the Illawarra region (SIR, 343.8; 99% CI, 141.6-691.7). These people lived in suburbs immediately to the south-southwest of a coke byproducts plant (a major industrial source of benzene, one of the few known leukaemogens). The greatest excess was among 15-24-year-olds (SIR, 1085.6; 99% CI, 234.1-3072.4). In 1996, ambient air concentrations of benzene averaged less than 1 part per billion (ppb). Since 1970, ambient air concentrations of benzene were estimated to have averaged up to 3 ppb, about one-thousandth of the level at which leukaemia risk has been identified in occupational epidemiological studies. Using the risk assessment model developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency, we estimate that past benzene levels in the Warrawong area could have resulted in 0.4 additional cases of leukaemia in 1989-1996. CONCLUSIONS: The excess occurrence of leukaemia in the Warrawong area in 1989-1996 is highly unusual. Current environmental benzene exposure and the reconstructed past environmental benzene exposure level are too low to explain the large excess of leukaemia. The cause of the cluster is uncertain.","['Westley-Wise, V J', 'Stewart, B W', 'Kreis, I', 'Ricci, P F', 'Hogan, A', 'Darling, C', 'Corbett, S', 'Kaldor, J', 'Stacey, N H', 'Warburton, P']","['Westley-Wise VJ', 'Stewart BW', 'Kreis I', 'Ricci PF', 'Hogan A', 'Darling C', 'Corbett S', 'Kaldor J', 'Stacey NH', 'Warburton P']","['Illawarra Public Health Unit, Illawarra Area Health Service, Wollongong, NSW. vwest@doh.health.nsw.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Med J Aust,The Medical journal of Australia,0400714,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Air Pollution/*adverse effects', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', '*Cluster Analysis', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiological Monitoring', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Inhalation Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'New South Wales/epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk']",1999/09/24 00:00,1999/09/24 00:01,['1999/09/24 00:00'],"['1999/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med J Aust. 1999 Aug 16;171(4):178-83. doi: 10.5694/j.1326-5377.1999.tb123593.x.,,['Med J Aust. 1999 Aug 16;171(4):172.

In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)the precise role of autologous transplantation particularly in first remission is much less clear than in AML. Formerly, most adult ALL patients who underwent ABMT did so in relapse or in second or subsequent remission. The fact that some of these patients could become long term survivors has encouraged the use of ABMT in first remission. In most studies 40-50% of first remission patients attained long term disease free survival (DFS). Relapse rates are considerably higher in patients receiving ABMT when compared to those receiving an allogeneic transplant, but the latter group of patients experience significant morbidity and mortality (15-30%) due to graft-versus-host disease and opportunistic infections. ABMT clearly has the potential to effect cures in ALL patients and its role and timing are now the subject of major clinical studies. As the mortality of ABMT for ALL rapidly decreases to approximately 5%, more widespread use of such a procedure may replace the protracted maintenance chemotherapy usually given in this disease.","['Piatkowska-Jakubas, B', 'Wegrzyn, J', 'Rucinska, M', 'Skotnicki, A B']","['Piatkowska-Jakubas B', 'Wegrzyn J', 'Rucinska M', 'Skotnicki AB']","['Kliniki Hematologii Collgium Medicum, Uniwersytetu Jagiellonskiego w Krakowie.']",['pol'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Poland,Przegl Lek,Przeglad lekarski,19840720R,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/09/24 00:00,1999/09/24 00:01,['1999/09/24 00:00'],"['1999/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Przegl Lek. 1999;56 Suppl 1:52-6.,,,,,,,,34,,,Transplantacja autologiczna w ostrej bialaczce limfoblastycznej doroslych.,,,,,,

Certain specialized cells can transport ascorbic acid directly through a sodium ascorbate cotransporter, but in most cells, vitamin C enters through the facilitative glucose transporters (GLUTs) in the form of dehydroascorbic acid, which is then reduced intracellularly and retained as ascorbic acid. Mice with established hematopoietic and epithelial cell xenografts were studied for the accumulation of injected ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid. Most hematopoietic and epithelial tumor cell lines can only transport vitamin C in the oxidized form (dehydroascorbic acid) in vitro; however, when grown as xenografts in mice, they rapidly accumulated vitamin C after administration of radiolabeled ascorbic acid. The involvement of the GLUTs in vitamin C uptake by the xenografted tumors was demonstrated by competitive inhibition with D-glucose but not L-glucose. Because the malignant cells were not capable of directly transporting ascorbic acid, we reasoned that the ascorbic acid was oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid in the tumor microenvironment. Tumor accumulation of vitamin C in animals injected with ascorbic acid was inhibited by coadministration of superoxide dismutase, implying a role for superoxide anion in the oxidation of ascorbic acid. Whereas the epithelial cancer cell lines could not generate superoxide anion in culture, the minced xenograft tumors did. Our studies show the transport of dehydroascorbic acid by GLUTs is a means by which tumors acquire vitamin C and indicate the oxidation of ascorbic acid by superoxide anion produced by cells in the tumor stroma as a mechanism for generating the transportable form of the vitamin.","['Agus, D B', 'Vera, J C', 'Golde, D W']","['Agus DB', 'Vera JC', 'Golde DW']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA. d-agus@ski.mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Ascorbic Acid/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Glucose/pharmacology', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Models, Biological', 'Monosaccharide Transport Proteins/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/*metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1999/09/24 00:00,1999/09/24 00:01,['1999/09/24 00:00'],"['1999/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Sep 15;59(18):4555-8.,,,,"['0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (Monosaccharide Transport Proteins)', '0 (SLC2A1 protein, human)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

By reverse transcriptase-PCR we detected expression of CACNA1G in normal colon and bone marrow, but expression was absent in the five tumor cell lines in which methylation was found. After treatment with the methylation inhibitor 5-deoxyazacytidine, the expression of CACNA1G was restored in all five cell lines. Detailed methylation mapping of the 5' CpG island by bisulfite-PCR revealed that methylation of a region 300-800 bp upstream of the translation initiation site closely correlated with the inactivation of CACNA1G. This region contained the transcription start site, as determined by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis. Aberrant methylation of CACNA1G was also examined in various human primary tumors and was detected in 17 of 49 (35%) colorectal cancers, 4 of 16 (25%) gastric cancers, and 3 of 23 (13%) acute myelogenous leukemia cases.

Weight loss is a potent stimulus to food intake in normal humans and animals. The persistence of anorexia in cancer patients, therefore, implies a failure of this adaptive feeding response, although the weight loss in the patients differs from that found in simple starvation. Tremendous progress has been made in the last 5 years with regard to the regulation of feeding and body weight. It has been demonstrated that leptin, a hormone secreted by adipose tissue, is an integral component of the homeostatic loop of body weight regulation. Leptin acts to control food intake and energy expenditure via neuropeptidergic effector molecules within the hypothalamus. Complex interactions among the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems affect the loop and induce behavioral and metabolic responses. A number of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukins 1 and 6, IFN-gamma, leukemia inhibitory factor, and ciliary neurotrophic factor have been proposed as mediators of the cachectic process. Cytokines may play a pivotal role in long-term inhibition of feeding by mimicking the hypothalamic effect of excessive negative feedback signaling from leptin. This could be done by persistent stimulation of anorexigenic neuropeptides such as corticotropin-releasing factor, as well as by inhibition of the neuropeptide Y orexigenic network that consists of opioid peptides and galanin, in addition to the newly identified melanin-concentrating hormone, orexin, and agouti-related peptide. Information is being gathered, although it is still insufficient, on such abnormalities in the hypothalamic neuropeptide circuitry in tumor-bearing animals that coincide with the development of anorexia and cachexia. Characterization of the feeding-associated gene products have revealed new biochemical pathways and molecular targets for pharmacological intervention that will likely lead to new treatments. Although therapeutic intervention using neuropeptide agonists/antagonists is now directed at obesity treatment, it may also have an effect on treating cancer anorexia-cachexia, especially when combined with other agents that have effects on muscle and protein breakdown.","['Inui, A']",['Inui A'],"['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Kobe University School of Medicine, Japan. inui@med.kobe-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Anorexia/*physiopathology', 'Body Weight', 'Cachexia/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Leptin', 'Neoplasms/mortality/*physiopathology', 'Neuropeptides/*physiology', 'Proteins/physiology', 'Syndrome']",1999/09/24 00:00,1999/09/24 00:01,['1999/09/24 00:00'],"['1999/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Sep 15;59(18):4493-501.,,,,"['0 (Leptin)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Proteins)']",,,,156,,,,,,,,,

Gene expressions were determined by isolation of total RNA and slot blot hybridization with chemiluminescently labeled gene probes (Ha-ras, c-myc and p53) Expression levels were compared before and after treatment with a combined cytostatic protocol, containing cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone (CHOP). Both the CLL and NHL group of patients exhibited significantly higher expression of the investigated genes than healthy controls. One month after the cytostatic treatment, we found considerably fewer individuals with overexpressed oncogenes than before the treatment.

These studies have been interpreted as providing conflicting evidence. METHODS: A common analytical approach was applied to data from the five cohorts included in the three studies based on original data from four of the cohorts, and published data from one additional cohort. A nested case-control design with conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the relative risk/10 microtesla-years (microT-years) for each of the contributing cohorts and for the combined data. The homogeneity of these estimates among the studies was also evaluated. RESULTS: Apparent inconsistencies in the findings of these studies can be explained by statistical variation. Overall, the studies suggest a small increase in risk of both brain cancer and leukaemia. Different methodological choices had little impact on the results. Based on a combined analysis of data from all five studies, the relative risk/10 microT-years was 1.12 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.98 to 1.28) for brain cancer, and 1.09 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.21) for leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: The combined estimates seem to provide the best summary measures of the data from all studies. However, fluctuations in risks among studies may reflect real differences, and the exposure measurements in different studies may not be entirely comparable.","['Kheifets, L I', 'Gilbert, E S', 'Sussman, S S', 'Guenel, P', 'Sahl, J D', 'Savitz, D A', 'Theriault, G']","['Kheifets LI', 'Gilbert ES', 'Sussman SS', 'Guenel P', 'Sahl JD', 'Savitz DA', 'Theriault G']","['Environment Division, Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA 94304-1395, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Electricity', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'Risk Assessment', 'United States/epidemiology']",1999/09/24 00:00,1999/09/24 00:01,['1999/09/24 00:00'],"['1999/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 1999 Aug;56(8):567-74. doi: 10.1136/oem.56.8.567.,,,['10.1136/oem.56.8.567 [doi]'],,,,PMC1757768,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Each subject's summary time weighted average (TWA) exposure was derived from measurements of two homes, weighted by the fraction of the reference period lived in the residence. The three cost efficient field work strategies examined were measuring: (a) the longer lived in home; (b) the currently lived in home; and (c) the former lived in home. Two different methods were used for imputing the missing values: (a) control mean imputation, (b) status specific mean imputation. The subject's summary exposure to magnetic fields estimated with each approach was compared with the subject's TWA calculated from measurements in both homes. The association between estimated exposure to magnetic fields and the risk of leukaemia under different approaches was examined with unconditional logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The Pearson correlation coefficient between the two measurements within subjects was 0.31 (p < 10(-4), indicating a lack of independence of measurements. Differences were found between mean exposures in current and former homes of cases, and between longer and shorter lived in homes of controls. All methods with measurements from one of the homes in conjunction with imputation of measurements for the second home led to marked attenuation of risk estimates at the highest exposure category, particularly when measurements from current homes were used and those from former homes were imputed. CONCLUSION: Results argue against attempting to estimate lifetime magnetic field exposure from imputed values derived from current residences to fill in gaps caused by unmeasured residences previously lived in.","['Baris, D', 'Linet, M S', 'Tarone, R E', 'Kleinerman, R A', 'Hatch, E E', 'Kaune, W T', 'Robison, L L', 'Lubin, J', 'Wacholder, S']","['Baris D', 'Linet MS', 'Tarone RE', 'Kleinerman RA', 'Hatch EE', 'Kaune WT', 'Robison LL', 'Lubin J', 'Wacholder S']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-7240, USA. barisd@epndce.nci.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,IM,"['Bias', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Residence Characteristics', '*Risk Assessment', 'United States/epidemiology']",1999/09/24 00:00,1999/09/24 00:01,['1999/09/24 00:00'],"['1999/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 1999 Aug;56(8):562-6. doi: 10.1136/oem.56.8.562.,,,['10.1136/oem.56.8.562 [doi]'],,,,PMC1757776,,,,,,,,,,

In normal rats, when the dose of TBI was escalated and the CP dose was kept constant, pretreatment with Amifostine yielded a positive dose modification factor of 1.26. No significant improvement was found after Amifostine pretreatment when the TBI dose was kept constant and CP dose escalated. When leukaemic rats received CP as the only antileukaemia treatment, Amifostine pretreatment did not lead to a reduction in the antileukaemic efficacy of CP, although protection against treatment-related mortality was observed. In the CP only groups, 9 out of 40 animals died of treatment-related toxicity, compared with none of the 40 animals in the Amifostine pretreatment groups. When applying the maximum tolerated treatment of CP and TBI in various combinations to leukaemic rats, 25 out of 36 rats died from treatment-related toxicity, whilst pretreatment with Amifostine reduced this to 11 out of 36, (P = 0.002). Of those animals which survived the CP + TBI conditioning treatment, 10 out of 25 in the Amifostine pretreatment group were cured, versus 8/11 in the CP + TBI only control group (P = 0.146). In conclusion, incorporation of Amifostine as a radiochemoprotectant in a marrow-ablative conditioning regimen allows the use of escalated doses of chemoradiotherapy without reducing the antileukaemic efficacy.","['Martens, A C', 'Hagenbeek, A']","['Martens AC', 'Hagenbeek A']","['Department of Haematology, Jordan Laboratory, University Hospital Utrecht, The Netherlands. a.martens@lab.azu.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,"['Amifostine/*administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Radiation-Protective Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Survival Analysis', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1999/09/24 00:00,1999/09/24 00:01,['1999/09/24 00:00'],"['1999/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1999 Apr;35(4):634-40. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(98)00412-2.,,,"['S0959804998004122 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(98)00412-2 [doi]']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Radiation-Protective Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'M487QF2F4V (Amifostine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data were classified as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin's disease (HD). An attempt was made to put the data into a modified version of the Revised European American Lymphoma (REAL) classification. We observed an overall rise in total NHL throughout the time period in all European countries but no such trend in HD. The increase in NHL overall being 4.2% per annum, representing an increase of 4.8% in males and 3.4% in females per annum, was only marked in middle and old age. Such increases were observed in all participating areas except in Burgundy. Different countries, however, have different base rates, the rates being highest in Scandinavia and the Netherlands. The analysis by subcategory classification suggested that the increase in NHL was confined to the follicle centre cell type, extranodal B-cell, nodal T-cell and nodal lymphomas not otherwise specified, categories. These new observations present a picture of real increase in case incidence with no obvious explanation. The increases in NHL do not appear to be due solely to better diagnoses.

Three patients dying during chemotherapy were inevaluable. Eighty-four (67%) patients remitted with one cycle, and the overall complete remission (CR) rate was 72%. CR rates were comparable for patients with and without evaluable karyotypes. CR rates with BF11 (64% after one cycle; 72% overall) and BF12 (70% after one cycle; 72% overall) were comparable (P=.4 and 1.0 respectively). CR rates after one cycle (86%, 61% and 55%; P=.03) as well as overall CR rates (90%, 69% and 55%; P=.02) were significantly different for patients with favorable, intermediate and adverse karyotypes respectively. In Cox analysis, the karyotype was the only factor found to influence CR independently. We conclude that the karyotype of the leukemic clone is the most important determinant of response to high-dose cytarabine-based induction chemotherapy in AML. The addition of idarubicin to high-dose cytarabine and etoposide does not appear to improve CR rates. A different treatment strategy may be needed to improve CR rates for patients with non-favorable karyotypes.","['Mehta, J', 'Powles, R', 'Treleaven, J', 'Swansbury, G J', 'Kulkarni, S', 'Saso, R', 'Min, T', 'Singhal, S']","['Mehta J', 'Powles R', 'Treleaven J', 'Swansbury GJ', 'Kulkarni S', 'Saso R', 'Min T', 'Singhal S']","['Leukaemia Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, Surrey, UK. jmehta@exchange.uams.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/09/24 00:00,1999/09/24 00:01,['1999/09/24 00:00'],"['1999/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Aug;34(5-6):553-60. doi: 10.3109/10428199909058483.,,,['10.3109/10428199909058483 [doi]'],"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ICE protocol 4']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous phase I clinical trials using a 3-day continuous infusion schedule of Fazarabine have shown myelosuppression to be the dose limiting toxicity in solid tumors. Based on this clinical and preclinical experience we designed a phase I study to determine the toxicity, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and antileukemic efficacy of Fazarabine using a 3-day continuous infusion schedule in patients with refractory or relapsed acute leukemia or chronic myelogenous (CML) in blastic phase. Adults with a diagnosis of acute leukemia or blastic phase CML who were refractory or had relapsed on salvage chemotherapy were entered on study. Fazarabine was administered as a continuous infusion over 3 days every 3 to 4 weeks. The initial dose was 2 mg/m2/hour x 72 hours. Results showed that the MTD was 425 mg/m2/hour infused over 72 hours every 3 to 4 weeks. At this dose level neurotoxicity and fluid overload were the dose limiting toxicities. Among 71 patients treated, we observed one complete remission, one partial remission and one hematologic improvement. No obvious dose response relationship could be determined. In conclusion, Fazarabine has not shown a beneficial effect in the therapy of acute leukemia. Since 71 patients and 20 dose levels were required to determine the MTD of Fazarabine, a reassessment of our phase I study designs should be considered to provide patients with better potential toxic: therapeutic benefits in such trials.","['Wilhelm, M', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Rios, M B', 'Estey, E', 'Keating, M J', 'Plunkett, W', 'Sorenson, M', 'Kantarjian, H M']","['Wilhelm M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Rios MB', 'Estey E', 'Keating MJ', 'Plunkett W', 'Sorenson M', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Medizinische Poliklinik University of Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/09/24 00:00,1999/09/24 00:01,['1999/09/24 00:00'],"['1999/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Aug;34(5-6):511-8. doi: 10.3109/10428199909058478.,,,['10.3109/10428199909058478 [doi]'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5V71D8JOKK (fazarabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Australian Leukaemia Study Group (ALSG).,501-10,"To determine the safety and efficacy of the combination of idarubicin, cytarabine and etoposide (""ICE"") for induction and consolidation treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and of dose-intensification of cytarabine in this setting, 54 previously untreated patients in three cohorts were studied by sequential dose escalation of cytarabine, in combination with standard doses of idarubicin and etoposide. Cytarabine was given to Cohort 1 at the conventional dosage of 100 mg/m2 per day by continuous infusion for 7 days in induction and 5 days in consolidation; to Cohort 2 at high-dose (HiDAC) (3 g/m2 intravenously twice daily on days 1, 3, 5 and 7) during induction with conventional dosage during consolidation; to Cohort 3 HiDAC was given for both induction and consolidation. In addition, Cohort 3 patients received lenograstim (Granocyte; rHuG-CSF) after both induction and consolidation courses. We found that there was no significant difference between the three cohorts in hematological toxicity in induction, but that HiDAC was associated with a greater incidence of gastro-intestinal toxicities. There was no difference in induction mortality between the three cohorts, which was 11% overall. Consolidation with HiDAC led to a significant increase in hematological toxicity. Overall, the complete remission (CR) rate was 80% with no significant difference between the three regimens. The estimated disease free survival at 3 years was 28%, 67% and 54% respectively for Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 with an estimated overall survival of 38%, 63% and 47%. We conclude that cytarabine dosage can be escalated safely in combination with idarubicin and etoposide in both induction and consolidation. The combination is effective for induction treatment of AML and its side-effects appear similar to those of standard regimens. Whether its use offers long-term benefits compared with standard regimens is the subject of ongoing controlled randomized studies.","['Lowenthal, R M', 'Bradstock, K F', 'Matthews, J P', 'Bishop, J F', 'Juneja, S', 'Cobcroft, R', 'Eliadis, P', 'Enno, A', 'Gill, D', 'Herrmann, R P', 'Manoharan, A', 'Page, F J', 'Rooney, K F', 'Rosenfeld, D', 'Seldon, M', 'Taylor, K M', 'Wolf, M M', 'Young, G A']","['Lowenthal RM', 'Bradstock KF', 'Matthews JP', 'Bishop JF', 'Juneja S', 'Cobcroft R', 'Eliadis P', 'Enno A', 'Gill D', 'Herrmann RP', 'Manoharan A', 'Page FJ', 'Rooney KF', 'Rosenfeld D', 'Seldon M', 'Taylor KM', 'Wolf MM', 'Young GA']","['Haematology/Oncology Unit, Royal Hobart Hospital, Tasmania, Australia.

Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples were obtained simultaneously and tested by RT-PCR with the objective to determine the usefulness to follow CML patients by testing peripheral blood rather than bone marrow samples. For the purpose of this study we have considered the test results obtained from bone marrow samples as the standard. A total of 111 CML patients were examined who underwent either an allogeneic BMT (n=91) or were treated with Interferon (n=20) amounting to a total of 163 assessments for BCR-ABL. Concordance of results was observed in 153 samples (93.9%). 10 samples showed discordance. Seven of these were subjected to repeat testing by RT-PCR. The previously obtained discordant results were confirmed. The sensitivity of peripheral blood assays was calculated to be 96.2% with a specificity of 89.5%. RT-PCR results restricted to Southern blot negative patients showed concordance of bone marrow and peripheral blood in 91.1% of tested samples with a sensitivity of 92.7% and a specificity of 88.6%. The subset of patients in which Southern blot testing was not available showed concordance at a similar level. Complete concordance was seen in all patients that were found to be positive by Southern blotting. We conclude from this study that peripheral blood testing for BCR-ABL transcripts by RT-PCR is a test with high sensitivity and specificity and may potentially replace bone marrow testing.

Atypical patterns among Ph-chromosomes were consistent with loss of the 3' portion of BCR that is usually translocated to chromosome 9, or loss of the 5' segment of ABL that usually remains on chromosome 9, or loss of both the 3' translocated BCR and 5' residual ABL hybridization sites.

Early myeloid cells also normally express c-Kit and their survival, proliferation and differentiation is promoted by SCE It might therefore be expected that c-Kit mutations could also be involved in some acute and/or chronic myeloid leukaemias. We have found that mutant c-Kit (and normal c-Kit in the presence of SCF) provides a strong differentiation stimulus in normal and immortalised murine early myeloid cells. Since maturation of haemopoietic cells, with the exception of mast cells, results in down-regulation of c-Kit expression, the transforming effects of mutant receptor may be self-limiting in most lineages. This is consistent with the observation that multipotential progenitor cells from some patients with systemic mastocytosis express mutant c-Kit. However, c-Kit mutations have been observed in a few cases of myelodysplastic syndromes or AML without mast cell features. Oncogenesis involves multiple genetic changes and the phenotype of malignant haemopoietic cells expressing mutant c-Kit may be influenced by co-oncogenic events. For example mutations blocking the differentiative effect of mutant c-Kit might result in AML rather than mastocytosis. Thus the extent to which c-Kit mutations contribute to malignancies of early myeloid phenotype remains unknown, and resolution of this issue is complicated by the heterogeneity of this family of diseases.","['Ashman, L K', 'Ferrao, P', 'Cole, S R', 'Cambareri, A C']","['Ashman LK', 'Ferrao P', 'Cole SR', 'Cambareri AC']","['Division of Haematology, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia. leonie.ashman@imvs.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics/*physiology']",1999/09/24 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['1999/09/24 09:00'],"['1999/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Aug;34(5-6):451-61. doi: 10.3109/10428199909058472.,,,['10.3109/10428199909058472 [doi]'],['EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)'],,,,90,,,,,,,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Mar;37(1-2):233-43.

Currently open trials from most major groups use anthracyclines in the induction phase for all high-risk patients and in the delayed intensification phase for all patients regardless of risk classification. Our review of published randomized studies reveals no benefit for the addition of anthracyclines to induction phase of childhood ALL regimens consisting of vincristine, prednisone, and L-asparaginase (VPL), with or without a delayed intensification phase. No randomized studies have evaluated the use of anthracyclines in the delayed intensification phase of therapy. Furthermore, studies of relapsed patients indicated no benefit for the addition anthracyclines to maintenance regimens. Recent evidence from preclinical studies suggests that a combination of VPL with an anti-CD19 immunotoxin is more effective than VPL plus anthracyclines combination. Accumulated evidence exists that anthracyclines are associated with late-onset cardiac morbidity in about 25% of childhood ALL and other cancer survivors, and about 5% develop overt heart failure, with some requiring cardiac transplantation. Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in children has no safe dose threshold and all doses are likely to cause significant myocardial damage. New data suggests that a unique cardiac mitochondrial exogenous NADH dehydrogenase is responsible for the anthracycline-induced oxygen radicals damage to the heart, and that chelators currently evaluated may not prevent late-onset cardiotoxicity in children. In view of these findings we urge extreme caution in using anthracyclines as part of multimodality ALL treatment programs, and strongly recommend reevaluation of what should be considered the best induction regimen for high-risk childhood ALL.","['Messinger, Y', 'Uckun, F M']","['Messinger Y', 'Uckun FM']","['Parker Hughes Cancer Center and the Department of Pediatrics, Hughes Institute, St. Paul, MN 55113, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Risk Assessment']",1999/09/24 00:00,1999/09/24 00:01,['1999/09/24 00:00'],"['1999/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Aug;34(5-6):415-32. doi: 10.3109/10428199909058469.,,,['10.3109/10428199909058469 [doi]'],['0 (Anthracyclines)'],,,,122,,,,,,,,,

MNDA was not detected in normal tissue histiocytes but was found in activated macrophages and foreign body giant cells associated with inflammation. Flow cytometric cell sorting of normal bone marrow established that MNDA is initially expressed in myeloid blast cells. Examination of lymphoid tissues showed a low level of expression in a population of normal mande B lymphocytes but not in germinal center cells or plasma cells. A subset of B cell neoplasms expressing MNDA included hairy cell leukemia, parafollicular (monocytoid) B cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and small lymphocytic lymphoma. Cell sorting of normal bone marrow showed MNDA expression in CD20+/CD10-/CD5- B cells. MNDA was not detected in other normal bone marrow or all other nonhematopoietic cells. The hematopoietic cell-specific pattern of MNDA expression was elucidated through a comprehensive analysis of normal and neoplastic tissues, and the results provide further evidence of the coexpression of B- and myeloid cell markers in neoplastic B cells and identify a normal B cell population that might be related to the cell of origin of a subset of B cell neoplasms.","['Miranda, R N', 'Briggs, R C', 'Shults, K', 'Kinney, M C', 'Jensen, R A', 'Cousar, J B']","['Miranda RN', 'Briggs RC', 'Shults K', 'Kinney MC', 'Jensen RA', 'Cousar JB']","['Department of Pathology, Truman Medical Center, University of Missouri, Kansas City, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,IM,"['Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inflammation/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Lymphoid Tissue/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",1999/09/24 00:00,1999/09/24 00:01,['1999/09/24 00:00'],"['1999/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1999 Sep;30(9):1040-9. doi: 10.1016/s0046-8177(99)90221-6.,,,"['S0046-8177(99)90221-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(99)90221-6 [doi]']","['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (MNDA protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",['CA68485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years much effort has been put into elucidating the anatomical nature of nerve injury-induced sympathetic-sensory coupling. The demonstration of sympathetic sprouting into dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of nerve-injured rats has led to the suggestion that this phenomenon might underlie sympathetically-maintained pain. As a result, several studies have been undertaken to determine what factor or factors are responsible for the sprouting, and for the formation of abnormal sympathetic terminal arborizations or 'baskets' around some DRG neurons. In this review we examine in particular the roles of nerve growth factor (NGF) and the cytokines leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), as these have all been shown to contribute to sympathetic sprouting. We also stress the role of satellite cells within axotomized DRG, as these have been shown to express not only neurotrophin mRNA, but also the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor p75. We propose a mechanism for sympathetic sprouting in the DRG involving; (i) the activation of satellite cells on the DRG by a factor such as LIF or IL-6, and (ii) the generation of a sympathetic axon-guiding gradient by p75-bound neurotrophins on the activated satellite cells. We also highlight the possibility that a sympathetic sprouting signal may be derived from the periphery, as NGF, LIF and IL-6 are all produced as a result of Wallerian degeneration, and can be retrograde transported to the DRG. The possible relevance of sympathetic sprouting in the DRG to neuropathic pain is also discussed.","['Ramer, Matt S', 'Thompson, Stephen W N', 'McMahon, Stephen B']","['Ramer MS', 'Thompson SWN', 'McMahon SB']","['Neuroscience Research Centre, GKT School of Biomedical Sciences, Kings College, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Pain,Pain,7508686,IM,"['Animals', 'Ganglia, Spinal/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Pain/*pathology', '*Peripheral Nerve Injuries', 'Sympathetic Nervous System/*pathology']",1999/09/24 00:00,1999/09/24 00:01,['1999/09/24 00:00'],"['1999/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pain. 1999 Aug;Suppl 6:S111-S120. doi: 10.1016/S0304-3959(99)00144-X.,,,"['10.1016/S0304-3959(99)00144-X [doi]', '00006396-199908001-00015 [pii]']",,,,,77,,,,10.1016/S0304-3959(99)00144-X [doi],,,,,

According to some studies L2 morphology is associated with poor prognosis, whereas in others the association disappears after adjustment for other known risk factors. PROCEDURE: We investigated the prognostic importance of lymphoblast L1/L2 morphology in childhood ALL treated with current Nordic ALL protocols in Finland. From the routine bone marrow (BM) aspirate and biopsy slides of 251 children with ALL diagnosed in 1990-1995, the blast cell morphology and early treatment responses were assessed blindly in a central review, using French-American-British (FAB) criteria with the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) modification. RESULTS: L1 morphology (>90% L1) was found in 197 (80%) children and L2 (>/=10% L2) in 49 (20%). Early treatment response was poorer in L2 than in L1: >5% blasts in the marrow on day 15 were seen in 27% of L2 as opposed to 12% of L1 (P = 0.048). The 6-year event-free survival (EFS) in the study population was 75%, 76% in L1 and 70% in L2 (P = 0.34). In the group with white blood cell count (WBC) below 50 x 10(9)/liter at diagnosis, the L2 morphology was associated with inferior survival: 6-year EFS 74% in L2 and 84% in L1 (P = 0.07), with 6-year overall survival (OS) 81% vs. 91% (P = 0.035), respectively. L2 morphology was not associated with any other adverse prognostic factor analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: With the intensive Nordic ALL protocols, lymphoblast L2 morphology is an independent poor prognostic factor, influencing both the early response to treatment and, in the low-WBC group, the ultimate outcome, and should be reemphasized in risk categorization of childhood ALL.","['Kanerva, J', 'Saarinen-Pihkala, U M', 'Riikonen, P', 'Makipernaa, A', 'Mottonen, M', 'Salmi, T T']","['Kanerva J', 'Saarinen-Pihkala UM', 'Riikonen P', 'Makipernaa A', 'Mottonen M', 'Salmi TT']","['Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. jukka.kanerva@helsinki.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/09/24 00:00,1999/09/24 00:01,['1999/09/24 00:00'],"['1999/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1999 Oct;33(4):388-94. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199910)33:4<388::aid-mpo8>3.0.co;2-n.,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199910)33:4<388::AID-MPO8>3.0.CO;2-N [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199910)33:4<388::aid-mpo8>3.0.co;2-n [doi]']",,,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

IRS Group of the Children's Cancer Group and the Pediatric Oncology Group.",362-71,"BACKGROUND: This review of children and adolescents with nonorbital soft-tissue sarcoma of the head and neck was undertaken to describe late sequelae of treatment, as manifested primarily by problems with statural growth, facial and nuchal symmetry, dentition, vision and hearing, and school performance. PROCEDURE: Four hundred sixty-nine patients entered the IRS-II and -III protocols with localized, nonorbital soft-tissue sarcomas of the head and neck from 1978 through 1987. Their overall survival rate was 53% (250/469) at 5 years. Two hundred thirteen patients were surviving relapse-free 5 or more years after diagnosis, for whom there were serial height measurements at 2 or more years after initiation of therapy. Their median age at diagnosis was 5 years; the median length of follow-up was 7 years. All received multiple-agent chemotherapy, and all but 3 received irradiation to the primary tumor volume. Sixty-eight percent of the tumors arose in cranial parameningeal sites, 22% in nonparameningeal sites, and 10% in the neck. We reviewed flow sheets submitted to the IRS Group Statistical Office to ascertain which late sequelae were recorded. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-four patients (77%) had one or more problems recorded. One hundred ninety of the two hundred thirteen patients (89%) were under 15 years of age at study entry, and at follow-up 92 (48%) had failed to maintain their initial height velocity, which had decreased by more than 25 percentile points from the original value. Thirty-six of the one hundred ninety patients (19%) were receiving growth hormone injections. Hypoplasia or asymmetry of tissues in the primary tumor site was reported in 74 patients, and 13 underwent reconstructive surgery. Poor dentition or malformed teeth were noted in 61 patients. Impaired vision developed in 37 patients, owing primarily to cataracts, corneal changes, and optic atrophy. Thirty-six patients had decreased hearing acuity, and 9 were fitted with hearing aids; 5 of these 9 had received cisplatin. Thirty-five patients were noted to have problems learning in school. Four patients developed a second malignancy (two sarcomas, one carcinoma, one leukemia). CONCLUSIONS: Late sequelae affected the majority of these patients treated for soft-tissue sarcoma of the head and neck on IRS-II and -III. The potential impact of certain sequelae could be reduced by specific measures, such as surgical reconstruction and hormonal therapy. Late sequelae must be taken into account in designing future curative treatments.","['Raney, R B', 'Asmar, L', 'Vassilopoulou-Sellin, R', 'Klein, M J', 'Donaldson, S S', 'Green, J', 'Heyn, R', 'Wharam, M', 'Glicksman, A S', 'Gehan, E A', 'Anderson, J', 'Maurer, H M']","['Raney RB', 'Asmar L', 'Vassilopoulou-Sellin R', 'Klein MJ', 'Donaldson SS', 'Green J', 'Heyn R', 'Wharam M', 'Glicksman AS', 'Gehan EA', 'Anderson J', 'Maurer HM']","['Department of Clinical Pediatrics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Behavioral Symptoms/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Face/radiation effects', 'Facial Injuries/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Growth/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Hearing Disorders/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Learning Disabilities/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Sarcoma/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/drug therapy', 'Thyroid Diseases/etiology', 'Tooth/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Vision Disorders/etiology']",1999/09/24 00:00,1999/09/24 00:01,['1999/09/24 00:00'],"['1999/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1999 Oct;33(4):362-71. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199910)33:4<362::aid-mpo4>3.0.co;2-i.,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199910)33:4<362::AID-MPO4>3.0.CO;2-I [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199910)33:4<362::aid-mpo4>3.0.co;2-i [doi]']",,"['CA-24507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29511/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-30138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

In hematopoietic cells this pathway competes with S-methylation catalyzed by thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). However, methylated 6MP metabolites inhibit purine de novo synthesis and thus may enhance incorporation of 6TGN into DNA. Approximately 10% of white individuals have low TPMT activity as a result of polymorphisms in the TPMT gene. The authors attempted to test the hypothesis that the degree of DNA damage during 6MP therapy might reflect variations in 6MP metabolism and pharmacokinetics. METHODS: The authors measured TPMT activity as well as erythrocyte levels of 6TGN (E-6TGN) and methylated 6MP metabolites (E-MeMP) during 6MP therapy in 439 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 5 of whom later developed secondary myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukemia (sMDS/AML). RESULTS: The patients who developed sMDS/AML had significantly lower TPMT activity compared with the remaining patients (P = 0.03). The 55 patients with TPMT activity <14 U/mL red blood cells (RBC) (antimode of the bimodal distribution) had a 5-year risk of sMDS/AML of 9 +/- 6% versus 1 +/- 1% for the remaining patients (P = 0.002). Cox regression analysis identified TPMT activity and E-MeMP level as the strongest predictors of risk for sMDS/AML (global P value = 0.02). Patients with low TPMT activity and high E-MeMP levels had the highest risk. All 5 patients with sMDS/AML had E-6TGN and/or E-MeMP levels > the 90% percentiles or had TPMT activity < 14 U/mL RBC. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate an increased leukemogenic risk when 6MP is administered with other cytotoxic agents in patients with low TPMT activity, and indicate that not only high 6TGN levels but also high levels of methylated metabolites may lead to DNA damage.","['Bo, J', 'Schroder, H', 'Kristinsson, J', 'Madsen, B', 'Szumlanski, C', 'Weinshilboum, R', 'Andersen, J B', 'Schmiegelow, K']","['Bo J', 'Schroder H', 'Kristinsson J', 'Madsen B', 'Szumlanski C', 'Weinshilboum R', 'Andersen JB', 'Schmiegelow K']","['The Laboratory for Pediatric Oncology, The Pediatric Clinic II, The National University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Damage', 'Guanine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Risk', 'Thionucleotides/metabolism']",1999/09/24 00:00,1999/09/24 00:01,['1999/09/24 00:00'],"['1999/09/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/09/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/09/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1999 Sep 15;86(6):1080-6. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990915)86:6<1080::aid-cncr26>3.0.co;2-5.,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19990915)86:6<1080::AID-CNCR26>3.0.CO;2-5 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(19990915)86:6<1080::aid-cncr26>3.0.co;2-5 [doi]']","['0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '15867-02-4 (6-thioguanylic acid)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']","['R01-GM28157/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-GM35720/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['Copyright 1999 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,

The California Cancer Registry has collected data regarding all cancers diagnosed in California since 1988. METHODS: Data regarding all invasive cancers diagnosed in California Hispanic children age <15 years during the 7-year period 1988-1994 were analyzed. Cancers were grouped according to the International Classification for Childhood Cancers. Age-adjusted and age specific incidence rates were compared with the corresponding incidence rates among non-Hispanic white children. RESULTS: Based on available demographic information, the overall incidence rate of cancer was approximately 7% lower among California children classified as Hispanic than among non-Hispanic white children. Hispanic children had higher incidence rates of lymphoid leukemia and gonadal germ cell tumors and a lower incidence rate of astrocytomas and carcinomas than non-Hispanic white children. CONCLUSIONS: These data do not confirm the perception that California Hispanic children have an unusually high cancer incidence rate but there were notable differences between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white children with regard to the incidence rates of certain cancers. The perception may be due in part to the fact that childhood malignancies represented 3.1% of all cancers diagnosed among Hispanics but only 0.5% of all cancers diagnosed among non-Hispanic whites. This is explained by the lower incidence rate of cancer among California Hispanic adults than among non-Hispanic white adults and the difference in the age distribution of the two populations.","['Glazer, E R', 'Perkins, C I', 'Young, J L Jr', 'Schlag, R D', 'Campleman, S L', 'Wright, W E']","['Glazer ER', 'Perkins CI', 'Young JL Jr', 'Schlag RD', 'Campleman SL', 'Wright WE']","['Cancer Surveillance Section, Department of Health Services, State of California Health and Human Services Agency, Sacramento, California 94234-7320, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Bone Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'California/epidemiology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Germinoma/epidemiology', '*Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Kidney Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/epidemiology', '*Whites']",1999/09/24 09:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/09/24 09:00'],"['1999/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1999 Sep 15;86(6):1070-9.,,,['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19990915)86:6<1070::AID-CNCR25>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]'],,['98B1BACAPRVS-04/BA/FDA HHS/United States'],['Copyright 1999 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,
