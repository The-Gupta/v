Here, we compare the incidence of clinical manifestations and the cytokine levels in 30 HTLV-1 carriers with high (> 50,000 copies/10(6) PBMC) and an equal number of subjects with low proviral load. Participants were followed for 3 to 16 years (median of 11 years). The PVL, IFN-gamma, TNF, and IL-10 levels were quantified at entry and at the end of the follow-up. Among the self-reported symptoms in the initial evaluation, only the presence of paresthesia on the hands was more frequent in the group with high PVL (p < 0.04). The production of IFN-gamma was higher in the group with high PVL group (median of 1308 versus 686 pg/ml, p < 0.011) when compared with the control group in the first assessment. There was no difference in the occurrence of urinary symptoms or erectile dysfunction, periodontal disease, Sicca syndrome, and neurologic signs between the two groups during the follow-up. The observation that none of the HTLV-1 carriers with high PVL and with exaggerated inflammatory response progressed to HAM/TSP indicates that other factors in addition to the PVL and an exaggerated immune response are involved in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP.","['0 (IFNG protein, human)', '0 (IL10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",PMC7438297,['NOTNLM'],"['*HTLV-1', '*HTLV-1 carriers', '*HTLV-1-associated myelopathy', '*Myelopathy', '*Proviral load']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It usually produces excessive reactive species, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and cell apoptosis. Our study is designed to examine the role of miR-421 antagomir in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injuries, as well as its underlying mechanisms. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was performed with male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats for the initiation of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injuries. Malondialdehyde (oxidative stress marker) and superoxide dismutase (antioxidant enzyme) were measured as indicators for oxidative stress. Flow cytometry was utilized to evaluate the cell apoptosis effects from miR-421. miR-421 antagomir significantly decreased neurological deficits and infarction volumes. It also downregulated malondialdehyde contents, upregulated superoxide dismutase activities, promoted the expressions of myeloid cells leukemia-1 and B cells lymphoma-2, and downregulated the expressions of Bax in the ischemic cortex. In addition, miR-421targeted MCL1 to exert its biological functions. Our study indicated the neuroprotection effects of miR-421 antagomir on cerebral I/R injuries, which involved the suppression of cell apoptosis and oxidative stress. MiR-421 might provide a new therapeutic direction for ischemia/reperfusion injuries.","['0 (Antagomirs)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, rat)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Ischemia/reperfusion injuries', '*MiR-421', '*Middle cerebral artery occlusion', '*Oxidative stress']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 May 9.,"The use of hydraulic fracturing (HF) to extract oil and natural gas has increased, along with intensive discussions on the associated risks to human health. Three technical processes should be differentiated when evaluating human health risks, namely (1) drilling of the borehole, (2) hydraulic stimulation, and (3) gas or oil production. During the drilling phase, emissions such as NOx, NMVOCs (non-methane volatile organic compounds) as precursors for tropospheric ozone formation, and SOx have been shown to be higher compared to the subsequent phases. In relation to hydraulic stimulation, the toxicity of frac fluids is of relevance. More than 1100 compounds have been identified as components. A trend is to use fewer, less hazardous and more biodegradable substances; however, the use of hydrocarbons, such as kerosene and diesel, is still allowed in the USA. Methane in drinking water is of low toxicological relevance but may indicate inadequate integrity of the gas well. There is a great concern regarding the contamination of ground- and surface water during the production phase. Water that flows to the surface from oil and gas wells, so-called 'produced water', represents a mixture of flow-back, the injected frac fluid returning to the surface, and the reservoir water present in natural oil and gas deposits. Among numerous hazardous compounds, produced water may contain bromide, arsenic, strontium, mercury, barium, radioactive isotopes and organic compounds, particularly benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX). The sewage outflow, even from specialized treatment plants, may still contain critical concentrations of barium, strontium and arsenic. Evidence suggests that the quality of groundwater and surface water may be compromised by disposal of produced water. Particularly critical is the use of produced water for watering of agricultural areas, where persistent compounds may accumulate. Air contamination can occur as a result of several HF-associated activities. In addition to BTEX, 20 HF-associated air contaminants are group 1A or 1B carcinogens according to the IARC. In the U.S., oil and gas production (including conventional production) represents the second largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions. High-quality epidemiological studies are required, especially in light of recent observations of an association between childhood leukemia and multiple myeloma in the neighborhood of oil and gas production sites. In conclusion, (1) strong evidence supports the conclusion that frac fluids can lead to local environmental contamination; (2) while changes in the chemical composition of soil, water and air are likely to occur, the increased levels are still often below threshold values for safety; (3) point source pollution due to poor maintenance of wells and pipelines can be monitored and remedied; (4) risk assessment should be based on both hazard and exposure evaluation; (5) while the concentrations of frac fluid chemicals are low, some are known carcinogens; therefore, thorough, well-designed studies are needed to assess the risk to human health with high certainty; (6) HF can represent a health risk via long-lasting contamination of soil and water, when strict safety measures are not rigorously applied.","['0 (Benzene Derivatives)', '0 (Hydrocarbons)', '0 (Natural Gas)', '0 (Petroleum)', '0 (Volatile Organic Compounds)', '0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)', '3FPU23BG52 (Toluene)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'L5I45M5G0O (ethylbenzene)']",PMC7225182,['NOTNLM'],"['*Environmental pollution', '*Epidemiological studies', '*Human health risk assessment', '*Hydraulic fracturing', '*Unconventional natural gas and oil production']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The R882H DNMT3A is a hotspot mutation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) causing aberrant DNA methylation. However, how this mutation affects the structure and function of DNMT3A remains unclear. Here we report structural characterization of wild-type and R882H-mutated DNMT3A in complex with DNA substrates with different sequence contexts. A loop from the target recognition domain (TRD loop) recognizes the CpG dinucleotides in a +1 flanking site-dependent manner. The R882H mutation reduces the DNA binding at the homodimeric interface, as well as the molecular link between the homodimeric interface and TRD loop, leading to enhanced dynamics of TRD loop.

The stage II clinical factors were analyzed through Lasso regression analysis to screen the risk factors for the construction of Nomogram prediction model. In addition, the model prediction capacity and accuracy were verified internally and externally using the ROC curve, C-index and calibration curve, respectively.A total of 1316 B-ALL children were enrolled in this study. Lasso regression analysis revealed that, Age, Gender, WBC, CNSL, MRD29, BMR, CNS R, BCR-ABL1, BMA29, DS, and DI were the important prognostic risk factors. The C-index values of internal and external verification models were 0.870 and 0.827, respectively, revealing the ideal model discriminating capacity. Besides, the calibration curve had high contact ratio, which suggested favorable consistency between the incidence predicted by the model and the actual incidence.

Although the term RS is most often reserved for transformation of CLL into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and less frequently Hodgkin lymphoma , the list of cases with more variable presentations in the literature is growing. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 71-year-old Caucasian man initially consulted an otolaryngologist for a 1-year history of nasal congestion. DIAGNOSES: The asynchronous occurrence of 2 rare angiocentric Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related lymphoproliferative disorders in a patient with CLL, specifically clonally related lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG), and an extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, are described herein. INTERVENTIONS: Radiation therapy and a regimen of cis-platinum were administered for the NK/T cell lymphoma, and ibrutinib for LYG. OUTCOMES: The patient remains in complete clinical remission 8 years after the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and recurrent extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, and 2 years after the diagnosis of clonally related LYG. LESSONS: Although the precise pathogenesis of RS remains incompletely understood, various molecular alterations, in particular long-term immunosuppression, may lead to RS, similar to the causal link existing between non-Hodgkin lymphomas and HIV infection, and post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders. EBV infection is linked to the pathogenesis of several types of lymphomas and found in a subset of patients with RS; immunosuppression, in the context of CLL or other pathological conditions or pharmacological agents, can disrupt the fine balance between virus and the host immune system, and result in EBV-driven lymphoproliferations of B-, T-, or NK-cell origin. The findings of our literature review thus suggest that such non-diffuse large B-cell lymphoma , non-Hodgkin lymphoma CLL transformations, may be considered as rare variants of RS.",,PMC7440048,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, together with the increase in the survival rate, a more frequent occurrence of secondary malignancies has been observed as well. TKIs have been demonstrated to be a risk factor of malignancies such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, prostate cancer, and skin cancer. However, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) has never been reported as a secondary malignancy after TKI treatment in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). PATIENT CONCERNS: An 81-year-old male patient diagnosed with CML and treated with TKIs for a long period (15 years) was admitted due to a chief complaint of abdominal pain. A large abdominal mass was detected by imaging that included computed tomography. DIAGNOSIS: LPL was confirmed from biopsies after ultrasonography and sigmoidoscopy. Serum IgM level was increased and M protein and monoclonal gammopathy, IgM_kappa light chain type were detected. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received six cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy. OUTCOMES: After chemotherapy, he showed response. The sizes of the abdominal mass and lymph nodes decreased; moreover, serum M protein and IgM levels decreased, as well. CONCLUSION: Herein, for the first time, we describe a patient who developed LPL as a secondary malignancy after administration of TKIs for the treatment of CML. Our observations indicate the importance of awareness of this secondary malignancy that can develop in CML patients treated with TKIs.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (R-CHOP protocol)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",PMC7220158,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inflammation of aging (""inflammaging"") has been proposed as a driver of age-related changes in HSC function and myeloid malignancy, but mechanisms linking these phenomena remain poorly defined. We identified loss of miR-146a as driving aging-associated inflammation in AML patients. miR-146a expression declined in old wild-type mice, and loss of miR-146a promoted premature HSC aging and inflammation in young miR-146a-null mice, preceding development of aging-associated myeloid malignancy. Using single-cell assays of HSC quiescence, stemness, differentiation potential, and epigenetic state to probe HSC function and population structure, we found that loss of miR-146a depleted a subpopulation of primitive, quiescent HSCs. DNA methylation and transcriptome profiling implicated NF-kappaB, IL6, and TNF as potential drivers of HSC dysfunction, activating an inflammatory signaling relay promoting IL6 and TNF secretion from mature miR-146a-/- myeloid and lymphoid cells. Reducing inflammation by targeting Il6 or Tnf was sufficient to restore single-cell measures of miR-146a-/- HSC function and subpopulation structure and reduced the incidence of hematological malignancy in miR-146a-/- mice. miR-146a-/- HSCs exhibited enhanced sensitivity to IL6 stimulation, indicating that loss of miR-146a affects HSC function via both cell-extrinsic inflammatory signals and increased cell-intrinsic sensitivity to inflammation.

In this study, we examine the pathogenetic impact of somatic hemizygous 13q12.2 microdeletions in B-cell precursor (BCP) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using 5 different patient cohorts (in total including 1418 cases). The 13q12.2 deletions occur immediately 5' of FLT3 and involve the PAN3 locus. By detailed analysis of the 13q12.2 segment, we show that the deletions lead to loss of a topologically associating domain border and an enhancer of FLT3. This results in increased cis interactions between the FLT3 promoter and another enhancer located distally to the deletion breakpoints, with subsequent allele-specific upregulation of FLT3 expression, expected to lead to ligand-independent activation of the receptor and downstream signaling. The 13q12.2 deletions are highly enriched in the high-hyperdiploid BCP ALL subtype (frequency 3.9% vs 0.5% in other BCP ALL) and in cases that subsequently relapsed. Taken together, our study describes a novel mechanism of FLT3 involvement in leukemogenesis by upregulation via chromatin remodeling and enhancer hijacking. These data further emphasize the role of FLT3 as a driver gene in BCP ALL.","['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', '13q deletion syndrome']",PMC7498303,,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Blood. 2020 Aug 20;136(8):919-920.

Although, Normal fibroblasts demonstrate anti-tumor effects, cancer associated fibroblasts are principal participant in tumor growth and invasion. The ambiguity of fibroblasts function can be regarded as two heads of its behavioral spectrum and can be subjected for mathematical modeling to identify their switching behavior. In this research, an agent-based model of mutual interactions between fibroblast and cancer cell was created. The proposed model is based on nonlinear differential equations which describes biochemical reactions of the main factors involved in fibroblasts and cancer cells communication. Also, most of the model parameters are estimated using hybrid unscented Kalman filter. The interactions between two cell types are illustrated by the dynamic modeling of TGFbeta and LIF pathways as well as their crosstalk. Using analytical and computational approaches, reciprocal effects of cancer cells and fibroblasts are constructed and the role of signaling molecules in tumor progression or prevention are determined. Finally, the model is validated using a set of experimental data. The proposed dynamic modeling might be useful for designing more efficient therapies in cancer metastasis treatment and prevention.","['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'R6FXH13RRC (Slit homolog 2 protein)']",PMC7209353,,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has few hydrogen bond donors and acceptors but is a chiral 2-arylbutyrate and potentially prone to racemization. We report achiral AR-42 analogues incorporating a cycloalkyl group linked via a quaternary carbon atom, with up to 40-fold increased potency against human class I HDACs (e.g., JT86, IC50 0.7 nM, HDAC1), 25-fold increased cytotoxicity against five human cancer cell lines, and up to 70-fold less toxicity in normal human cells. JT86 was ninefold more potent than racAR-42 in promoting accumulation of acetylated histone H4 in MM96L melanoma cells. Molecular modeling and structure-activity relationships support binding to HDAC1 with tetrahydropyran acting as a hydrophobic shield from water at the enzyme surface. Such potent inhibitors of class I HDACs may show benefits in diseases (cancers, parasitic infections, inflammatory conditions) where AR-42 is active.","['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (OSU-HDAC42 compound)', '0 (Phenylbutyrates)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 May 8.,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac autonomic dysfunction (CAD) is possible following treatment for childhood cancer. The aims of our analyses were to compare the prevalence of CAD between adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and controls, compare exercise response among survivors with and without CAD, and identify treatment-related risk factors for CAD. PROCEDURE: Participants were treated for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital between 1980 and 2003 (N = 338). A comparison group matched for race/ethnicity, age, and sex was also recruited (N = 325). Resting heart rate (HR) was assessed via electrocardiogram, and heart rate recovery (HRR) and exercise capacity were evaluated with submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing. RESULTS: CAD was present in 33.7% of survivors and 27.6% of controls (P = 0.09). Although mean resting HR did not differ between survivors and controls (74 +/- 12 vs 72 +/- 12 beats per minute (bpm), P = 0.07), survivors had lower mean HRR than controls (22 +/- 9 vs 25 +/- 10 bpm; P < 0.001). Survivors with CAD had lower peak exercise tolerance (25.7 +/- 6.5 vs 21.2 +/- 4.9 mL/kg/min, P < 0.001) than those without. Survivors treated with cyclophosphamide in combination with vincristine >/=38 mg/m(2) and/or glucocorticoids >/=10 000 mg/m(2) were 1.56 (95% CI 1.09-2.24) times more likely to have CAD than those without this treatment. Obese survivors were 1.78 (95% CI: 1.31-2.40) times more likely to have CAD than nonobese survivors (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: CAD was present in over one third of survivors and was associated with lower exercise capacity. Obese survivors and those exposed to cyclophosphamide with high doses of vincristine and/or corticosteroids were at greatest risk.",,PMC7302420,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*autonomic dysfunction', '*cardiac', '*chemotherapy', '*obesity', '*survivor']","['CA132901/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA195547/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA195547/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA132901/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,['NIHMS1597994'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Isoform 2 of the glycolytic enzyme hexokinase (HK2) enhances both glucose metabolism and resistance to death stimuli in many neoplastic cell types. Here, we observe that HK2 locates at mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contact sites called MAMs (mitochondria-associated membranes). HK2 displacement from MAMs with a selective peptide triggers mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload caused by Ca(2+) release from ER via inositol-3-phosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and by Ca(2+) entry through plasma membrane. This results in Ca(2+) -dependent calpain activation, mitochondrial depolarization and cell death. The HK2-targeting peptide causes massive death of chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells freshly isolated from patients, and an actionable form of the peptide reduces growth of breast and colon cancer cells allografted in mice without noxious effects on healthy tissues. These results identify a signaling pathway primed by HK2 displacement from MAMs that can be activated as anti-neoplastic strategy.",['EC 2.7.1.1 (Hexokinase)'],PMC7332982,['NOTNLM'],"['*Hexokinase 2', '*anti-neoplastic strategy', '*cancer', '*cell penetrating peptide', '*mitochondria-associated membranes']","['JHU|Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program (NTAP)/International', 'IG 2017/20749/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro', '(AIRC)/International', '2015/17067/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC)/International', ""Children's Tumor Foundation (CTF)/International"", 'Universita degli Studi di Padova/International']",['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Generally, STR alleles are stable and transferred from parent to child or from donor to recipient. However, 3 cases did not follow this norm. Additional work-up with help from forensic literature solved these mysteries. In case 1, the patient received HSCT from his son. The son shared STR alleles in 22/23 loci except Penta E, which was explained by repeat expansion in the son. In case 2, the patient had been in remission for 14 years after HSCT for lymphoma and developed repeat expansion in CSF1PO in granulocytes.

This study is the first to use the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database to analyze sociological risk factors for suicide death in leukemia patients. METHODS: A retrospective search of the SEER database was conducted. Logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors for suicide death. Variables significant in the univariate logistic regression models were subsequently analyzed using multivariate regression. RESULTS: The death rate was highest in California (1.73%). Suicide mortality was more common during the 1970s and 1980s, after which it trended downward. Young age at diagnosis (18-34 vs. >64 years: odds ratio [OR] = 1.537, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.007-2.347; 35-64 vs. >64 years: OR = 1.610, 95% CI = 1.309-1.979), being male (OR = 1.518, 95% CI = 1.230-1.873), and living where a high proportion of people have at least a bachelor's degree (>50% vs. <20%: OR = 8.115, 95% CI = 5.053-13.034) significantly increased suicide death risk.

Epub 2020 May 7.,"Chronic lymphocyte leukemia (CLL) is a B-cell malignancy resisted to apoptosis. Recently, some studies indicated that cytokines such as interleukin 27 (IL-27) can reduce B-cell proliferation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the mechanism underlying the proapoptotic effect of IL-27 on B cells of patients with CLL in comparison with B cells of normal subjects. The effect of IL-27 on the antitumor activity of natural killer (NK) and T cells was also evaluated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from 35 patients with CLL and 15 normal subjects. B cells and PBMCs were cocultured with IL-27 and B cells apoptosis to evaluate proliferation. Both messenger RNA and protein expression of IL-27 and IL-27 receptor were determined using flow cytometry and real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. To evaluate the apoptotic effect of IL-27 on B cells of patients with CLL, Annexin V-FITC and 7-AAD (BioLegend) fluorescent dyes were used. In addition, the IL-27 effect on activation of T cell and NK cell was determined by determining CD96 molecule expression. IL-27 and IL-27 receptor expression in patients with CLL was significantly lower than that of normal subjects (p < .05). IL-27 enhanced apoptosis of B cells in patients with CLL (p < .05) but this effect was not significantly observed in B cells of normal subjects (p > .05). Consequently, IL-27 reduced the proliferation of B cells and enhanced NK cell activity (p < .05). IL-27, through inducing apoptosis, can exert an inhibitory effect on cancer B cells of CLL patients with minimal effect on normal B cells.","['0 (Interleukins)', '0 (MYDGF protein, human)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*IL-27', '*apoptosis', '*chronic lymphocyte leukemia', '*natural killer cell']",,['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the introduction of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the overall survival of patients dramatically increased. The main goal of HSCT is the induction of a graft-versus-leukemia effect to eradicate the residual cancer cells and also reconstitute a healthy immune system for patients. However, relapse is a nettlesome challenge of HSCT. Like many other tumors, hematologic cancer cells induce immune exhaustion leading to immune escape and relapses after HSCT. Besides malignant cells, inhibitory cells such as tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells express various inhibitory receptors capable of inducing exhaustion in immune cells, especially T and natural killer cells. The significance of immune checkpoint blocking in tumor regression in clinical trials led to the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine.

METHODS: The 3-year model included the following comparators: fludarabine + cyclophosphamide + rituximab (FCR), bendamustine + rituximab (BR), obinutuzumab + chlorambucil (GClb), ibrutinib (Ibr), and Ibr+Rituximab/obinutuzumab [Ibr+R/Ibr+G]). TCC included US-specific costs associated with treatment (i.e., drug, administration, and wastage), adverse events, routine care, and monitoring. Dosing and safety data were drawn from clinical trials and US package inserts. Budget impact outcomes were presented on an absolute and per-member per-month (PMPM) basis. Sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty in influential parameters, including scenarios testing the duration of treat-to-progression agents. RESULTS: Over the 3-year time horizon, introducing VEN+G in a 1M-member health plan resulted in total cost savings of $1,550,663 (PMPM - $0.04), compared to a scenario without VEN+G. The fixed 12-month duration of VEN+G contributed to this cost saving by reducing cumulative treatment costs compared with Ibr-based regimens. By year 3, the cumulative difference in TCC of VEN+G compared with Ibr, Ibr+G, and Ibr+R amounted to - $300,942, - $367,001, and - $369,784, respectively. Extensive sensitivity analyses supported the base case findings. CONCLUSIONS: Introducing VEN+G among first-line CLL treatments to a US health plan resulted in cost savings compared to a plan with chemoimmunotherapies and Ibr-based therapies only.

The currently available standard of care technologies for copy number assessment such as conventional karyotype and FISH are either limited by low resolution or restriction to targeted assessment. RECENT FINDINGS: Chromosomal microarray (CMA) is effective in characterization of chromosomal and gene aberrations of diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic significance at a higher resolution than conventional karyotyping. These results are complementary to NGS mutation studies. Copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH), which is prognostic in AML, is currently only identified by CMA. Yet, despite the widespread availability, CMA testing is not routinely performed in diagnostic laboratories due to lack of knowledge on best-testing practices for clinical work-up of myeloid neoplasms. In this review, we provide an overview of the clinical significance of CMA in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN). We will also elaborate the specific clinical scenarios where CMA can provide additional information essential for management and could potentially alter treatment.

This study was conducted to evaluate how physicians risk-stratify patients at the time of MF diagnosis, the accuracy of the risk stratification, and its effect on treatment selection. Medical charts were reviewed at US community hematology/oncology practices in the Cardinal Health Oncology Provider Extended Network; patient clinical characteristics, risk stratification, and treatment data were collected. Physician-assigned risk categorizations were compared with data-derived risk categorizations based on the International Prognostic Scoring System, the system recommended at diagnosis. A total of 491 patients diagnosed with MF between 2012 and 2016 (mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 65.4 [11.8] years; 54.8% male, 69.2% with primary MF) were included. Risk categorization was not assigned for 30.1% of patients. Of the patients with a physician-assigned risk categorization (n = 343), a scoring system was used in 49.9%. Compared with data-derived risk categorizations, 42.9% of physician-assigned risk categorizations were incorrect; 85.0% of incorrect physician-assigned risk categorizations were underestimations. Notably, 38.5% of patients with data-derived intermediate- or high-risk categorizations did not initiate treatment within 120 days of diagnosis. Among patients with data-derived intermediate risk, those with an underestimated physician-assigned risk categorization were significantly less likely to receive treatment within 120 days of diagnosis (51.6% with correct physician-assigned categorization vs 18.5% with underestimated risk categorization; P = 0.0023).

In Kenya it ranks third as a cause of death after infectious and cardiovascular diseases. Nearly 31% of the total cancer burden in sub-Saharan Africa is attributable to infectious agents. Information on cancer burden is scanty in Kenya and this study aimed to provide comprehensive hospital based data to inform policies. Method: A cross-sectional retrospective survey was conducted at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) from January 2008 to December 2012. Data was obtained from the patients files and the study was approved by the KNH/University of Nairobi and MTRH Ethics and Research Committees. Results: In KNH, the top five cancers were: cervical (62, 12.4%), breast (59, 11.8%), colorectal (31, 6.2%), chronic leukemia (27, 5.4%) and stomach cancer (26, 5.2%). Some 154 (30.8%) of these cancers were associated with infectious agents, while an estimated 138 (27.6%) were attributable to infections. Cancers of the cervix (62, 12.4%), stomach (26, 5.2%) and nasopharynx (17, 3.4%) were the commonest infection-associated cancers. In MTRH, the five common types of cancers were Kaposi's sarcoma (93, 18.6%), breast (77, 15.4%), cervical (41, 8.2%), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (37, 7.4%) and colorectal, chronic leukemia and esophageal cancer all with 27 (5.4%). Some 241 (48.2%) of these cancers were associated with infectious agents, while an estimated 222 (44.4%) were attributable to infections. Kaposi's sarcoma (93, 18.6%), cancer of the cervix (41, 8.2%) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (37, 7.4%) were the commonest infection-associated cancers. Conclusion: Our results suggest that 30.8% and 48.2% of the total cancer cases sampled in KNH and MTRH respectively were associated with infectious agents, while 27.6% and 44.4% were attributable to infections in the two hospitals respectively. Reducing the burden of infection-attributable cancers can translate to a reduction of the overall cancer burden.",,PMC7185250,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer burden', 'Kenya', 'infectious agents', 'sub-Saharan Africa']",,['Copyright: (c) 2019 Macharia LW et al.'],,['No competing interests were disclosed.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Mar 27.,"Myeloid sarcoma (MS) carries a poor prognosis, and information on epigenetic modifications in MS is currently limited. In the present study, 214 ten-eleven translocation-2 (TET2)(-/-) mice were successfully constructed. In addition, 436 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 354 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients were recruited. The incidence of MS in mice and patients with TET2 deficiency was examined, and the efficiency of hypomethylating agents (HMAs) was also be evaluated. A total of 93% of the TET2 (-/-) mice developed myeloid malignancies, 5.5% of which were accompanied by MS (n=11). The survival of these TET2 (-/-) mice ranged between 3 and 25 months. No significant difference was observed between the survival of MS and non-MS mice with TET2 loss (P>0.05). In addition, MS cells were transplantable, and their recipients exhibited myeloproliferative characteristics, such as increased white blood cell counts, monocytosis, low erythrocyte counts and hepatosplenomegaly. Their median survival duration was 94.8 days. In the clinical setting, 9.7% of MDS and 11.6% of AML patients with TET2 deficiency developed MS, which was higher compared with previous reports (1.5-9.1%). The median age of the MS patients was 44 years old. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) reduced the incidence of MS in TET2 (-/-) mice, and decitabine was a suitable treatment strategy for MS patients. These data indicate that TET2 deficiency plays a key role in MS and its prognostic significance requires further investigation. HMAs may be a useful treatment for MS patients with TET2 mutations.",,PMC7202316,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'myeloid Sarcoma', 'ten-eleven translocation-2']",,['Copyright: (c) Wang et al.'],,,,['Oncol Lett. 2020 Oct;20(4):41.

Epub 2020 Mar 31.,"Wilms' tumor (WT) is one of the most common types of renal carcinoma in children. The aim of the present study was to construct a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulation network and explore novel prognostic biomarkers for WT. The expression profiles were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database to identify differentially expressed RNAs (DERNAs). Based on the interactions between microRNAs (miRNAs) and mRNAs/long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a ceRNA network was constructed. Functional enrichment analyses were subsequently conducted to explore the functions of the ceRNA-associated DEmRNAs. Survival analysis was performed to screen for prognosis-associated RNAs and the chi(2) test was used to assess the associations between prognosis-associated RNA expression and histology classification/clinical staging. The present study identified 1,784 lncRNAs, 114 miRNAs and 3,337 mRNAs, which were abnormally expressed in WT compared with that in normal samples. By prediction, pairing and network analysis, a ceRNA network consisting of 38 DElncRNAs, 18 DEmiRNAs and 99 DEmRNAs was established. These DEmRNAs were significantly enriched in pathways associated with the occurrence and development of WT. By combining the expression data with survival analysis, seven prognosis-associated RNAs were identified (P<0.05). Of these seven RNAs, two (zinc finger and BTB domain containing 4; and deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 2) were significantly associated with clinical staging and histology classification. Lastly, the expression levels of the seven RNAs were verified in the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The present study revealed that 7 RNAs might be considered as novel prognostic biomarkers and potential treatment targets for therapy in WT. In addition, the ceRNA regulation network could provide novel strategies for further studies on lncRNAs and miRNAs in WT.",,PMC7202313,['NOTNLM'],"['The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'long non-coding RNAs', 'overall survival', 'prognosis']",,['Copyright: (c) Liu et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 May 7.,"PTCL patients exhibit poor survival with existing treatments. We investigated the efficacy of CHOP combined with alemtuzumab in 116 PTCL patients age 61-80 in an open-label, randomized phase 3 trial. Alemtuzumab was given on day 1, to a total of 360 mg in 21 patients, or 120 mg in 37. Hematotoxicity was increased with A-CHOP resulting in more grade >/=3 infections (40% versus 21%) and 4 versus 1 death due to infections, respectively. CR/CRu rate was 60% for A-CHOP and 43% for CHOP, and OR rate was 72% and 66%, respectively. Three-year-EFS, PFS and OS were 27% [15%-39%], 28% [15%-40%], and 37% ([23%-50%] for A-CHOP, and 24% [12%-35%], 29% [17%-41%], and 56% [44%-69%] for CHOP, respectively, showing no significant differences. Multivariate analyses, adjusted for strata and sex confirmed these results (hazard ratio HREFS: 0.7 ([95% CI: 0.5-1.1]; p = 0.094), HRPFS: 0.8 ([95% CI: 0.5-1.2]; p = 0.271), HROS: 1.4 ([95% CI: 0.9-2.4]; p = 0.154). The IPI score was validated, and male sex (HREFS 2.5) and bulky disease (HREFS 2.2) were significant risk factors for EFS, PFS, and OS. Alemtuzumab added to CHOP increased response rates, but did not improve survival due to treatment-related toxicity.","['3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",,,,,,,,,,['ACT-2 study investigators'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether additional chromosomal abnormalities (ACAs) enable an earlier recognition of imminent blastic proliferation and a timelier change of treatment is unknown. One thousand five hundred and ten imatinib-treated patients with Philadelphia-chromosome-positive (Ph+) CML randomized in CML-study IV were analyzed for ACA/Ph+ and blast increase. By impact on survival, ACAs were grouped into high risk (+8, +Ph, i(17q), +17, +19, +21, 3q26.2, 11q23, -7/7q abnormalities; complex) and low risk (all other). The presence of high- and low-risk ACAs was linked to six cohorts with different blast levels (1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 30%) in a Cox model. One hundred and twenty-three patients displayed ACA/Ph+ (8.1%), 91 were high risk. At low blast levels (1-15%), high-risk ACA showed an increased hazard to die compared to no ACA (ratios: 3.65 in blood; 6.12 in marrow) in contrast to low-risk ACA. No effect was observed at blast levels of 20-30%. Sixty-three patients with high-risk ACA (69%) died (n = 37) or were alive after progression or progression-related transplantation (n = 26). High-risk ACA at low blast counts identify end-phase CML earlier than current diagnostic systems. Mortality was lower with earlier treatment.

Epub 2020 May 7.,"Folate metabolism enables cell growth by providing one-carbon (1C) units for nucleotide biosynthesis. The 1C units are carried by tetrahydrofolate, whose production by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase is targeted by the important anticancer drug methotrexate. 1C units come largely from serine catabolism by the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), whose mitochondrial isoform is strongly upregulated in cancer. Here we report the SHMT inhibitor SHIN2 and demonstrate its in vivo target engagement with (13)C-serine tracing. As methotrexate is standard treatment for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we explored the utility of SHIN2 in this disease. SHIN2 increases survival in NOTCH1-driven mouse primary T-ALL in vivo. Low dose methotrexate sensitizes Molt4 human T-ALL cells to SHIN2, and cells rendered methotrexate resistant in vitro show enhanced sensitivity to SHIN2. Finally, SHIN2 and methotrexate synergize in mouse primary T-ALL and in a human patient-derived xenograft in vivo, increasing survival. Thus, SHMT inhibition offers a complementary strategy in the treatment of T-ALL.","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 2.1.2.1 (Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.2.1 (SHMT protein, human)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",PMC7647950,,,"['R00 CA197869/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1DP1DK113643/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | National Institutes', 'of Health (NIH)', 'P30CA072720/Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey (Cancer Institute of New', 'Jersey)', 'R01CA163591/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | National Institutes', 'of Health (NIH)', 'RSG-19-161-01-TBE/American Cancer Society (American Cancer Society, Inc.)', 'R00CA215307/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | National Institutes', 'of Health (NIH)', 'R01 CA236936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DP1 DK113643/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA072720/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA236936/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | National Institutes', 'of Health (NIH)', 'R00 CA215307/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA163591/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00CA197869/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | National Institutes', 'of Health (NIH)']",,,,['NIHMS1587113'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finally, the patient was judged as having Philadelphia chromosome- positive acute myeloid leukemia, and remission induction chemotherapy with the JALSG AML 201 protocol was initiated in combination with dasatinib to achieve complete remission. After 3 courses of consolidation chemotherapy, the anticancer drugs were discontinued because of deterioration of his general condition and renal insufficiency. Six months after the initial treatment, he was referred to our department, and no evidence of recurrence was confirmed on bone marrow examination. However, 2 months later, right massive pleural effusion was detected, and he was admitted to the department of pneumology at our hospital. Thoracoscopic pleural biopsy was performed at the time of chest tube insertion, and he was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia extramedullary recurrence. Peripheral myeloblasts appeared and increased rapidly, accompanied by further exacerbation of renal function; thus, he received palliative care at the department of hematology and oncology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to further our understanding of the role of ASXL1 lesions in malignant hematopoiesis, we generated a novel knock-in mouse model carrying the most frequent ASXL1 mutation identified in MDS patients, p.G643WfsX12. Mutant mice did not display any major hematopoietic defects nor developed any apparent hematological disease. In AML patients, ASXL1 mutations co-occur with mutations in CEBPA and we therefore generated compound Cebpa and Asxl1 mutated mice. Using a transplantation model, we found that the mutated Asxl1 allele significantly accelerated disease development in a CEBPA mutant context. Importantly, we demonstrated that, similar to the human setting, Asxl1 mutated mice responded poorly to chemotherapy. This model therefore constitutes an excellent experimental system for further studies into the clinically important question of chemotherapy resistance mediated by mutant ASXL1.","['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (Asxl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (CEBPA protein, mouse)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",PMC8017816,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we identified a group of novel C8-linked benzofused Pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines (PBD) monomeric hybrids capable of sequence-selective inhibition of NF-kappaB with low nanomolar LD50 values in CLL (n=46) and MM cell lines (n=5). The lead compound, DC-1-192, significantly inhibited NF-kappaB DNA binding after just 4h exposure and demonstrating inhibitory effects on both canonical and non-canonical NF-kappaB subunits. In primary CLL cells, sensitivity to DC-1-192 was inversely correlated with RelA subunit expression (r2=0.2) and samples with BIRC3 or NOTCH1 mutations showed increased sensitivity (P=0.001). RNA-sequencing and gene set enrichment analysis confirmed the over-representation of NF-kappaB regulated genes in the down-regulated gene list. Furthermore, In vivo efficacy studies in NOD/SCID mice, using a systemic RPMI 8226 human multiple myeloma xenograft model, showed that DC-1-192 significantly prolonged survival (P=0.017). In addition, DC1-192 showed synergy with bortezomib and ibrutinib; synergy with ibrutinib was enhanced when CLL cells were co-cultured on CD40L-expressing fibroblasts in order to mimic the cytoprotective lymph node microenvironment (P = 0.01). Given that NF-kappaB plays a role in both bortezomib and ibrutinib resistance mechanisms, these data provide a strong rationale for the use of DC-1-192 in the treatment of NF-kappaB-driven cancers, particularly in the context of relapsed/refractory disease.","['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (pyrrolo(2,1-c)(1,4)benzodiazepine)', '12794-10-4 (Benzodiazepines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",PMC8018133,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent drug discoveries have opened up new options for drug combinations, which is a concept used in other areas for preventing drug resistance. Two of these are (I) Axitinib, which inhibits the T315I mutation of BCR-ABL1, a main source of drug resistance, and (II) Asciminib, which has been developed as an allosteric BCR-ABL1 inhibitor, targeting an entirely different binding site, and as such does not compete for binding with other drugs. These drugs offer new treatment options. METHODS: We measured the proliferation of KCL-22 cells exposed to imatinib-dasatinib, imatinib-asciminib and dasatinib-asciminib combinations and calculated combination index graphs for each case. Moreover, using the median-effect equation we calculated how much axitinib can reduce the growth advantage of T315I mutant clones in combination with available drugs. In addition, we calculated how much the total drug burden could be reduced by combinations using asciminib and other drugs, and evaluated which mutations such combinations might be sensitive to. RESULTS: Asciminib had synergistic interactions with imatinib or dasatinib in KCL-22 cells at high degrees of inhibition. Interestingly, some antagonism between asciminib and the other drugs was present at lower degrees on inhibition. Simulations revealed that asciminib may allow for dose reductions, and its complementary resistance profile could reduce the risk of mutation based resistance. Axitinib, however, had only a minor effect on T315I growth advantage. CONCLUSIONS: Given how asciminib combinations were synergistic in vitro, our modelling suggests that drug combinations involving asciminib should allow for lower total drug doses, and may result in a reduced spectrum of observed resistance mutations. On the other hand, a combination involving axitinib was not shown to be useful in countering drug resistance.","['0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (asciminib)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'C9LVQ0YUXG (Axitinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",PMC7204252,['NOTNLM'],"['Allosteric inhibitor', 'Drug combination', 'Targeted therapy']","['CAN 2015/387/Cancerfonden', 'CAN 2018/362/Cancerfonden (SE)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown by miRNA-seq, that miRNAs from the mir-106a-363 cluster are overexpressed in pediatric T-ALL. In silico analysis indicated their potential involvement in the regulation of apoptosis. Here, we aimed to test the hypothesis on the pro-tumorigenic roles of these miRNAs in T-ALL cells in vitro. We demonstrate, for the first time, that hsa-miR-20b-5p and hsa-miR-363-3p from the mir-106a-363 cluster, when upregulated in T-ALL cells in vitro, protect leukemic cells from apoptosis, enhance proliferation, and contribute to growth advantage. We show, using dual luciferase reporter assays, Ago2-RNA immunoprecipitation, RT-qPCR, and Western blots, that the oncogenic effects of these upregulated miRNAs might, at least in part, be mediated by the downregulation of two important tumor suppressor genes, PTEN and BIM, targeted by both miRNAs. Additionally, we demonstrate the cooperative effects of these two miRNAs by simultaneous inhibition of both miRNAs as compared to the inhibition of single miRNAs. We postulate that hsa-miR-20b-5p and hsa-miR-363-3p from the mir-106a-363 cluster might serve as oncomiRs in T-ALL, by contributing to post-transcriptional repression of key tumor suppressors, PTEN and BIM.","['0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (MIRN20b microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN363 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",PMC7290785,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*miRNA cluster', '*noncoding RNAs in cancer', '*oncogenic miRNAs', '*silencing tumor suppressor genes']",,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression levels of genes by binding to the untranslated regions of transcripts. Although miRNAs have been previously shown to play a crucial role in CLL development, progression and treatment resistance, their further processing and diversification by RNA editing (specifically adenosine to inosine or cytosine to uracil deamination) has not been addressed so far. In this study, we analyzed next generation sequencing data to provide a detailed map of adenosine to inosine and cytosine to uracil changes in miRNAs from CLL and normal B cells. Our results reveal that in addition to a CLL-specific expression pattern, there is also specific RNA editing of many miRNAs, particularly miR-3157 and miR-6503, in CLL.

Five hundred and nine patients aged 60 years or older (median age, 68 years) were prospectively enrolled in the intensive Acute Leukemia French Association (ALFA)-1200 trial between 2012 and 2016, and 471 patient samples were submitted to multigene analysis. Mutations in any of 8 genes frequently altered in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), including ASXL1, SRSF2, STAG2, BCOR, U2AF1, EZH2, SF3B1, and ZRSR2, defined a secondary AML (sAML)-like disease, as reported. Of the samples analyzed, 48% included sAML-like gene mutations. These mutations were associated with a shorter event-free survival, both overall (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.79; P < .001) and within the European LeukemiaNet (ELN)-2017 intermediate-risk subgroup (hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-2.28; P = .044), which excludes ASXL1-mutated cases by definition. We therefore included patients with intermediate-risk AML carrying sAML-like mutations in a single high-risk patients group together with adverse-risk patients with AML, whereas other intermediate-risk patients were included in a standard-risk group together with favorable-risk patients (high-risk/standard-risk patient ratio, 1.00). Using this 2-class risk assessment, we observed that transplantation prolonged overall survival from remission in patients with high-risk AML only, not in patients with standard-risk AML. Routine analysis of sAML-like gene mutations may thus improve the definition of high-risk older patients with AML, and better identify the half of older patients who clearly derive survival benefit from allogeneic transplantation in first remission.

However, early thrombo-haemorrhagic complications and mortality remain high. We aimed to investigate how the timing of ATRA initiation and the inclusion of ATO influence patient outcomes. Clinical records were retrospectively reviewed for all patients treated for APL in a single, tertiary centre during 2000-2017. Among 70 patients with APL, 36 (51.4%) presented with thrombo-haemorrhagic complications, and four (5.8%) died within 30 days. The median time to ATRA initiation was 11.2 (range 0-104) h from the time of admission. Patients requiring more transfusions started on ATRA sooner (P=0.04). Patients with adverse early events did not start ATRA later (P=0.99). Nevertheless, patients that required additional tests for diagnosis (PML immunofluorescence or molecular) started on ATRA later (28.5 versus 5.3h; P<0.0001), and had more thrombo-haemorrhagic complications (P=0.04). Long-term survival was actually better in patients who started ATRA later (P=0.03), which is likely explained by higher proportion of low risk patients in this group. Patients treated with ATO (n=23) maintained higher fibrinogen levels and required less transfusions during induction (P<0.05), with no disease-related deaths in this group over a median follow-up time of 37.8 months (interquartile range 44.9 months). In summary, fast ATRA initiation reduces early but not late adverse events in APL patients, and the inclusion of ATO helps further improve both early and late outcomes in APL.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL)', 'All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)', 'Arsenic trioxide (ATO)', 'Bleeding complications', 'Early deaths', 'Overall survival', 'Transfusion support']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2020 May 6.,"CD44 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein interacting with a number of extracellular components, including hyaluronic acid (HA). CD44-HA axis is involved in a variety of processes, including adhesion, migration, differentiation, trafficking, and others. CD44 is overexpressed in several cancers where binding of HA induces signal transduction leading to activation of antiapoptotic proteins and factors linked to drug resistance. As such, CD44 has been implicated in cancer growth, progression, and metastasis. It has been convincingly demonstrated that blocking CD44-HA interaction decreases cancer cell survival and metastasis. In this study, using in vitro selection, we have developed DNA aptamers recognizing a HA-binding domain of CD44 with high affinity and specificity. The aptamers bind to CD44 with nanomolar affinities and efficiently inhibit the growth of leukemic cancer cells characterized by high expression of CD44.

Thus, novel formulations are needed to improve the population benefiting from immunotherapy. Here, we report a combined therapeutic modality based on oncolytic virus nanovesicles composed of CaCl2, oncolytic virus Ad5, lecithin and cholesterol (Lipo-Cap-Ad5) with immune checkpoint blockade (anti-PD-1 antibody). We investigated in vivo antitumour activity, systemic toxicity and mechanism of antitumour immune responses of Lipo-Cap-Ad5 + anti-PD-1 blockade, in a murine B16F10 tumour xenograft model. Through a series of in vivo studies, we found that Lipo-Cap-Ad5 in combination with anti-PD-1 blockade drastically reduced the tumour growth by 76.6%, and prolonged animals' survival with no obvious toxicity observed in heart, liver and kidney. The combination therapy facilitates tumour infiltration of effector CD4(+), CD8(+) T cells and increases secretion of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. Therefore, Lipo-Cap-Ad5 in combination with anti-PD-1 blockade can potentiate and activate the immune system synergistically, ultimately creating a pro-inflammatory environment. These results suggest that combination immunotherapy of Lipo-Cap-Ad5 and anti-PD-1 blockade developed in this study has promising applications to enhance therapeutic efficacy with the potential of being translated into clinical practice.",['0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)'],,['NOTNLM'],"['*Combination immunotherapy', '*immune checkpoint inhibitors', '*melanoma', '*nanovesicles', '*oncolytic virus']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, the usage of biocompatible polymeric nanomaterials to form an intelligently sensitive carrier for the targeted release in tumour microenvironment has attracted wide attention. These different intelligent polymeric micelles (PMs) could change the pharmacokinetics process of drugs or respond in the special microenvironment of tumour site to maximise the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of doxorubicin in other tissues and organs. Several intelligent PMs have already been in the clinical research stage and planned for market. Therefore, related research remains active, and the latest nanotechnology approaches for doxorubicin delivery are always in the spotlight.

Treatment with purine nucleoside analogs (PNA) results in a high response rate and remains the standard of care. Long term follow-up shows that most patients relapse and require retreatment. Newer combination strategies and agents have emerged to try to reduce the relapse rate and to address cases of PNA refractoriness. AREAS COVERED: The authors reviewed the literature on the pharmacological management of HCL, including recent studies that led to new agents being incorporated into practice. EXPERT OPINION: Combination of cladribine plus rituximab produces a high rate of measurable residual disease-negative complete remission. In our center, newly diagnosed patients are offered cladribine followed by 8 weekly doses of rituximab in an ongoing phase II trial. Patients in first relapse are also offered this combination if they were initially treated with a single-agent PNA, or if the remission duration was >/=5 years after first-line cladribine plus rituximab. Patients who relapse within 5 years are offered therapy with a novel agent that may include the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib, alone or in combination with rituximab, dabrafenib in combination with trametinib, the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib, or moxetumomab pasudotox.","['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '2NDX4B6N8F (immunotoxin HA22)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Hairy Cell Leukemia', 'cladribine', 'pharmacological management', 'rituximab']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 May 7.,"INTRODUCTION: Recent advances in genetic analysis have led to the discovery of novel genetic subtypes of precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with prognostic relevance. In this study, we studied a cohort of pediatric B-ALL patients to retrospectively determine the incidence of patients harboring novel genetic subtypes, as well as their outcome. METHODS: B-ALL patients (N = 190) diagnosed in a single Korean hospital were included in the study. Patients' medical records were reviewed for data on established genetic abnormalities and outcome. CRLF2 expression was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Anchored multiplex PCR-based enrichment was used to detect fusions and point mutations in 81 ALL-related genes. RESULTS: Incidence of established recurrent genetic subtypes was as follows: high hyperdiploidy (21.6%), ETV6-RUNX1 (21.6%), BCR-ABL1 (7.9%), KMT2A rearrangement (7.4%) TCF3-PBX1/TCF3-HLF (7.4%), and hypodiploidy (1.1%). Incidence of new genetic subtypes was as follows: BCR-ABL1-like (13.2%), ETV6-RUNX1-like (2.1%), EWSR1-ZNF384 (1.1%), and iAMP21 (1.1%). Median age at diagnosis of BCR-ABL1-like ALL was 6.8 years. According to type of genetic abnormality, BCR-ABL1-like ALL was divided into ABL class (12%), CRLF2 class (8%), JAK-STAT class (12%), and RAS class (68%). The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) of BCR-ABL1-like patients was significantly inferior to non-BCR-ABL1-like low- and standard-risk patients (71.5 +/- 9.1% vs 92.5 +/- 3.2%, P = .001) and comparable to non-BCR-ABL1-like high (75.2 +/- 6.2%) and very high-risk patients (56.8 +/- 7.4%). All four ETV6-RUNX1-like patients survived event-free. CONCLUSION: Analogous to previous studies, incidence of BCR-ABL1-like ALL in our cohort was 13.2% with outcome comparable to high and very high-risk patients. A significantly high number of RAS class mutations was a distinct feature of our BCR-ABL1-like ALL group.","['0 (CRLF2 protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (EWSR1 protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein EWS)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (TCF3-HLF fusion protein, human)', '0 (TCF3-PBX1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (ZNF384 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",PMC7333828,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL1-like', '*RAS mutation', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",,['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Epub 2020 Jun 1.,"HUWE1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is involved in cancer cell proliferation by regulating MCL-1 stability. The HECT domain has been shown to be required for the ubiquitin ligase activity of HUWE1. To identify efficient drugs that impair the activity of HUWE1, and thus decrease MCL-1 accumulation, we screened 2000 candidate compounds that might suppress HUWE1 activity. To evaluate these 2000 candidates, the HECT domain of HUWE1, which is the catalytic domain responsible for MCL1 ubiquitination, was selected as a conjugation site, and putative binding candidates were filtrated. Tobramycin emerged as one of the compounds that show efficient binding ability with the HECT domain of HUWE1. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) results validated the specific binding of Tobramycin with the HECT domain. Subsequent analyses demonstrated its potential to inhibit cancer cell proliferation by binding to the HECT domain of HUWE1 and impeding the HUWE1-mediated ubiquitination of MCL-1. Consequently, the accumulation of MCL-1 inhibited the proliferation of tumour cells, while the apoptosis rates were not significantly altered after Tobramycin treatment. In vitro experiments showed that Tobramycin could inhibit cell proliferation by regulating the G2/M transition in cancer cell models, including A549 and HeLaCaco2 cell lines. Our results indicated that Tobramycin could be a potential new probe to develop targeted therapies for the prevention or treatment of HUWE1-overexpressing cancers.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (HUWE1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'VZ8RRZ51VK (Tobramycin)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*HUWE1', '*MCL-1', '*tobramycin', '*tumour', '*ubiquitin']",,"['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite their clinical importance, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the contribution of mutant ASXL1 to cancer pathogenesis remain to be elucidated. Thus, we analyzed the roles of the hyperactive complex formed by mutant ASXL1 and the deubiquitinase BAP1 in promoting myeloid leukemogenesis. BAP1 expression resulted in the stabilization and increased monoubiquitination of mutant but not wildtype ASXL1. Monoubiquitination of mutant ASXL1 enhanced the catalytic function of BAP1, resulting in a profound reduction in H2AK119ub by counteracting the PRC1 complex. The mutant ASXL1-BAP1 hyperactive complex impaired the multi-lineage differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells and accelerated myeloid leukemogenesis. Mechanistically, the mutant ASXL1/BAP1 complex induced the upregulation of HOXA5, HOXA7, HOXA9, and IRF8 via a reduction in H2AK119ub. Importantly, BAP1 depletion inhibited the leukemogenicity of mutant ASXL1-expressing myeloid leukemia cells and MLL-rearranged leukemia cells by reducing the expression levels of HOXA5, HOXA7, and HOXA9. Our findings highlight the potential of BAP1 as a therapeutic target in a broad range of myeloid neoplasms.","['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (BAP1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ASXL1', 'Myeloid leukemia', 'PR-DUB', 'Polycomb repressive complex']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Next-generation sequencing technology has also revealed that clonal hematopoiesis is a common, age-related process, in which a somatically mutated hematopoietic precursor gives rise to a genetically distinct subpopulation in the blood. Furthermore, novel germline mutations have been identified, indicating that mutated stem cells appear long before MDS presentation.

These cells express specific antigens (e.g., CD123, CD47, TIM-3) and depend on several signaling pathways (e.g., WNT/beta-catenin and PI3K/AKT/FOXO pathways) and mitochondrial respiration for growth and survival.

However, there are limited data for pediatric patients treated with this drug. Herein, we report the clinical courses of two children with FLT3-mutated recurrent AML who received gilteritinib. Case 1: An 11-year-old boy with secondary relapsed AML presented with an FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) since the first recurrence. One week after gilteritinib initiation, blasts, which had comprised 90% of the white blood cells before treatment, almost disappeared from the peripheral blood without tumor lysis syndrome. The patient developed multiple adverse effects and died from the disease 2.5 months after gilteritinib initiation. Case 2: A 12-year-old girl diagnosed with AML was positive for FLT3 ITD. She received gilteritinib during her first relapse post-stem cell transplantation. After the drug was administered, the recipient cell counts increased, as determined by molecular tests (i.e., FISH), whereas microscopically, there was a complete response for 5 months with good performance status. Gilteritinib treatment in children with FLT3-mutated recurrent AML is feasible and effective. As a patient experienced several adverse effects with gilteritinib treatment, clinical trials are required to determine the appropriate pediatric dose of this medication.","['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (gilteritinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3 internal tandem duplication', 'Gilteritinib', 'NUP98-NSD1 fusion', 'Pediatric acute myeloid leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequent evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid suggested central nervous system graft versus host disease (GVHD); hence, prednisolone therapy was initiated.

Epub 2020 Apr 23.,"The overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl2 in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) may contribute to difficulties in eradicating these cells during chemotherapy. In the present study, doxorubicin (Dox) was evaluated for its potential to induce selective apoptotic cell death in AML MOLM13 cells and to modulate autophagy through Bcl2 and Beclin 1 protein expression. Annexin V/propidium iodide and 5(6)carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) flow cytometric analyses were conducted to determine the effects of Dox on cell death and cell proliferation, respectively, following 48 h of coincubation with AML MOLM13 or U937 monocytic cells. The protein expression levels of Bcl2 and Beclin 1 in untreated and treated cells were quantified by western blot analysis. Dox reduced the viability of MOLM13 cells partly by inhibiting cell division and inducing cell apoptosis. Dox demonstrated a level of selectivity in its cytotoxicity against MOLM13 compared to U937 cells (P<0.05). Dox induced a significant decrease in Beclin 1 protein levels in MOLM13 cells without significantly affecting the protein levels in U937 monocytes. A novel Bcl2 1520 kDa (p1520Bcl2) isoform was found to be selectively expressed in AML MOLM13 cells (but absent in the leukaemic cell lines tested, OCIAML2, CML K562 and U937). Dox induced a highly significant inhibition of p1520Bcl2 at concentrations of 0.5, 0.75 and 1 microM (P<0.01). However, the usual 26 kDa Bcl2 (p26Bcl2alpha) isoform protein expression was not affected by the drug in either the MOLM13 or U937 cells. It was thus postulated that Dox exhibited some selectivity by targeting the p1520Bcl2 isoform in MOLM13 cells and activating Beclin 1 to induce cell death.","['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",PMC7252449,['NOTNLM'],"['*doxorubicin', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*Bcl-2', '*Beclin 1', '*5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester', '*Annexin V/propidium iodide', '*apoptosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 May 4.,"MicroRNA (miR)-19b is expressed in various types of tumors and may serve as a potential therapeutic target. The miR1792 cluster is upregulated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) tissues and cells. miR19b is a member of the miR1792 cluster; however, its expression and function in NPC are largely unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the expression and function of miR19b in NPC cells. The miRCURY LNATM miRNA Inhibitor (miR19b inhibitor and negative control) were transfected into C6661 cells. The proliferation, apoptosis and migration of the cells were subsequently detected by the Cell Counting Kit8 assay, flow cytometry and Transwell assay, respectively. Additionally, the expression of STAT3 signaling pathwayassociated proteins [STAT3, pSTAT3 and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1)] and the transcriptional targets of pSTAT3 [Bcl2, myeloid leukemia protein 1 (Mcl1) and cyclin D1] were detected by western blotting. The miR19b inhibitor inhibited proliferation and migration and induced apoptosis of C6661 cells. Furthermore, the miR19b inhibitor upregulated the expression of SOCS1, a predicted target gene of miR19b, and decreased the phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705 and Ser727. These data indicated that upregulation of SOCS1, an endogenous inhibitor of STAT3 phosphorylation, attenuated the STAT3 signaling pathway in C6661 cells. Moreover, the expression level of the proproliferative protein cyclin D1 and antiapoptotic proteins Mcl1 and Bcl2 was significantly decreased following transfection with the miR19b inhibitor. The aforementioned three proteins are downstream transcriptional targets of the activated STAT3 signaling pathway. The results of the present study revealed that inhibition of miR19b negatively modulated the malignant behavior of NPC cells via the STAT3 signaling pathway. Therefore, miR19b inhibition may serve as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of NPC.","['0 (MIRN19 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)']",PMC7248468,['NOTNLM'],"['*nasopharyngeal neoplasms', '*micrornas', '*STaT3 transcription factor', '*cell proliferation', '*apoptosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 May 6.,"In the past few years, international treatment guidelines for chronic myeloid leukaemia have incorporated recommendations for attempting discontinuation of treatment with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) outside of the setting of a clinical trial with the aim of a treatment-free remission (TFR). Physicians involved in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia need to be sufficiently well informed to guide patients through decision-making about the discontinuation of treatment with TKIs targeting BCR-ABL1 by providing a balanced assessment of the potential risks and benefits of stopping or continuing therapy. These guidelines also seek to ensure that the risks associated with being off treatment are kept to a minimum. In this Review, we summarize the clinical studies of TFR and how their results can guide routine clinical practice with a focus on specific aspects such as molecular monitoring and the pregnancy-specific risks associated with a TFR attempt in female patients. We also address the development of predictors of outcome after TKI discontinuation and present strategies that warrant further consideration to enable more patients to enter TFR.","['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients received pomalidomide 4 mg daily from days 1-21 and dexamethasone 40 mg weekly (28-day cycles). Daratumumab 16 mg/kg was administered per label. Primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. Per protocol, all patients (N = 112) had received lenalidomide in their most recent prior regimen (75.0% lenalidomide refractory). ORR was 77.7% (76.2% in lenalidomide-refractory patients); median follow-up was 17.2 months. Median PFS was not reached (1-year PFS rate 75.1%).

METHODS: Endometrial cancer cell lines HEC-1B and RL95-2 were infected with a recombinant lentivirus to overexpress LIF, and the changes in LIF expression was verified using RT-qPCR and ELISA. The viability of the LIF-overexpressing cells was assessed using CCK-8 assay, and the cell apoptosis and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential in response to cisplatin or paclitaxel treatment were analyzed with annexin V-FITC/PI staining and JC-1 assay, respectively. The effect of LIF overexpression on the expressions of Bcl-2 family proteins and STAT3 pathway was evaluated using Western blotting; dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was employed to detect the transcriptional activity of STAT3. The effect of STAT3 silencing on apoptosis of the LIF-overexpressing cells induced by cisplatin or paclitaxel was investigated. RESULTS: The cell lines infected with the recombinant lentivirus showed significantly increased mRNA and protein levels of LIF (P < 0.05) without obvious changes in the cell viability (P>0.05). LIF overexpression significantly attenuated cisplatin-or paclitaxel-induced apoptosis of the endometrial cancer cells (P < 0.05) and markedly increased mitochondrial membrane potential of the cells (P < 0.05). The expressions of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and p-STAT3 proteins increased obviously while the expressions of Bax, Bad and STAT3 either decreased or showed no obvious changes in the LIF-overexpressing cells. Overexpressing LIF significantly enhanced the transcriptional activity of STAT3 (P < 0.05), and silencing STAT3 obviously enhanced apoptosis of the endometrial cancer cells overexpressing LIF (P < 0.05).

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 243 children with ALL diagnosed between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2018 in the Department of Pediatrics of Nanfang Hospital (Guangzhou China). Kaplan Meier-survival analysis was performed to compare the survival time between the patients with D19 MRD < 1% and those with D19 MRD >/= 1%; logistic regression analyisis and Chi-square test were used to identify the risk factors of D19 MRD >/= 1%. RESULTS: Compared with those with D19 MRD >/= 1%, the children with D19 MRD < 1% had significantly better 3-year overall survival (100% vs 90.2%, P=0.004) and event-free survival (97.6% vs 71.6%, P < 0.001). Univariate analysis showed that the odds ratio (OR) for mediastinal invasion, T-cell immunophenotype, TEL/AML1 fusion gene and the presence of blasts in peripheral blood on the 5th day were 4.47 (95%CI: 0.275-72.968, P=0.034), 5.250 (95%CI: 1.950-14.133, P=0.02), 0.330 (95%CI: 0.112-0.970, P=0.036) and 4.407 (95%CI: 1.782-10.895, P=0.01), respectively. The initial risk stratification (P < 0.001), white blood cell grades (P=0.018) and its counts (P=0.027), and the number of blasts on the 5th day (P < 0.001) were significantly different between the two groups. Multivariate analysis showed that initial risk stratification as intermediate and high risks (OR=2.889, 95% CI: 1.193-6.996) and the presence of blasts in peripheral blood on the 5th day (OR=4.477, 95% CI: 1.692-11.843) were independent risk factors for poor early treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: D19 MRD >/= 1% is a predictor of poor prognosis in children with ALL. Mediastinal invasion, T-cell immunophenotype and the presence of blasts in peripheral blood on the 5th day are all risk factors for poor early treatment response, while TEL/AML1 fusion gene is a protective factor; the initial risk stratification as intermediate to high risk and the presence of blasts in peripheral blood on the 5th day are independent risk factors for poor early treatment response of the patients.",,PMC7086137,['NOTNLM'],"['childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'minimal residual disease', 'risk factors', 'survival analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 May 4.,"Arsenic trioxide (As2O3), a front-line therapeutic agent against acute promyelocytic leukemia, has a broad spectrum against malignancies. Unfortunately, the clinical application of As2O3 in treating hematological cancers has not been transformed to solid tumors, for its dose-limited toxicity and undesirable pharmacokinetics. The ordinary As2O3 loaded nanodrugs (such as liposomes, polymer micelles, albumin-based nanodrugs, and silica-based nanodrugs, etc.) still could not fuel up pharmaceuticals and eradicate toxicity for low delivery efficiency caused by the instability and severe drug leakage of formulations during circulation. Recently, the approach of forming and delivering arsenic-metal complexes which will dissociate in the tumoral environment caught our mind. This is the most effective strategy to reduce drug leakage in circulation and accumulate arsenite ions in tumor sites, therefore promote the anti-tumor effect and lighten the toxicity of the drug. This review aims to explain the formation mechanism of arsenic-metal nanocomposites and summarize the constructing strategies of the arsenic-metal nanocomplexes (arsenic-nickel, arsenic-manganese, arsenic-platinum, arsenic-gadolinium, arsenic-zinc, and arsenic-iron nanobins) loaded nanodrugs for solid tumor therapy. Furthermore, the expectations and challenges of arsenic-metal complexes containing nanodrugs for cancer therapy in the future were discussed.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Transition Elements)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Arsenic-metal complexes', 'Drug delivery', 'Formation mechanism', 'Solid tumor', 'Tumoral environment']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2020 May 4.,"The antipsychotic drug chlorpromazine (CPZ) has potential for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, if central nervous system side-effects resulting from its passage through the blood-brain barrier can be prevented. A robust drug delivery system for repurposed CPZ would be drug-in-cyclodextrin-in-liposome that would redirect the drug away from the brain while avoiding premature release in the circulation. As a first step, CPZ complexation with cyclodextrin (CD) has been studied. The stoichiometry, binding constant, enthalpy, and entropy of complex formation between CPZ and a panel of CDs was investigated by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). All the tested CDs were able to include CPZ, in the form of 1:1, 1:2 or a mixture of 1:1 and 1:2 complexes. In particular, a substituted gamma-CD, sugammadex (the octasodium salt of octakis(6-deoxy-6-S-(2-carboxyethyl)-6-thio)cyclomaltooctaose), formed exclusively 1:2 complexes with an extremely high association constant of 6.37 x 10(9) M(-2). Complexes were further characterized by heat capacity changes, one- and two-dimensional (ROESY) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, protection of CPZ against photodegradation by CDs was assessed. This was accelerated rather than reduced by complexation with CD. Altogether these results provide a molecular basis for the use of CD in delayed release formulations for CPZ.","['0 (Cyclodextrins)', '0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (beta-Cyclodextrins)', '0 (gamma-Cyclodextrins)', '361LPM2T56 (Sugammadex)', 'KZJ0BYZ5VA (gamma-cyclodextrin)', 'U42B7VYA4P (Chlorpromazine)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chlorpromazine', 'Cyclodextrin', 'Inclusion complex', 'Photodegradation', 'Repurposing', 'Sugammadex']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Natural history and molecular studies indicate that infant acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) originates in utero, is distinct from childhood ALL, and most cases are caused by MLL-r resulting in an oncogenic MLL fusion protein. Unlike childhood ALL, only a very small number of additional mutations are present in infant ALL, indicating that MLL-r alone may be sufficient to give rise to this rapid onset, aggressive leukaemia in an appropriate fetal cell context. Despite modifications in treatment approaches, the outcome of MLL-r infant ALL has remained dismal and a clear understanding of the underlying biology of the disease is required in order to develop appropriate disease models and more effective therapeutic strategies.","['149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,"['17001/LLR_/Blood Cancer UK/United Kingdom', 'MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '216632/Z/19/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2020 May 4.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most common, complex, and heterogeneous hematological malignancies in adults. Despite progresses in understanding the pathology of AML, the 5-year survival rates still remain low compared with CML, CLL, etc. The relationship between genomic features and drug responses is critical for precision medication. Herein, we depicted a picture for response of 145 drugs against 33 primary cell samples derived from AML patients with full spectrum of genomic features assessed by whole exon sequencing and RNA sequencing. In general, most of the samples were much more sensitive to the combinatorial chemotherapy regimens than the single chemotherapy drugs. Overall, these samples were moderately sensitive to the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and the targeted drugs. In the weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), the TCM and targeted therapies displayed similar genetic signatures in the gene module correlation. Meanwhile, the expression of miRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs did not display apparent gene module correlations among those different types of therapies. In addition, the combinatorial chemotherapy bear more module correlations than the single drugs. Interestingly, we found that the gene mutations and drug response were not enriched in any WGCNA module analysis. Most of the sensitive drug response biomarkers were enriched in the ribosome, endocytosis, cell cycle, and p53 associated signaling pathways. This study showed that gene expression modules might show better correlation than gene mutations for drug efficacy predictions.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*Drug response', '*Gene mutations']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2020 May 4.,"One of the main theories accounting for the underlying pathophysiology of schizophrenia posits alterations in GABAergic neurotransmission. While previous gene expression studies of postmortem brain samples typically report the down-regulation of GABA related genes in schizophrenia, the results are often inconsistent and not uniform across studies. We performed a systematic gene expression analysis of 22 GABA related genes in postmortem superior temporal gyrus (STG) samples of 19 elderly subjects with schizophrenia (mean age: 77) and 14 matched controls from the Icahn school of Medicine at Mount Sinai (MSSM) cohort. To test the validity and robustness of the resulting differentially expressed genes, we then conducted a meta-analysis of the MSSM and an independent dataset from the Stanley Consortium of 14 STG samples of relatively young subjects with schizophrenia (mean age: 44) and 15 matched controls. For the first time, the findings showed the down-regulation of three GABA-receptor subunits of type A, GABRA1, GABRA2 and GABRB3, in the STG samples of subjects with schizophrenia, in both the elderly and the relatively young patients. These findings, as well as previous results, lend weight to the notion of a common upstream pathology that alters GABAergic neurotransmission in schizophrenia. GABRA1, GABRA2 and GABRB3 down-regulation may contribute to the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of schizophrenia through altered oscillation synchronization in the STG.","['0 (GABRA1 protein, human)', '0 (GABRA2 protein, human)', '0 (GABRB3 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, GABA)', '0 (Receptors, GABA-A)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*GABRA1', '*GABRA2', '*GABRB3', '*Gene expression', '*Schizophrenia', '*Superior temporal gyrus']",,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Current studies have found that VEGF plays an important role in hematologic diseases including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the circulating levels of VEGF in AML were still controversial among published studies. METHODS: Three databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to February 2020. All articles included in the meta-analysis met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies will be screened and data extracted by two independent investigators. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and the Risk of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool were applied to evaluate the quality of the included studies. A random-effects model was applied to pool the standardized mean difference (SMD). Heterogeneity test was performed by the Q statistic and quantified using I(2). All statistical analysis was conducted in Stata 12.0 software. RESULTS: Fourteen case-control studies were finally included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was high in our included studies (I(2) = 91.1%, P < 0.001). Sensitivity analysis showed no significant change when any one study was excluded using random-effect methods (P > 0.05). Egger's linear regression test showed that no publication bias existed (P > 0.05). Patients with AML, mainly those newly diagnosed and untreated, have higher VEGF levels (SMD = 0.85, 95% CI 0.28-1.42). Moreover, AML patients in n >/= 40 group, plasma group, Asia and Africa group, and age >/= 45 group had higher circulating VEGF levels (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to healthy controls, our meta-analysis shows a significantly higher level of circulating VEGF in AML patients, and it is associated with sample size, sample type, region, and age.","['0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)']",PMC7201671,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Meta-analysis', '*Vascular endothelial growth factor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is no information on the impact of donor types using homogeneous prophylaxis with PTCy. METHODS: We retrospectively compared outcomes of adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR1) who received a first allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) with PTCy as GVHD prophylaxis from MSD (n = 215), MUD (n = 235), and Haplo (n = 789) donors registered in the EBMT database between 2010 and 2017. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 2 years. Haplo-SCT carried a significantly increased risk of acute grade II-IV GVHD (HR 1.6; 95% CI 1.1-2.4) and NRM (HR 2.6; 95% CI 1.5-4.5) but a lower risk of relapse (HR 0.7; 95% CI 0.5-0.9) that translated to no differences in LFS (HR 1.1; 95% CI 0.8-1.4) or GVHD/relapse-free survival (HR 1; 95% CI 0.8-1.3). Interestingly, the use of peripheral blood was associated with an increased risk of acute (HR 1.9; 95% CI 1.4-2.6) and chronic GVHD (HR 1.7; 95% CI 1.2-2.4) but a lower risk of relapse (HR 0.7; 95% CI 0.5-0.9).

STUDY DESIGN: a population-based cohort to compare the long-term risk (up to the age of 18 years) of childhood neoplasms (benign and malignant) in children that were born LGA vs. those that were appropriate for gestational age (AGA), between the years 1991-2014. Childhood neoplasms diagnosis were defined according to international classification of disease 9 (ICD-9) codes recorded medical files. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used in order to compare cumulative incidence of oncological morbidity over the study period. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to control for confounders. RESULTS: 231,344 infants met the inclusion criteria; out of those 10,369 were diagnosed LGA at birth. Children that were LGA at birth had a higher incidence of leukemia (OR 2.25, 95%CI 1.08-4.65, p = 0.025) as well as kidney tumors (OR = 4.7, 95%CI = 1.02-21.9, p = 0.028). In addition, cumulative incidence over time of childhood malignancies, leukemia, and kidney tumors were significantly higher in LGA children (Log Rank = 0.010, 0.021, and 0.028, respectively). In a Cox regression model controlling for other perinatal confounders, LGA at birth remained independently associated with an increased risk for childhood malignancy (adjusted HR 1.51, 95%CI 1.02-2.23, p = 0.039).

The disease typically manifests in the skin, but it also evolves into a leukemic phase or can be complicated by other myeloid malignancies, especially myelomonocytic tumors. The association between these neoplasms is not fully elucidated. We report a case of BPDCN with a history of cytopenia that was supposed to be chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The patient received intensive chemotherapy and achieved complete remission, but soon relapsed. The successive occurrence of myelomonocytic neoplasm and BPDCN is in accordance with the fact that they evolve from a common cell origin with a multilineage potential for myelomonocytic and plasmacytoid dendritic cell differentiation. This case may shed further light on the mystery of biology and the histogenesis of BPDCN.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",PMC7687125,['NOTNLM'],"['Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm', 'chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', 'histogenesis']","['BMU2018ME002/Peking University Medicine Seed Fund for Interdisciplinary Research', 'and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities']","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Forty-eight neonate Hu lambs were used in this study: 12 lambs with normal birth weight (NBW: 4.25 +/- 0.14 kg) and 36 lambs with IUGR (3.01 +/- 0.13 kg). Seven day old lambs were assigned to 4 treatment groups (12 lambs in each group) as follows: control group (CON), IUGR group, IUGR + Arg, and IUGR + NCG. Lambs were fed the experimental diets for 21 days from 7 days to 28 days of age. Compared with IUGR lambs, the Arg or NCG-treated IUGR lambs had a markedly higher duodenal transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and lower fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FD4) (P < 0.05), respectively. The duodenal mitochondrial membrane potential change (DeltaPsim), relative mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level, together with the activities of the respiratory complexes I, III, and IV were markedly higher in Arg or NCG-treated IUGR lambs than those in non-supplemented IUGR lambs (P < 0.05). The expressions of the integrity-related proteins (occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1)), antioxidant- and apoptosis-related proteins (B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 2 (Bcl2), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1)), and the nitric oxide-dependent pathway-related proteins (epithelial NO synthase (eNOS) and inducible NO synthase (iNOS)) were higher in NCG or Arg-supplemented IUGR lambs than those in nontreated IUGR lambs (P < 0.05). The duodenal expressions of the mitophagy-related proteins (microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) I, LC3 II, Belin1, PTEN induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), and Parkin) and the immune function-related proteins (myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), IL-6, nuclear factor kappa B (p65), toll-like receptor (TLR4) and TNF-alpha) were reduced (P < 0.05) in NCG or Arg-supplemented IUGR lambs compared with non-supplemented IUGR lambs. These results demonstrated that the dietary supplementation of Arg or NCG enhanced the duodenal barrier function and mitochondrial function, mitigated duodenal inflammation, and suppressed mitophagy in suckling lambs suffering from IUGR.","['0 (Glutamates)', '1188-38-1 (N-carbamylglutamate)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, substantial variation in RT-qPCR results makes inter-laboratory comparability hard. To facilitate inter-laboratory comparative assessment, an international scale (IS) for BCR-ABL1 was proposed. Methods The laboratory-specific conversion factor (CF) to the IS can be derived from the World Health Organization (WHO) genetic reference panel; however, this material is limited to the manufacturers to produce and calibrate secondary reference reagents. Therefore, we developed secondary reference calibrators, as lyophilized cellular material, aligned to the IS. Our purpose was both to re-evaluate the CF in 18 previously harmonized laboratories and to propagate the IS to new laboratories. Results Our field trial including 30 laboratories across Latin America showed that, after correction of raw BCR-ABL1/ABL1 ratios using CF, the relative mean bias was significantly reduced. We also performed a follow-up of participating laboratories by annually revalidating the process; our results support the need for continuous revalidation of CFs. All participating laboratories also received a calibrator to determine the limit of quantification (LOQ); 90% of them could reproducibly detect BCR-ABL1, indicating that these laboratories can report a consistent deep molecular response. In addition, aiming to investigate the variability of BCR-ABL1 measurements across different RNA inputs, we calculated PCR efficiency for each individual assay by using different amounts of RNA. Conclusions In conclusion, for the first time in Latin America, we have successfully organized a harmonization platform for BCR-ABL1 measurement that could be of immediate clinical benefit for monitoring the molecular response of patients in low-resource regions.","['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL1', '*Ph-IS', '*RT-qPCR', '*harmonization']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Targeting LSC is essential to developing a potential cure for patients with relapsed/refractory AML. Here we investigated the effect of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling on AML stem/progenitor proportion and examined the combined effect of AhR agonist and tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The AhR agonist, 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), significantly decreased the LSC proportion and clonogenicity and increased differentiation markers in AML primary cells. Synergistic/additive effects of FICZ and gilteritinib, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor, were confirmed in AML cells with FLT3-ITD. We present evidence that combination of both agents inhibits FLT3 downstream molecules and degrades clonogenicity. Collectively, our results suggest that FICZ not only compels LSC differentiation, but also enhances the efficacy of gilteritinib when combined.

The FCPS consists of datasets with known a priori classifications that are to be reproduced by the algorithm. The datasets are intentionally created to be visualized in two or three dimensions under the hypothesis that objects can be grouped unambiguously by the human eye. Each dataset represents a certain problem that can be solved by known clustering algorithms with varying success. In the R package ""Fundamental Clustering Problems Suite"" on CRAN, user-defined sample sizes can be drawn for the FCPS. Additionally, the distances of two high-dimensional datasets called Leukemia and Tetragonula are provided here.

This research aims to explore the prognostic value of AQP-1 in elderly cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). Methods: Complete clinical and expression data of 226 elderly patients (aged > 60) with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) were downloaded from the databases of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We have explored prognostic significance of AQP-1, investigated the underlying mechanism, and developed a novel scoring system for the risk assessment of elderly patients with AML based on AQP1 methylation. Results: In the first and second independent group, AQP1 shows lower expression in CN-AML than normal people, while high AQP1 expression and AQP1 promoter hypomethylation were related to better overall survival (OS; P < 0.05). To understand the underlying mechanisms, we investigated differentially expressed genes (DEGs), miRNA and lncRNA associated with AQP1 methylation. A three-gene prognostic signature based on AQP1 methylation which was highly correlated with OS was established, and the performance was validated by Permutation Test and Leave-one-out Cross Validation method. Furthermore, an independent cohort was used to verify the prognostic value of this model.

Methods: RNA matrix and clinical data of AML were downloaded from GEO, TCGA, and TARGET databases. Prognostic metabolic genes were identified by LASSO analysis to establish a metabolic model. Prognostic accuracy of the model was quantified by time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves and the area under the curve (AUC). Survival analysis was performed by log-rank tests. Enriched pathways in different metabolic risk statuses were evaluated by gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA). Results: We identified nine genes to construct a prognostic model of shorter survival in the high-risk vs. low-risk group. The prognostic model showed good predictive efficacy, with AUCs for 5-year overall survival of 0.78 (0.73-0.83), 0.76 (0.62-0.89), and 0.66 (0.57-0.75) in the training, adult external, and pediatric external cohorts, respectively. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that the metabolic signature had independent prognostic value with hazard ratios of 2.75 (2.06-3.66), 1.89 (1.09-3.29), and 1.96 (1.00-3.84) in the training, adult external, and pediatric external cohorts, respectively. Combining metabolic signatures and classic prognostic factors improved 5-year overall survival prediction compared to the prediction by classic prognostic factors (p < 0.05). GSEA revealed that most pathways were metabolism-related, indicating potential mechanisms. Conclusion: We identified dysregulated metabolic features in AML and constructed a prognostic model to predict the survival of patients with AML.",,PMC7186449,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myelogenous leukemia', 'clinical prognostic model', 'gene set enrichment analysis', 'metabolism', 'nomogram']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Wang, Hu, Li, Nie, Chen, Cai, Shu, Deng, Xu and Liang.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Feb 18.,"Purpose: The effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the immortality features of malignant cells, such as hematologic cancerous cells, are controversial, and the associated mechanisms are yet to be well understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro effect of bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) on the chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562 through telomere length measurements, telomerase activity assessments, and hTERT gene expression. The possible signaling pathways involved in this process, including Wnt-5a/beta-catenin and P53, were also evaluated. Methods: Two cell populations (BMSCs and K562 cell line) were co-cultured on transwell plates for 7 days. Next, K562 cells were collected and subjected to quantitative real-time PCR, PCR-ELISA TRAP assay, and the ELISA sandwich technique for telomere length, hTERT gene expression, telomerase activity assay, and cytokine measurement, respectively. Also, the involvement of the mentioned signaling pathways in this process was reported by real-time PCR and Western blotting through gene and protein expression, respectively. Results: The results showed that BMSCs caused significant decreases in telomere length, telomerase activity, and the mRNA level of hTERT as a regulator of telomerase activity. The significant presence of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) was obvious in the co-cultured media. Also, BMSCs significantly decreased and increased the gene and protein expression of beta-catenin and P53, respectively. Conclusion: It was concluded that the mentioned effects of IL-6, IL-8, and TGF-beta cytokines secreted from MSCs on K562 cells as therapeutic agents were applied by Wnt-5a/beta-catenin and P53 pathways.",,PMC7191235,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytokines', 'Mesenchymal stem cells', 'P53 signaling pathways', 'Telomerase activity', 'Telomere length', 'Wnt5a/beta-catenin']",,['(c) 2020 The Authors.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the above fact, this study was designed to assess some hematological changes and their diagnostic values in malaria infected patients. A total of 160 malaria positive adult patients, together with 81 healthy control adults were recruited for the study. For the malaria positive group, the female to male ratio was 1.38 : 1. Specifically, 74.38%, 10.00%, and 15.62% of those in the malaria positive group had mild, moderate, and severe parasitaemia, respectively. Leukemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia were found to be significantly associated with malaria and were all estimated to be specific for the diagnosis of malaria.

CXCR4-overexpressing cancer cells are good targets for therapy because of their association with dissemination and relapse in R-CHOP treated DLBCL patients. Immunotoxins that incorporate bacterial toxins are potentially effective in treating haematological neoplasias, but show a narrow therapeutic index due to the induction of severe side effects. Therefore, when considering the delivery of these toxins as cancer therapeutics, there is a need not only to increase their uptake in the target cancer cells, and their stability in blood, but also to reduce their systemic toxicity. We have developed a therapeutic nanostructured protein T22-PE24-H6 that incorporates exotoxin A from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which selectively targets lymphoma cells because of its specific interaction with a highly overexpressed CXCR4 receptor (CXCR4(+)) in DLBCL. Methods: T22-PE24-H6 cytotoxicity and its dependence on the CXCR4 receptor were evaluated in DLBCL cell lines using cell viability assays. Different in vitro experiments (mitochondrial membrane potential, Western Blot, Annexin V and DAPI staining) were conducted to determine T22-PE24-H6 cell death mechanisms. In vivo imaging and therapeutic effect studies were performed in a disseminated DLBCL mouse model that mimics organ infiltration in DLBCL patients. Finally, immunohistochemistry and histopathology analyses were used to evaluate the antineoplastic effect and systemic toxicity. Results: In vitro, T22-PE24-H6 induced selective cell death of CXCR4(+) DLBCL cells by activating the apoptotic pathway. In addition, repeated T22-PE24-H6 intravenous administration in a CXCR4(+) DLBCL-disseminated mouse model showed a significant reduction of lymphoma burden in organs clinically affected by DLBCL cells (lymph nodes and bone marrow). Finally, we did not observe systemic toxicity associated to the nanoparticle treatment in non-DLBCL-infiltrated organs. Conclusion: We have demonstrated here a potent T22-PE24-H6 antineoplastic effect, especially in blocking dissemination in a CXCR4(+) DLBCL model without associated toxicity. Thereby, T22-PE24-H6 promises to become an effective alternative to treat CXCR4(+) disseminated refractory or relapsed DLBCL patients.","['0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",PMC7196303,['NOTNLM'],"['*CXCR4 receptor', '*DLBCL', '*PE24 exotoxin', '*targeted nanoparticle']",,['(c) The author(s).'],,"['Competing Interests: LSG, NS, UU, IC, RM, EV and AV are con-inventors of the', 'Patent application PCT/EP2018/ 061732 on the use of Nanostructured proteins.

Different parameters were assessed from the patients' records: initial blood parameters, blood parameters during initial chemotherapy, leukemia/therapy related complaints, duration of fever, microbiological findings (blood and urine), as well as patients' survival. Dental treatment need was defined as the presence of at least one carious tooth; periodontal treatment need was determined by the presence of probing depth >/=3.5 mm in at least two sextants. To reflect periodontal inflammation, the periodontal inflamed surface area (PISA) was applied. Thirty-nine patients were included. A dental treatment need of 75% and periodontal treatment need of 76% as well as an average PISA of 153.18 +/- 158.09 were found. Only two associations were detected: periodontal treatment need was associated with thrombocyte count after 7 days (p=0.03), and PISA was associated with erythrocyte count three days after induction of therapy (p=0.01).

Genetic tests for primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs) are expensive, time-consuming, and not easily accessible in developing countries. Therefore, we studied the feasibility of a customized single nucleotide variant (SNV) microarray that we developed to detect disease-causing variants and copy number variation (CNV) in patients with PIDs for only 40 Euros. Methods: Probes were custom-designed to genotype 9,415 variants of 277 PID-related genes, and were added to the genome-wide Illumina Global Screening Array (GSA). Data analysis of GSA was performed using Illumina GenomeStudio 2.0, Biodiscovery Nexus 10.0, and R-3.4.4 software. Validation of genotype calling was performed by comparing the GSA with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of 56 non-PID controls. DNA samples of 95 clinically diagnosed PID patients, of which 60 patients (63%) had a genetically established diagnosis (by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) PID panels or Sanger sequencing), were analyzed to test the performance of the GSA. The additional SNVs detected by GSA were validated by Sanger sequencing. Results: Genotype calling of the customized array had an accuracy rate of 99.7%. The sensitivity for detecting rare PID variants was high (87%). The single sample replication in two runs was high (94.9%). The customized GSA was able to generate a genetic diagnosis in 37 out of 95 patients (39%). These 37 patients included 29 patients in whom the genetic variants were confirmed by conventional methods (26 patients by SNV and 3 by CNV analysis), while in 8 patients a new genetic diagnosis was established (6 patients by SNV and 2 patients suspected for leukemia by CNV analysis). Twenty-eight patients could not be detected due to the limited coverage of the custom probes. However, the diagnostic yield can potentially be increased when newly updated variants are added. Conclusion: Our robust customized GSA seems to be a promising first-line rapid screening tool for PIDs at an affordable price, which opens opportunities for low-cost genetic testing in developing countries. The technique is scalable, allows numerous new genetic variants to be added, and offers the potential for genetic testing not only in PIDs, but also in many other genetic diseases.",,PMC7179678,['NOTNLM'],"['*SNP microarray', '*copy number variants (CNV) calling', '*microarray-based genotyping', '*primary immunodeficiencies', '*single nucleotide variants (SNV) calling']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Suratannon, van Wijck, Broer, Xue, van Meurs, Barendregt, van', 'der Burg, Dik, Chatchatee, Langerak, Swagemakers, Goos, Mathijssen, Dalm,', 'Suphapeetiporn, Heezen, Drabwell, Uitterlinden, van der Spek, van Hagen and the', 'South East Asia Primary Immunodeficiencies (SEAPID) Consortium.']",,,,,['South East Asia Primary Immunodeficiencies (SEAPID) Consortium'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The secondary objectives were evaluation of short and long-term toxicity and non-relapse mortality (NRM). Background: Total body irradiation (TBI), as a part of the conditioning regimen before allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), allows disease control by eradicating residual blast cells in the transplant recipient. Materials and methods: Retrospective study conducted in patients with ALL who received between March 2003 and December 2013 a conditioning regimen with F-TBI and chemotherapy. Irradiation was delivered with 3.3Gy once-a-day for three consecutive days. Results: Eighty-seven patients were included. The median age was 19 years (range: 5-49 years). The 3-year CI of relapse was 30%. The estimated 3-year RFS and OS were 54% and 58%, respectively. Cumulative incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) grade II-IV and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was 31% and 40%, respectively. Interstitial pneumonitis was observed in 2 patients. The 3-year CI of NRM was 16%. In multivariate analysis, cGVHD was associated with a lower CI of relapse (RR=0.26, 95% CI: 0.07-0.95, p=0.04). High-risk cytogenetics was associated with a lower RFS (RR=2, 95 CI: 1.04-3.84, p=0.03). Grade II-IV aGVHD was an independent predictor of higher CI of NRM (RR=6.7, 95% CI: 1.4-31.7, p=0.02). Conclusions: Once-a-day F-TBI regimen is effective, safe and practical in patients who underwent ASCT for ALL.",,PMC7195497,,,,"['(c) 2020 Greater Poland Cancer Centre. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2020 May 5.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore characteristics of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) derived from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and multiple myeloma (MM). METHODS: BM-MSCs were recovered from 17 of MDS patients, 23 of MM patients and 9 healthy donors and were passaged until proliferation stopped. General characteristics and gene expression profiles of MSCs were analysed. In vitro, ex vivo coculture, immunohistochemistry and knockdown experiments were performed to verify gene expression changes. RESULTS: BM-MSCs failed to culture in 35.0% of patients and 50.0% of recovered BM-MSCs stopped to proliferate before passage 6. MDS- and MM-MSCs shared characteristics including decreased osteogenesis, increased angiogenesis and senescence-associated molecular pathways. In vitro and ex vivo experiments showed disease-specific changes such as neurogenic tendency in MDS-MSCs and cardiomyogenic tendency in MM-MSCs. Although the age of normal control was younger than patients and telomere length was shorter in patient's BM-MSCs, they were not different according to disease category nor degree of proliferation. Specifically, poorly proliferation BM-MSCs showed CDKN2A overexpression and CXCL12 downregulation. Immunohistochemistry of BM biopsy demonstrated that CDKN2A was intensely accumulation in perivascular BM-MSCs failed to culture. Interestingly, patient's BM-MSCs revealed improved proliferation activity after CDKN2A knockdown. CONCLUSION: These results collectively indicate that MDS-MSCs and MM-MSCs have common and different alterations at various degrees. Hence, it is necessary to evaluate their alteration status using representative markers such as CDKN2A expression.",['0 (Chemokine CXCL12)'],PMC7260074,['NOTNLM'],"['CDKN2A', 'mesenchymal stromal cells', 'multiple myeloma', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'proliferation']","['HI15C3076/Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea', '18172MFDS182/Ministry of Food and Drug Safety', 'Korea Health Industry Development Institute']",['(c) 2020 The Authors.

This study was conducted to elucidate the expression of TLR9 in AML patients and its relation to the prognosis of the disease. RESULTS: The study included 40 newly diagnosed AML patients managed in the hospital in addition to 20 sex and age matched normal volunteers as control. TLR9 expression assay was conducted on peripheral blood samples of AML cases before the start of treatment as well as the controls by immunophenotyping. TLR9 expression was ranging from 0.10 to 2.40% in AML patients with higher expression among the control, ranging from 0.94 to 8.25%. The median TLR9 expression in AML patients was significantly lower with advanced cytogenetic risk score. It is not significantly differing in relation to patients' sex, age group, and FAB type of AML. However, significant lower median expression was found in relation to clinical outcome. TLR9 expression </= 1% showed lower median overall survival time when compared to those with > 1% expression. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that AML patients express TLR9 in leukemic cells with very low percentage.

Epub 2020 May 5.,"We performed a meta-analysis to determine safety and efficacy of corticosteroids in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infections. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, WanFang Chinese database, and ZhiWang Chinese database using Boolean operators and search terms covering SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, OR MERS-CoV AND corticosteroids to find appropriate studies. Review Manager 5.3 was used to analyze results of meta-analysis. Observational studies were analyzed for quality using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale and randomized clinical trials, using the Jadad scale. Subjects were divided into those with severe-only and other (severe and not severe) cohorts based on published criteria. Efficacy endpoints studied included mortality, hospitalization duration, rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, use of mechanical ventilation, and a composite endpoint (death, ICU admission, or mechanical ventilation). We included 11 reports including 10 cohort studies and 1 randomized clinical trial involving 5249 subjects (2003-2020). Two discussed the association of corticosteroids and virus clearing and 10 explored how corticosteroids impacted mortality, hospitalization duration, use of mechanical ventilation, and a composite endpoint. Corticosteroid use was associated with delayed virus clearing with a mean difference (MD) = 3.78 days (95% confidence Interval [CI] = 1.16, 6.41 days; I(2) = 0%). There was no significant reduction in deaths with relative Risk Ratio (RR) = 1.07 (90% CI = 0.81; 1.42; I(2) = 80%). Hospitalization duration was prolonged and use of mechanical ventilation increased. In conclusion, corticosteroid use in subjects with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infections delayed virus clearing and did not convincingly improve survival, reduce hospitalization duration or ICU admission rate and/or use of mechanical ventilation. There were several adverse effects. Because of a preponderance of observational studies in the dataset and selection and publication biases our conclusions, especially regarding SARS-CoV-2, need confirmation in a randomized clinical trial. In the interim we suggest caution using corticosteroids in persons with COVID-19.","['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', 'COVID-19 drug treatment']",PMC7199650,,,"['81873428/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)/International', '81660682/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)/International', '2017ZT07S096/Guangdong Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team', 'Program/International']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 May 5.,"Following the success of posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PT-CY) as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis in haploidentical transplantation, this prevention strategy has progressively been used for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) from HLA-matched sibling (MSD) and unrelated donor (MUD). We have introduced PT-CY plus sirolimus and micophenolate mofetil (PT-CY-Sir-MMF) as GVHD prophylaxis in allo-HSCT, irrespective of donor type. This study reports on the safety and efficacy of PT-CY-Sir-MMF in 158 consecutive allo-HSCT from MSD (n = 52), MUD (n = 64), and haploidentical (n = 42) donor. Median age was 53 years and 66% had acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Cumulative incidences of acute GHVD grade II-IV, III-IV and moderate to severe cGVHD were 27%, 9% and 27%, respectively. The incidence of hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome was 9.5%. The 1-year cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality, relapse and event-free survival were 14%, 12% and 75%, respectively. Compared with MSD and MUD, haploidentical transplantation had a higher incidence of CMV DNAemia requiring therapy (34% vs 35% and 52%, respectively, p = 0.04) and was a risk factor for grade III-IV acute GVHD (RR 2.8, p = 0.05). Our study shows that PT-CY-Sir-MMF is not only feasible and effective in preventing GVHD after haploidentical HSCT, but also in allo-HSCT from MSD and MUD.","['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myeloma cells with a t(11;14) translocation present a particular vulnerability to BCL2 inhibition while a majority of myeloma cells relies on MCL1 for survival. The present study aimed to determine whether the combination of BCL2 and MCL1 inhibitors at low doses could be of benefit for myeloma cells beyond the single selective inhibition of BCL2 or MCL1. We identified that half of patients were not efficiently targeted neither by BCL2 inhibitor nor MCL1 inhibitor. Seventy percent of these myeloma samples, either from patients at diagnosis or relapse, presented a marked increase of apoptosis upon low dose combination of both inhibitors. Interestingly, primary cells from a patient in progression under venetoclax treatment were not sensitive ex vivo to neither venetoclax nor to MCL1 inhibitor, whereas the combination of both efficiently induced cell death. This finding suggests that the combination could overcome venetoclax resistance. The efficacy of the combination was also confirmed in U266 xenograft model resistant to BCL2 and MCL1 inhibitors. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that the combination of both inhibitors favors apoptosis in a BAX/BAK dependent manner. We showed that activated BAX was readily increased upon the inhibitor combination leading to the formation of BAK/BAX hetero-complexes. We found that BCLXL remains a major resistant factor of cell death induced by this combination. The present study supports a rational for the clinical use of venetoclax/S63845 combination in myeloma patients with the potential to elicit significant clinical activity when both single inhibitors would not be effective but also to overcome developed in vivo venetoclax resistance.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (S63845)', '0 (Thiophenes)']",PMC7200824,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In pathological conditions, mitochondrial stress leads to neuronal death, which is regulated by the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family of proteins. MCL-1 is an anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein localized to mitochondria either in the outer membrane (OM) or inner membrane (Matrix), which have distinct roles in inhibiting apoptosis and promoting bioenergetics, respectively. While the anti-apoptotic role for Mcl1 is well characterized, the protective function of MCL-1 (Matrix) remains poorly understood. Here, we show MCL-1(OM) and MCL-1(Matrix) prevent neuronal death through distinct mechanisms. We report that MCL-1(Matrix) functions to preserve mitochondrial energy transduction and improves respiratory chain capacity by modulating mitochondrial oxygen consumption in response to mitochondrial stress. We show that MCL-1(Matrix) protects neurons from stress by enhancing respiratory function, and by inhibiting mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening.

RUNX1 is also essential for the development of immune cells and sensory neurons. Chromosomal translocations involving the gene have been associated with several types of leukemia. To investigate the role of RUNX1 in human hematopoietic development we generated RUNX1-null human embryonic stem cell reporter line GIBHe008-A by TALEN mediated homologous recombination. This cell line GIBHe008-A was subjected to detailed characterization by standard assays for human pluripotent stem cells.

This study applies the Bayesian networks (BNs) to investigate the interrelationships between AKI and its risk factors among HM patients, and to evaluate the predictive and inferential ability of BNs model in different clinical settings. METHODS: During 2014 and 2015, a total of 2501 inpatients with HM were recruited in this retrospective study conducted in a tertiary hospital, Shanghai of China. Patients' demographics, medical history, clinical and laboratory records on admission were extracted from the electronic medical records. Candidate predictors of AKI were screened in the group-LASSO (gLASSO) regression, and then they were incorporated into BNs analysis for further interrelationship modeling and disease prediction. RESULTS: Of 2395 eligible patients with HM, 370 episodes were diagnosed with AKI (15.4%). Patients with multiple myeloma (24.1%) and leukemia (23.9%) had higher incidences of AKI, followed by lymphoma (13.4%). Screened by the gLASSO regression, variables as age, gender, diabetes, HM category, anti-tumor treatment, hemoglobin, serum creatinine (SCr), the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum uric acid, serum sodium and potassium level were found with significant associations with the occurrence of AKI. Through BNs analysis, age, hemoglobin, eGFR, serum sodium and potassium had directed connections with AKI. HM category and anti-tumor treatment were indirectly linked to AKI via hemoglobin and eGFR, and diabetes was connected with AKI by affecting eGFR level. BNs inferences concluded that when poor eGFR, anemia and hyponatremia occurred simultaneously, the patients' probability of AKI was up to 78.5%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of BNs model was 0.835, higher than that in the logistic score model (0.763). It also showed a robust performance in 10-fold cross-validation (AUC: 0.812). CONCLUSION: Bayesian networks can provide a novel perspective to reveal the intrinsic connections between AKI and its risk factors in HM patients. The BNs predictive model could help us to calculate the probability of AKI at the individual level, and follow the tide of e-alert and big-data realize the early detection of AKI.","['0 (Hemoglobins)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",PMC7201633,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute kidney injury', '*Bayesian networks', '*Clinical epidemiology', '*Disease prediction', '*Hematologic malignancy']","['no. 2017-01-07-00-07-E00009/Major Projects of Scientific Research, Innovation', 'Plan of Shanghai Education Commission/International', 'no. 2017ZZ01015/Shanghai Medical Center of Kidney/International', 'no.2019ZSQN19/Zhongshan Hospital Science Foundation for Youths/International']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The data of in-patients with hematological disorders infected by CRPA or carbapenem-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CSPA) were recorded in a seven-year retrospective cohort study. Risk factors for CRPA infections and impact of on mortality were identified. The primary end point was 30-day all-cause mortality. Results: A total of 81 patients with PA infections were included in the study, including 58 CSPA and 23 CRPA. Most of the primary diseases were acute leukemia or lymphoma (79.0%, 64/81). The median absolute neutrophil count at infection onset was 0.24x10(9)/L. Independent risk factors associated with carbapenem-resistance included longer duration of hospital stay (P=0.013, OR=1.045) and carbapenem exposure one month prior to infections (P=0.005, OR=8.132). The 30-day all-cause mortality of the whole cohort was 29.6%(24/81), and 30-day attributable mortality was 13.6%(11/81). Pulmonary infection was the leading cause of death, accounting for 41.7%(10/24). The adjusted 30-day mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with CRPA compared with CSPA [60.9%(14/23) vs. 17.2%(10/58), P<0.001, respectively]. CRPA infection was an independent prognostic factor for 30-day mortality(P=0.011, OR=5.427). Other factors included old age, longer duration of neutropenia and poor functional performance. Conclusions: Patients with hematological disorders have high mortality rate and poor prognosis caused by CRPA infections, which mainly develop in lungs.","['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Carbapenems)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Carbapenem resistance', 'Hematologic diseases', 'Mortality', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the heterogeneous features of the diseases caused by HTLV-1, a common topic concerning related therapeutic treatments relies on the use of antiretrovirals. This review will compare the different approaches and opinions in this matter, giving a concise overview of preclinical as well as clinical studies covering all the aspects of antiretrovirals in HTLV-1 infection. Studies will be grouped on the basis of the class of antiretroviral, putting together both pre-clinical and clinical results and generally following a chronological order. Analysis of the existing literature highlights that a number of preclinical studies clearly demonstrate that different classes of antiretrovirals, already utilized as anti-HIV agents, are actually capable to efficiently contrast HTLV-1 infection. Nevertheless, the results of most of the clinical studies are generally discouraging on the same point. In conclusion, the design of new antiretrovirals more specifically focused on HTLV-1 targets, and/or the establishment of early treatments with antiretrovirals could hopefully change the perspectives of diseases caused by HTLV-1.",,PMC7281255,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'HAM/TSP', 'HTLV-1', 'antiretrovirals']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study aimed at identifying types of locus of control in parents of children with leukemia and the possible association with depressive symptomatology and current life perception. One hundred and four parents were recruited at the Hematology-Oncology Clinic of the Department of Woman's and Child's Health, University of Padua, one month after a leukemia diagnosis. Participants were Caucasian with a mean age of 37.28 years (SD = 5.89), mostly mothers (87.5%) and with a mean of 12.16 years of education (SD = 3.82). After signing the informed consent, they filled in the Ladder of Life, the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 and the Parental Health Locus of Control (PHLOC) questionnaires. Paired-samples t-test (t = -14.42; df = 103; p = 0.0001) showed that parents of children with leukemia were more inclined to have an external locus of control than an internal one. The hierarchical regression analysis model (R(2) = 0.34; F = 4.32; p = 0.0001) identified health professional influence (ss = -0.28; p = 0.004), current life perception (ss = -0.3; p = 0.013) and future life perception (ss = -0.26; p = 0.012) as significant predictors of parental depression. Current life perception was best predicted (R(2) = 0.25; F = 3.96; p = 0.01) by the parental influence locus of control style (ss = 0.25; p = 0.03). Improving trust in the medical staff care and strengthening the internal locus of control in parents could be a preventive program to cope with parental depression symptomatology.",,PMC7278609,['NOTNLM'],"['children with leukemia', 'depression', 'health locus of control', 'life perceptions', 'parents']","['research grant of the corresponding author/Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica', 'Fondazione Citta della Speranza and Department of Developmental and Social', 'Psychology (University of Padua)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms by which EMT modulators contribute to leukemia pathogenesis, however, remain to be elucidated. Here we show that overexpression of SNAI1, a key modulator of EMT, is a pathologically relevant event in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that contributes to impaired differentiation, enhanced self-renewal, and proliferation of immature myeloid cells. We demonstrate that ectopic expression of Snai1 in hematopoietic cells predisposes mice to AML development. This effect is mediated by interaction with the histone demethylase KDM1A/LSD1. Our data shed new light on the role of SNAI1 in leukemia development and identify a novel mechanism of LSD1 corruption in cancer. This is particularly pertinent given the current interest surrounding the use of LSD1 inhibitors in the treatment of multiple different malignancies, including AML.","['0 (SNAI1 protein, human)', '0 (Snail Family Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (KDM1A protein, human)']",PMC7441169,,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['Blood. 2020 Aug 20;136(8):920-921.

Extrinsic regulation of HSC DNA repair is not well understood, and therapies to augment HSC DNA repair following myelosuppression remain undeveloped. We report that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) regulates DNA repair in HSCs following irradiation via activation of the DNA-dependent protein kinase-catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). We show that hematopoietic regeneration in vivo following total body irradiation is dependent upon EGFR-mediated repair of DNA damage via activation of DNA-PKcs. Conditional deletion of EGFR in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) significantly decreased DNA-PKcs activity following irradiation, causing increased HSC DNA damage and depressed HSC recovery over time. Systemic administration of epidermal growth factor (EGF) promoted HSC DNA repair and rapid hematologic recovery in chemotherapy-treated mice and had no effect on acute myeloid leukemia growth in vivo. Further, EGF treatment drove the recovery of human HSCs capable of multilineage in vivo repopulation following radiation injury. Whole-genome sequencing analysis revealed no increase in coding region mutations in HSPCs from EGF-treated mice, but increased intergenic copy number variant mutations were detected. These studies demonstrate that EGF promotes HSC DNA repair and hematopoietic regeneration in vivo via augmentation of NHEJ. EGF has therapeutic potential to promote human hematopoietic regeneration, and further studies are warranted to assess long-term hematopoietic effects.","['0 (CIB1 protein, human)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Prkdc protein, mouse)']",PMC7378456,,,"['K08 HL138305/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA211015/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we demonstrated that MK-2048, a second-generation HIV-1 integrase (IN) inhibitor, potently and selectively kills HTLV-1-infected cells. Differential transcriptome profiling revealed significantly elevated levels of gene expression of the unfolded protein response (UPR) PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) signaling pathway in ATL cell lines following MK-2048 treatment. We also identified a significant downregulation in glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), a master regulator of the UPR in the CD4+CADM1+ HTLV-1-infected cell population of primary HTLV-1 carrier peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (n = 9), suggesting that HTLV-1-infected cells are hypersensitive to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis. MK-2048 efficiently reduced proviral loads in primary HTLV-1 carrier PBMCs (n = 4), but had no effect on the total numbers of these cells, indicating that MK-2048 does not affect the proliferation of HTLV-1-uninfected PBMCs. MK-2048 specifically activated the ER stress-related proapoptotic gene, DNA damage-inducible transcript 3 protein (DDIT3), also known as C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), in HTLV-1-infected but not uninfected cells of HTLV-1-carrier PBMCs. Our findings demonstrated that MK-2048 selectively induces HTLV-1-infected cell apoptosis via the activation of the UPR.

Epub 2020 May 19.,"Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represent an exciting inhibitory modality with many advantages, including substoichiometric degradation of targets. Their scope, though, is still limited to date by the requirement for a sufficiently potent target binder. A solution that proved useful in tackling challenging targets is the use of electrophiles to allow irreversible binding to the target. However, such binding will negate the catalytic nature of PROTACs. Reversible covalent PROTACs potentially offer the best of both worlds. They possess the potency and selectivity associated with the formation of the covalent bond, while being able to dissociate and regenerate once the protein target is degraded. Using Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) as a clinically relevant model system, we show efficient degradation by noncovalent, irreversible covalent, and reversible covalent PROTACs, with <10 nM DC50's and >85% degradation. Our data suggest that part of the degradation by our irreversible covalent PROTACs is driven by reversible binding prior to covalent bond formation, while the reversible covalent PROTACs drive degradation primarily by covalent engagement. The PROTACs showed enhanced inhibition of B cell activation compared to ibrutinib and exhibit potent degradation of BTK in patient-derived primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. The most potent reversible covalent PROTAC, RC-3, exhibited enhanced selectivity toward BTK compared to noncovalent and irreversible covalent PROTACs. These compounds may pave the way for the design of covalent PROTACs for a wide variety of challenging targets.",,PMC7349657,,,,,,,,['J Am Chem Soc. 2020 Jun 24;142(25):11316.

Epub 2020 Jun 10.,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in diverse cellular processes and carcinogenesis. Homeobox A cluster antisense RNA 2 (HOXA-AS2) is a 1,048-basepairs lncRNA located between human HOXA3 and HOXA4 genes, whose overactivation was previously found to promote the proliferation and invasion of solid tumors. However, its clinical and biological roles in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain unclear. This study showed that HOXA-AS2 was overexpressed in AML patients. In addition, the increased HOXA-AS2 expression was correlated with higher white blood cell and bone marrow blast counts, unfavorable karyotype classification, more measurable residual disease positivity, and earlier death. There was also a tendency toward inferior survival in patients with high HOXA-AS2 expression, and HOXA-AS2 was an independent prognostic factor among the normal-karyotype AMLs. Furthermore, the results of in vitro study showed that silencing HOXA-AS2 significantly inhibited the growth of leukemic cells by inducing G1/G0-phase arrest and apoptosis. Further analysis demonstrated that silencing HOXA-AS2 suppressed the phosphorylation level of PI3K and AKT, which thereafter promoted the expression of P21 and P27. Moreover, it was suggested that the sex-determining region Y-box 4 (SOX4), which is closely involved in the PI3K/AKT pathway, might be one of the major downstream targets of HOXA-AS2. Silencing HOXA-AS2 decreased the expression of SOX4, whereas the upregulation of SOX4 partially abrogated the inhibitory effect of silencing HOXA-AS2 on leukemic cells. In conclusion, these findings suggest that HOXA-AS2 probably functions as an oncogene via SOX4/PI3K/AKT pathway and might be a useful biomarker for the prognostic prediction in AML patients, providing a potential therapeutic target for AML.","['0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (SOX4 protein, human)', '0 (SOXC Transcription Factors)', '0 (long noncoding RNA HOXA-AS2, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['HOXA-AS2', 'PI3K/AKT', 'SOX4', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'lncRNA']","['NSFC/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81170519/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2014-253/National Youth Top-notch Talent of Ten Thousand Talent Program']",['(c) 2020 International Federation for Cell Biology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considering the immunophenotype as a prognostic maker, MEF2D fusion-positive ALL with CD5 expression may be associated with a poorer prognosis in comparison with those lacking CD5 expression. In cases with characteristic marker expression, the presence of certain fusion transcripts could be predicted accurately.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (MEF2 Transcription Factors)', '0 (MEF2D protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (SIL-TAL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (TCF3-PBX1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*flow cytometry', '*genetic mutations', '*immunophenotype', '*novel fusion genes']",,"['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,"[""Tokyo Children's Cancer Study Group (TCCSG)""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Observations: We report a 7 year old female who presented one year following initial treatment for T-Cell ALL with visual acuity impairment, bilateral optic nerve infiltration and infiltration of the retina of both eyes. OCT demonstrated subretinal fluid in both eyes, which eventually resolved, and perivascular hyperreflectivity within the inner retinal layers. She was treated with systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy, total body and orbital radiation and eventual bone marrow transplantation with notable improvement in vision and regression of retinal and optic nerve findings. With continued remission, there was notable outer retinal thinning, specifically of the photoreceptors in the right eye. Conclusions and importance: Leukemic abnormalities of the eye are not uncommon, however optic nerve and retinal infiltration are rare manifestations. Leukemic infiltrates of the retina can be detected by OCT despite normal funduscopic examination and monitored for improvement. The optic nerve and other ocular tissues are considered a pharmacologic sanctuary and thus, the optic nerve can be a site of relapse in leukemia. The use of radiation therapy is a helpful adjunct with systemic, intrathecal chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation in obtaining clinical remission and visual acuity improvement.",,PMC7184527,['NOTNLM'],"['Infiltrative optic neuropathy', 'Leukemia', 'Leukemic retinopathy', 'Optic nerve', 'Optical coherence tomography', 'T-cell ALL']",,['(c) 2020 The Authors.'],,['The authors have no financial disclosures or conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The concept behind car-t immunotherapy is that modification of a patient's own T cells to facilitate their localization to the cancer cell, with subsequent activation of the T cell effector mechanism and proliferation, will result in targeted killing of cancer cells. The car-ts are a novel drug in that the starting material for the manufacture of the car-t product comes from the patient, whose viable T cells are then genetically modified. Thus, collaboration is needed between the pharmaceutical companies, which must meet good manufacturing standards for each patient's unique product, and the treating sites. For regulators and health authorities, this new class of drugs requires new paradigms for assessment and approval. Treatments with car-ts require that institutions address unique logistics requirements and management of novel toxicities. The Hospital for Sick Children has had early experience with both the licensing of clinical trials and the introduction of the first commercial product. Here, we provide an overview of basic concepts and treatment, with caveats drawn from what we have learned thus far in bringing this new therapy to the clinical front line.","['0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",PMC7193999,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chimeric antigen receptor T cells', '*cytokine release syndrome', '*leukemia', '*lymphoma', '*pediatrics']",,['2020 Multimed Inc.'],,"[""CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES We have read and understood Current Oncology's"", 'policy on disclosing conflicts of interest, and we declare the following', 'interests: DAW has consulted for Novartis for an unrelated drug and is an', 'institutional investigator on Novartis and Kite/Gilead trials; JK is the', 'institutional principal investigator for Novartis-sponsored trials with', 'tisagenlecleucel and for Kite/Gilead-sponsored trials with KTE-X19; JK has also', 'consulted for Novartis, but has not received any honoraria.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report a case of CML-BC in which the blast lineage switched from myeloid to B-lymphoid. A 35-year-old male was initially admitted to our hospital because of abdominal distention for over a year and dizziness for one week. Prior to presentation at our hospital, he visited a local hospital because of abdominal distention where his white blood cell count and bone marrow (BM) smear indicated CML. Results from peripheral blood (PB) counts, bone marrow analysis, immunophenotyping by flow cytometry, and the detection of the Philadelphia chromosome were consistent with a diagnosis of myeloid blast crisis from CML. The patient received chemotherapy with imatinib for induction, which diminished the number of blasts. However, after three months, the blasts were increased in the PB and BM. The BM study and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry revealed B-lymphoblastic leukemia. In accordance with his first admission, a chromosome study revealed a karyotype of 46, XY, t(9; 22)(q34; q11) in all 20 cells analyzed, and B-lymphoblastic transformation from CML was diagnosed. Despite three months of treatment with DVCP (daunorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and prednisone) chemotherapy in combination with dasatinib, the patient did not achieve complete remission.

Methods: The main objective of our program was to design organosilane-modified Fe3O4/SiO2/APTS(~NH2) core magnetic nanocomposites with functionalized copper-Schiff base complex through the use of (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane linker as chemotherapeutics to cancer cells. The nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), TEM, and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) techniques. All analyses corroborated the successful synthesis of the nanoparticles. In the second step, all compounds of magnetic nanoparticles were validated as antitumor drugs through the conventional MTT assay against K562 (myelogenous leukemia cancer) and apoptosis study by Annexin V/PI and AO/EB. The molecular dynamic simulations of nanoparticles were further carried out; afterwards, the optimization was performed using MM+, semi-empirical (AM1) and Ab Initio (STO-3G), ForciteGemo Opt, Forcite Dynamics, Forcite Energy and CASTEP in Materials studio 2017. Results: The results showed that the anti-cancer activity was barely reduced after modifying the surface of the Fe3O4/SiO2/APTS nanoparticles with 2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde as Schiff base and then Cu(II) complex. The apoptosis study by Annexin V/PI and AO/EB stained cell nuclei was performed that apoptosis percentage of the nanoparticles increased upon increasing the thickness of Fe3O4 shell on the magnetite core. The docking studies of the synthesized compounds were conducted towards the DNA and Topoisomerase II via AutoDock 1.5.6 (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA). Conclusion: Results of biology activities and computational modeling demonstrate that nanoparticles were targeted drug delivery system in cancer treatment.","['0 (Ferric Compounds)', '0 (Magnetite Nanoparticles)', '0 (Propylamines)', '0 (Schiff Bases)', '0 (Silanes)', '1K09F3G675 (ferric oxide)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'L8S6UBW552 (amino-propyl-triethoxysilane)']",PMC7182715,['NOTNLM'],"['MTT assay', 'Schiff base', 'Topoisomerase II', 'apoptosis', 'computational methods', 'core-shell', 'molecular docking', 'superparamagnetic']",,['(c) 2020 Eshaghi Malekshah et al.'],,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Influencing factors of CRF in allo-HSCT candidates have not been studied so far. Aim was to identify potentially influencing factors on CRF. METHODS: To assess CRF, a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) was performed on average 2.6 +/- 7.2 days prior to admission. A regression analysis was conducted, with the following predictors: gender, age, body mass index (BMI), time between last therapy and allo-HSCT (t_Therapies), number of cardiotoxic therapies (n_Cardiotox), number of transplantations (n_Transplantations), comorbidity index (HCT-CI), hemoglobin level of the last 3 months (area under the curve), and physical activity. RESULTS: A total of 194 patients performed a CPET. VO2peak was significantly reduced compared with reference data. In total, VO2peak was 21.4 ml/min/kg (- 27.5%, p < 0.05). Men showed a significant larger percentage difference from reference value (- 29.1%, p < 0.05) than women (- 24.4%).

Epub 2020 May 4.,"One of the key features of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the arrest of differentiation at the early progenitor stage of myelopoiesis. Therefore, the identification of new agents that could overcome this differentiation block and force leukemic cells to enter the apoptotic pathway is essential for the development of new treatment strategies in AML. Regarding this, herein we report the pro-differentiation activity of the pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor, obatoclax. Obatoclax promoted differentiation of human AML HL-60 cells and triggered their apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Importantly, obatoclax-induced apoptosis was associated with leukemic cell differentiation. Moreover, decreased expression of Bcl-2 protein was observed in obatoclax-treated HL-60 cells. Furthermore, differentiation of these cells was accompanied by the loss of their proliferative capacity, as shown by G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Taken together, these findings indicate that the anti-AML effects of obatoclax involve not only the induction of apoptosis but also differentiation of leukemic cells. Therefore, obatoclax represents a promising treatment for AML that warrants further exploration.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrroles)', 'QN4128B52A (obatoclax)']",PMC7575496,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Apoptosis', '*Differentiation', '*HL-60 cells', '*Obatoclax']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, 38 cases of asymptomatic carriers of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) were screened for CCR4 mutation. RESULTS: Mutation analysis by direct sequencing of 34 ATLL clinical samples detected CCR4 mutation in four genomic DNA samples and seven cDNA samples, and two novel mutations were identified. All CCR4 mutations detected by direct sequencing were positive for HRM analysis and/or fragment analysis. CCR4 mutation was not detected in the asymptomatic carriers of HTLV-1. CONCLUSIONS: CCR4 mutation screening by a combination of HRM and fragment analysis using cDNA is a simple and practical method, and it will contribute to better decision making for a therapeutic strategy, providing a rapid CCR4 mutational status to clinicians.","['0 (CCR4 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['* CCR4', '*Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', '*Clinical laboratory test', '*Fragment analysis', '*High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis']",,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2020.

Cyclin A2, which is ubiquitously expressed in dividing cells and plays role in DNA replication, entry into mitosis and spindle assembly, and cyclin A1, whose function is less clear and which is expressed in spermatocytes, leukemia cells and in postmitotic multiciliated cells. Deletion of the gene showed that cyclin A1 is essential for male meiosis, but nonessential for female meiosis. Our results revealed, that the cyclin A1 is not only dispensable in oocytes, we show here that its expression is in fact undesirable in these cells. Our data demonstrate that the APC/C and proteasome in oocytes are unable to target sufficiently cyclin A1 before anaphase, which leads into anaphase arrest and direct inhibition of separase. The cyclin A1-induced cell cycle arrest is oocyte-specific and the presence of cyclin A1 in early embryos has no effect on cell cycle progression or chromosome division. Cyclin A1 is therefore not only an important cell cycle regulator with biased expression in germline, being essential for male and damaging for female meiosis, its persistent expression during anaphase in oocytes shows fundamental differences between APC/C function in oocytes and in early embryos.","['0 (CCNA2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ccna1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin A1)', '0 (Cyclin A2)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",PMC7198627,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 May 4.,"Regardless of line of therapy, treatment goals in chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are: avoid progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis CML such that patients achieve a life expectancy comparable with that of the general population; avoid adverse events (AEs); and restore and maintain quality of life. The most important prognostic factor for achieving these goals is response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) at key milestones. For patients failing a TKI, a treatment change is mandatory to limit the risk of progression and death. There is currently no precise guideline for patients that fail a second-generation TKI, and there is a paucity of data to guide clinical decision making in this setting. There is, therefore, an unmet need for practical and actionable guidance on how to manage patients who fail a second-generation TKI. Although the term 'failure' includes patients failing for resistance or intolerance, the focus of this paper is failure of a second-generation TKI because of resistance. CML patients who fail their first second-generation TKI for true resistance need a more potent therapy. In these patients, the key issues to consider are the relative appropriateness of early allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or the use of a further TKI. Selection of the next line of treatment after second-generation TKI resistance should be individualized and must be based on patient-specific factors including cytogenetics, mutation profile, comorbidities, age, previous history of AEs with prior TKI therapy, and risk profile for AEs on specific TKIs. This expert opinion paper is not in conflict with existing recommendations, but instead represents an evolution of previous notions, based on new data, insights, and clinical experience. We review the treatment options for patients resistant to second-generation TKI therapy and provide our clinical opinions and guidance on key considerations for treatment decision making.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",PMC7266739,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 May 4.,"Cyclooxygenase (COX)-dependent production of prostaglandins (PGs) is known to play important roles in tumorigenesis. PGD2 has recently emerged as a key regulator of tumor- and inflammation-associated functions. Here we show that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or normal MSCs overexpressing COX2 promote proliferation of co-cultured hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), which can be prevented by treatment with COX2 knockdown or TM30089, a specific antagonist of the PGD2 receptor CRTH2. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that PGD2-CRTH2 signaling acts directly on type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), potentiating their expansion and driving them to produce Interleukin-5 (IL-5) and IL-13. Furthermore, IL-5 but not IL-13 expands CD4(+)CD25(+)IL5Ralpha(+) T regulatory cells (Tregs) and promotes HSPC proliferation. Disruption of the PGD2-activated ILC2-Treg axis by specifically blocking the PGD2 receptor CRTH2 or IL-5 impedes proliferation of normal and malignant HSPCs. Conversely, co-transfer of CD4(+)CD25(+)IL5Ralpha(+) Tregs promotes malignant HSPC proliferation and accelerates leukemia development in xenotransplanted mice. Collectively, these results indicate that the mesenchymal source of PGD2 promotes proliferation of normal and malignant HSPCs through activation of the ILC2-Treg axis. These findings also suggest that this novel PGD2-activated ILC2-Treg axis may be a valuable therapeutic target for cancer and inflammation-associated diseases.","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (IL5 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)', 'XZF106QU24 (prostaglandin D2 receptor)']",PMC7606225,,,"['P20 GM121322/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL151390/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20GM121322/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National', 'Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)/International']",,,,['NIHMS1585846'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FLT3-ITD diversity can further influence clinical outcomes. Addition of FLT3 inhibitors to standard chemotherapy has improved OS. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prognostic impact of FLT3 diversity and identify predictors of efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors. We reviewed prospectively collected data from 395 patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-ITD mutant AML. 156 (39%) patients received FLT3 inhibitors combined with either high or low intensity chemotherapy. There was no statistically significant difference in clinical outcomes among patients treated with FLT3 inhibitors based on FLT3 numerical variation (p = 0.85), mutation length (p = 0.67). Overall, the addition of FLT3 inhibitor to intensive chemotherapy was associated with an improved OS (HR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.24-0.5, p = 0.0005), but not in combination with lower intensity chemotherapy (HR = 0.98, 95%CI: 0.7-1.36, p = 0.85). A differential effect of FLT3 inhibitor on OS was more pronounced in younger patients with FLT3 allelic ratio >/=0.5 (HR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.25-0.66, p < 0.001), single ITD mutation (HR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.34-0.88, p = 0.01), diploid cytogenetics (HR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.35-0.76, p = 0.001), NPM1 co-mutation (HR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.19-0.67, p = 0.001).

We performed a retrospective study of 742 patients with newly diagnosed AML and normal karyotype (t-AML, n = 61, and non-t-AML, n = 681). Patients with t-AML were older but had a similar mutational profile compared to those with non-t-AML. Overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were significantly worse for patients with t-AML (P < 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively). Patients with t-AML had a higher cumulative incidence of death in remission (51% versus 16%, P < 0.01), but not higher cumulative incidence of relapse (42% versus 56%, respectively, P = 0.21).

Secondary AML can be further divided into therapy-related AML (t-AML) or AML evolving from antecedent hematological disorder (AHD-AML). This study evaluated the characteristics and prognosis of secondary AML in a homogeneous East Asian population who are often under-represented. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective, longitudinal cohort study of Korean AML patients over 18 years old treated between January 2000 and December 2013. A total of 437 de novo AML (80.3%), 41 t-AML (7.5%), and 66 AHD-AML (12.1%) were evaluated. RESULTS: First, we found that secondary AML constituted about 19.7% of all AML cases, and t-AML was more prevalent than AHD-AML. Second, we determined AHD-AML as a prognostic factor for inferior survival, independent of other risk factors (HR=2.137, 95%CI=1.534-2.977, p<0.001). The induction response rates correlated well with the overall survival. Furthermore, AHD-AML was associated with worst treatment outcomes and prognosis regardless of cytogenetic risk or age. Interestingly, t-AML was generally associated with better outcomes compared to AHD-AML despite the similarities in treatment schema. CONCLUSION: Secondary AML represents a broad spectrum of diseases and t-AML should be addressed separately from AHD-AML.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'mutations', 'secondary', 'survival', 'therapy related']",,"['Copyright(c) 2020, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, androgen ablation is the mainstay of the treatment of PCa. Proteins of the polycomb and trithorax family are master epigenetic regulators of cell type specific gene expression including androgen receptor.

Currently, five TKIs (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib and ponatinib) are approved for the treatment of CML and can be used as first, second or further lines of treatment according to disease risk scores, patient comorbidities and the presence of known TKI resistance mechanisms. In fact, 15-20% of all CML patients fail to achieve optimal responses according to the current definitions of the European Leukemia Network and will require sequential TKI treatment to avoid disease progression.

10.1186/s13045-020-00873-7.,"BACKGROUND: Consolidative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a controversial option for patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia after chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy. We performed a multicenter retrospective study to assess whether patients can benefit from haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after CAR-T therapy. METHODS: A total of 122 patients after CAR-T therapy were enrolled, including 67 patients without subsequent transplantation (non-transplant group) and 55 patients with subsequent haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (transplant group). Long-term outcome was assessed, as was its association with baseline patient characteristics. RESULTS: Compared with the non-transplant group, transplantation recipients had a higher 2-year overall survival (OS; 77.0% versus 36.4%; P < 0.001) and leukemia-free survival (LFS; 65.6% versus 32.8%; P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that minimal residual disease (MRD) positivity at transplantation is an independent factor associated with poor LFS (P = 0.005), OS (P = 0.035), and high cumulative incidence rate of relapse (P = 0.045). Pre-transplant MRD-negative recipients (MRD- group) had a lower cumulative incidence of relapse (17.3%) than those in the non-transplant group (67.2%; P < 0.001) and pre-transplant MRD-positive recipients (MRD+ group) (65.8%; P = 0.006). The cumulative incidence of relapse in MRD+ and non-transplant groups did not differ significantly (P = 0.139). The 2-year LFS in the non-transplant, MRD+, and MRD- groups was 32.8%, 27.6%, and 76.1%, respectively. The MRD- group had a higher LFS than the non-transplantation group (P < 0.001) and MRD+ group (P = 0.007), whereas the LFS in the MRD+ and non-transplant groups did not differ significantly (P = 0.305). The 2-year OS of the MRD- group was higher than that of the non-transplant group (83.3% versus 36.4%; P < 0.001) but did not differ from that of the MRD+ group (83.3% versus 62.7%; P = 0.069). The OS in the non-transplant and MRD+ groups did not differ significantly (P = 0.231). CONCLUSION: Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with pre-transplant MRD negativity after CAR-T therapy could greatly improve LFS and OS in patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Food and Drug Administration data showed that approximately 49% of the approved molecules originate naturally or chemically-resemble these substances, of which more than 70% are being used in anticancer therapy. It is noteworthy that at present there are no scientific studies to prove the effectiveness and safety of a number of plants used in folk medicine such as in the case of Calyptranthes grandifolia O. Berg (Myrtaceae) originally from South America. The aim of the present study was to determine the biological potential and toxicological effects of the aqueous leaf extract of C. grandifolia. The main detected phytoconstituents were condensed tannins and flavonoids and a high quantity of polyphenols. Regarding the antimicrobial potential, the extract exerted inhibitory activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results also revealed the extract induced DNA damage in a concentration-dependent manner in RAW 264.7 cells. In addition, C. grandifolia produced cytotoxicity in leukemia cell lines (HL60 and Kasumi-1) without affecting isolated human lymphocytes but significantly inhibited JAK3 and p38alpha enzyme activity. Taken together, these findings add important information on the biological and toxicological effects of C. grandifolia, indicating that aqueous extract may be a source of natural antimicrobial and antileukemic constituents.","['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Picrates)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'DFD3H4VGDH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Antibacterial', '*Myrtaceae', '*bioactive natural products', '*cytotoxicity', '*leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, at present, it is not clear how macroH2As affect gene regulation to exert these functions. We have parted from the initial observation that loss of total macroH2A1 led to a change in the morphology of murine myotubes differentiated ex vivo. The fusion of myoblasts to myotubes is a key process in embryonic myogenesis and highly relevant for muscle regeneration after acute or chronic injury. We have focused on this physiological process, to investigate the functions of the two splice isoforms of macroH2A1. Individual perturbation of the two isoforms in myotubes forming in vitro from myogenic C2C12 cells showed an opposing phenotype, with macroH2A1.1 enhancing, and macroH2A1.2 reducing, fusion.

We investigated the regulatory effects of tricin and ETZL on degranulation, production of cytokines and lipid mediators, and signaling proteins involved in the IgE-bound high-affinity IgE receptor activation, mitogen-activated protein kinase, arachidonic acid and Syk. The production of beta-hexosaminidase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-4, leukotrienes (LT) B4, LTC4 and prostaglandin E2 in IgE-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells were significantly inhibited by exposure to tricin or ETZL. Moreover, tricin and ETZL inhibit the phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A2, 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase-2. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of Akt, ERK, p38, JNK, protein kinase Cdelta and phospholipase Cgamma1 were effectively suppressed by both samples. Exposure to tricin or ETZL also significantly decreases the phosphorylation of Lyn and Syk, but has minimal effect on Fyn. Taken together, our data indicate that tricin and ETZL are potential anti-allergic materials that could be applied for the prevention of allergy-related diseases.","['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'D51JZL38TQ (tricin)']",PMC7249134,['NOTNLM'],"['FcepsilonRI signaling pathway', 'MAPK signaling pathway', 'anti-allergic activity', 'arachidonic acid signaling pathway', 'enzyme-treated Zizania latifolia extract', 'tricin']",['2019/Keimyung University'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considering the dismal prognosis this disease presents, several efforts have been made to better classify it and offer a tailored treatment to each subtype. This has been formally done by the World Health Organization (WHO) with the AML classification schemes from 2008 and 2016. Nonetheless, there are still mutations that are not currently included in the WHO AML classification, as in the case of some mutations that influence methylation. In this regard, the present study aimed to determine if some of the mutations that influence DNA methylation can be clustered together regarding methylation, expression, and clinical profile. Data from the TCGA LAML cohort were downloaded via cBioPortal. The analysis was performed using R 3.5.2, and the necessary packages for classical statistics, dimensionality reduction, and machine learning. We included only patients that presented mutations in DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1/2, ASXL1, WT1, and KMT2A. Afterwards, mutations that were present in too few patients were removed from the analysis, thus including a total of 57 AML patients. We observed that regarding expression, methylation, and clinical profile, patients with mutated TET2, IDH1/2, and WT1 presented a high degree of similarity, indicating the equivalence that these mutations present between themselves. Nonetheless, we did not observe this similarity between DNMT3A- and KMT2A-mutated AML. Moreover, when comparing the hypermethylating group with the hypomethylating one, we also observed important differences regarding expression, methylation, and clinical profile. In the current manuscript we offer additional arguments for the similarity of the studied hypermethylating mutations and suggest that those should be clustered together in further classifications. The hypermethylating and hypomethylating groups formed above were shown to be different from each other considering overall survival, methylation profile, expression profile, and clinical characteristics. In this manuscript, we present additional arguments for the similarity of the effect generated by TET2, IDH1/2, and WT1 mutations in AML patients. Thus, we hypothesize that hypermethylating mutations skew the AML cells to a similar phenotype with a possible sensitivity to hypermethylating agents.",,PMC7277399,['NOTNLM'],"['TCGA', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'classification', 'methylation', 'mutations']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Fifty CML patients treated at 14 institutions with frontline imatinib for at least 12 months and in stable complete cytogenetic response who developed a late chronic anemia treated with EPO were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Median time from imatinib start to EPO treatment was 42.2 months [interquartile range (IQR) 20.8-91.9]. Median Hb value at EPO starting time was 9.9 g/dL (IQR 8.9-10.3): Eleven patients (22.0%) were transfusion dependent. Alpha-EPO (40 000 UI weekly) was employed in 37 patients, beta-EPO (30 000 UI weekly) in 9 patients, zeta-EPO (40 000 UI weekly) in 2 patients, and darbepoetin (150 mcg/weekly) in the remaining 2 patients. On the whole, 41 patients (82.0%) achieved an erythroid response, defined as a stable (>3 months) improvement >1.5 g/dL of Hb level, and 9 patients (18.0%) indeed resulted resistant. Among responding patients, 10 relapsed after a median time from EPO start of 20.7 months (IQR 10.8-63.7). No EPO-related toxicity was observed.

METHODS: A total of 129 consecutive adult patients with APL of all risk categories who achieved CR1 with conventional induction (all-trans retinoic acid [ATRA]/daunorubicin) and consolidation (daunorubicin/cytarabine [induction daunorubicin and consolidation omitted for age >/=70 years]) underwent maintenance comprising ATRA (45 mg/m(2) /day), oral As2 O3 (10 mg/day), and ascorbic acid (1 g/day) (AAA) for 2 weeks every 2 months for 2 years. RESULTS: Over a 17-year period from August 1, 2002, to July 31, 2019, 63 men and 66 women (median age, 46 years [range, 18-82 years]) received AAA maintenance, which was already completed in 117 patients. At a median follow-up of 100 months (range, 8-215 months), 17 patients (13%) developed first relapse (R1) (hematologic, n = 14; molecular, n = 3) after a median of 19 months (range, 7-96 months) from CR1. Two R1 patients had concomitant central nervous system (CNS) involvement. All patients achieved CR2 with oral As2 O3 -based salvage. Five patients had a subsequent relapse and died. Eight patients died of unrelated causes while still in CR1. The 5-year and 10-year rates of relapse-free survival (RFS) were 89% and 85%, respectively. The 5-year and 10-year rates of overall survival (OS) were 94% and 87%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that inferior RFS was associated with FLT3-ITD (P = .005) and CNS involvement on presentation (P = .004), and inferior OS was associated with therapy-related APL (P = .03), FLT3-ITD (P = .03), and relapse (P = .03). The safety profile was favorable, with no grade 3/4 organ toxicities. CONCLUSION: CR1 maintenance with AAA is safe and results in favorable long-term survival in patients with APL.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute promyelocytic leukemia', '*arsenic trioxide', '*first completion remission', '*maintenance', '*oral']",,['(c) 2020 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For comprehensive analyses that directly compare the catalytic properties of all six human KMT2 complexes, we employed a biochemically defined system reconstituted with recombinant KMT2 core complexes (KMT2CoreCs) containing minimal components required for nucleosomal H3K4 methylation activity. We found that each KMT2CoreC generates distinct states and different levels of H3K4 methylation, and except for MLL3 all are stimulated by H2Bub. Notably, SET1BCoreC exhibited the strongest H3K4 methylation activity and, to our surprise, did not require H2B ubiquitylation (H2Bub); in contrast, H2Bub was required for the H3K4me2/3 activity of the paralog SET1ACoreC. We also found that WDR5, RbBP5, ASH2L and DPY30 are required for efficient H3K4 methyltransferase activities of all KMT2CoreCs except MLL3, which could produce H3K4me1 in the absence of WDR5. Importantly, deletion of the PHD2 domain of CFP1 led to complete loss of the H3K4me2/3 activities of SET1A/BCoreCs in the presence of H2Bub, indicating a critical role for this domain in the H2Bub-stimulated H3K4 methylation. Collectively, our results suggest that each KMT2 complex methylates H3K4 through distinct mechanisms in which individual subunits differentially participate.","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (KMT2D protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Setd1A protein, human)']",PMC7261165,,,"['ZIA DK075003/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 GM086868/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM086868/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK068055/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA196539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

The eponymous PML proteins, central to the self-organization of PML bodies, and other restriction factors found in these organelles are common targets of viral antagonism. The 72-kDa immediate-early protein 1 (IE1) is the principal antagonist of PML bodies encoded by the human cytomegalovirus (hCMV). IE1 is believed to disrupt PML bodies by inhibiting PML SUMOylation, while PML was proposed to act as an E3 ligase for IE1 SUMOylation. PML targeting by IE1 is considered to be crucial for hCMV replication at low multiplicities of infection, in part via counteracting antiviral gene induction linked to the cellular interferon (IFN) response. However, current concepts of IE1-PML interaction are largely derived from mutant IE1 proteins known or predicted to be metabolically unstable and globally misfolded. We performed systematic clustered charge-to-alanine scanning mutagenesis and identified a stable IE1 mutant protein (IE1cc172-176) with wild-type characteristics except for neither interacting with PML proteins nor inhibiting PML SUMOylation. Consequently, IE1cc172-176 does not associate with PML bodies and is selectively impaired for disrupting these organelles. Surprisingly, functional analysis of IE1cc172-176 revealed that the protein is hypermodified by mixed SUMO chains and that IE1 SUMOylation depends on nucleosome rather than PML binding. Furthermore, a mutant hCMV expressing IE1cc172-176 was only slightly attenuated compared to an IE1-null virus even at low multiplicities of infection. Finally, hCMV-induced expression of cytokine and IFN-stimulated genes turned out to be reduced rather than increased in the presence of IE1cc172-176 relative to wild-type IE1. Our findings challenge present views on the relationship of IE1 with PML and the role of PML in hCMV replication. This study also provides initial evidence for the idea that disruption of PML bodies upon viral infection is linked to activation rather than inhibition of innate immunity.","['0 (IE1 protein, cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",PMC7224577,,,"['MR/P022146/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The number of haematological malignancies (HM) increased after the war and the concern was the use of DU during the war. The aim of this study was to analyse the incidence rates of HM in Kosovo throughout a 20-year that includes pre- and post- war period (1995-2015); and to examine if there is any association between the use of DU rounds and incidence rates of HM in different regions of Kosovo. METHODS: In this retrospective register-based study, 1,798 new patients diagnosed with leukaemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Multiple myeloma were analysed over a 20 year period. Incidence rates were calculated focusing on specific time periods, regions and age-groups. In addition, the correlation between the use of DU in different regions and their incidence of HM was analysed. RESULTS: The average annual crude rate of all HM in Kosovo was 5.02 cases per 100,000 persons. Incidence rates of HM in first post-war period (2000-2003) increased by 0.37 cases/100,000 persons (9.51%) compared to the pre-war period (1995-1998) whereas in the last post-war period (2012-2015), incidence of HM increased by 3.19/100,000 persons (82%). Gjakova and Peja, the first and third most exposed regions to DU ordnance ranked first and second in difference in HM. Prishtina, Gjilan and Ferizaj, regions with the least number of rounds/km2, were characterized by a decline of incidence rates. CONCLUSIONS: After the war, the increase in incidence rate of HM was higher in two regions with most DU rounds/km2 expended Despite these findings, this study warrants further investigation and does not lead us to a conclusive finding on the existence of a causal relationship between the use of DU during the war and the rise in incidence of HM in Kosovo.",['4OC371KSTK (Uranium)'],PMC7197787,,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, these features play an important role in certain diseases. We present Netboost, a three-step dimension reduction technique. First, a boosting-based filter is combined with the topological overlap measure to identify the essential edges of the network. Second, sparse hierarchical clustering is applied on the selected edges to identify modules and finally module information is aggregated by the first principal components. We demonstrate the application of the newly developed Netboost in combination with CoxBoost for survival prediction of DNA methylation and gene expression data from 180 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and show, based on cross-validated prediction error curve estimates, its prediction superiority over variable selection on the full dataset as well as over an alternative clustering approach. The identified signature related to chromatin modifying enzymes was replicated in an independent dataset, the phase II AMLSG 12-09 study. In a second application we combine Netboost with Random Forest classification and improve the disease classification error in RNA-sequencing data of Huntington's disease mice.

Differentiation and proliferation of residual normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are impeded in AML-infiltrated bone marrow (BM). The underlying mechanisms and interactions of residual hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) within the leukemic niche are poorly understood, especially in the human context. To mimic AML infiltration and dissect the cellular crosstalk in human BM, we established humanized ex vivo and in vivo niche models comprising AML cells, normal HSPCs, and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Both models replicated the suppression of phenotypically defined HSPC differentiation without affecting their viability. As occurs in AML patients, the majority of HSPCs were quiescent and showed enrichment of functional HSCs. HSPC suppression was largely dependent on secreted factors produced by transcriptionally remodeled MSCs. Secretome analysis and functional validation revealed MSC-derived stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) and its transcriptional regulator HIF-1alpha as limiting factors for HSPC proliferation. Abrogation of either STC1 or HIF-1alpha alleviated HSPC suppression by AML. This study provides a humanized model to study the crosstalk among HSPCs, leukemia, and their MSC niche, and a molecular mechanism whereby AML impairs normal hematopoiesis by remodeling the mesenchymal niche.","['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '76687-96-2 (teleocalcin)']",PMC7260026,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adult stem cells', '*Hematology', '*Hematopoietic stem cells', '*Leukemias', '*Stem cells']","['FC001045/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'G0700052/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'FC001045/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'C15966/A24375/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'FC001045/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We conducted a randomized clinical study to investigate the effects of pre-infusion (1 x 10(6) cells/kg) MSCs on hematopoietic recovery, Epstein-Barr and cytomegalovirus infection, GVHD, and relapse in patients undergoing haplo-PBSCT. Fifty patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome were randomly divided into an MSC group administered 1 x 10(6) MSCs/kg 4 to 6 hours before infusion of peripheral stem cells and a control group without MSCs. RESULTS: Mean platelet engraftment time was significantly faster in the MSC compared with the control group (12.28 vs 13.29 days). The mean neutrophil engraftment time was comparable in both groups (10.76 +/- 2.40 vs. 10.29 +/- 1.72 days). Grade II or above acute GVHD was significantly decreased in the MSC compared with the control group (12% vs. 36%). There were no significant differences in relapse rate or overall survival between the groups.

Epub 2020 May 4.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) represents the most common indication for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). This study aimed to address the implementation status of allogeneic HCT for adults with AML in Japan and to provide a comprehensive overview of post-transplant outcomes. For this purpose, we analyzed data of 15,186 patients undergoing allogeneic HCT between 1992 and 2016 who were consecutively reported to the Japanese nationwide transplantation registry. The constant increase in the annual number of transplantations was clearly attributable to the growth of unrelated transplantation, and umbilical cord blood transplantation currently accounts for one-third of all allogeneic HCTs. The proportion of older patients has increased steadily since 2000, approximately, in parallel with the introduction of reduced-intensity conditioning. The probability of overall survival (OS) was estimated at 41% (95% confidence interval (CI), 40-42%) for the entire cohort, 56% (95% CI, 55-57%) for patients transplanted in complete remission (CR), and 22% (95% CI, 21-23%) for those transplanted in non-CR. Multivariate analysis identified age, sex, performance status, disease status, cytogenetic risk, donor type, graft source, sex mismatch between the donor and the recipient, and year of transplantation as factors significantly associated with OS. These findings represent the real-world data in Japan, showing the changes in transplantation practice and a detailed estimation of post-transplant outcomes.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'Survival', 'Transplantation practice']","['18ek0510023h0002/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development', '2019-8/Aichi Cancer Research Foundation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with stellate cells, the role of macrophages in the development of fibrosis remains unclear. Multispectral imaging allows detection of multiple markers in situ in human formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. This cutting-edge technology is ideal for analyzing human liver tissues, as it allows spectral unmixing of fluorophore signals, subtraction of auto-fluorescence, and preservation of hepatic architecture. We analyzed five different antibodies commonly observed on macrophage populations (CD68, MAC387, CD163, CD14, and CD16). After optimization of the monoplex stains and development of a Spectral Library, we combined all of the antibodies into a multiplex protocol and used them to stain biopsies collected from representative patients with chronic liver diseases, including chronic hepatitis C, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and autoimmune hepatitis. Various imaging modalities were tested, including cell phenotyping, tissue segmentation, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding plots, and phenotype matrices that facilitated comparison and visualization of the identified macrophage and other cellular profiles. We then tested the feasibility of this platform to analyze numerous regions of interest from liver biopsies with multiple patients per group, using batch analysis algorithms. Five populations showed significant differences between patients positive for hepatitis C virus with advanced fibrosis when compared with controls. Three of these were significantly increased in patients with advanced fibrosis when compared to controls, and these included CD163+CD16+, CD68+, and CD68+MAC387+. Conclusion: Spectral imaging microscopy is a powerful tool that enables in situ analysis of macrophages and other cells in human liver biopsies and may lead to more personalized therapeutic approaches in the future.",,PMC7193134,,,"['KL2 TR001441/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Currently, CAR-T cells are manufactured in centralized facilities and face bottlenecks like complex scaling up, high costs, and logistic operations. These difficulties are mainly related to the use of viral vectors and the requirement to expand CAR-T cells to reach the therapeutic dose. In this paper, by using Sleeping Beauty-mediated genetic modification delivered by electroporation, we show that CAR-T cells can be generated and used without the need for ex vivo activation and expansion, consistent with a point-of-care (POC) approach. Our results show that minimally manipulated CAR-T cells are effective in vivo against RS4;11 leukemia cells engrafted in NSG mice even when inoculated after only 4 h of gene transfer. In an effort to better characterize the infused CAR-T cells, we show that 19BBz T lymphocytes infused after 24 h of electroporation (where CAR expression is already detectable) can improve the overall survival and reduce tumor burden in organs of mice engrafted with RS4;11 or Nalm-6 B cell leukemia. A side-by-side comparison of POC approach with a conventional 8-day expansion protocol using Transact beads demonstrated that both approaches have equivalent antitumor activity in vivo. Our data suggest that POC approach is a viable alternative for the generation and use of CAR-T cells, overcoming the limitations of current manufacturing protocols. Its use has the potential to expand CAR immunotherapy to a higher number of patients, especially in the context of low-income countries.","['0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",PMC7185214,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR-T cells', '*immunotherapy', '*point-of-care', '*sleeping Beauty']",,"['(c) 2020 The Author(s).

Methods: Totally 1,148 patients admitted to our outpatient unit between January 2018 and January 2020, who were diagnosed with bipolar disorder according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-V), from whom informed consent was obtained, were cross-sectionally and consecutively evaluated. Each patient was questioned regarding a family history of diabetes, ischemic heart disease, thyroid disease, cancer (gastrointestinal, breast and prostate cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma), cerebrovascular disease and epilepsy in first- and second-degree relatives. Results: Diabetes, ischemic heart disease, cancer, cerebrovascular disease and epilepsy were more common in the family histories than in bipolar patients. A strong correlation was found between family history positive for epilepsy and bipolar disorder with psychotic symptoms. Also, a correlation was found between family history for diabetes and seasonal course and family history positive for thyroid disease and comorbid anxiety disorder.

Graft-versus-Host Disease and the favorable Graft-versus-Leukemia effect are mediated by donor T cells recognizing polymorphic peptides, which are presented on the cell surface by HLA molecules and result from single nucleotide polymorphism alleles that are disparate between patient and donor. Identification of polymorphic HLA-binding peptides, designated minor histocompatibility antigens, has been a laborious procedure, and the number and scope for broad clinical use of these antigens therefore remain limited. Here, we present an optimized whole genome association approach for discovery of HLA class I minor histocompatibility antigens. T cell clones isolated from patients who responded to donor lymphocyte infusions after HLA-matched allogeneic stem cell transplantation were tested against a panel of 191 EBV-transformed B cells, which have been sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project and selected for expression of seven common HLA class I alleles (HLA-A( *)01:01, A( *)02:01, A( *)03:01, B( *)07:02, B( *)08:01, C( *)07:01, and C( *)07:02). By including all polymorphisms with minor allele frequencies above 0.01, we demonstrated that the new approach allows direct discovery of minor histocompatibility antigens as exemplified by seven new antigens in eight different HLA class I alleles including one antigen in HLA-A( *)24:02 and HLA-A( *)23:01, for which the method has not been originally designed. Our new whole genome association strategy is expected to rapidly augment the repertoire of HLA class I-restricted minor histocompatibility antigens that will become available for donor selection and clinical use to predict, follow or manipulate Graft-versus-Leukemia effect and Graft-versus-Host Disease after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","['0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)']",PMC7180171,['NOTNLM'],"['*Graft-versus-Leukemia effect', '*HLA class I', '*allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*graft versus host disease', '*hematological diseases', '*minor histocompatibility antigens', '*whole genome association scanning']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Fuchs, Honders, van der Meijden, Adriaans, van der Lee, Pont,', ""Monajemi, Kielbasa, 't Hoen, van Bergen, Falkenburg and Griffioen.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the current experience, treatment is necessary for years and, in the majority of cases, a lifelong approach is required to control the malignant disease. To what extent imatinib causes immunosuppression in different age cohorts is a controversial discussion. According to general medical recommendations, live vaccines are contraindicated in individuals treated with imatinib. However, a recent increase in the number of globally reported cases of measles has been observed and continues to rise. Due to the high contagiousness of the virus, near-perfect vaccination coverage (herd immunity of 93 to 95%) is required to effectively protect against measles resurgence-a scenario that is not realistic in many countries. When four teenagers with CML (median age 13 years, range 12-15) who were enrolled into pediatric trial CML-paed II while on imatinib treatment (median treatment duration 36 months, range 11-84) were identified without protective measles and/or varicella titers, we carefully balanced the risks of a live vaccination under immunosuppressive TKI medication against the benefit of being protected. The patients underwent live vaccination with the live attenuated vaccines M-M-RVAX Pro((R)) and Varivax((R)) simultaneously (Patient #1), Priorix((R)) and Varilix((R)) consecutively (Patient #2), and Priorix((R)) (Patients #3 and #4). While the first three patients were vaccinated while receiving TKI therapy, treatment with imatinib was interrupted in patient #4 for 1 week prior and 2 weeks after vaccination. Patients #1 and #3 reacted with stable long-term seroconversion. In Patient #2, serum titer conversion against measles and varicella could not be demonstrated and thus revaccination with Priorix((R)) and Varilix((R)) was performed 3 years later. However, protective titers did not develop or were lost again. Patient #4 also lost protective titers against measles when assessed 10 months after vaccination, but revaccination resulted in stable seroprotective titers over 12 months after the last vaccination during ongoing imatinib treatment. We conclude that in all patients, the safety of live vaccines could be documented, as no acute or late adverse events were observed. However, in line with observations that memory B-cells are lost under exposure to imatinib, revaccination may become necessary (two out of four patients in this small series lost their seroprotection). Considering that the number of cases is very small, we also suggest some criteria for decision-making regarding live vaccinations of CML patients treated with imatinib.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chickenpox Vaccine)', '0 (Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine)', '0 (Vaccines, Attenuated)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",PMC7181227,['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*imatinib', '*measles', '*mild immunosuppression', '*pediatric CML', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors', '*vaccination', '*varicella']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Bettoni da Cunha-Riehm, Hildebrand, Nathrath, Metzler and', 'Suttorp.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sunitinib is a multitargeted TKI targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and is defined a safe and effective candidate target, but its effect on other signaling pathways is unknown. To investigate the cytotoxic and apoptotic effect of sunitinib in CML cell model K-562 on JAK-STAT signaling pathway components, suppressor genes and oncogenes, hematopoiesis-related genes, cell cycle and VEGF pathway components, and mRNA level expression changes was aimed. Materials and Methods: Sunitinib's effective dose cytotoxic IC50 was determined by trypan blue and WST-1 cell proliferation assay tests. Expression levels of target genes were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction simultaneously after sunitinib application. Protein expression analysis was determined by ""WesternBreeze Chromogenic Kit-Anti-Rabbit"" based on the principles of the application kit by Western blot analysis. Results: Assessing the cytotoxicity of K-562 cells following sunitinib treatment revealed that sunitinib decreased cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. According to the sunitinib inhibition curve, IC50 dose was calculated as 3.5 muM at 48(th) h for K-562 cells and apoptosis assays pointed that sunitinib induces apoptotic cell death of leukemic cells at moderate levels. Conclusion: Our study supports that sunitinib might be used as a novel therapeutic target to trigger apoptosis in CML cells which in turn might accelerate therapeutic response in regard to inhibiting oncogenes and enhancing tumor suppressors in cooperation with cell cycle regulatory genes.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'V99T50803M (Sunitinib)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'cell line', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'sunitinib']",,,,['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, awareness of the variations in clinical presentations and immunophenotypic aberrancies is requisite to ensure diagnostic accuracy. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was carried out to analyze the clinical-pathological profile of patients with HCL diagnosed over a period of 81 months (2010-September 2017) in our institute. Flow cytometry was performed in all the patients, and further, BRAFV600E mutation analysis was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction in a limited number of samples. Result: A total of 353 lymphoproliferative disorders were assessed during the period, of which 16 (4.5%) were diagnosed as HCL, which included 15 cases of classical HCL and single case of HCL-v. Striking male predominance was noted with a median age of 52 (range 22-90 years). 47% patients presented with pancytopenia, while 20% cases had leukocytosis. Three patients presented with bleeding diathesis in the form of melena and purpuric spots. The absence of splenomegaly was observed in 20% patients (4/15) while 2 (13.3%) cases had lymphadenopathy. Hypocellular marrow was observed in 13% cases. Bright expression of CD20/CD22 along with CD25/CD103/CD123/CD11c was noted in all the patients of classical HCL. Aberrant expression of CD23 and CD5 was seen in 33% ( n =5) and 6.7% ( n =1) cases respectively. CD200 was positive in all the 5/15 cases tested. The case of HCL-v presented with very high leukocyte count and exhibited a CD103/CD11c+ and CD123/CD25- profile. BRAFV600E, mutation was present in all the four patients tested who included patients with a hypocellular marrow and absent splenomegaly. Conclusion: HCL has characteristic profiles, yet it may exhibit unusual clinical and immunophenotypic presentations. Perspicacious use of flow cytometry and BRAFV600E mutation analysis will aid in the diagnosis in unprecedented cases.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['BRAF mutation', 'flow cytometry', 'hairy-cell leukemia', 'morphology']",,,,['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subjects and Methods: It is a retrospective analysis conducted to assess pediatric CML data from January 1998 to December 2014. There are 65 (3.2%) pediatric CML patients out of entire 2008 patients of CML. Data were analyzed regarding epidemiological characteristics, clinical presentations, response and side effects of imatinib, event-free survival, and overall survival of the pediatric CML patients. Results: The median age of diagnosis was 11.84 years, and 76.9% patients were male and 23.07% patients were female. Sixty (92.3%) patients were in CML-chronic phase, 3 (4.6%) patients in CML-accelerated phase, and 2 (3.07%) patients in CML-blastic crisis. Most common initial symptoms and signs are weakness (60.0%), abdominal pain (55.38%), splenomegaly (100%), and hepatomegaly (86.5%). 67.3% of patients have white blood counts <100 x 10(9)/L and 92.3% had platelets >150 x 10(9)/L. In the initial months of 2002, imatinib was available and utilized in 54 patients. Of 54 patients, complete hematological response at 3 months, partial cytogenetic response at 6 months, complete cytogenetic response at 12 months, and major molecular response (MMR) at 18 months were 77.77%, 59.2%, 48.14%, and 40.74%, respectively. MMR at 36 months was 62.96% ( n = 34). Most common imatinib-related side effects are gastrointestinal upset and myelosuppression. Conclusion: Pediatric CML in India is comparable with Western countries regarding epidemiological characteristic, clinical presentations, and tolerance of imatinib. As there is a paucity of universal literature regarding pediatric CML (especially data from Southeast Asian region), this article may fill up that space.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Case series', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'imatinib', 'pediatric']",,,,['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aim: This study aims to identify the frequency of aberrant immunophenotypes in de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and to evaluate their association with initial clinical and hematological features. Materials and Methods: A total of 181 patients of de novo AML were included during the time (July 2010-June 2012). The immunophenotype of all cases of AML was studied by using flow cytometry. Results: Aberrant lymphoid antigen expression was seen in 43.1% cases. Most frequent aberrant lymphoid antigen was CD7, seen in 26.5% cases. All French-American-British (FAB) subtypes except AML-M3 expressed aberrant lymphoid antigens. The expression was most common in AML-M4 in the current study. CD34 expression in AMLs was significantly associated with the expression of aberrant lymphoid antigens. Lymphoid antigen expression in adult AML was significantly associated with higher white blood cell (WBC) count (>50,000/mm(3)) and higher number of peripheral blasts (>70%). Conclusion: In summary, CD7 is the most common aberrant lymphoid antigen expressed in AML. FAB subtype AML-M3 is usually not associated with aberrant lymphoid antigen expression. AML cases with CD34 positivity are more likely to express aberrant lymphoid markers. The current study also supports that aberrant lymphoid antigen expression in adult AML is associated with adverse presenting hematological features (WBC count >50,000/mm(3), peripheral blasts >70%). Pediatric Ly + AML cases are not associated with adverse presenting clinical and biological features.","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Aberrant', 'acute leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'immunophenotyping']",,,,['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL6 is a pleiotropic cytokine and plays an important role in immune response, hematopoiesis, and acute phase response. IL6 is regarded as a prominent target for clinical interventions. Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the serum levels of IL6 in CML to provide greater insight to their role in disease transformation in Indian patients. Materials and Methods: A total of 50 CML cases and 10 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cases along with 20 healthy controls were included in the study between 2015 and 2016. About 4 mL blood samples were collected from all cases in plain vial and serum was separated. Levels of IL6 were determined in all cases by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The study suggests that both ALL and CML are associated with significantly elevated serum IL6 level than the healthy control group. Mean levels of serum IL6 are 223.4 +/- 53.403 pg/mL in CML, 71.020 +/- 29.549 pg/mL in ALL, and 5.360 +/- 0.467 pg/mL in healthy control group. Serum IL6 correlated with different phases of CML. Mean IL6 levels are 50.93 +/- 29.37 pg/mL in chronic phase (CP), 69.02 +/- 22.60 pg/mL in accelerated phase (AP), and 652.77 +/- 124.62 pg/mL in blast crisis (BC) phase of CML. In compared to CP and AP, in BC, IL-6 is significantly elevated ( P = 0.00 and 0.00, respectively); however, we did not find a significant difference in IL-6 serum levels between CP and AP ( P = 0.703). Conclusion: Study suggests that the detection of IL6 level in newly diagnosed patient can predict the severity of the disease. There might be association of level of IL6 with the disease transformation.","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Accelerated phase', 'acute lymphocytic leukemia', 'blast crisis', 'chronic phase', 'interleukin 6', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,,,['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As murine studies have demonstrated that this transcription factor has a notable role in the initiation and progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) disease, the aim of the current study was to investigate and review the influence of GFI1 in human AML cells. Methods: GFI1 expression levels were measured by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction in 96 primary AML samples which were then compared to gene expression levels observed in 18 healthy subjects. Moreover, GFI1 expression patterns were analyzed based on specific AML subtypes including acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Finally, leukemic cells were stained to measure levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Results: This study reports that AML patients have significantly higher GFI1 mRNA levels in comparison to healthy subjects and that, when considering AML subtypes, patients with APL have higher GFI1 expression than non-APL patients. Conclusion: It is also concluded that GFI1 overexpression in patients with high MPO levels, such as those of the APL subtype, is correlated with favorable disease prognosis as supported by other studies which demonstrate that increased peroxide activity and GFI1 are independently correlated with a favorable prognosis.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GFI1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'growth factor independence 1']",,,,['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The epidemiologic profile of patients varies greatly in different geographic locations and so do the cytogenetic abnormalities and the FAB subtype of the AML. We intended to study the clinical profile, cytogenetics, and outcomes with standard of care treatment on our population in India. Methods: This was a retrospective study with systematic review of 203 case records. Primary objectives were to know the demographic profile of AML, prevalence of various FAB subtypes, cytogenetic abnormalities, and treatment outcomes at our center, which is a referral center of oncology. Two treatment outcomes considered in study for patients of AML were achievement of remission status of the bone marrow postintensive induction chemotherapy and sustenance of the remission for 6 months, once remission is achieved. Secondary objective was to study these outcomes in non-M3 AML in relation to cytogenetics. Results: Median age was 39 years. The most common FAB subtype observed was AML M2. About 65.6% patients achieved complete remission (CR), and 42.4% patients could sustain it for next 6 months. Cytogenetics correlated with prognosis but not age. Conclusions: Our population differs from the Western population regarding lower age, lower prevalence of adverse cytogenetics, and higher prevalence of favorable cytogenetic abnormalities.

Epub 2020 May 1.,"Kidney transplantation improves quality of life, prolongs survival, and is cost-effective, but bears some serious complications including malignancy. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of malignancy in dialyzed patients on the waiting list and in kidney allograft recipients. The cross-sectional study was conducted in 50 prevalent patients on the waiting list and 300 kidney allograft recipients. Patients who had been registered in the cadaver kidney waiting list and kidney allograft recipients did not differ in regard to age, sex, dialysis vintage, and causes of end-stage renal failure. In waitlisted patients, only 3 had a history of malignancy. In kidney allograft recipients, 52 patients developed malignancy. The leading malignancy was skin cancer with 9 cases, followed by post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder in 5 cases, Kaposi sarcoma in 2 cases, brain cancer in 2 cases, Merkel carcinoma in 2 cases, lung cancer (small cell and non--small cell), unknown origin in 2 cases, and the other 22 malignancies were in single patients (including 1 leukemia and 1 multiple myeloma). Seventeen deaths were recorded in kidney allograft recipients with malignancy mainly in post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, Kaposi sarcoma, Merkel carcinoma, sarcoma, and brain cancer. Concluding, waitlisted patients represent a very selected and healthier dialyzed population. Guidelines for cancer screening in both potential transplant recipients and kidney allograft recipients should be developed as nowadays a scarcity of data exists in this matter. Minimization of immunosuppressive regimen should be considered, in particular, in high-risk patients.",,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TP53 mutations have been associated with complex karyotypes, therapy-related malignancies, lower response rates to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and an overall adverse prognosis. In this single-center retrospective study, we analyzed the clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes of 83 patients with TP53-mutated myeloid malignancies treated at Yale Cancer Center between 9/2015 and 5/2019. Complex karyotypes (n = 75; 90%) and therapy-related malignancies (n = 32; 39%) were common. Median overall survival (OS) was 7.6 months. Intensive chemotherapy did not improve OS compared to lower-intensity treatment for AML patients. Patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) had a significantly longer median OS, despite relatively limited follow-up.

Epub 2020 May 2.,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with hematological malignancies (HM) require intensive chemotherapy with curative intent, especially in case of AML that results in more frequent admissions to Intensive Care Units (ICU). Due to our knowledge, this study is the first multicenter retrospective analysis in Polish population. METHODS: A total of 200 patients with HM hospitalized in 4 Polish hematological centers. Data concerning clinical indices and outcomes during admission and ICU stay were collected retrospectively. RESULTS: The most common hematological malignancy was acute leukemia (55%). The main cause of ICU admission was respiratory failure (88.5%), often accompanied by sepsis (58.5%) and acute renal failure (51.5%). In patients with hematological malignancies, the following factors were associated with ICU mortality: prolonged ICU stay (odd ratio [OR] = 6.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38-35.33, chi(2) = 5.61, p = 0.02), the presence of acute respiratory failure (odd ratio [OR] = 5.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-28.46, chi(2) = 3.93, p = 0.04), and the need for renal replacement therapy (odd ratio [OR] = 8.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23-62.11, chi(2) = 4.78, p = 0.03). There were following associations with in-hospital mortality in patients with hematological malignancies: prolonged ICU stay (odd ratio [OR] = 10.12, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.85-55.37, chi(2) = 7.21, p = 0.008), the presence of acute respiratory failure (odd ratio [OR] =5.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.36-20.16, chi(2) = 5.87, p = 0.02), the need for catecholamine support (odd ratio [OR] =3.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06-11.05, chi(2) = 4.32, p = 0.04), and renal replacement therapy (odd ratio [OR] =5.55, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-26.92, chi(2) = 4.59, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that ICU and in-hospital mortalities among patients with hematological malignancies are still poor, but easier access to the intensive care unit and close cooperation between hematologists and intensivists may improve outcomes. We have found that acute failure of key organs (acute respiratory failure, end-stage renal failure requires renal replacement therapy) and length of ICU stay (but probably no comorbidities and illness severity) may have impact on mortality (both ICU and in-hospital).","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Catecholamines)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Hematological malignancies', 'Intensive care unit', 'Mortality', 'Prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively analyzed 417 patients > 45 years with ALL in first complete remission who underwent a matched sibling or unrelated allo-HSCT and compared outcomes between fludarabine/busulfan (FLUBU, n = 127), fludarabine/melphalan (FLUMEL, n = 190), and fludarabine-TBI (FLUTBI, n = 100) conditioning. At 2 years, there were no differences between the groups in terms of cumulative incidence (CI) of relapse (40% for FLUBU vs 36% for FLUMEL vs 41% for FLUTBI, p = 0.21); transplant-related mortality (TRM) (18% for FLUBU, 22% for FLUMEL, 14% for FLUTBI, p = 0.09); overall survival (55% for FLUBU, 50% for FLUMEL, 60% for FLUTBI, p = 0.62) or leukemia-free survival (43% for FLUBU, 42% for FLUMEL, 45% for FLUTBI, p = 0.99), but GVHD-relapse-free survival was significantly lower in the FLUTBI group than FLUBU and FLUMEL group (18% vs 35% vs 28%, p = 0.02). However, this difference was lost in the multivariate analysis when adjusted for the in vivo T-cell depletion. Finally, the FLUMEL regimen was shown to be an independent risk factor for a higher TRM (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.05-3.72, p = 0.04). We conclude that the three most popular RIC regimens yield similar transplant outcomes.",['G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 15.,"Mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (mIDH2) is an emerging target for the treatment of cancer. AG-221 is the first mIDH2 inhibitor approved by the FDA for acute myeloid leukemia treatment, but its acquired resistance has recently been observed, necessitating the development of new inhibitor. In this study, a multi-step virtual screening protocol was employed for the analysis of a large database of compounds to identify potential mIDH2 inhibitors. To this end, we firstly utilized molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and binding free energy calculations to elucidate the key factors affecting ligand binding and drug resistance. Based on these findings, the receptor-ligand interaction-based pharmacophore (IBP) model and hierarchical docking-based virtual screening were sequentially carried out to assess 212,736 compounds from the Specs database. The resulting hits were finally ranked by PAINS filter and ADME prediction and the top compounds were obtained. Among them, six molecules were identified as mIDH2 putative inhibitors with high selectivity by interacting with the capping residue Asp312. Furthermore, subsequent docking and MD experiments demonstrated that compound V2 might have potential inhibitory activity against the AG-221-resistant mutants, thereby making it a promising lead for the development of novel mIDH2 inhibitors.","['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ligands)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Hierarchical docking', 'Molecular dynamics simulation', 'Mutant IDH2', 'Receptor-ligand interaction-based pharmacophore', 'Virtual screening']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Controlled trials have tested poorly absorbable steroids as adjuncts with systemic glucocorticoids, but only small case series have reported treatment with poorly absorbed beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) and budesonide (BUD) alone. Our team has adopted the practice of administering BDP or BDP+BUD without systemic glucocorticoids as first-line therapy for isolated upper GI (UGI) aGVHD. We report results in 76 patients treated with BDP alone and in 81 patients treated with BDP+BUD, with allocation by physician choice. Almost all patients received peripheral blood stem cells (92%) from a fully HLA-matched related or unrelated donor (80%) after myeloablative conditioning (76%) for acute leukemia (49%), myelodysplastic syndrome (17%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (14%), or another hematopoietic disorders (20%). After 28 days of treatment with BDP, 46% of the patients had a complete response (CR) and 10% had a partial response (PR); after 200 days, 61 (80%) patients were alive, 34% maintained a CR, and 3% maintained a PR, whereas 53% required additional immunosuppression (IS). After 28 days of treatment with BDP+BUD, 67% had a CR and 10% a PR; after 200 days, 74 (91%) patients were alive, 46% maintained a CR, and 2% maintained a PR, whereas 43% required additional IS. Among the entire cohort of 157 patients, 66 (42%) were treated successfully without systemic glucocorticoids. This study reports the efficacy of poorly absorbable steroids alone for patients with isolated UGI aGVHD.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been reported as an important factor in regulating cellular process expressed in all hematopoietic compartment. But the molecular mechanism of circRNAs in ALL remain unclear. In this study, we observed circ-0000745 upregulated in leukemia cells (Kasumi-1 and KG-1). Upregulated the expression of circ-0000745 significantly enhanced the proliferation of Kasumi-1 and KG-1 cells, and reduced the ratio of apoptosis cells. Knock down the endogenous expression of circ-0000745 suppressed the cell proliferation and increased the ratio of apoptosis cells. Furthermore, western blot assay showed that overexpression of circ-0000745 increased the activity of ERK1/2. Altogether, these results revealed that upregulated circ-0000745 in leukemia cells could promoter cell viability by increasing the activation of ERK pathway. This study supported the important of circRNAs in the process of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and provided a new biomarker on ALL diagnosis and therapy.","['0 (RNA, Circular)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Cell proliferation', 'Circ-0000745', 'ERK pathway', 'circRNAs']",,['Copyright (c) 2020.

More and more studies have revealed that lncRNA can participate in the occurrence and pathophysiology of diseases, especially in cancers. Although research on lncRNAs has doubled year by year, little is known about the specific regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs in diseases. The main purpose of this review is to explore the molecular mechanism and clinical significance of SNHG5 in cancers. We systematically search Pubmed to obtain relevant literature on SNHG5. In this review, the functional role, molecular mechanism, and clinical significance of SNHG5 in human cancers are described in detail. Small nucleolar RNA host gene 5 (SNHG5) has been shown to be involved in the development and tumorigenesis of a variety of cancers (colorectal, bladder, gastric, endometrial, acute lymphocytic leukemia, osteosarcoma, etc.). Its disorder is closely related to metastasis, pathological staging, and prognosis. LncRNA SNHG5 might be a potential and novel diagnostic marker for cancer patients, a target for molecular targeted therapy, and a prognostic diagnostic marker.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (long non-coding RNA SNHG5, human)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancers', 'LncRNAs', 'SNHG5', 'ceRNA']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2020 Apr 28.,"Recent experimental data suggest that the heterogeneity of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) stem cells may be the result of the development of unique molecular events generating functional consequences in terms of the resistance and persistence of leukemic stem cells. To explore this phenomenon, we designed a single-cell transcriptome assay evaluating simultaneously the expression of 87 genes. Highly purified CD34+ cells from three CML patients at diagnosis were immobilized in microfluidic chips, and the expression of 87 genes was evaluated in each cell. This analysis identified a group of 13 highly connected genes including NANOG, POU5F1, LIN28A, and SOX2, representing on average 8.59% of the cell population analyzed. Bioinformatics analysis with the corrected matrix and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) algorithm identified four distinct clusters, and the pseudotime analysis confirmed the presence of seven stem cell states in the four clusters identified. ALOX5 expression was associated with the group of cells expressing the pluripotency markers. In in vitro analyses, two genes that were predicted to undergo similar regulation using pseudotime analysis (ALOX5 and FGFR) were found to be similarly inhibited by ponatinib, an FGFR inhibitor. Finally, in an independent cohort of CML patients, we found that pluripotency gene expression is a common feature of CD34+ CML cells at diagnosis. Overall, these experiments allowed identification of individual CD34+ cells expressing high levels of pluripotency genes at diagnosis, in which a continuum of transitional states were identified using pseudotime analysis. These results suggest that leukemic stem cell persistence in CML needs to be targeted simultaneously rather than using a single pathway.",['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Epub 2020 Apr 29.,"The precise regulation of gene transcription is required to establish and maintain cell type-specific gene expression programs during multicellular development. In addition to transcription factors, chromatin, and its chemical modification, play a central role in regulating gene expression. In vertebrates, DNA is pervasively methylated at CG dinucleotides, a modification that is repressive to transcription. However, approximately 70% of vertebrate gene promoters are associated with DNA elements called CpG islands (CGIs) that are refractory to DNA methylation. CGIs integrate the activity of a range of chromatin-regulating factors that can post-translationally modify histones and modulate gene expression. This is exemplified by the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), which is enriched at CGI-associated gene promoters and correlates with transcriptional activity. Through studying H3K4me3 at CGIs it has become clear that CGIs shape the distribution of H3K4me3 and, in turn, H3K4me3 influences the chromatin landscape at CGIs. Here we will discuss our understanding of the emerging relationship between CGIs, H3K4me3, and gene expression.","['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2D protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (histone H3 trimethyl Lys4)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",PMC7294231,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chromatin', '*CpG islands', '*DNA methylation', '*H3K4me3', '*Transcription']","['209400/Z/17/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '203829/Z/16/A/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors.

Epub 2020 Apr 30.,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 is an oncovirus that causes aggressive adult T-cell leukemia but is also responsible for severe neurodegenerative and endocrine disorders. Combatting HTLV-1 infections requires a detailed understanding of the viral mechanisms in the host. Therefore, in vitro studies of important virus-encoded proteins would be critical. Our focus herein is on the HTLV-1-encoded regulatory protein p13(II), which interacts with the inner mitochondrial membrane, increasing its permeability to cations (predominantly potassium, K(+)). Thereby, this protein affects mitochondrial homeostasis. We report on our progress in developing specific protocols for heterologous expression of p13(II) in E. coli, and methods for its purification and characterization. We succeeded in producing large quantities of highly-pure full-length p13(II), deemed to be its fully functional form. Importantly, our particular approach based on the fusion of ubiquitin to the p13(II) C-terminus was instrumental in increasing the persistently low expression of soluble p13(II) in its native form. We subsequently developed approaches for protein spin labeling and a conformation study using double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy and a fluorescence-based cation uptake assay for p13(II) in liposomes. Our DEER results point to large protein conformation changes occurring upon transition from the soluble to the membrane-bound state. The functional assay on p13(II)-assisted transport of thallium (Tl(+)) through the membrane, wherein Tl(+) substituted for K(+), suggests transmembrane potential involvement in p13(II) function. Our study lays the foundation for expansion of in vitro functional and structural investigations on p13(II) and would aid in the development of structure-based protein inhibitors and markers.","['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (rof protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",PMC7266171,['NOTNLM'],"['*DEER-detected p13(II) self-association', '*Fluorescence-based p13(II) liposome uptake assay', '*High-yield protein production', '*Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 encoded protein p13(II)', '*Viral protein-mitochondrial membrane association']","['P41 GM103521/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM123779/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 AI137735/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2020 May 2.,"BACKGROUND: The frequency of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) germline mutations in cancer-related genes among children with cancer in highly consanguineous populations is not well studied. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing of germline DNA was performed in 60 children with acute leukemia. We used the St. Jude Pediatric Cancer Variant Pathogenicity Information Exchange (PeCanPIE) data portal for the classification of germline variants by the St. Jude Medal Ceremony pipeline. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and three patients had acute myeloid leukemia. Parental consanguinity was present in 27 (45%) patients. All patients were of Arab ancestry. Three patients (5%) had a history of cancer in their siblings. Five patients (8.3%) had P/LP germline mutations in cancer-related genes. Three patients with B-ALL had heterozygous pathogenic mutations in TP53, BRCA1, and BRCA2; one patient with B-ALL had homozygous pathogenic mutation in PMS2; and one patient with T-ALL had LP homozygous mutation in AK2 that was associated with reticular dysgenesis. Among patients who had history of parental consanguinity, three (11%) had P/LP germline mutations compared with two (8%) in the absence of parental consanguinity. Fourteen (23%) patients had gold medal variants in cancer-related genes, 13 were heterozygous, and one was homozygous. Silver medal variants were present in 35 (58%) patients; all were heterozygous except one homozygous. CONCLUSIONS: Children with acute leukemia in Saudi Arabia had low frequency of P/LP mutations in cancer-related genes despite the high rate of consanguinity. Larger studies using whole-genome sequencing are needed to further explore the heritability of childhood leukemia.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute leukemia', '*cancer-related genes', '*children', '*germline variants']",,"['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 May 2.,"INTRODUCTION: The development of drug resistance is the main obstacle for successful treatment in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Noncoding RNAs have been implicated in biological function in AML drug resistance. Aberrant protein glycosylation is associated with AML progression. The aim of the study was to explore the potential regulatory mechanism of lncRNA MEG3/miR-155/ALG9 axis in drug resistance of AML. METHODS: QRT-PCR and Western blot were used for comparison analyses of ALG9, MEG3, and miR-155 levels. CCK-8 and colony formation assays were determined for drug sensitivity and proliferative capability of AML cells. Luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the targets of miR-155. RESULTS: The mannosyltransferase ALG9 and MEG3 was downregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of M5/multidrug resistance (MDR) AML patients and adriamycin (ADR)-resistant AML cell lines, which determined a positive correlation in AML patients. Low expression of ALG9 and MEG3 predicted poor prognosis of AML patients. The altered level of ALG9 was found corresponding to the drug-resistant phenotype and sphere formation of AML cells. MiR-155 was overexpressed in M5/MDR patients and ADR-resistant AML cells, as well as inversely correlated to ALG9 expression. MEG3 was a direct target of miR-155 and could sponge miR-155 in AML cells. MEG3 interacted with miR-155 to regulate ALG9 expression, which reversed the effects of ALG9 regulation on proliferation and drug resistance in AML cells. CONCLUSION: MEG3 sponged miR-155 by competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism, which further modulated ALG9 expression and AML procession, providing a novel therapeutic target for AML chemoresistance.","['0 (MEG3 non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (ALG9 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Mannosyltransferases)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ALG9', 'MEG3', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'drug resistance', 'miR-155']","['81472014/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'LQ2017049/Technology Research General Project of Liaoning Educational Commission']",['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: YACSs (n = 3558) diagnosed with breast cancer (BC), colorectal cancer (CRC), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or localized malignant melanoma (MM) between the ages of 19 and 39 years and treated between 1985 and 2009 were invited to complete a mailed questionnaire. Survivors of localized MM treated with limited skin surgery served as a reference group for treatment burden. RESULTS: In total, 1488 YACSs responded (42%), and 1056 YACSs were evaluable and included in the present study (74% females, average age at survey 49 years, average 15 years since diagnosis). Forty-four percent did not meet PA guidelines, 50% reported BMI >/= 25 and 20% smoked, with no statistically significant differences across diagnostic groups. Male gender, education </= 13 years, comorbidity, lymphedema, pain, chronic fatigue, and depressive symptoms were associated with not meeting single and/or an increasing number of lifestyle guidelines. CONCLUSION: A large proportion of long-term YACSs do not meet the lifestyle guidelines for PA, BMI, and/or smoking.

RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies in adult Ph-negative ALL support the use of measurable residual disease (MRD) response to front-line therapy to guide consolidation. As such, most MRD-negative patients do not require front-line HCT. Blinatumomab benefits patients with B-ALL with MRD+ complete response (CR) and can be used as a bridge to HCT; whether HCT is still required in this setting is an area of ongoing inquiry. Blinatumomab and inotuzumab result in high rates of MRD negative CR in adults with relapsed/refractory ALL and allow more patients with relapsed disease to receive HCT. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapies may serve as a bridge to HCT or as a stand-alone therapy for relapsed/refractory patients; data suggests there may be greater benefit to consolidating CAR-T with HCT in HCT-naive adults. The decision to incorporate consolidative allogeneic HCT into front-line therapy should be primarily guided by MRD status and the ALL regimen utilized. Targeted immunotherapies result in high MRD-negative CR rates, allowing more adults with relapsed/refractory ALL to be successfully bridged to HCT; early incorporation of these therapies may also prove valuable in reducing the need for HCT in the front-line setting by increasing MRD negative CR rates.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*Immunotherapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 May 1.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) initiating and sustaining cells maintain high cell-surface similarity with their cells-of-origin, i.e., hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), and identification of truly distinguishing leukemia-private antigens has remained elusive to date. To nonetheless utilize surface antigen-directed immunotherapy in AML, we here propose targeting both, healthy and malignant human HSPC, by chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells with specificity against CD117, the cognate receptor for stem cell factor. This approach should spare most mature hematopoietic cells and would require CAR T termination followed by subsequent transplantation of healthy HSPCs to rescue hematopoiesis. We successfully generated anti-CD117 CAR T-cells from healthy donors and AML patients. Anti-CD117 CAR T-cells efficiently targeted healthy and leukemic CD117-positive cells in vitro. In mice xenografted with healthy human hematopoiesis, they eliminated CD117-expressing, but not CD117-negative human cells. Importantly, in mice xenografted with primary human CD117-positive AML, they eradicated disease in a therapeutic setting. Administration of ATG in combination with rituximab, which binds to the co-expressed CAR T-cell transduction/selection marker RQR8, led to CAR T-cell depletion. Thus, we here provide the first proof of concept for the generation and preclinical efficacy of CAR T-cells directed against CD117-expressing human hematopoietic cells.","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (KIT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 May 1.,"Previous studies demonstrated that splicing factor mutations are recurrent events in hematopoietic malignancies with both clinical and functional implications. However, their aberrant splicing patterns in acute myeloid leukemia remain largely unexplored. In this study, we characterized mutations in SRSF2, U2AF1, and SF3B1, the most commonly mutated splicing factors. In our clinical analysis of 2678 patients, splicing factor mutations showed inferior relapse-free and overall survival, however, these mutations did not represent independent prognostic markers. RNA-sequencing of 246 and independent validation in 177 patients revealed an isoform expression profile which is highly characteristic for each individual mutation, with several isoforms showing a strong dysregulation. By establishing a custom differential splice junction usage pipeline, we accurately detected aberrant splicing in splicing factor mutated samples. A large proportion of differentially used junctions were novel, including several junctions in leukemia-associated genes. In SRSF2(P95H) mutants, we further explored the possibility of a cascading effect through the dysregulation of the splicing pathway. Furthermore, we observed a validated impact on overall survival for two junctions overused in SRSF2(P95H) mutants. We conclude that splicing factor mutations do not represent independent prognostic markers. However, they do have genome-wide consequences on gene splicing leading to dysregulated isoform expression of several genes.","['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (SF3B1 protein, human)', '0 (Splicing Factor U2AF)', '0 (U2AF1 protein, human)', '147153-65-9 (SRSF2 protein, human)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)']",,,,"['2013.86.2/Wilhelm Sander-Stiftung (Wilhelm Sander Foundation)/International', 'SFB1243/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research', 'Foundation)/International']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the capacity of CART therapy has not yet been fully elucidated. PATIENT CONCERNS: An 18-year-old Chinese male patient presented with multiple firm masses on the skin all over his body following regular chemotherapy. DIAGNOSES: Bone marrow smear and skin biopsy confirmed that it was a bone marrow and skin relapse from the initial B-cell ALL. INTERVENTIONS: CD19 CART-cell therapy was performed to manage the bone marrow and skin of the relapsed B-cell ALL. OUTCOMES: During CART-cell therapy, cytokine release syndrome and central nervous encephalopathy occurred. Eventually, the lesions disappeared, and the bone marrow and skin tested minimal residual disease (MRD) negative. The patient achieved complete remission (CR). Fourteen days after testing MRD negative, he received allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation and has remained disease free to date. LESSONS: The CR of this patient with leukemia cutis demonstrated that CART exhibited efficacy in this case.

Epub 2020 May 1.,"Mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1), which exerts its H3K4 methyltransferase activity by interacting with WDR5, ASH2L, and RBBP5, plays a pivotal role in regulating hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis. Disrupting the integrity of MLL1-complex has been reported to be associated with acute leukemia. However, the exact role of MLL1-complex in myeloid cells is unknown. In this study, microarray analysis revealed that the core components of the Mll1-complex, Wdr5, Ash2l, and Mll1, were concurrently downregulated by tumor-secreted factors as well as GM-CSF + IL-6 during the accumulation and activation of murine myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). These changes were further validated by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting both in vitro and in vivo. The expression levels of WDR5 and ASH2L were also significantly decreased in bone marrow MDSCs of lung cancer patients compared with that of healthy controls. Functionally, ectopic expression of Wdr5, Ash2l, and Mll1 (C terminus) reversed the accumulation and function of GM-CSF + IL-6-induced as well as tumor-cocultured polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) by promoting them to differentiate into mature neutrophil-like cells. Mechanistically, GM-CSF + IL-6-activated Stat3 and Cebpbeta synergistically induced the expression of miR-21a, miR-21b, and miR-181b, and thus inhibited the expression of Wdr5, Ash2l, and Mll1 by targeting to their 3' untranslated regions, respectively. Furthermore, knockdown of these microRNAs also suppressed the expansion and function of GM-CSF + IL-6-induced PMN-MDSCs. Taken together, our findings indicate that the Stat3/Cebpbeta-miR-21a/b/181b-Mll1-complex axis may play a critical role in PMN-MDSC expansion, activation, and differentiation, and this axis may provide an effectively immunological therapeutic approach for patients with cancer or other immunological diseases.","[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (Cebpb protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incorporation of immune-targeted strategies into the treatment landscape of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), however, has been challenging. While this is in part due to the inability of the immune system to mount an effective tumor-specific immunogenic response against the heterogeneous nature of AML, the decreased immunogenicity of AML cells also represents a major obstacle in the effort to design effective immunotherapeutic strategies. In fact, AML cells have been shown to employ sophisticated escape mechanisms to evade elimination, such as direct immunosuppression of natural killer cells and decreased surface receptor expression leading to impaired recognition by the immune system. Yet, cellular and humoral immune reactions against tumor-associated antigens (TAA) of acute leukemia cells have been reported and the success of allogeneic stem cell transplantation and monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of AML clearly provides proof that an immunotherapeutic approach is feasible in the management of this disease. This review discusses the recent progress and persisting challenges in cellular immunotherapy for patients with AML.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR-T cell', '*Cancer vaccine', '*NK cell', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*adoptive T cell', '*drug development']",,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Central Kazakhstan area has a relatively high incidence rate of leukemia. However, the relationship between vitamin D status and leukemia or other types of cancer in Kazakhstan has not yet been addressed. Therefore, in this first pilot single-center study conducted in Central Kazakhstan, we compared plasma levels of 25(OH)D and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with leukemia and demographically matching healthy volunteers. The levels of 25(OH)D in patients were found to be significantly lower (10.8 +/- 7.0 ng/mL; n = 31) than in healthy subjects (21.6 +/- 7.8 ng/mL; n = 34; p < 0.0001). A similar difference was observed in both younger (<60 years old) and older (>60 years old) participants, though there was no association between 25(OH)D concentration and age within the patient group. In female patients, 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower than in male patients (p = 0.04). No significant seasonal variations of 25(OH)D were observed in either the patient or the control group. VDR gene expression levels appeared to be similar in leukemia patients and healthy subjects, and no correlation between the cellular VDR expression and plasma 25(OH)D concentrations was observed in either group of participants. We did not observe a significant association of 25(OH)D or VDR levels and overall survival of leukemia patients.

The aim of this study was to test the activity of clinical-grade membrane-bound IL-21/4-1BBL-expanded NK cell products against AML in vivo. METHODS: Fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were incubated with equal numbers of irradiated membrane-bound IL-21/4-1BBL-expressing K562 cells for 2-3 weeks to induce clinical-grade NK cell expansion. RESULTS: Expansion for 2 and 3 weeks produced approximately 4 and 8 x 10(9) NK cells from 2 x 10(7) PBMCs. The production of CD107a and TNF-alpha in NK cell products in response to AML cell lines and primary blasts was higher than that observed in resting NK cells. The 2-week expanded NK cell products were xenografted into immunodeficient mice with leukemia and were persistently found in the BM, spleen, liver, lung, and peripheral blood for at least 13 days; furthermore, these expanded products reduced the AML burden in vivo. Compared with matched AML patients with persistent or relapsed minimal residual disease (MRD(+) ) who underwent regular consolidation therapy, MRD(+) patients who underwent NK treatment had better overall survival and showed no major adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical-grade mbIL-21/4-1BBL-expanded NK cells exhibited antileukemic activity against AML in vitro and in vivo.","['0 (4-1BB Ligand)', '0 (Interleukins)', 'MKM3CA6LT1 (interleukin-21)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*4-1BBL', '*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*IL-21', '*Minimal residual disease', '*NK cells']","['2017YFA0104500/National Key Research and Development Program of', 'China/International', '81670166/National Natural Science Foundation of China/International', '81530046/National Natural Science Foundation of China/International', '81870140/National Natural Science Foundation of China/International', '81621001/Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of', 'China/International', 'Z171100001017098/Beijing Municipal Science &amp; Technology', 'Commission/International', '201704020214/Project of Health Collaborative Innovation of Guangzhou', 'City/International', '2018-2-4084/Scientific Research Foundation for Capital Medicine', 'Development/International', 'BMU2019LCKXJ003/Peking University Clinical Scientist Program/International', 'PKU2020LCXQ015/Clinical Medicine Plus X-Young Scholars Project of Peking', 'University/International', ""RDX2019-14/Peking University People's Hospital Research and Development"", 'Funds/International']","['(c) 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Recent approval of genetically engineered dicamba-resistant crops is expected to lead to increased dicamba use, and there has been growing interest in potential human health effects. A prior analysis in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) suggested associations between dicamba and colon and lung cancer. We re-evaluated dicamba use in the AHS, including an additional 12 years and 2702 exposed cancers. METHODS: The AHS is a prospective cohort of pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina. At enrollment (1993-1997) and follow-up (1999-2005), participants reported dicamba use. Exposure was characterized by cumulative intensity-weighted lifetime days, including exposure lags of up to 20 years. We estimated relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using multivariable Poisson regression for incident cancers diagnosed from enrollment through 2014/2015. RESULTS: Among 49 922 applicators, 26 412 (52.9%) used dicamba. Compared with applicators reporting no dicamba use, those in the highest quartile of exposure had elevated risk of liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer (nexposed = 28, RRQ4 = 1.80, CI: 1.26-2.56, Ptrend < 0.001) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL, nexposed = 93, RRQ4 = 1.20, CI: 0.96-1.50, Ptrend = 0.01) and decreased risk of myeloid leukaemia (nexposed = 55, RRQ4 = 0.73, CI: 0.51-1.03, Ptrend = 0.01). The associations for liver cancer and myeloid leukaemia remained after lagging exposure of up to 20 years. CONCLUSIONS: With additional follow-up and exposure information, associations with lung and colon cancer were no longer apparent. In this first evaluation of liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer, there was an association with increasing use of dicamba that persisted across lags of up to 20 years.","['0 (Pesticides)', 'SJG3M6RY6H (Dicamba)']",PMC7660157,['NOTNLM'],"['*Dicamba', '*agricultural health study', '*agriculture', '*cancer', '*pesticides']","['Z01 CP010119/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 ES049030/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the International', 'Epidemiological Association 2020.

METHODS: 291 de novo AML patients and 97 controls were consecutively recruited, and bone marrow samples were collected to detect AKIP1 expression using quantitative polymerase chain reaction prior to initial treatment. Treatment response, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) in AML patients were evaluated. RESULTS: A-kinase interacting protein 1 expression was higher in AML patients than that in controls; meanwhile, receiver operating characteristic curve displayed that AKIP1 was able to distinguish AML patients from controls (area under the curve:0.772, 95%CI: 0.720-0.823). Among AML patients, AKIP1 high expression was correlated with -7 or 7q-, monosomal karyotype, and worse risk stratification. Moreover, AKIP1 expression was negatively correlated with complete remission achievement, while no correlation of AKIP1 expression with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation achievement was observed. AKIP1 high expression was associated with shorter EFS and OS in total patients, and further subgroup analysis exhibited that AKIP1 high expression correlated with worse EFS and OS in intermediate-risk and poor-risk patients but not in better-risk patients. Besides, subsequent analysis revealed that AKIP1 high expression was an independent factor predicting unfavorable EFS and OS. CONCLUSION: A-kinase interacting protein 1 has the potential to be a novel marker for assisting AML management.","['0 (AKIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",PMC7246368,['NOTNLM'],"['A-kinase interacting protein 1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'risk stratification', 'survival']",,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

In addition, computer-aided biomarker discovery has now become an attractive paradigm for precision diagnosis. METHODS: In this study, we identified and evaluated miR-139-3p as a biomarker for screening of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma using the Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus database analyses. We identified possible miR-139-3p target genes through the predicted database and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma upregulated genes from the Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to determine key miR-139-3p targets and pathways associated with esophageal carcinoma. Finally, the expression and expected significance of hub genes were evaluated via the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. RESULTS: MiR-139-3p was significantly downregulated in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma/esophageal carcinoma. In GSE 122497, the area under the curve-receiver operating characteristic value, sensitivity, and specificity for serum miR-139-3p were 0.754, 67.49%, and 80.00%, respectively. The pattern specification process, skeletal system development, and regionalization process were the most enriched interactions in esophageal carcinoma. In addition, Epstein-Barr virus infection, human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection, and human cytomegalovirus infection were identified as crucial pathways. Six hub genes (CD1A, FCGR2A, ANPEP, CD1B, membrane metalloendopeptidase, and TWIST1) were found, and FCGR2A and membrane metalloendopeptidase were further confirmed by genotype-tissue expression. High expression of membrane metalloendopeptidase correlated with a better overall survival but not with disease-free survival of patients with esophageal carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-139-3p was identified as a candidate biomarker for predicting esophageal squamous cell carcinoma based on network analysis. MiR-139-3p acted as a tumor suppressor by targeting membrane metalloendopeptidase in esophageal carcinoma, and low expression of membrane metalloendopeptidase may indicate a better prognosis of patients with esophageal carcinoma.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN139 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",PMC7225788,['NOTNLM'],"['*TCGA', '*bioinformatics', '*biomarkers', '*esophageal squamous cell carcinoma', '*miR-139-3p', '*microRNA']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to explore a specific solution for third-generation EGFR-TKI resistance caused by bypass activation, and to examine the antitumor effects of the combination of a novel inhibitor CX-6258 HCl with osimertinib, along with its underlining mechanisms. Methods: A bioinformatics analysis was performed to detect the relations between the provirus integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (PIM1) expression and prognosis of lung cancer. The EGFR-mutated lung cancer cell lines were treated with the combination of CX-6258 HCl and osimertinib to analyze cell proliferation using the Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, and in vivo experiments. Cell migration was analyzed using wound healing and Transwell assays. The apoptosis level was detected using Annexin V-propidium iodide flow cytometry. The expression levels of EGFR and STAT3 were determined using Western blot analysis. Results: High expression level of PIM1 was related to the poor prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The combined administration of osimertinib and CX-6258 HCl significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration and effectively induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells. It was more efficient in suppressing EGFR activation and phosphorylation of STAT3 compared with osimertinib treatment alone. Furthermore, it showed a durable efficacy in a xenograft model. Conclusions: This study showed that PIM1 is a poor prognostic factor for NSCLC. CX-6258 HCl is a potential molecular inhibitor to sensitize the antitumor effects of osimertinib through the inhibiting of the phosphorylation of STAT3 in NSCLC.",,PMC7186747,['NOTNLM'],"['CX-6258 HCl', 'PIM1', 'epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)', 'non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)', 'osimertinib']",,['2020 Annals of Translational Medicine.

However, its prognostic value in AML remains unclear. Methods: In this study, we evaluated the prognostic significance of ANP32A expression using two independent large cohorts of cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) patients. Multivariable analysis in CN-AML group was also presented. Based on the ANP32A expression, its related genes, dysregulation of pathways, interaction network analysis between microRNAs and target genes, as well as methylation analysis were performed to unveil the complex functions behind ANP32A. Results: Here we demonstrated overexpression of ANP32A was notably associated with unfavorable outcome in two independent cohorts of CN-AML patients (OS: P=0.012, EFS: P=0.005, n=185; OS: P=0.041, n=232), as well as in European Leukemia Net (ELN) Intermediate-I group (OS: P=0.018, EFS: P=0.045, n=115), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Intermediate Risk AML group (OS: P=0.048, EFS: P=0.039, n=225), and non-M3 AML group (OS: P=0.034, EFS: P=0.011, n=435). Multivariable analysis further validated ANP32A as a high-risk factor in CN-AML group. Multi-omics analysis presented overexpression of ANP32A was associated with aberrant expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor, up/down-regulation of metabolic and immune-related pathways, dysregulation of microRNAs, and hypomethylation on CpG island and 1st Exon regions.

DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A)-mutated AML patients have a poor prognosis. Some long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to enhance therapeutic sensitivity, and so could affect the overall survival rate of elderly cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) patients; however, studies on the lncRNA signature in DNMT3A-mutated AML are rare. Method: The DNMT3A R878H conditional knock-in mouse model was constructed to explore the lncRNAs of DNMT3A mutation by using the Cuffcomparison method. Cis and trans regulation networks were used to predict candidate genes. The expression levels in leukemic cell lines and the prognostic index of these candidate genes were analyzed with the Broad Institute Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and OncoLnc databases. The data for each sample were statistically analyzed using GraphPad Prism. Results: In this study, we applied the DNMT3A R878H conditional knock-in mouse model to explore the lncRNA epigenetic landscape of DNMT3A mutation by using the Cuffcomparison method. Twenty-three differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified in Dnmt3a(R878H/WT)Mx1-Cre(+) mice. We next predicted the downstream targetable genes regulated by these lncRNAs through cis and trans regulation networks and found 124 candidate genes are related to these lncRNAs. In further analysis of 124 genes, we found that increased mRNA expression levels of interleukin 1 receptor type 2 (IL1R2), Kruppel-like factor 13 (KLF13), ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit A (ATP6V1A), proteasome 26S Subunit, non-ATPase 3 (PSMD3), and pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 2 (PYCR2) were associated with poor prognosis in AML. Functional analysis of these genes demonstrated that the pathways involved in autophagy, cell cycle, and hematopoietic stem cell differentiation were more enriched in Dnmt3a(R878H/WT)Mx1-Cre(+) mice. Conclusion: Our study was the first to use DNMT3A R878H conditional knock-in mouse model to predict the specific lncRNAs regulated by the DNMT3A mutation in AML. Six candidate genes were found to be associated with DNMT3A mutation with poor prognosis. Our results provided a possible treatment strategy for this disease.",,PMC7186694,['NOTNLM'],"['DNMT3A R878H', 'LncRNA', 'RNA-seq', 'knock-in mice']",,['2020 Annals of Translational Medicine.

However, few studies have been conducted on the progression from FA to AML. In this study, we used proteomic profiling, together with bioinformatics analyses, to explore the molecular mechanisms by which FA progresses to AML. Quantitative proteomic analyses of bone marrow samples identified 168 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), including 7 upregulated proteins and 161 downregulated proteins in the bone marrow of the FA patient compared with the healthy people. The upregulated proteins were enriched in response to stress, oxygen transport, and hydrogen peroxide catabolic process. The downregulated proteins were enriched in myeloid leukocyte mediated immunity, response to interleukin-12, platelet degranulation and regulation of ATPase activity. Based on these results, we discovered 155 DEPs (142 upregulated and 13 downregulated) in the bone marrow samples between FA and AML patients, of which HIST1H1D, HIST1H3A, PSME1 and THRAP3 may play important roles in the progression of FA to AML and may be used as markers for AML early diagnosis. Finally, cell-line based experiments confirmed that PSME1 had an important effect on the proliferation of leukemia cells.",,PMC7191167,['NOTNLM'],"['Fanconi anemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'bone marrow samples']",,['AJTR Copyright (c) 2020.'],,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He received sequential chemotherapy, including carboplatin plus paclitaxel, amrubicin, and S-1, due to multiple pulmonary metastases. After >4 years of first-line chemotherapy, he developed consistent myelosuppression and a definite diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia was made following bone marrow analysis. A 49-year-old man with advanced TC received carboplatin plus paclitaxel with amrubicin as second-line therapy due to recurrence. Amrubicin was administered for 54 cycles but T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma without recurrence of TC was confirmed following transbronchial nodal biopsy due to marked lymphadenopathy.

In particular, the e6a2 fusion transcript has been associated with clinically aggressive disease frequently presenting in accelerated or blast crisis phases; there is limited evidence on the efficacy of front-line second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors for this genotype.

Epub 2020 Apr 30.,"Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) modulates gene expression by interacting with chromatin regions that are frequently distal from the promoters of estrogen-regulated genes. Active chromatin-enriched ""super-enhancer"" (SE) regions, mainly observed in in vitro culture systems, often control production of key cell type-determining transcription factors. Here, we defined super-enhancers that bind to ERalpha in vivo within hormone-responsive uterine tissue in mice. We found that SEs are already formed prior to estrogen exposure at the onset of puberty. The genes at SEs encoded critical developmental factors, including retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) and homeobox D (HOXD). Using high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) along with DNA sequence analysis, we demonstrate that most SEs are located at a chromatin loop end and that most uterine genes in loop ends associated with these SEs are regulated by estrogen. Although the SEs were formed before puberty, SE-associated genes acquired optimal ERalpha-dependent expression after reproductive maturity, indicating that pubertal processes that occur after SE assembly and ERalpha binding are needed for gene responses. Genes associated with these SEs affected key estrogen-mediated uterine functions, including transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) and LIF interleukin-6 family cytokine (LIF) signaling pathways. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first identification of SE interactions that underlie hormonal regulation of genes in uterine tissue and optimal development of estrogen responses in this tissue.","['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",PMC7307205,['NOTNLM'],"['*chromatin conformation capture', '*chromatin looping', '*chromatin modification', '*epigenetic regulation', '*estrogen receptor', '*female reproduction', '*gene expression', '*reproduction', '*super-enhancer', '*transcription']","['ZIA ES070065/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA ES103311/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['Conflict of interest-The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest', 'with the contents of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As 50% of the residues are exactly the same and the signature domain of KIF2C is highly conserved between human and zebrafish, we used zebrafish embryos as a model to investigate the function of kif2c in vivo. We determined that kif2c is necessary for lymphopoiesis in zebrafish embryos. Additionally, we observed that kif2c is not related to differentiation of HSCs; however, it is important for the maintenance of HSCs as it provides survival signals to HSCs.

Single HSCs can give rise to at least eight distinct blood-cell lineages. Together, hematopoiesis, erythropoiesis, and angiogenesis coordinate several biological processes, i.e., cellular interactions during development and proliferation, guided migration, lineage programming, and reprogramming by transcription factors. Any dysregulation of these processes can result in hematological disorders and/or malignancies. Several studies of the molecular mechanisms governing HSC maintenance have demonstrated that protein regulation by the ubiquitin proteasomal pathway is crucial for normal HSC function. Recent studies have shown that reversal of ubiquitination by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) plays an equally important role in hematopoiesis; however, information regarding the biological function of DUBs is limited. In this review, we focus on recent discoveries about the physiological roles of DUBs in hematopoiesis, erythropoiesis, and angiogenesis and discuss the DUBs associated with common hematological disorders and malignancies, which are potential therapeutic drug targets.",,PMC7281754,['NOTNLM'],"['DUBs', 'HSCs', 'cell differentiation', 'erythroid', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'myeloid']",['2019R1A2C2005453/National Research Foundation of Korea'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These tumours frequently present with DNA damage response (DDR) defects including loss or mutation of key DDR genes, oncogene-induced replication stress (RS) and cell cycle checkpoint dysfunction. Aim: To identify biomarkers of sensitivity to inhibition of Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR), a DNA damage sensor, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which is required for single strand break repair. We also hypothesise that combining ATR and PARP inhibition is synergistic. Methods: Single agent sensitivity to VE-821 (ATR inhibitor) and olaparib (PARP inhibitor), and the combination, was determined using cell proliferation and clonogenic assays, in HR-NB cell lines. Basal expression of DDR proteins, including ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATR, was assessed using Western blotting. CHK1(S345) and H2AX(S129) phosphorylation was assessed using Western blotting to determine ATR activity and RS, respectively. RS and homologous recombination repair (HRR) activity was also measured by gammaH2AX and Rad51 foci formation using immunofluorescence. Results: MYCN amplification and/or low ATM protein expression were associated with sensitivity to VE-821 (p < 0.05). VE-821 was synergistic with olaparib (CI value 0.04-0.89) independent of MYCN or ATM status. Olaparib increased H2AX(S129) phosphorylation which was further increased by VE-821. Olaparib-induced Rad51 foci formation was reduced by VE-821 suggesting inhibition of HRR. Conclusion: RS associated with MYCN amplification, ATR loss or PARP inhibition increases sensitivity to the ATR inhibitor VE-821.

In this study, we assessed the anticancer efficiency and acute toxicity of anthrafuran administered orally. The action of anthrafuran was studied on transplanted tumor models which included P388 leukemia, Ca755 mammary adenocarcinoma, LLC lung carcinoma, and T47D human breast cancer xenografts on Balb/c nude mice. A significant antitumor efficacy of oral anthrafuran was revealed for all tested tumor models as follows: T/Cmax = 219% for P388, TGImax = 91% for Ca755, TGImax = 84% with CRmax = 54% for LLC, and T/C = 38% for T47D. The optimal treatment schedule of orally administered anthrafuran was 70-100 mg/kg given daily for five days. The LD50 value of orally administered anthrafuran (306.7 mg/kg) in mice was six times higher than that for i.p. administration (52.5 mg/kg).

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 465 adult patients with AML who had received HSCT in the first CR between 2000 and 2016. RESULTS: In MK + AML, the median leukocyte count was significantly lower (P < .001) and no NPM1 mutation was found (P = .042). Multivariate analysis revealed that MK was the most powerful prognostic factors for OS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.6; P = .001), EFS (HR, 3.8; P < .001), and cumulative incidence of relapse (HR, 6.1; P < .001), compared to any other poor risk factors such as complex karyotype, FLT3-ITD mutations, old age, and higher leukocyte count. The adverse prognostic impact of MK tended to be more prominent in the younger age group (<40 years) (HR, 6.3, P < .001) than in the older age group (>/=40 years) (HR, 3.4, P < .001).

However, the mechanism underlying this association is unknown. METHODS: Ecological study of incidence of pediatric ALL among 253 counties in the State of Texas (USA) using surrogates of genetic and environmental PM. ALL incidence data were obtained from Texas Cancer Registry and county population statistics from the US Census Bureau. Poisson regression was used to compare ALL incidence and PM. RESULTS: There is substantial and variable genetic and environmental PM among counties in Texas. Indicators of genetic PM including proportion of multiracial households, ratio of Hispanics to non-Hispanics, and ratio of foreign to native-born residents were all significantly associated with a higher incidence of ALL (IRR(3) 1.81 (95CI 1.05-3.13), 1.67 (95CI 1.16-2.37), and 1.59 (95CI 1.03-2.48), respectively). Surrogates of environmental PM namely population density and persons per household were not associated with incidence of ALL; IRRs 1.29 (95CI 0.4-4.15) and 1.47 (95CI 0.89-2.43). CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with prior patterns and magnitudes of PM association with ALL. Our findings suggest that the implicated mechanism of leukemogenesis in PM may be genetically transmitted rather than environmental.",,PMC7275880,['NOTNLM'],"['*Childhood', '*Epidemiology', '*Etiology', '*Leukemia', '*Lymphocytic', '*Mixing', '*Population']",['R25 CA160078/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2020 Apr 29.,"The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) body is a phase-separated nuclear structure physically associated with chromatin, implying its crucial roles in genome functions. However, its role in transcriptional regulation is largely unknown. We developed APEX-mediated chromatin labeling and purification (ALaP) to identify the genomic regions proximal to PML bodies. We found that PML bodies associate with active regulatory regions across the genome and with approximately 300 kb of the short arm of the Y chromosome (YS300) in mouse embryonic stem cells. The PML body association with YS300 is essential for the transcriptional activity of the neighboring Y-linked clustered genes. Mechanistically, PML bodies provide specific nuclear spaces that the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A cannot access, resulting in the steady maintenance of a hypo-methylated state at Y-linked gene promoters. Our study underscores a new mechanism for gene regulation in the 3D nuclear space and provides insights into the functional properties of nuclear structures for genome function.","['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Dnmt3a protein, mouse)', '0 (Eif2s3y protein, mouse)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Multifunctional Enzymes)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Uty protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 3.1.- (Apex2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Ddx3y protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*APEX', '*DNA methylation', '*PML', '*Y chromosome', '*chromatin', '*phase separation']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

This was so even though the treatment resulted in decreased pain and increased mobility-both of which are associated with decreased mortality. It was decided to re-analyze the epidemiological data looking at all causes of death. The risk of leukaemia, solid cancer, death from non-cancer causes and from all causes in a study populations of men that received either the typical dose of 5.6 to 11.1 MBq of 224Ra, any dose of 224Ra or no radium were compared using the Cox proportional hazard model. For patients that received the typical dose of 224Ra agreed with the excess cancer was similar to that reported in previous studies. In contrast, these patients were less likely to die from non-cancer diseases and from all causes of death than the control patients. No excess mortality was also found in the population of all males that received the radionuclide. It is concluded that 224Ra treatment administered at low doses to patients with ankylosing spondylitis did not impact mortality from all causes. The study demonstrates the need to consider all causes of death and longevity when assessing health impacts following irradiation.","['13233-32-4 (thorium X)', '60YU5MIG9W (Thorium)', 'W90AYD6R3Q (Radium)']",PMC7192484,,,['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, many life-threatening conditions have since evolved into chronic medical ailments. Paralleling these advancements have been increasing rates of complex hematologic pain syndromes, present in up to 60% of patients with malignancy who are receiving active treatment and up to 33% of patients during survivorship. Opioids remain the practice cornerstone to managing malignancy-associated pain. Prevention and management of opioid-related complications have received significant national attention over the past decade, and emerging data suggest that patients with cancer are at equal if not higher risk of opioid-related complications when compared with patients without malignancy. Numerous tools and procedural practice guides are available to help facilitate safe prescribing. The recent development of cancer-specific resources directing algorithmic use of validated pain screening tools, prescription drug monitoring programs, urine drug screens, opioid use disorder risk screening instruments, and controlled substance agreements have further strengthened the framework for safe prescribing. This article, which integrates federal and organizational guidelines with known risk factors for cancer patients, offers a case-based discussion for reviewing safe opioid prescribing practices in the hematology setting.","['0 (Analgesics, Opioid)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', 'CD35PMG570 (Oxycodone)']",,,,['P30 CA054174/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, our results demonstrate the ability of sub-toxic doses of Trametinib to enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in CRC cells. Our findings also indicate that Trametinib and TRAIL activate caspase-dependent apoptosis in CRC cells. Moreover, Mcl-1 overexpression can reduce apoptosis in CRC cells treated with Trametinib with or without TRAIL. We further demonstrate that Trametinib degrades Mcl-1 through the proteasome pathway. In addition, GSK-3beta phosphorylates Mcl-1 at S159 and promotes Mcl-1 degradation. The E3 ligase FBW7, known to polyubiquitinate Mcl-1, is involved in Trametinib-induced Mcl-1 degradation. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence that Trametinib enhances TRAIL-mediated apoptosis through FBW7-dependent Mcl-1 ubiquitination and degradation.","['0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '33E86K87QN (trametinib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",PMC7299726,['NOTNLM'],"['*Mcl-1', '*TRAIL', '*Trametinib', '*apoptosis', '*degradation']",,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Prolonged remissions with good quality of life become achievable for many patients previously considered only for palliative care because they could not tolerate intensive therapy. As treatment options multiply, the importance of genetic profile is recognised, even for advanced-age patients for whom cure is unlikely. With lack of randomised comparative trials for most treatment regimens, one can only extrapolate data from existing studies to make evidence-based decisions. We herein present seven common clinical scenarios illustrating the complexity of treating older AML patients and describe our approach to their management. In each case, up-to-date data on relevant agents to be offered to a particular patient are discussed.

We characterised effector and suppressor immune responses at the time of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) cessation in patients from the CML8 and CML10 clinical studies. Natural killer (NK) cells with increased expression of activating NK receptors were higher in patients who achieved TFR. There was no difference in the proportion of CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells. Furthermore, we found that FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (T reg) and monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (Mo-MDSCs) were concomitantly decreased in TFR patients, suggesting that the effector and suppressor arms of the immune system work in concert to mediate TFR. A discovery cohort (CML10) was used to generate a predictive model, using logistic regression. Patients classified into the high-risk group were more likely to relapse when compared with the low-risk group (HR 7.4, 95% CI 2.9-19.1).

Case summary : We report the case of a 74-year-old gentleman referred for assessment of progressive exertional dyspnoea and peripheral oedema, 30 months following treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia with high-dose chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Clinical examination and cardiac imaging revealed a small pericardial effusion and pericardial thickening with constrictive physiology; however, no aetiology was identified despite diagnostic pericardiocentesis. The patient required recurrent hospital admissions for intravenous diuresis, therefore, following multidisciplinary discussions, surgical partial pericardectomy was performed. Histology suggested graft-vs.-host disease (GvHD) and post-operatively, the patient improved clinically. Following immunomodulatory therapy with ruxolitinib for both pericardial and pulmonary GvHD, his functional status improved further with no subsequent hospital admissions. Discussion : Although pericardial disease in cancer patients is common, CP is unusual. Determining the underlying aetiology is important for subsequent management, and here, we describe the use of multi-modality imaging to diagnose a rare cause, GvHD, which responded to surgical treatment and immunomodulatory therapy.",,PMC7180538,['NOTNLM'],"['Graft-vs.-host disease', 'Allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'Cardio-oncology', 'Case report', 'Constrictive pericarditis', 'Heart failure']",,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Previous studies support that head and neck cancer-initiating cells (HN-CICs), a subpopulation of cancer cells with enhanced stemness properties, contribute to therapy resistance and tumor recurrence. Arsenic trioxide (As2O3; ATO) has shown to be an effective anti-cancer drug targeting acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Combinatorial treatment with high dose of ATO and cisplatin (CDDP) exert synergistic apoptotic effects in cancer cell lines of various solid tumors, however, it may cause of significant side effect to the patients. Nevertheless, none has reported the anti-cancerous effect of ATO/CDDP targeting HN-CICs. In this study, we aim to evaluate the low dose combination of ATO with conventional chemo-drugs CDDP treatment on targeting HN-CICs. We first analyzed the inhibitory tumorigenicity of co-treatment with ATO and chemo-drugs on HN-CICs which are enriched from HNSCC cells. We observed that ATO/CDDP therapeutic regimen successfully synergized the cell death on HN-CICs with a Combination Index (CI) <1 by Chou-Talalay's analysis in vitro. Interestingly, the ATO/CDDP regimen also induced exaggerated autophagy on HN-CICs. Additionally, this drug combination strategy also empowered both preventive and therapeutic effect by in vivo xenograft assays. Finally, we provide the underlying molecular mechanisms of ATO-based therapeutic regimen on HN-CICs. Together, low dose of combinatorial ATO/CDDP regimen induced cell death as well as exacerbated autophagy via AMPK-STAT3 mediated pathway in HN-CICs.",,PMC7174769,['NOTNLM'],"['arsenic trioxide', 'autophagy', 'combination index', 'head and neck cancer-initiating cells', 'synergistic effects']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Hu, Teo, Huang, Lee and Lo.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the survival of cancer patients is expected to rise due to new therapies being brought into practice, physicians are going to encounter side effects of these therapies.

A correlation of high serum ferritin levels with increased mortality after alloSCT has been suggested by several retrospective analyses as well as by two smaller prospective studies. This prospective multicentric study aimed to study the association of ferritin serum levels before start of conditioning with alloSCT outcome. Patients with acute leukemia, lymphoma or MDS receiving a matched sibling alloSCT for the first time were considered for inclusion, regardless of conditioning. A comparison of outcomes between patients with high and low ferritin level was performed using univariate analysis and multivariate analysis using cause-specific Cox model. Twenty centers reported data on 298 alloSCT recipients. The ferritin cut off point was determined at 1500 mug/l (median of measured ferritin levels). In alloSCT recipients with ferritin levels above cut off measured before the start of conditioning, overall survival (HR = 2.5, CI = 1.5-4.1, p = 0.0005) and progression-free survival (HR = 2.4, CI = 1.6-3.8, p < 0.0001) were inferior. Excess mortality in the high ferritin group was due to both higher relapse incidence (HR = 2.2, CI = 1.2-3.8, p = 0.007) and increased non-relapse mortality (NRM) (HR = 3.1, CI = 1.5-6.4, p = 0.002). NRM was driven by significantly higher infection-related mortality in the high ferritin group (HR = 3.9, CI = 1.6-9.7, p = 0.003). Acute and chronic GVHD incidence or severity were not associated to serum ferritin levels. We conclude that ferritin levels can serve as routine laboratory biomarker for mortality risk assessment before alloSCT.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",PMC7174614,['NOTNLM'],"['*biomarker', '*ferritin', '*immunology', '*iron metabolism', '*stem cell', '*transplantation']",['DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom'],"['Copyright (c) 2020 Penack, Peczynski, van der Werf, Finke, Ganser, Schoemans,', 'Pavlu, Niittyvuopio, Schroyens, Kaynar, Blau, van der Velden, Sierra, Cortelezzi,', 'Wulf, Turlure, Rovira, Ozkurt, Pascual-Cascon, Moreira, Clausen, Greinix, Duarte', 'and Basak.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 29.,"In beta-thalassaemia, anaemia results from ineffective erythropoiesis characterized by inhibition of late-stage erythroid differentiation. We earlier used luspatercept and RAP-536 protein traps for certain Smad2/3-pathway ligands to implicate Smad2/3-pathway overactivation in dysregulated erythroid differentiation associated with murine beta-thalassaemia and myelodysplasia. Importantly, luspatercept alleviates anaemia and has been shown to reduce transfusion burden in patients with beta-thalassaemia or myelodysplasia. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying luspatercept action and pSmad2/3-mediated inhibition of erythroid differentiation. In murine erythroleukemic (MEL) cells in vitro, ligand-mediated overactivation of the Smad2/3 pathway reduced nuclear levels of GATA-1 (GATA-binding factor-1) and its transcriptional activator TIF1gamma (transcription intermediary factor 1gamma), increased levels of reactive oxygen species, reduced cell viability and haemoglobin levels, and inhibited erythroid differentiation. Co-treatment with luspatercept in MEL cells partially or completely restored each of these. In beta-thalassaemic mice, RAP-536 up-regulated Gata1 and its target gene signature in erythroid precursors determined by transcriptional profiling and gene set enrichment analysis, restored nuclear levels of GATA-1 in erythroid precursors, and nuclear distribution of TIF1gamma in erythroblasts. Bone marrow cells from beta-thalassaemic mice treated with luspatercept also exhibited restored nuclear availability of GATA-1 ex vivo. Our results implicate GATA-1, and likely TIF1gamma, as key mediators of luspatercept/RAP-536 action in alleviating ineffective erythropoiesis.","['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (RAP-536)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Smad2 Protein)', '0 (Smad3 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Trim33 protein, mouse)', 'AQK7UBA1LS (luspatercept)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Activin Receptors, Type II)']",PMC7294138,,,,"['(c) 2020 Acceleron Pharma Inc.

The most common translocated genes are AFF1 (formerly AF4), MLLT3 (formerly AF9), and MLLT1 (formerly ENL). The bimodal incidence of MLL-r-ALL usually peaks in infants in their first 2 years of life and then declines thereafter during the pediatric/young adult phase until it increases again with age. MLL-rearranged ALL (MLL-r-ALL) is characterized by hyperleukocytosis, aggressive behavior with early relapse, relatively high incidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement, and poor prognosis. RECENT FINDINGS: MLL-r-ALL cells are characterized by relative resistance to corticosteroids (due to Src kinase-induced phosphorylation of annexin A2) and L-asparaginase therapy, but they are sensitive to cytarabine chemotherapy (due to increased levels of hENT1 expression).

Occurrence rates of malignant breast tumors in children are also quite low. We herein report a B-lymphoblastic lymphoma of the breast arisen in an adolescent girl. To the best of our knowledge, this is the youngest case with primary breast non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. CASE PRESENTATION: A 14-year-old Japanese girl felt a lump in her right breast and came to our hospital. A circumscribed soft mass, 30 mm in diameter, was palpable. Histological examination revealed atypical lymphoid cells diffusely spreading into the breast tissue. Based on results of immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, her disease was diagnosed as B-lymphoblastic lymphoma (stage I). She was then referred to the pediatric department and received combination chemotherapy, based on a chemotherapy regimen for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Following remission induction therapy, we confirmed no FDG uptake in the right breast on PET-CT scan. CONCLUSIONS: We have described a rare malignant lymphoma arising in the breast of an adolescent female. Histological assessment is necessary for diagnosis of breast lymphoma. However, it can be challenging with several reasons, and clinical information may contribute to the assessment. Moreover, treatments for lymphoma vary according to disease types. Thus, surgeons should collaborate closely with pathologists, pediatricians, and hematologists.",,PMC7190779,['NOTNLM'],"['B-lymphoblastic Lymphoma', 'Children', 'Primary breast lymphoma', 'Surgery']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The accurate diagnosis of HCL relies on the recognition of hairy cells by morphology and flow cytometry (FCM) in the blood and/or bone marrow (BM). The BRAF V600E mutation, an HCL-defining mutation, represents a novel diagnostic parameter and a potential therapeutic target. The precise cellular origin of HCL is a late-activated postgerminal center memory B cell. BRAF mutations were detected in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of patients with HCL, suggesting that this is an early HCL-defining event. Watch-and-wait strategy is necessary in approximately 10% of asymptomatic HCL patients, sometimes for several years. Purine analogs (PNAs) are the established first-line options for symptomatic HCL patients. In second-line treatment, chemoimmunotherapy combining PNA plus rituximab should be considered in high-risk HCL patients. The three options for relapsed/refractory HCL patients include recombinant immunoconjugates targeting CD22, BRAF inhibitors, and BCR inhibitors. The clinical interest to investigate blood minimal residual disease (MRD) was recently demonstrated, with a high risk of relapse in patients with positive testing for MRD and a low risk in patients with negative testing. However, efforts must be made to standardize MRD analyses in the near future. Patients with HCL are at risk of second malignancies. The increased risk could be related to the disease and/or the treatment, and the respective role of PNAs in the development of secondary malignancies remains a topic of debate.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxin', '*BRAF V600E mutation', '*BRAF inhibitors', '*Biology', '*Hairy cell leukemia', '*Treatment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median survival ranges from approximately 3.5 to 5.5 years; while the most frequent cause of death is the evolution to acute myeloid leukemia, also other conditions such as progression without transformation, complications due to cytopenias including infections or bleeding, and cardiovascular events may be fatal. Myelofibrosis is still orphan of curative treatments: allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), the only therapeutic approach that has clearly demonstrated an impact on disease progression, is associated with relevant morbidity and mortality and only a minority of patients is eligible for such an intensive procedure. While the discovery of the crucial role of JAK2 mutations and the consequent clinical use of JAK inhibitors has led to a dramatic improvement of symptoms control and quality of life, yet these drugs do not significantly modify the natural history of the disease. A better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis will hopefully foster the development of new targeted therapies aimed at improving MF prognosis. Herein, we review the most recent advances about JAK inhibitors and other molecules which are under investigation.","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Fedratinib', '*Momelotinib', '*Myelofibrosis', '*Pacritinib', '*Ruxolitinib', '*Target therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies showed that AEL leukemic cells often carry complex karyotypes and mutations in known AML-associated oncogenes. To better define the underlying molecular mechanisms driving the erythroid phenotype, we studied a series of 33 AEL samples representing 3 genetic AEL subgroups including TP53-mutated, epigenetic regulator-mutated (eg, DNMT3A, TET2, or IDH2), and undefined cases with low mutational burden. We established an erythroid vs myeloid transcriptome-based space in which, independently of the molecular subgroup, the majority of the AEL samples exhibited a unique mapping different from both non-M6 AML and myelodysplastic syndrome samples. Notably, >25% of AEL patients, including in the genetically undefined subgroup, showed aberrant expression of key transcriptional regulators, including SKI, ERG, and ETO2. Ectopic expression of these factors in murine erythroid progenitors blocked in vitro erythroid differentiation and led to immortalization associated with decreased chromatin accessibility at GATA1-binding sites and functional interference with GATA1 activity. In vivo models showed development of lethal erythroid, mixed erythroid/myeloid, or other malignancies depending on the cell population in which AEL-associated alterations were expressed. Collectively, our data indicate that AEL is a molecularly heterogeneous disease with an erythroid identity that results in part from the aberrant activity of key erythroid transcription factors in hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells.","['0 (CBFA2T3 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)', '126648-96-2 (SKI protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Tet2 protein, mouse)', 'Acute erythroleukemia']",PMC8215330,,,"['MR/L008963/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12009/11/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'R01 CA176647/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'MC_U137961146/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G1000729/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'R35 CA197695/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'MC_UU_00016/11/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['Blood. 2020 Aug 6;136(6):648-649.

Epub 2020 Apr 29.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is incurable, so there is a significant unmet need for effective therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory disease. This situation has not changed despite the recent approval of the anti-CD38 antibody daratumumab, one of the most potent agents in MM treatment. The efficiency of daratumumab might be improved by combining it with synergistic anti-MM agents. We therefore investigated the potential of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor ricolinostat to up-regulate CD38 on MM cells, thereby enhancing the performance of CD38-specific therapies. Using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry, we observed that ricolinostat significantly increases CD38 RNA levels and CD38 surface expression on MM cells. Super-resolution microscopy imaging of MM cells by direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy confirmed this rise with molecular resolution and revealed homogeneous distribution of CD38 molecules on the cell membrane. Particularly important is that combining ricolinostat with daratumumab induced enhanced lysis of MM cells. We also evaluated next-generation HDAC6 inhibitors (ACY-241, WT-161) and observed similar increase of CD38 levels suggesting that the upregulation of CD38 expression on MM cells by HDAC6 inhibitors is a class effect. This proof-of-concept illustrates the potential benefit of combining HDAC6 inhibitors and CD38-directed immunotherapy for MM treatment.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '4Z63YK6E0E (daratumumab)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 6)', 'WKT909C62B (ricolinostat)']",PMC8318885,,,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2022 Jan;36(1):297.

Epub 2020 Apr 29.,"Loss-of-function mutations of EZH2, the enzymatic component of PRC2, have been associated with poor outcome and chemotherapy resistance in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Using isogenic T-ALL cells, with and without CRISPR/Cas9-induced EZH2-inactivating mutations, we performed a cell-based synthetic lethal drug screen. EZH2-deficient cells exhibited increased sensitivity to structurally diverse inhibitors of CHK1, an interaction that could be validated genetically. Furthermore, small-molecule inhibition of CHK1 had efficacy in delaying tumor progression in isogenic EZH2-deficient, but not EZH2 wild-type, T-ALL cells in vivo, as well as in a primary cell model of PRC2-mutant ALL. Mechanistically, EZH2 deficiency resulted in a gene-expression signature of immature T-ALL cells, marked transcriptional upregulation of MYCN, increased replication stress, and enhanced dependency on CHK1 for cell survival. Finally, we demonstrate this phenotype is mediated through derepression of a distal PRC2-regulated MYCN enhancer. In conclusion, we highlight a novel and clinically exploitable pathway in high-risk EZH2-mutated T-ALL. SIGNIFICANCE: Loss-of-function mutations of PRC2 genes are associated with chemotherapy resistance in T-ALL, yet no specific therapy for this aggressive subtype is currently clinically available. Our work demonstrates that loss of EZH2 activity leads to MYCN-driven replication stress, resulting in increased sensitivity to CHK1 inhibition, a finding with immediate clinical relevance.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 890.","['EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)']",PMC7611258,,,"['14010/LLR_/Blood Cancer UK/United Kingdom', '17002/LLR_/Blood Cancer UK/United Kingdom', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",['(c)2020 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,['EMS128581'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Constitutive activation of STAT3 has been connected to prostate cancer malignancy, and abolishing the STAT3 activity may diminish tumor growth and metastasis. However, its suppressor genes and pathways have not been well established. In this study, we show that promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) has a putative tumor-suppressor function in prostate cancer by inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT3. Compared with a benign prostate, high-grade prostate cancer patient tissue was negatively correlated with PLZF expression. PLZF depletion accelerated proliferation and survival, migration, and invasion in human prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated a novel role of PLZF as the transcriptional regulator of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 that inhibits the oncogenic JAKs-STAT3 pathway. These results suggest that the collapse of PLZF expression by the CCL3 derived from fibroblasts accelerates the cell migration and invasion properties of prostate cancer cells. Our results suggest that increasing PLZF could be an attractive strategy for suppressing prostate cancer metastasis as well as for tumor growth.",,PMC7281005,['NOTNLM'],"['STAT3', 'promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger', 'prostate cancer', 'tumor-associated fibroblast', 'tumor-suppressor gene']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results showed that IL-22 (rs2227491) was significantly associated with the white blood cell (WBC) counts. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5B (STAT-5B) (rs6503691) showed a close relationship with the recurrent genetic abnormalities in patients with AML. We verified the negatively independent effect of age and risk of cytogenetics on overall survival (OS). More importantly, the GG genotype of IL-12A (rs6887695) showed a negative impact on AML prognosis independently. Furthermore, the relative expression of IL-12 was decreased in GG genotype, no matter under a co-dominant or recessive model. However, no correlation was observed between the SNPs mentioned above and disease susceptibility, risk stratification and survival. Our findings suggest that immunorelated gene polymorphisms are associated with prognosis in AML, which may perform as novel inspection targets for AML patients.","['0 (Interleukins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5B protein, human)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', 'XEO71E2E45 (interleukin-22)']",PMC7419888,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*disease prognosis', '*immunorelated genes', '*single nucleotide polymorphisms']",,['(c) 2020 British Society for Immunology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report a case of relapsed/refractory T-cell LGL treated with belinostat. A 57-year-old male presented with lymphocytosis and anemia and was found to have T-cell LGL, requiring frequent packed red blood cell transfusions. He was initially treated with methotrexate with no response after 7 months. He was then switched to cyclosporine and cyclophosphamide and experienced transfusion independence for 42 months before disease relapse. He was then started on belinostat with noted subsequent transfusion independence for greater than 15 months to date and decreased disease involvement on bone marrow biopsy. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of belinostat use in relapsed/refractory T-cell LGL leukemia which resulted in a durable clinical and biologic response.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'F4H96P17NZ (belinostat)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Belinostat', '*Large granular leukemia', '*T-cells']",,"['(c) 2020 S.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the burden of cardiovascular complications related to treatment with anti-BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and to determine if there are differences between the latest- and first-generation TKIs. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was carried out on 55 patients (39 men, 16 women; mean age +/- SD: 58 +/- 11 years) treated with TKIs targeting Bcr-Abl for a median period of 3.5 years. Patients were divided in two groups according to the type of treatment. Group A included patients treated with latest-generation TKI (nilotinib, dasatinib, and ponatinib), while group B included patients treated with first-generation TKI (imatinib). Cardiological evaluation included electrocardiogram, echocardiogram with global longitudinal strain of left ventricle (GLS), and carotid ultrasound scan with arterial stiffness measurement (pulse wave velocity, PWV). Adverse cardiovascular events were recorded in both groups. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed that cardiovascular adverse events (myocardial ischemia, peripheral artery disease, deep vein thrombosis, and pleural effusion) were significantly more frequent in group A than group B (p value = 0.044). Moreover, there was a significant reduction in GLS and PWV in group A when compared to group B (respectively, p = 0.03 and p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that imatinib is a relatively safe drug, while it reveals that the latest-generation TKIs may cause a burden of cardiovascular complications. GLS and PWV allow detection of early signs of cardiac and vascular toxicity in oncohematologic patients treated with TKI, and their use is advisable.","['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Arterial stiffness', 'Cardio-oncology', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,"['(c) 2020 S.

However, molecular integration of developmental signaling with MSC-intrinsic chromatin regulation remains incompletely understood. SWI/SNF-(BAF) is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler implicated in multi-cellular development. We show that BMPs and long-term osteogenic signals in MSCs selectively induce expression of polybromo BAF (PBAF) components Pbrm1, Arid2, and Brd7. Loss of Pbrm1/Arid2/Brd7 profoundly impairs osteolineage gene expression and osteogenesis without compromising adipogenesis. Pbrm1 loss attenuates MSC in vivo ossification. Mechanistically, Pbrm1/PBAF deficiency impairs Smad1/5/8 activation through locus-specific epi-genomic remodeling, involving Pbrm1 bromodomains, along with transcriptional downregulation of Bmpr/TgfbetarII affecting BMP-early-responsive gene expression. Gain of function of BmprIbeta, TgfbetarII in PBAF-deficient MSCs partly restores Smad1/5/8 activation and osteogenesis. Pbrm1 loss further affects hematopoietic stem and progenitor activity through non-cell-autonomous regulation of microenvironment and niche-factor expression. Together, these findings reveal a link illustrating epi-genomic feedforward control of BMP/TGF-beta signaling to transcriptional and cellular plasticity in the mesenchymal microenvironment and account for stromal-SWI/SNF in hematopoiesis.","['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (PBRM1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*BMP/TGF-beta signaling', '*SWI/SNF', '*bromodomain', '*chromatin remodeling', '*feedforward control', '*hematopoiesis', '*hematopoietic microenvironment', '*mesenchymal stromal cell', '*osteolineage differentiation', '*transcriptional regulation']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 The Author(s).

Methods In this cross-sectional research, 300 (167 females; age M = 53.00, SD = 27.57) cancer survivors (breast cancer, leukaemia, colorectal cancer) were recruited from oncology outpatient clinics in Iran. Participants completed measures of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), post-traumatic growth (PTG), cognitive processing, attentional biases, and autobiographical memory specificity. Results Using partial least square structural equation modelling, it was found that the proposed model was capable of predicting PTSD and PTG. Negative attentional biases were significantly associated with PTSD symptoms, but were not significantly associated with PTG. In contrast, memory specificity and positive attentional biases tended to be associated with PTG, but were not significantly associated with PTSD symptoms. Second, negative cognitive processing was significantly associated with PTSD symptoms, while positive cognitive processing was significantly associated with PTG. Finally, there was support for indirect pathways between positive cognitive tendencies and PTG through positive cognitive processing, while there were indirect pathways between negative habitual cognitive tendencies and PTSD symptoms through negative cognitive processing. Conclusions Our findings support growing evidence for differential trajectories to PTG and PTSD symptoms in cancer. Such cognitive factors may be important therapeutic targets in psycho-oncology interventions. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? The diagnosis of cancer and its subsequent treatment can result in symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Positive changes and psychosocial growth (post-traumatic growth; PTG) are also common as a result of patients' experience of cancer. What does this study add? This study identified predictors of positive (PTG) and negative trauma (PTSD) outcomes within a sample of Iranian cancer survivors (N = 300). General habitual cognitive tendencies (memory specificity, attentional biases) were associated with cognitive processing, which in turn contributed to psycho-traumatic adaption. There was support for indirect pathways between positive cognitive tendencies and PTG through positive cognitive processing, while there were indirect pathways between negative habitual cognitive tendencies and PTSD symptoms through negative cognitive processing.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*attentional bias', '*cancer', '*cognitive processing', '*memory specificity', '*trauma']",['Cognitive Sciences and Technologies Council of Iran/International'],['(c) 2020 The British Psychological Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notwithstanding, the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with isolated del(5q) remains so far the only MDS subtype defined by a genetic abnormality. Approximately half of MDS patients carry somatic mutations in spliceosome genes, with SF3B1 being the most commonly mutated one. SF3B1 mutation identifies a condition characterized by ring sideroblasts (RS), ineffective erythropoiesis, and indolent clinical course. A large body of evidence supports recognition of SF3B1-mutant MDS as a distinct nosologic entity. To further validate this notion, we interrogated the data set of the International Working Group for the Prognosis of MDS (IWG-PM). Based on the findings of our analyses, we propose the following diagnostic criteria for SF3B1-mutant MDS: (1) cytopenia as defined by standard hematologic values, (2) somatic SF3B1 mutation, (3) morphologic dysplasia (with or without RS), and (4) bone marrow blasts <5% and peripheral blood blasts <1%. Selected concomitant genetic lesions represent exclusion criteria for the proposed entity. In patients with clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance, SF3B1 mutation is almost invariably associated with subsequent development of overt MDS with RS, suggesting that this genetic lesion might provide presumptive evidence of MDS in the setting of persistent unexplained cytopenia. Diagnosis of SF3B1-mutant MDS has considerable clinical implications in terms of risk stratification and therapeutic decision making. In fact, this condition has a relatively good prognosis and may respond to luspatercept with abolishment of the transfusion requirement.","['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (SF3B1 protein, human)']",PMC7362582,,,"['R35 CA253125/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA206963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA171963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Blood. 2020 Jul 9;136(2):149-151.

Since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of two CAR T-cell therapies, axicabtagene ciloleucel and tisagenlecleucel, experience has highlighted various barriers to their broader access and use, including challenges related to manufacturing a patient-specific product, high costs and inadequate reimbursement, incomplete or nonsustained disease responses, and potential for causing life-threatening toxicities. Research on disparities, application, and practice of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can inform opportunities to address similar barriers to use of CAR T-cell therapies that are currently available as well as other cellular therapies that are expected to become available in the near future. To ensure optimal patient outcomes, these therapies should preferably be administered at centers that have experience and established quality processes and practices. We review opportunities for centers, manufacturers, payers, and policy makers to address barriers to care.

However, with most data being derived from case-control study interviews, information on the underpinning reasons for caesarean section is sparse, and evidence is conflicting. OBJECTIVES: Use clinical records compiled at the time of delivery to investigate the association between childhood ALL and caesarean delivery; examining timing in relation to labour onset, and reasons for the procedure. METHODS: Data are from the UK Childhood Cancer Study, a population-based case-control study conducted in the 1990s, when caesarean section rates were relatively low, in England, Scotland, and Wales. Children with ALL were individually matched to two controls on sex, date of birth, and region of residence. Information on mode of delivery and complications was abstracted from obstetric records. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using logistic regression models adjusted for matching variables and relevant covariates. RESULTS: Around 75% of the 1034 cases and 1914 controls were born through unassisted vaginal delivery. Caesarean delivery was as frequent in cases and controls (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.84, 1.36). No association was observed between ALL and caesarean delivery either during or before labour, with adjusted ORs of 1.08 (95% CI 0.78, 1.48) and 1.09 (95% CI 0.78, 1.53), respectively. For B-cell ALL, the ORs were 1.14 (95% CI 0.81, 1.59) for caesarean during labour and 1.21 (95% CI 0.85, 1.72) for prelabour. The underpinning reasons for caesarean delivery differed between cases and controls; with preeclampsia, although very rare, being more common amongst cases born by caesarean (OR 8.91, 95% CI 1.48, 53.42). CONCLUSIONS: Our obstetric record-based study found no significant evidence that caesarean delivery increased the risk of childhood ALL, either overall or when carried out before labour.",,PMC7216966,['NOTNLM'],"['*caesarean', '*childhood leukaemia', '*delivery', '*epidemiology']",,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Even allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation does not improve the outcome of ALL cases with some types of MLL rearrangements. The aim of the present study was to identify the co-expressed genes that related to MLL rearrangement (MLL-r) and elucidate the potential mechanisms of how MLL-r and their partner genes lead to leukemogenesis. Gene co-expression networks were constructed using the gene expression data and sample traits of 204 pretreated pediatric ALL patients, and co-expression modules significantly related to the MLL-r were screened out. Gene ontology annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis of the module genes were performed. Hub genes were identified and their expression levels were analyzed in samples with or without MLL-r and the results were validated by an independent investigation. Furthermore, the relationships between the hub genes and sample traits were analyzed. In total, 21 co-expression modules were identified. The green module was positively correlated with MLL-r. PROM1, LGALS1, CD44, FUT4 and HOXA10 were identified as hub genes, which were involved in focal adhesion, calcium-dependent phospholipid binding, connective tissue development and transcriptional misregulation in cancer.

METHODS: The expressions of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 and dimethylation of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha at lysine 55 in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines and human normal bone marrow mononuclear cells (as control) were assessed. Control CRISPR-Cas9 lentivirus, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 knockout CRISPR-Cas9 lentivirus, vector plasmid, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 wild type overexpression plasmid, and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 with a K55R substitution overexpression plasmid were transfected into AML-193 and Kasumi-1 cells combined or alone, and were accordingly divided into 4 groups (Sgcontrol + vector group, SgeEF1A2 + vector group, SgeEF1A2 + eEF1A2WT group, and SgeEFIA2 + eEF1A2K55R group). RESULTS: Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 and dimethylation of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha at lysine 55 expressions were higher in AML-193, Kasumi-1, and KG-1 cell lines compared to the control. In AML-193 and Kasumi-1 cells, the knockout and compensated experiments revealed that eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 promoted cell proliferation and migration but repressed apoptosis. Additionally, the knockout of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 decreased dimethylation of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha at lysine 55 expression, meanwhile, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 wild type overexpression enhanced while eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 with a K55R substitution overexpression did not influence the dimethylation of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha at lysine 55 expression. Furthermore, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 wild type overexpression promoted cell proliferation, enhanced migration, and decreased apoptosis, but eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 with a K55R substitution overexpression did not influence these cellular functions in AML-193 and Kasumi-1 cells, suggesting the implication of dimethylation of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha at lysine 55 in eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 mediated oncogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSION: Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 and its dimethylated product may serve as therapeutic targets, and these findings may provide support for exploring novel strategies in acute myeloid leukemia treatment.","['0 (EEF1A1 protein, human)', '0 (EEF1A2 protein, human)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factor 1)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",PMC7225831,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*cell migration', '*cell proliferation', '*dimethylation of eEF1A at lysine 55', '*eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In a cross-sectional, retrospective, single-center study, we assessed 25 relapse-free long-term survivors (median age at SCT: 11 +/- 4.9 years; median time between SCT and testing: 8.25 years, 19 males) using a reduced version of the pediatric-modified total neuropathy score for clinical assessment and Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST). INCLUSION CRITERIA: [Formula: see text] 6 years old at testing, [Formula: see text] 18 years old at time of SCT, [Formula: see text] 1 year between SCT and testing. RESULTS: Nine patients (36%) had peripheral neuropathy as defined by the clinical red-pmTNS (>/= 4). The QST parameters mechanical pain sensitivity, mechanical detection threshold, thermal sensory limen, vibration detection threshold and pressure pain threshold were significantly abnormal in the survivor cohort (p < 0.0038). Except for one, all survivors showed at least one abnormal QST parameter. When using QST, signs of small and large fiber dysfunction were present in 22 (88%) and 17 (68%) survivors, respectively. More than half of all survivors were found to experience pathologic sensitization to pain.

In the present study, we analyzed the mRNA expression of B7-H3 in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and validated its expression across multiple cancer types. We then generated a novel B7-H3-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and tested its antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo. The B7-H3 expression heterogeneity and variation were frequent. Moderate or even high expression levels of B7-H3 were also observed in some tumor-adjacent tissues, but the staining intensity was weaker than that in tumor tissues. B7-H3 expression was absent or very low in normal tissues and organs. Flow cytometry indicated that the mean expression level of B7-H3 in eight bone marrow specimens from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was 57.2% (range 38.8-80.4). Furthermore, we showed that the B7-H3-targeted CAR-T cells exhibited significant antitumor activity against AML and melanoma in vitro and in xenograft mouse models. In conclusion, although B7-H3 represents a promising pan-cancer target, and B7-H3-redirected CAR-T cells can effectively control tumor growth, the expression heterogeneity and variation have to be carefully considered in translating B7-H3-targeted CAR-T cell therapy into clinical practice.",,PMC7178328,['NOTNLM'],"['B7-H3', 'CAR-T', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'melanoma']",,['(c) 2020 The Author(s).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A prompt clearance of these apoptotic cells and debris by phagocytic cells, a process known as efferocytosis, is important in maintaining tissue homeostasis. Accordingly, impaired efferocytosis due to the defective clearance and disrupted stages can lead to a growing number of inflammation- and immune-related diseases. Although numerous studies have shown the mechanisms of efferocytosis, its role in disorders, such as non-tumor and tumor diseases, remains poorly understood. This review summarizes the processes and signal molecules in efferocytosis, and efferocytosis-related functions in non-tumor (e.g., atherosclerosis, lung diseases) and tumor diseases (e.g., breast cancer, prostate cancer), as well as describes the role of involved cytokines. Of note, there is a dual role of efferocytosis in the abovementioned disorders, and a paradoxical effect among non-tumor and tumor diseases in terms of inflammation resolution, immune response, and disease progression. Briefly, intact efferocytosis and cytokines promote tissue repair, while they contribute to tumor progression via the tumor microenvironment and macrophage politzerization. Additionally, this review provides potential targets associated with TAM (TYRO3, AXL, MERTK) receptors and cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and CXCL5, suggesting potential novel therapeutic ways in treating diseases.",,PMC7186127,['NOTNLM'],"['atherosclerosis', 'breast cancer', 'cytokine', 'efferocytosis', 'inflammation', 'leukemia', 'lung disease', 'prostate cancer', 'target', 'tumor']",,['(c) 2020 The Author(s).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notch signaling governs many steps of T cell development and its dysregulation represents the most common causative event in the pathogenesis of T-ALL. The activation of canonical NF-kappaB pathway has been described as a critical downstream mediator of Notch oncogenic functions, through the sustaining of tumor cell survival and growth. The potential role of Notch/NF-kappaB partnership is also emerging in the generation and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the context of cancer. However, little is known about the effects of combined mutations of Notch and NF-kappaB in regulating immune-environment and progression of T-ALL. To shed light on the topics above we generated double-mutant mice, harboring conventional knock-out mutation of NF-kappaB1/p50 on the genetic background of a transgenic model of Notch-dependent T-ALL. The immunophenotyping of double-mutant mice demonstrates that NF-kappaB1 deletion inhibits the progression of T-ALL and strongly modifies immune-environment of the disease. Double-mutant mice display indeed a dramatic reduction of pre-leukemic CD4(+)CD8(+) (DP) T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) and, concurrently, the rising of an aggressive myeloproliferative trait with a massive expansion of CD11b(+)Gr-1(+) cells in the periphery, and an accumulation of the granulocyte/monocyte progenitors in the bone-marrow. Interestingly, double-mutant T cells are able to improve the growth of CD11b(+)Gr-1(+) cells in vitro, and, more importantly, the in vivo depletion of T cells in double-mutant mice significantly reduces the expansion of myeloid compartment. Our results strongly suggest that the myeloproliferative trait observed in double-mutant mice may depend on non-cell-autonomous mechanism/s driven by T cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that the reduction of CD4(+)CD8(+) (DP) T cells and Tregs in double-mutant mice relies on a significant enhancement of their apoptotic rate. In conclusion, double-mutant mice may represent a useful model to deepen the knowledge of the consequences on T-ALL immune-environment of modulating Notch/NF-kappaB relationships in tumor cells. More importantly, information derived from these studies may help in the refinement of multitarget therapies for the disease.","['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)']",PMC7169422,['NOTNLM'],"['*NF-kappaB1', '*Notch', '*T-ALL', '*Tregs', '*myeloproliferation', '*tumor environment']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Grazioli, Orlando, Giordano, Noce, Peruzzi, Scafetta,', 'Screpanti and Campese.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 28.,"The Activation-Induced Cell Death (AICD) is a stimulation-dependent form of apoptosis used by the organism to shutdown T-cell response once the source of inflammation has been eliminated, while allowing the generation of immune memory. AICD is thought to progress through the activation of the extrinsic Fas/FasL pathway of cell death, leading to cytochrome-C release through caspase-8 and Bid activation. We recently described that, early upon AICD induction, mitochondria undergo structural alterations, which are required to promote cytochrome-C release and execute cell death. Here, we found that such alterations do not depend on the Fas/FasL pathway, which is instead only lately activated to amplify the cell death cascade. Instead, such alterations are primarily dependent on the MAPK proteins JNK1 and ERK1/2, which, in turn, regulate the activity of the pro-fission protein Drp1 and the pro-apoptotic factor Bim. The latter regulates cristae disassembly and cooperate with Drp1 to mediate the Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization (MOMP), leading to cytochrome-C release. Interestingly, we found that Bim is also downregulated in T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) cells, this alteration favouring their escape from AICD-mediated control.","['EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.6.5.5 (DNM1L protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.5 (Dynamins)']",PMC7492225,,,,,,,,['Cell Death Differ. 2020 Jul 20;:.

Furthermore, abnormally processed RNAs can cause a variety of diseases, including obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. Especially in cancer development, aberrant RNAs caused by deregulated RNA modifiers or regulators are related to progression. Accumulating evidence has reported that aberrant RNAs promote carcinogenesis in many cancers, including liver cancer, leukemia, melanoma, lung cancer, breast cancer, and other cancers, in which abnormal RNA processing occurs in normal cells. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the precise roles and mechanisms of disease-related RNA processing in various cancers for the development of therapeutic interventions. In this review, the underlying mechanisms of variations in the RNA life cycle and the biological impacts of RNA variations on carcinogenesis will be discussed, and therapeutic strategies for the treatment of tumor malignancies will be provided.

We investigated and compared the epigenetic and genetic landscape of adult and pediatric T-ALL (n = 77) and T-LBL (n = 15) patient samples by high-resolution genome-wide DNA methylation and Copy Number Variation (CNV) BeadChip arrays. DNA methylation profiling identified the presence of CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) subgroups within both pediatric and adult T-LBL and T-ALL. An epigenetic signature of 128 differentially methylated CpG sites was identified, that clustered T-LBL and T-ALL separately. The most significant differentially methylated gene loci included the SGCE/PEG10 shared promoter region, previously implicated in lymphoid malignancies. CNV analysis confirmed overlapping recurrent aberrations between T-ALL and T-LBL, including 9p21.3 (CDKN2A/CDKN2B) deletions. A significantly higher frequency of chromosome 13q14.2 deletions was identified in T-LBL samples (36% in T-LBL vs. 0% in T-ALL). This deletion, encompassing the RB1, MIR15A and MIR16-1 gene loci, has been reported as a recurrent deletion in B-cell malignancies. Our study reveals epigenetic and genetic markers that can distinguish between T-LBL and T-ALL, and deepen the understanding of the biology underlying the diverse disease localization.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",PMC7188684,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that MLL1, which is induced in dorsal horn neuron after spinal nerve ligation (SNL), is responsible for mechanical allodynia and increased H3K4me3 at metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) promoter. Moreover, SNL induced WD (Trp-Asp) repeat domain 5 subunit (WDR5) expression as well as the MLL1-WDR5 interaction accompany with H3K4me3 enrichment and transcription of mGluR5 gene in the dorsal horn in neuropathic allodynia progression. Conversely, WDR5-0103, a novel inhibitor of the MLL1-WDR5 interaction, reversed SNL-induced allodynia and inhibited SNL-enhanced mGluR5 transcription/expression as well as MLL1, WDR5, and H3K4me3 at the mGluR5 promoter in the dorsal horn. Furthermore, disrupting the expression of MLL1 or WDR5 using small interfering RNA attenuated mechanical allodynia and reversed protein transcription/expression and complex localizing at mGluR5 promoter in the dorsal horn induced by SNL. This finding revealed that MLL1-WDR5 complex integrity regulates MLL1 and WDR5 recruitment to H3K4me3 enrichment at mGluR5 promoter in the dorsal horn underlying neuropathic allodynia. Collectively, our findings indicated that SNL enhances the MLL1-WDR5 complex, which facilitates MLL1 and WDR5 recruitment to H3K4me3 enrichment at mGluR5 promoter in spinal plasticity contributing to neuropathic allodynia pathogenesis.","['0 (Histones)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Metabotropic Glutamate 5)', '0 (WDR5 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2020 International Association for the Study of Pain.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 28.,"As the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic spreads and the number of Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi)-treated COVID-19-affected patients grows, we must consider the pros and cons of BTKi discontinuation for our patients. In favor of BTKi continuation, BTK plays an active role in macrophage polarization. By modulating key transcription factors, BTK may regulate macrophage polarization downstream of classic M1 and M2 polarizing stimuli and mitigate the hyperinflammatory state associated with COVID-19. In favor of BTKi discontinuation, we note a potentially increased risk of secondary infections and impaired humoral immunity. We hypothesize that the potential benefit of blunting a hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 through attenuation of M1 polarization outweighs the potential risk of impaired humoral immunity, not to mention the risk of rapid progression of B-cell malignancy following BTKi interruption. On the basis of this, we suggest continuing BTKi in patients with COVID-19.","['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'AG9MHG098Z (zanubrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'I42748ELQW (acalabrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",PMC7367762,,,['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['(c)2020 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,['NIHMS1589949'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both primary and therapy-related hematopoietic malignancies with LFS are associated with dismal outcomes with standard therapies and even allogenic stem cell transplantation (SCT). CASE PRESENTATION: We reported a relapsed/refractory acute B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (B-LBL) patient in the context of LFS. He was identified to harbor a TP53 c.818G>A (p.R273H) germline mutation, and his family history was significant for rectal carcinoma in his father, an unknown cancer in his sister and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in his brother and one of his sons. The patient received murine monoclonal anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell ""cocktail"" therapy and achieved complete remission with negative minimal residual disease (MRD), as assessed by morphology and multiparameter flow cytometry. Fifteen months after murine monoclonal CAR T-cell ""cocktail"" therapy, the patient's B-LBL recurred. Fortunately, a round of fully human monoclonal anti-CD22 CAR T-cell therapy was still effective in this patient, and he achieved CR again and continued to be followed. Each time after infusion, the CAR T-cells underwent extremely rapid exponential expansion, which may be due to the disruption of TP53, a gene that can functionally control cell cycle arrest. Grade 4 and grade 1 cytokine release syndrome occurred after the first and second rounds of CAR T-cell therapy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This case provides the first report of the use of CAR T-cell therapy in a hematologic malignancy patient with LFS. As traditional chemotherapy and allogenic SCT are not effective therapy strategies for patients with hematologic malignancies and LFS, CAR T-cell therapy may be an alternate choice.ChiCTR-OPN-16008526 and ChiCTR1900023922.","['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",PMC7213909,['NOTNLM'],"['*haematology', '*immunotherapy']",,"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

The rise of apoptosis in transfected human monocuclear cells (MNCs) was significant as well, but the unspecific miRNA control induced apoptosis in MNCs to a similar extend.

Outbreaks of keratoconjunctivitis are problematic to human health, especially for infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. However, the development of anti-HAdV drugs has been hampered by inconvenient screening systems; therefore, development of a simple screening method is highly desirable. In this study, we identified that HAdV-19 can infect a human lymphoid cell line transformed with human T-cell leukemia virus (MT-2 cells). MT-2 cells supported HAdV-19 replication and showed apparent cytopathic effects within five days post-infection. Using a thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT)-based colorimetric assay on MT-2 cells, we were able to detect the anti-HAdV-19 activities of previously reported nucleoside/tide compounds, including (S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine (cidofovir), 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (zalcitabine) and 3'-deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine (trifluridine).

Siderophores help to transport iron. Type 2-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (BDH2) is a rate-limiting factor in the biogenesis of siderophores. Using qRT-PCR, we analyze BDH2mRNA expression in the bone marrow (BM) of 187 MDS patients, 119 de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, and 43 lymphoma patients with normal BM. Elevated BDH2mRNA expression in BM is observed in MDS patients (n = 187 vs. 43, normal BM; P = 0.009), and this is related to ferritin levels. Patients with higher BDH2 expression show a greater risk of leukemia progression (15.25% vs. 3.77%, lower expression; P = 0.017) and shorter leukemia-free-survival (medium LFS, 9 years vs. 7 years; P = 0.024), as do patients with a ferritin level >/=350 ng/mL. Additionally, we investigate the mechanisms related to the prognostic ability of BDH2 by using BDH2-KD THP1. The cell cycle analysis, surface markers, and special stain studies indicate that BDH2-KD induces differentiation and decreases the growth rate of THP1 cells, which is associated with the retardation of the cell cycle. Moreover, many genes, including genes related to mitochondrial catabolism, oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and genes related to cell differentiation and proliferation influence BDH2-KD THP1 cells. Herein, we demonstrate that BDH2 is involved in cell cycle arrest and the inhibition of differentiation in malignant cells. Furthermore, the high BDH2 expression in MDS patients could be suggestive of a poor prognostic factor.

A close correlation between RASopathy gene mutations and spontaneous in vitro myeloid colony (CFU-GM) growth in CMML has been described. Molecular and/or functional analyses were performed in three cohorts of 337 CMML patients: in patients without (A, n = 236) and with (B, n = 61) progression/transformation during follow-up, and in patients already transformed at the time of sampling (C, n = 40 + 26 who were before in B). The frequencies of RAS-pathway mutations (variant allele frequency >/= 20%) in cohorts A, B, and C were 30%, 47%, and 71% (p < 0.0001), and of high colony growth (>/=20/10(5) peripheral blood mononuclear cells) 31%, 44%, and 80% (p < 0.0001), respectively. Increases in allele burden of RAS-pathway mutations and in numbers of spontaneously formed CFU-GM before and after transformation could be shown in individual patients. Finally, the presence of mutations in RASopathy genes as well as the presence of high colony growth prior to transformation was significantly associated with an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) development. Together, RAS-pathway mutations in CMML correlate with an augmented autonomous expansion of neoplastic precursor cells and indicate an increased risk of AML development which may be relevant for targeted treatment strategies.",['EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)'],PMC7215883,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CFU-GM', 'CMML', 'RAS-pathway mutations']","['F4704-B20/Austrian Science Fund', '1/CX/CSRD VA/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MTX targets the folate metabolic pathway (FMP). Abnormal function of the enzymes in FMP, due to genetic aberrations, leads to adverse drug reactions. The aim of this study was to investigate variants in pharmacogenes involved in FMP and their association with MTX pharmacokinetics (MTX elimination profile) and toxicity in the consolidation therapy phase of pediatric ALL patients. Eleven variants in the thymidylate synthetase (TYMS), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), SLC19A1 and SLCO1B genes were analyzed in 148 patients, using PCR- and sequencing-based methodology. For the Serbian and European control groups, data on allele frequency distribution were extracted from in-house and public databases. Our results show that the A allele of SLC19A1 c.80 variant contributes to slow MTX elimination. Additionally, the AA genotype of the same variant is a predictor of MTX-related hepatotoxicity. Patients homozygous for TYMS 6bp deletion were more likely to experience gastrointestinal toxicity. No allele frequency dissimilarity was found for the analyzed variants between Serbian and European populations. Statistical modelling did not show a joint effect of analyzed variants. Our results indicate that SLC19A1 c.80 variant and TYMS 6bp deletion are the most promising pharmacogenomic markers of MTX response in pediatric ALL patients.","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",PMC7230684,['NOTNLM'],"['*drug-related toxicity', '*methotrexate', '*pediatric ALL', '*pharmacogenomics', '*pharmacokinetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The functional connection between oxidation and the intracellular signaling machinery still remains to be investigated. In the last decade, several studies have highlighted the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as modulators directly targeting kinases, phosphatases, and downstream modulators, or indirectly acting on cysteine residues on kinases/phosphatases resulting in protein conformational changes with modulation of intracellular signaling pathway(s). Translational studies have revealed the important link between oxidation and signal transduction pathways in hematological disorders. The intricate nature of intracellular signal transduction mechanisms, based on the generation of complex networks of different types of signaling proteins, revealed the novel and important role of phosphatases together with kinases in disease mechanisms. Thus, therapeutic approaches to abnormal signal transduction pathways should consider either inhibition of overactivated/accumulated kinases or homeostatic signaling resetting through the activation of phosphatases.

Lack of mechanistic insight into NUP98-fusion-dependent oncogenic transformation has so far precluded the development of rational targeted therapies. We reasoned that different NUP98-fusion proteins deregulate a common set of transcriptional targets that might be exploitable for therapy. To decipher transcriptional programs controlled by diverse NUP98-fusion proteins, we developed mouse models for regulatable expression of NUP98/NSD1, NUP98/JARID1A, and NUP98/DDX10. By integrating chromatin occupancy profiles of NUP98-fusion proteins with transcriptome profiling upon acute fusion protein inactivation in vivo, we defined the core set of direct transcriptional targets of NUP98-fusion proteins. Among those, CDK6 was highly expressed in murine and human AML samples. Loss of CDK6 severely attenuated NUP98-fusion-driven leukemogenesis, and NUP98-fusion AML was sensitive to pharmacologic CDK6 inhibition in vitro and in vivo.

The mechanisms regulating telomere-homeostasis in ALT cells remain unclear. We report that a replication initiator protein, Origin Recognition Complex-Associated (ORCA/LRWD1), by localizing at the ALT-telomeres, modulates HR activity. ORCA's localization to the ALT-telomeres is facilitated by its interaction to SUMOylated shelterin components. The loss of ORCA in ALT-positive cells elevates the levels of two mediators of HR, RPA and RAD51, and consistent with this, we observe increased ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia body formation and telomere sister chromatid exchange. ORCA binds to RPA and modulates the association of RPA to telomeres. Finally, the loss of ORCA causes global chromatin decondensation, including at the telomeres.

Electron microscopy and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy confirmed that there were clear differences between controls and DNR-treated groups, with the resultant models having excellent predictive and discriminative abilities. Four metabolites meeting the biomarker requirements were identified. KEGG analyses revealed that these biomarkers were associated with the metabolism of fat, choline, and glucose.

METHOD: A phenomenological individual interview study based on one open-ended question. The participants (n = 12) had previously been treated for AL and were recruited from an ongoing peer support feasibility study. The interviews were carried out prior to participation as a peer support provider. A phenomenological methodology developed by Amadeo Giorgi was used for the analysis of the data. RESULTS: The essence of the phenomenon can be characterized by the following characteristics: ""A wish to move on with life"", ""A wish to instill hope to those in a hopeless situation"" and ""Expecting own course of disease to become meaningful"". The motivation reflected the experience that when helping others they also helped themselves. CONCLUSION: Former patients treated for AL are motivated to undertake their new role as PSP because their own course of disease becomes meaningful, helps facilitate a better post-cancer recovery through greater self-confidence while instilling hope to newly diagnosed patients with AL. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: It is important to identify readiness before recruiting former patients for the PSP role and to develop peer-to-peer programs to sustain motivation. Future studies should examine how motivation changes over time while practicing as a PSP to newly diagnosed patient with AL.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Motivation', 'Peer support', 'Phenomenology', 'Social support', 'Volunteering']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2020 Apr 3.,"PURPOSE: Arthrocentesis is a common treatment for temporomandibular joint disorders. Although modifications of the standard double-puncture technique have been described, no consensus has been reached regarding which is the best. The aim of the present study was to compare the outcomes of the single- and double-puncture arthrocentesis techniques (SPT and DPT, respectively). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review following the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) guidelines was performed. Two independent reviewers conducted electronic searches in the MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases for relevant studies reported up to January 2019. Studies comparing type I SPT (only 1 cannula) or type II SPT (2 soldered cannulas) to conventional DPT were considered. Data regarding the maximal mouth opening (MMO), joint pain, and operative time were extracted for the meta-analysis. In the case of statistically significant heterogeneity (P < .10), a random effects model was used to assess the significance of the treatment effects. Otherwise, a fixed effects model was used. The included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were assessed for methodologic quality using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. RESULTS: Nine studies were included for qualitative synthesis. Two were suitable for quantitative synthesis per outcome. The meta-analysis did not find any differences between SPT and DPT in relation to the MMO. However, in relation to joint pain, the results slightly favored the use of DPT. No differences in operative time were found between type I SPT and DPT (P = .49). CONCLUSIONS: The present study found no differences between the SPT and DPT in relation to the MMO, and no difference was found in operative time between the DPT and type I SPT. Because of the heterogeneity between studies, it might be interesting to conduct more homogeneous RCTs to elucidate which technique results in better clinical outcomes.",,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The resulting chimeric oncoproteins retain the phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat motifs of the NUP moiety that mediate interaction with the nuclear export receptor Crm1. NUP fusion leukemias are characterized by HOXA gene upregulation; however, their molecular pathogenesis remains poorly understood. To investigate the role of Crm1 in mediating the leukemogenic properties of NUP chimeric proteins, we took advantage of the Sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1)-NUP214 fusion. SQSTM1-NUP214 retains only a short C-terminal portion of NUP214 which contains FG motifs that mediate interaction with Crm1. We introduced point mutations targeting these FG motifs and found that the ability of the resulting SQSTM1-NUP214FGmut protein to interact with Crm1 was reduced by more than 50% compared with SQSTM1-NUP214. Mutation of FG motifs affected transforming potential: while SQSTM1-NUP214 impaired myeloid maturation and conferred robust colony formation to transduced hematopoietic progenitors in a serial replating assay, the effect of SQSTM1-NUP214FGmut was considerably diminished. Moreover, SQSTM1-NUP214 caused myeloid leukemia in all transplanted mice, whereas none of the SQSTM1-NUP214FGmut reconstituted mice developed leukemia. These oncogenic effects coincided with the ability of SQSTM1-NUP214 and SQSTM1-NUP214FGmut to upregulate the expression of Hoxa and Meis1 genes in hematopoietic progenitors. Indeed, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that impaired SQSTM1-NUP214 interaction with Crm1 correlated with impaired binding of the fusion protein to Hoxa and Meis1 genes. These findings highlight the importance of Crm1 in mediating the leukemogenic properties of SQSTM1-NUP214, and suggest a conserved role of Crm1 in recruiting oncoproteins to their effector genes.","['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nup214 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Sequestosome-1 Protein)', '0 (Sqstm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)', '157907-48-7 (HoxA protein)']",PMC7188244,,,['T32 HL007057/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 28.,"PURPOSE: To determine whether dexrazoxane provides effective cardioprotection during frontline treatment of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) without increasing relapse risk or noncardiac toxicities of the chemotherapy regimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter study of all pediatric patients with AML without high allelic ratio FLT3/ITD treated in the Children's Oncology Group trial AAML1031 between 2011 and 2016. Median follow-up was 3.5 years. Dexrazoxane was administered at the discretion of treating physicians and documented at each course. Ejection fraction (EF) and shortening fraction (SF) were recorded after each course and at regular intervals in follow-up. Per protocol, anthracyclines were to be withheld if there was evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) defined as SF < 28% or EF < 55%. Occurrence of LVSD, trends in EF and SF, 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), and treatment-related mortality (TRM) were compared by dexrazoxane exposure. RESULTS: A total of 1,014 patients were included in the analyses; 96 were exposed to dexrazoxane at every anthracycline course, and 918 were never exposed. Distributions of sex, age, race, presenting WBC count, risk group, treatment arm, and compliance with cardiac monitoring were similar for dexrazoxane-exposed and -unexposed patients. Dexrazoxane-exposed patients had significantly smaller EF and SF declines than unexposed patients across courses and a lower risk for LVSD (26.5% v 42.2%; hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.86; P = .009). Dexrazoxane-exposed patients had similar 5-year EFS (49.0% v 45.1%; P = .534) and OS (65.0% v 61.9%; P = .613) to those unexposed; however, there was a suggestion of lower TRM with dexrazoxane (5.7% v 12.7%; P = .068). CONCLUSION: Dexrazoxane preserved cardiac function without compromising EFS and OS or increasing noncardiac toxicities.

Epub 2020 May 19.,"Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an essential component of potentially curative therapy for patients with hematologic malignancies. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous (auto) stem cell rescue is used to overcome chemoresistance in multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Alternatively, poor-risk acute leukemias rely on the graft versus leukemia effect of allogeneic (allo) products. Long-term remissions are feasible with both auto- and allo-HCT; however, disease relapse is the leading cause of death after HCT for many patients. In recognition of this, novel therapies are being investigated in the upfront, relapsed/refractory, and post-HCT maintenance settings to deepen response and maintain disease control. To date, the most robust data to support this approach are in multiple myeloma, where post-transplant maintenance therapy has improved clinical outcomes. In Hodgkin lymphoma, patients with high-risk features may benefit from post-auto-HCT vedotin (BV) regardless of pre-HCT BV exposure. Apart from mantle cell lymphoma, where rituximab maintenance is generally accepted, post-auto-HCT maintenance in other forms of NHL is less established. In patients who undergo allo-HCT, the utilization of maintenance therapy is an important component of improving post-HCT outcomes, however, an individualized approach that considers patient factors such as residual toxicity from HCT, an immature graft with poor graft function, infection, and graft-versus-host disease create a complex environment for aggressive interventions. Initiation of directed agents in patients with identified mutations prior to allo-HCT, including FLT3 in acute myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome in acute lymphoid leukemia have generally improved post-HCT outcomes. Ongoing studies are exploring the safety and efficacy of additional maintenance strategies post-allo-HCT in an effort to further improve post-HCT outcomes.",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*multiple myeloma', '*post-transplant maintenance']",,"['(c) 2020 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a case of PCL to demonstrate the clonal evolution, resulting in disease relapse after achieving complete remission, and its aggressive nature of the disease, leading to poor clinical outcome. CASE REPORT: A 69-year-old man presented with a three-day-history of worsening generalized body weakness, poor oral intake, nausea, significant loss of weight and lower back pain. He was diagnosed as primary PCL, based on hypercalcaemia, renal insufficiency, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, lytic bone lesions, 24% abnormal plasma cells in peripheral blood, immunophenotype of clonal plasma cells which were positive for CD38, CD138 and CD56 markers with kappa light chain restriction, 49% abnormal plasma cells in bone marrow, monoclonal paraprotein (IgG kappa) in serum and urine, and positive IGH rearrangement (Fluorescence in-situ hybridisation, FISH). He achieved complete remission after four cycles of Bortezomib-based therapy. There was a plan for high-dose therapy plus autologous haematopoietic cell transplantation. A month later, the disease relapsed, as evidenced by 94% abnormal plasma cells in his bone marrow aspirate, complex karyotype and abnormal FISH results. He passed away a few days later, from severe septicaemia. Time-to-progression of disease was 1 month and overall survival was 5 months.

Peripheral smear and bone marrow aspirate exhibited unusually large and bizarre-looking abnormal cells which were found to be myeloblasts with aberrant CD56 and CD2 expression on immunophenotyping. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed an extra RARA gene rearrangement. This finding correlated well with a near-tetraploid karyotype with double t(15;17)(q22;q21). Bcr-3 type PML/ RARA copies were identified in reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The diagnosis of near-tetraploid acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APML) was established. The patient was treated with all-trans retinoic acid and idarubicin and six weeks later achieved complete remission. Tetraploid/ near-tetraploid APML is exceedingly rare. It is a distinct cytogenetic subgroup with unique clinical and biological features as highlighted by atypical morphology, frequent CD2 expression and association with the bcr-3 type PML/RARA fusion transcripts.

Many subtypes remain without targeted therapy, and therefore the mainstay of treatment remains generic cytotoxic drugs with bone marrow transplant the sole definitive option. In this review, we will focus on cellular mechanisms which have the potential for therapeutic exploitation to specifically target and treat this devastating disease. We will bring together the disciplines of autophagy and extracellular vesicles, exploring how the dysregulation of these mechanisms can lead to changes in the leukaemic microenvironment and the subsequent propagation of disease.

Epub 2020 Apr 28.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are needed by almost every acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patient undergoing induction chemotherapy and constitute a cornerstone in supportive measures for cancer patients in general. Randomized controlled trials have shown non-inferiority or even superiority of restrictive transfusion guidelines over liberal transfusion guidelines in specific clinical situations outside of medical oncology. In this study, we analysed whether more restrictive RBC transfusion reduces blood use without affecting hard outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 352 AML patients diagnosed between 2007 and 2018 and undergoing intensive induction chemotherapy were included in this retrospective analysis. In the less restrictive transfusion group, patients received RBC transfusion for haemoglobin levels below 8 g/dl (2007-2014). In the restrictive transfusion group, patients received RBC transfusion for haemoglobin levels below 7 g/dl (2016-2018). Liberal transfusion triggers were never endorsed. RESULTS: A total of 268 (76.1%) and 84 (23.9%) AML patients fell into the less restrictive and restrictive transfusion groups, respectively. The less restrictive transfusion group had 1 g/dl higher mean haemoglobin levels, received their first RBC transfusions earlier and needed 1.5 more units of RBC during the hospital stay of induction chemotherapy. Febrile episodes, C-reactive protein levels, admission to the intensive care unit, length of hospital stay as well as response and survival rates did not differ between the two cohorts. CONCLUSION: From our retrospective analysis, we conclude that a more restrictive transfusion trigger does not affect important outcomes of AML patients. The opportunity to test possible effects of the more severe anaemia in the restrictive transfusion group on quality of life was missed.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['RBC', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'induction chemotherapy', 'transfusion']",,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Epub 2020 Apr 27.,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic stem cell disease caused by abnormal DNA replication of bone marrow stem cells and chemotherapy resistance is a major obstacle to the effective treatment of patients with CML. Imatinib (IM), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is a first-line drug clinically used for CML. Mounting evidence has indicated that the dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is associated with the chemoresistance of CML. In this study, miR-153-3p, which had been implicated with numerous types of tumors, was identified to be downregulated in IM-resistant CML cells. Upregulation of miR-153-3p significantly increased IM sensitivity and decreased the survival rate of IM-resistant CML cells, whereas downregulation of miR-153-3p attenuated these effects in IM-resistant CML cells. Upregulated miR-153-3p could decrease the autophagy caused by IM in IM-resistant CML cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed that Bcl-2 is a direct target of miR-153-3p. Bcl-2 restoration reversed the increased sensitivity to IM induced by miR-153-3p-mimic transfection in IM-resistant CML cells. The results of the present study showed that dysregulated miR-153-3p may target Bcl-2 to promote the development of IM resistance and attenuate IM-induced apoptosis in CML. Therefore, miR-153-3p upregulation combined with IM treatment may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with low sensitivity.","['0 (MIRN153 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Autophagy', 'Bcl-2', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Imatinib', 'miR-153-3p']",['2018A030310299/Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both the dynamics of blebbing and the connection to nuclear pore biogenesis remain poorly understood. We employ a proteomics-based approach to identify myeloid leukemia factor 2 (MLF2) as a luminal component of the bleb. Using an MLF2-based live-cell imaging platform, we demonstrate that nuclear envelope blebbing occurs rapidly and synchronously immediately after nuclear envelope reformation during mitosis. Bleb formation is independent of ubiquitin conjugation within the bleb, but strictly dependent on POM121, a transmembrane nucleoporin essential for interphase nuclear pore biogenesis.

ALL can develop in either B or T lymphocytes, but B-lineage ALL (B-ALL) exceeds T-ALL clinically. As for other cancers, animal models allow study of the molecular mechanisms driving ALL. Several zebrafish (Danio rerio) T-ALL models have been reported, but until recently, robust D. rerio B-ALL models were not described. Then, D. rerio B-ALL was discovered in two related zebrafish transgenic lines; both were already known to develop T-ALL. Here, we report new B-ALL findings in one of these models, fish expressing transgenic human MYC (hMYC). We describe B-ALL incidence in a large cohort of hMYC fish, and show B-ALL in two new lines where T-ALL does not interfere with B-ALL detection. We also demonstrate B-ALL responses to steroid and radiation treatments, which effect ALL remissions, but are usually followed by prompt relapses. Finally, we report gene expression in zebrafish B lymphocytes and B-ALL, in both bulk samples and single B- and T-ALL cells. Using these gene expression profiles, we compare differences between the two new D. rerio B-ALL models, which are both driven by transgenic mammalian MYC oncoproteins.

Genes contributing to neurogenesis, dendritic development and synaptogenesis organize neural elements into networks known as the connectome. We hypothesized that NDD in CHD may be attributable to genes altering both neural connectivity and cardiac patterning. To assess the contribution of de novo variants (DNVs) in connectome genes, we annotated 229 published NDD genes for connectome status and analyzed data from 3,684 CHD subjects and 1,789 controls for connectome gene mutations.

When removing three known syndromic CHD genes, the findings remained significant (OR = 3.69, 95%CI:2.02-6.73, Fisher's exact test P = 1.06E-06).

There is always fierce competition between the two types of cells, and the former exhibits a greater competitive advantage than the latter via multiple mechanisms. Under hypoxia, the dynamic balance between the generation and clearing of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) is conducive to maintaining a quiescent state of cells. Quiescent LSCs can reside well in the BM niche, avoiding attack by chemotherapeutic agents, which is the cause of chemotherapeutic resistance and relapse in leukemia. HSCs acquire energy mainly through anaerobic glycolysis, whereas LSCs achieve energy metabolism largely through mitochondrial oxidative respiration. Mitochondria are the primary site of ROS generation. Thus, in theory, mitochondria-mediated respiration will cause an increase in ROS generation in LSCs and a higher intracellular oxidative stress level. The sensitivity of the cells to pro-oxidant drugs increases as well, which allows for the selective clearing of LSCs by pro-oxidative therapy. However, HSCs are also highly sensitive to changes in ROS levels, and the toxic effects of pro-oxidant drugs on HSCs poses a major challenge to pro-oxidative therapy in leukemia. Given the above facts, we reviewed studies on the oxidative resistance of LSCs and the oxidative damage to HSCs under pro-oxidative therapy. An in-depth investigation into the oxidative stress status and regulatory mechanisms of LSCs and HSCs in hypoxic environments will promote our understanding of the survival strategy employed by LSCs and the mechanism of the oxidative damage to HSCs in the BM niche, thus facilitating individualized treatment of leukemia patients and helping eliminate LSCs without disturbing normal hematopoietic cells.",,PMC7184730,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) is a powerful Fc-mediated effector function for killing hematological cancer cells, CD37-specific antibodies are generally poor inducers of CDC. To enhance CDC, the E430G mutation was introduced into humanized CD37 monoclonal IgG1 antibodies to drive more efficient IgG hexamer formation through intermolecular Fc-Fc interactions after cell surface antigen binding. DuoHexaBody-CD37, a bispecific CD37 antibody with the E430G hexamerization-enhancing mutation targeting two non-overlapping epitopes on CD37 (biparatopic), demonstrated potent and superior CDC activity compared to other CD37 antibody variants evaluated, in particular ex vivo in patient-derived chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. The superior CDC potency was attributed to enhanced IgG hexamerization mediated by the E430G mutation in combination with dual epitope targeting. The mechanism of action of DuoHexaBody-CD37 was shown to be multifaceted, as it was additionally capable of inducing efficient antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis in vitro. Finally, potent anti-tumor activity in vivo was observed in cell line- and patient-derived xenograft models from different B-cell malignancy subtypes.

Epub 2020 Apr 18.,"BACKGROUND: Seizures are common in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). As ALL survival rates are improving, the challenge to minimize treatment related side effects and late sequelae rises. Here, we studied the frequency, timing, etiology and risk factors of seizures in ALL patients. METHODS: The study included children aged 1-17.9 years at diagnosis of B-cell-precursor and T cell ALL who were treated according to the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL2008 protocol between 2008 and 2015. Detailed patient data were acquired from the NOPHO ALL2008 registry and by review of medical records. RESULTS: Seizures occurred in 81/1464 (5.5%) patients. The cumulative incidence of seizures at one months was 1.7% (95% CI: 1.2-2.5) and at one year 5.3% (95% CI 4.2-6.5%). Patients aged 10-17.9 years, those with T cell immunophenotype, CNS involvement, or high-risk induction with dexamethasone had higher risk for seizures in univariable analyses. Only age remained a risk factor in multivariable analyses (the cumulative incidence of seizures for patients 10-17.9 years old at one year was 9.0% (95% CI: 6.2-12.9)). Of the 81 patients with seizures, 43 had posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), 15 had isolated seizures, nine had sinus venous thrombosis (SVT), three had stroke-like syndrome, and 11 had other neurotoxicities. Epilepsy diagnosis was reported in totally 11 ALL survivors at last follow up. CONCLUSION: Seizures are relatively common in ALL patients and occur most often in patients with PRES, SVT, or as an isolated symptom. Older children have higher risk of seizures.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'Epilepsy', 'Neurotoxicity']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 European Paediatric Neurology Society. Published by Elsevier', 'Ltd.

Epub 2020 Apr 24.,"INTRODUCTION: Serous degeneration of bone marrow is a rare hematological complication, of multiple etiologies, which physiopathology is yet to be fully understood. It is described as a focal hypoplasia of the bone marrow and atrophy of its adipocytes coupled with an extracellular deposit of an eosinophilic substance that corresponds to ""hyaluronic acid"". The prognosis of these lesions depends on the etiological diagnosis. OBSERVATION: We report the case of a 19-year-old female patient without no notable pathological history, hospitalized in a regional hospital for mucocutaneous pallor with an impaired general condition. The biological assessment revealed a pancytopenia, and the presence of 60 % blast cells on the blood smear, which was in favor of acute leukemia. As part of the etiological assessment, a bone marrow biopsy was performed, revealing a typical aspect of serous degeneration. The bone marrow cellularity was reduced, made of rare hematopoietic cells, dissociated by pale extracellular deposits that were colored by PAS and alcian blue, with no individualized blasts. DISCUSSION: Serous transformation of the hematopoietic marrow is a rare condition, described at the end of the 19th century. The most severe forms are observed in young patients with hypoplasia. It most often manifests as pancytopenia at the beginning, if not then by an isolated cytopenia, anemia or thrombocytopenia. It is interesting to underline the contribution of MRI in diagnosis. The foci of bone marrow serous degeneration are characterized in the long bones by a fluid signal with a T1 hypo-signal and a T2 hyper-signal with no enhancement after injection of gadolinium, unlike bone metastases. The histology of bone marrow biopsy finds focal marrow hypoplasia of the hematopoietic lines associated with a depletion of adipocytes and an eosinophilic gelatinous interstitial infiltration alcian blue and PAS positive. The histological differential diagnosis is amyloidosis due to red Congo positivity, a previous biopsy (the absence of adipose tissue or hematopoietic tissue with granulation tissue and bone formation) and interstitial edema. Bone marrow necrosis can also be observed. Serous degeneration of bone marrow can be a symptom of a chronic systemic illness. In most cases, it is found in cases of severe chronic malnutrition, such as anorexia nervosa, certain cancers (acute leukemia), systemic diseases (lupus) or severe infection. Though there is no specific treatment for this complication, the treatment of the cause most often allows for the complete regression of the peripheral and spinal anomalies. CONCLUSION: In rare cases, as is the case in our observation, the serous degeneration of bone marrow can reveal underlying solid tumors or hemopathies, knowledge of it can help guide the investigations towards these etiologies.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Bone marrow', 'Leucemie aigue', 'Moelle osseuse', 'Serous degeneration', 'Transformation gelatineuse']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This pilot study evaluates the feasibility of identifying exceptional responders retrospectively, obtaining pre-exceptional response treatment tumor tissues, and analyzing them with state-of-the-art molecular analysis tools to identify potential molecular explanations for responses. METHODS: Exceptional response was defined as partial (PR) or complete (CR) response to a systemic treatment with population PR or CR rate less than 10% or an unusually long response (eg, duration >3 times published median). Cases proposed by patients' clinicians were reviewed by clinical and translational experts. Tumor and normal tissue (if possible) were profiled with whole exome sequencing and, if possible, targeted deep sequencing, RNA sequencing, methylation arrays, and immunohistochemistry. Potential germline mutations were tracked for relevance to disease. RESULTS: Cases reflected a variety of tumors and standard and investigational treatments. Of 520 cases, 476 (91.5%) were accepted for further review, and 222 of 476 (46.6%) proposed cases met requirements as exceptional responders. Clinical data were obtained from 168 of 222 cases (75.7%). Tumor was provided from 130 of 168 cases (77.4%). Of 117 of the 130 (90.0%) cases with sufficient nucleic acids, 109 (93.2%) were successfully analyzed; 6 patients had potentially actionable germline mutations. CONCLUSION: Exceptional responses occur with standard and investigational treatment.

M-808 effectively inhibits leukemia cell growth at low nanomolar concentrations and is capable of achieving partial tumor regression in an MV4;11 xenograft tumor model in mice at a well-tolerated dose schedule. Determination of the co-crystal structure of M-808 in complex with menin provides a structural basis for their high-affinity, covalent interactions.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the disappearance of monosomy 7 after eltrombopag treatment. The patient was a 77-year-old woman with intraoral hematoma and purpura who was diagnosed with very severe AA with a normal karyotype. After combination therapy with rabbit antithymocyte globulin, cyclosporin, and granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), pancytopenia transiently improved. When pancytopenia worsened again, the patient was administered darbepoetin alfa for renal anemia and danazol. Bone marrow examination showed 2.5% blasts with the karyotype 45,XX,-7[17]/46,XX[3], and 87.0% of marrow cells had monosomy 7, as determined by 7q31 interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Pancytopenia was considered owing to the evolution of myelodysplastic syndrome, and we stopped G-CSF and darbepoetin treatment. As she refused treatment with a hypomethylating agent, considering her age, eltrombopag was started against refractory pancytopenia after obtaining informed consent. She showed an improvement in pancytopenia and became transfusion independent. After 1 year of eltrombopag treatment, bone marrow examination revealed 0.7% blasts with the karyotype 46,XX[20] and without monosomy 7 clone by FISH analysis. After a further 1 year of eltrombopag treatment with dose tapering, she has achieved a complete response. This case suggested that eltrombopag treatment is not necessarily contraindicated in patients with monosomy 7.","['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', 'S56D65XJ9G (eltrombopag)', 'Chromosome 7, monosomy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Aplastic anemia', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes', 'clonal evolution', 'eltrombopag', 'monosomy 7', 'thrombopoietin receptor agonist']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 27.,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess outcomes of cats referred to a specialized adoption program for feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-positive cats. METHODS: Cats referred to an FeLV-specific adoption program between January 2018 and July 2019 at an animal shelter in Austin, TX, USA, were first identified based on their putative FeLV status as reported by the referring shelter, rescue group, veterinarian or individual. Each cat was re-screened for FeLV upon admission and subsequently deemed infected or uninfected. Data on cat source, admission date, outcome date, outcome type, signalment and comorbidities at the time of admission were extracted from the shelter database. Outcomes were recorded up to 15 December 2019. RESULTS: In total, 801 cats suspected to be infected with FeLV were referred to the FeLV adoption program. Of these, 149 (18.6%) were ultimately deemed uninfected, and infection was confirmed in 652 (81.4%) cats. Adoption was the most common outcome for FeLV-infected cats (n = 514 cats; 78.8%), followed by euthanasia or death in care (n = 109; 16.7%). Upper respiratory infection (URI) was the most common comorbidity in FeLV-infected cats (n = 106; 16.3%) at the time of admission, which was not significantly different than URI in the cats that were deemed not to be infected with FeLV (n = 29; 19.5%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study demonstrated high national demand for a lifesaving option for cats diagnosed with FeLV. FeLV infections could not be confirmed in approximately one in five cats referred to the FeLV adoption program, a reminder of the risk behind basing the fate of a cat on a single positive test result. The majority of cats referred to the FeLV program were adopted, demonstrating that programs centered on adopter education and post-adoption support can create lifesaving outcomes for most FeLV-infected cats, despite uncertainty regarding their long-term prognosis.",,PMC7691564,['NOTNLM'],"['*Feline leukemia virus', '*animal shelter', '*animal shelter outcomes', '*feline welfare', '*pet adoption', '*shelter medicine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 27.,"Background: Panobinostat demonstrates activity against pediatric cancers in vitro. A phase I trial in children with refractory hematologic malignancies was conducted. Study design: The trial evaluated two schedules of oral panobinostat using 3 + 3 dose escalations in 28-day cycles. For children with leukemia, panobinostat was given once daily three days a week each week at 24, 30 and 34 mg/m2/day. For children with lymphoma, panobinostat was given once daily three days a week every other week at 16, 20 and 24 mg/m2/day. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from Day 29 of the first cycle, when available, was evaluated for PK. The study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01321346) Results: Twenty-two subjects enrolled with leukemia. Five enrolled at dose level 1, 6 at dose level 2, and 11 at dose level 3. There was one dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the leukemia arm at dose level 3 (Grade 4 hypertriglyceridemia), but no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was identified. No subjects required removal from protocol therapy for QTc prolongation. PK studies were available in 11 subjects with similar exposure in children as in adults. Four Day 29 CSF specimens were found to have panobinostat levels below the lower limit of quantification. Five subjects with lymphoma were enrolled and received study drug, and 4 were evaluable for DLT. A DLT was reported (Grade 3 enteritis) on the lymphoma arm. Conclusions: Panobinostat was tolerated in heavily pretreated pediatric subjects. Gastrointestinal effects were observed on this study. There were no cardiac findings.

However, little is known about the characteristics of inter-chromosomal distribution of genes (including protein-coding genes, processed transcripts and pseudogenes) in different genomes. In this study, we explored these issues using the available genomic data of both human and model organisms. Moreover, we also analyzed the distribution pattern of protein-coding genes that have been associated with 14 common diseases and the insert/deletion mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms detected by whole genome sequencing in an acute promyelocyte leukemia patient. We obtained the following novel findings. Firstly, inter-chromosomal distribution of genes displays a nonstochastic pattern and the gene densities in different chromosomes are heterogeneous. This kind of heterogeneity is observed in genomes of both lower and higher species. Secondly, protein-coding genes involved in certain biological processes tend to be enriched in one or a few chromosomes. Our findings have added new insights into our understanding of the spatial distribution of genome and disease- related genes across chromosomes. These results could be useful in improving the efficiency of disease-associated gene screening studies by targeting specific chromosomes.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA', 'Inter-chromosomal distribution', 'density', 'disease-associated', 'gene', 'non-stochastic pattern', 'protein-coding']",,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The miR-4260 level was higher in AML cell lines than the normal cell lines. Inhibition of miR-4260 hindered proliferation and increased apoptosis of AML cells. Mechanistically, long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1128 (LINC01128) competed with nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 2 (NR3C2) for miR-4260 so as to upregulate NR3C2.

Epub 2020 Apr 26.,"Acute myeloid leukemia has recently undergone a significant transition into identifying and successfully inhibiting driver mutations leading to disease. One of the most common mutations in acute myeloid leukemia involves the protein FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), which leads to ligand-independent activation of intracellular signaling cascades leading to the survival and proliferation of the acute leukemia blast cell. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the presence of two dominant types of mutations of this protein: internal tandem duplication and tyrosine kinase domain mutations. Successful inhibition of this protein has proven to be challenging. While FLT3 has been shown to be successfully inhibited and shown to improve overall survival in the frontline therapy of acute myeloid leukemia in combination with cytarabine and anthracycline, relapsed and refractory (R/R) patients have not been shown to be a successful population until recently.

At present, the risk stratification and prognosis of MDS need to be further optimized. A prognostic model was constructed by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis for MDS patients based on the identified metabolic gene panel in training cohort, followed by external validation in an independent cohort. The patients with lower risk had better prognosis than patients with higher risk. The constructed model was verified as an independent prognostic factor for MDS patients with hazard ratios of 3.721 (1.814-7.630) and 2.047 (1.013-4.138) in the training cohort and validation cohort, respectively. The AUC of 3-year overall survival was 0.846 and 0.743 in the training cohort and validation cohort, respectively. The high-risk score was significantly related to other clinical prognostic characteristics, including higher bone marrow blast cells and lower absolute neutrophil count. Moreover, gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) showed several significantly enriched pathways, with potential indication of the pathogenesis. In this study, we identified a novel stable metabolic panel, which might not only reveal the dysregulated metabolic microenvironment, but can be used to predict the prognosis of MDS.",,PMC7294120,['NOTNLM'],"['*gene set enrichment analyses', '*metabolism', '*myelodysplastic syndrome', '*prognostic model', '*the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator']",,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Epub 2020 Apr 26.,"Imatinib mesylate (IM) is the first-line treatment for Philadelphia (Ph) chromosomal positive leukemia by inhibiting phosphorylation of substrates via binding to the ABL kinase domain. Because of the drug resistance, side effects and the high cost of IM, it is necessary to find anti-cancer drugs with relatively low toxicity and cost, and enhanced efficacy, such as traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). As one of TCMs, Huai Qi Huang (HQH) was chosen to treat BV173 and K562 cells. Various concentrations of HQH were added to cells for 24-72 h. Co-treatment of HQH and trametinib, an MEK inhibitor, was used to verify the synergistic effects on cell viability and apoptosis. Knockdown and overexpression of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MEK4) were implemented to demonstrate the role of MEK in cell apoptosis. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured by cell counting kit-8 assay (CCK8) and flow cytometry, respectively. Western blotting and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were used to assess protein and mRNA expression levels, respectively. The results showed that HQH inhibited survival and promoted apoptosis of BV173 and K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner, accompanied with down-regulation of PRKCH mRNA as well as CRAF, MEK4, phospho-ERK (pERK) and BCL2 proteins, and up-regulation of cleaved caspase3 protein. Co-treatment of HQH and trametinib had a synergistic effect on inhibiting survival and promoting apoptosis. MEK4 knockdown increased apoptosis, and had a synergistic effect with HQH. In contrast, MEK4 overexpression decreased apoptosis, and had the opposite effect with HQH. Collectively, the results of this study may identify a therapeutic mechanism of HQH on promoting apoptosis, and provide a potential option for treatment of Ph(+) leukemia.","['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (huai qi huang)', '33E86K87QN (trametinib)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCH protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'Huai Qi Huang', 'RAF/MEK/ERK', 'apoptosis', 'leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compounds from plants are the new targets to solve this problem. Quercetin (QCT), quercetrin (QTR), and rutin (RUT) are potential anticancer flavonoids but their poor water solubility leads to less efficacy. In this study, the polymeric micelles of benzoylated methoxy-poly (ethylene glycol)-b-oligo(epsilon-caprolactone) or mPEG-b-OCL-Bz loading with the flavonoids were prepared to solve these problems. The flavonoid-loaded micelles showed an average size of 13-20 nm and maximum loading capacity of 35% (w/w). The release of QCT (21%, 3 h) was lower than that of QTR (51%, 3 h) and RUT (58%, 3 h). QCT (free and micelle forms) exhibited significantly higher cytotoxicity against P-glycoprotein-overexpressing leukemia (K562/ADR) cells than QTR and RUT (p < 0.05). The results demonstrated that QCT-loaded micelles effectively reversed cytotoxicity of both doxorubicin (multidrug resistant reversing (delta) values up to 0.71) and daunorubicin (delta values up to 0.74) on K562/ADR cells. It was found that QCT-loaded micelles as well as empty polymeric micelles inhibited P-gp efflux of tetrahydropyranyl Adriamycin. Besides, mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased by QCT (in its free form and micellar formation). Our results suggested that the combination effects of polymeric micelles (inhibiting P-gp efflux) and QCT (interfering mitochondrial membrane potential) might be critical factors contributing to the reversing multidrug resistance of K562/ADR cells by QCT-loaded micelles. We concluded that QCT-loaded mPEG-b-OCL-Bz micelles are the attractive systems for overcoming multidrug-resistant cancer cells.","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Micelles)', '0 (Polymers)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['P-gp', 'cancer', 'flavonoid', 'polymeric micelle', 'resistance']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluates cancer incidence in the WTC Health Program General Responder Cohort occurring within 12 years post exposure. Methods: The study population consisted of 28 729 members of the General Responder Cohort enrolled from cohort inception, July 2002 to December 31, 2013. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated with cancer case inclusion and follow-up starting post September 11, 2001 (unrestricted) and, alternatively, to account for selection bias, with case inclusion and follow-up starting 6 months after enrollment in the WTC Health Program (restricted). Case ascertainment was based on linkage with six state cancer registries. Under the restricted criterion, hazard ratios were estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models for all cancer sites combined and for prostate cancer. Results: Restricted analyses identified 1072 cancers in 999 responders, with elevations in cancer incidence for all cancer sites combined (SIR = 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02 to 1.16), prostate cancer (SIR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.40), thyroid cancer (SIR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.71 to 2.75), and leukemia (SIR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.92). Cancer incidence was not associated with any WTC exposure index (composite or individual) for all cancer sites combined or for prostate cancer. Conclusion: Our analyses show statistically significant elevations in cancer incidence for all cancer sites combined and for prostate and thyroid cancers and leukemia. Multivariable analyses show no association with magnitude or type of exposure.",,PMC7050150,,,,['(c) The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the ionizing radiation from CT scans may increase the risk of cancer. This study examined the association between medical radiation from CT scans and the risk of thyroid cancer, lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in adults. Methods: We conducted a nested case-control study in a cohort constructed from a population-based universal health insurance dataset in Taiwan in 2000-2013. In total, 22 853 thyroid cancer, 13 040 leukemia, and 20 157 NHL cases with their matched controls were included. Median follow-up times were 9.29-9.90 years for the three case-control groups. Medical radiation from CT scans was identified through physician order codes in medical insurance data from the index date to 3 years before a cancer diagnosis. Conditional logistic regression modeling was used for the overall and subsets of the population defined by sex and age groups to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the cancer risk associated with medical radiation. Results: Exposure to medical radiation from CT scans was associated with elevated risk of thyroid cancer (OR = 2.55, 95% CI = 2.36 to 2.75) and leukemia (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.42 to 1.68). The elevated risk of thyroid cancer and leukemia in association with medical CT was stronger in women than in men. No statistically significant association between the risk of cancer and CT scans was observed in overall patients with NHL (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.98 to 1.12); however, increased risks were found in patients aged 45 years or younger. A clear dose-response relationship was observed in patients 45 years or younger for all three cancers. Conclusions: CT scans may be associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer and leukemia in adults and in those diagnosed with NHL at a younger age.",,PMC7050152,,,,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

There have been only a few reports of AML that subsequently developed during imatinib mesylate (IM) treatment for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). CASE SUMMARY: A 63-year-old woman was diagnosed with a hepatic GIST recurrence in April 2012; she was administered IM 400 mg/d. In November 2015, she developed dyspnea with pancytopenia while IM treatment was continued for 42 mo. A chromosome study using a bone marrow sample showed a 46, XX karyotype with t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) in 22 of 26 analyzed metaphase cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using the locus-specific indicator (11q23) gene break-apart probe showed positive rearrangement in 82% of interphase cells. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions subsequently confirmed the KMT2A/ELL transcript. She achieved complete response with incomplete neutrophil recovery with two decitabine treatment cycles. After the third cycle of decitabine, the disease relapsed, and she refused further treatment. She died of hemorrhagic stroke 5 mo after diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of AML with KMT2A gene rearrangements in a patient with a GIST receiving IM treatment. CONCLUSION: Physicians should consider the potential risks of developing hematologic malignancies, including therapy-related AML, in patients with GISTs receiving IM treatment.",,PMC7176619,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Case report', 'Gastrointestinal stromal tumor', 'Imatinib', 'KMT2A', 'Myelodysplastic syndrome']",,"['(c)The Author(s) 2020.

Several risk and genetic factors have been widely investigated to characterize AML. However, the concomitant epigenetic factors in controlling the gene expression lead to AML transformation was not fully understood. This study was aimed to identify epigenetically regulated genes in AML cell lines induced by epigenetic modulating agents, Trichostatin A (TSA) and 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza). Materials and Methods: MV4-11 and Kasumi 1 were treated with TSA and/or 5-Aza at IC50 concentration. Gene expression profiling by microarray was utilized using SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression v3. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway annotations were analyzed by DAVID bioinformatics software using EASE enrichment score. mRNA expression of the differentially expressed genes were verified by quantitative real time PCR. Results: Gene expression analysis revealed a significant changes in the expression of 24,822, 15,720, 15,654 genes in MV4-11 and 12,598, 8828, 18,026 genes in Kasumi 1, in response to TSA, 5-Aza and combination treatments, respectively, compared to non-treated (p<0.05). 7 genes (SOCS3, TUBA1C, CCNA1, MAP3K6, PTPRC, STAT6 and RUNX1) and 4 genes (ANGPTL4, TUBB2A, ADAM12 and PTPN6) shown to be predominantly expressed in MV4-11 and Kasumi 1, respectively (EASE<0.1). The analysis also revealed phagosome pathway commonly activated in both cell lines.

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was conducted in 295 newly-diagnosed CP-CML patients(age >18 years) who were admitted to the Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Shariati Hospital, Tehran during 1 January, 2009 to 30 December, 2016. Response to treatment was evaluated by molecular response assessment. Rates of IM dose adjustment, switching to another drug therapy, progression to Accelerate Phase (AP) and Blastic Crisis (BC) and long-term outcomes included Overall Survival (OS) and Progression Free Survival (PFS) were assesed. Results: Patients' average age was 41.7 years, and 52.9% were male. 44.4% of patients at the month 18 achieved Major Molecular Response (MMR). Progression to AP/BC occurred in 26 patients during 84 months, and the estimated rate of OS and PFS were 71.83 and 74.48, respectively. Among the patients who did not achieve MMR at month 18 , 61 patients were treated with IM ( 400 mg /day), and then after month 18, 24(39.3%) of whom achieved MMR. Dose adjustments occurred in 60 patients (20.33%). IM dose increase was observed in 53 patients who did not achive optimal response to imatinib or loss of optimal response. IM dose decrease was observed in 7 patients. 25 (8.47%) patients were switched to a different Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI). Most of TKI changes(n=21) happened in patients who did not achieve optimal response to IM and TKI changes owing to adverse events of IM were observed in 4 patients.. Among the patients undergoing change in treatment, 24(43.75%) patients achieved MMR. Conclusion: Our data showed the high effectiveness of the change in the treatment of IM-resistant condition.

Increased SCF levels have recently been reported in a small series of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), however its precise role in CLL pathophysiology remains elusive. In this study, CLL cells were found to express predominantly the membrane isoform of SCF, which is known to elicit a more robust activation of the c-kit receptor. SCF was significantly overexpressed in CLL cells compared to healthy tonsillar B cells and it correlated with adverse prognostic biomarkers, shorter time-to-first treatment and shorter overall survival. Activation of immune receptors and long-term cell-cell interactions with the mesenchymal stroma led to an elevation of SCF primarily in CLL cases with an adverse prognosis. Contrariwise, suppression of oxidative stress and the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib lowered SCF levels. Interestingly, SCF significantly correlated with mitochondrial dynamics and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a which have previously been linked with clinical aggressiveness in CLL. SCF was able to elicit direct biological effects in CLL cells, affecting redox homeostasis and cell proliferation. Overall, the aberrantly expressed SCF in CLL cells emerges as a key response regulator to microenvironmental stimuli while correlating with poor prognosis. On these grounds, specific targeting of this inflammatory molecule could serve as a novel therapeutic approach in CLL.","['0 (KITLG protein, human)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)']",PMC7927890,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 5.,"BACKGROUND: The treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in older adults and elderly patients is a challenge, and modern protocols include targeted therapy and immunotherapy in combination with attenuated or minimal chemotherapy. However, frail patients are excluded from these trials, and reports on the outcome of this subgroup of patients are scarce. Our objective was to analyze the outcome of unfit older adults and elderly patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL included in a prospective trial (ALL-07FRAIL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Older adults and elderly patients with Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) >/= 4 were included. Induction therapy consisted of vincristine and dexamethasone, and maintenance therapy with mercaptopurine and methotrexate for 2 years. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients with a median age of 67 years (range, 57-89 years) and a median CCI of 5 (range, 4-12) were included. The rates of early withdrawal, early death, resistance, and complete response (CR) were 5%, 10%, 31%, and 54%, respectively. Six patients with CR abandoned the study, 5 died in CR, and 23 relapsed (cumulative relapse incidence 75%). The medians of disease-free and overall survival (OS) were 6.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3-13.5 months) and 7.6 months (95% CI, 6.3-8.9 months), respectively. The most frequent toxic events were hematologic (neutropenia 77% and thrombocytopenia 54%, of grade III-IV in all cases). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score but not the CCI had significant impact on OS. CONCLUSION: Complete remission with very attenuated chemotherapy can be attained in one-half of older or elderly infirm patients with ALL. These results suggest that some of these patients could benefit from the concomitant or subsequent use of immunotherapy and/or targeted therapy.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Elderly', '*Frail', '*Minimal chemotherapy', '*Philadelphia chromosome-negative']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the outcomes of ATRA and intravenous ATO plus IDA as a frontline induction therapy in 118 patients with APL with high-risk (HR) and standard-risk (SR) disease from January 2008 to December 2017. The medical records of 118 patients with APL (HR, n = 45; SR, n = 73) who received the frontline triple combination regimen at Henan Provincial People's Hospital and Tongji Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Consolidation therapy comprised 6 cycles of ATO and ATRA plus IDA, and IDA was administered in 1 to 4 cycles of consolidation therapy based on the comparable clinical efficacy compared with 6 cycles and fewer side effects to myocardium without subsequent maintenance therapy. RESULTS: Of 118 patients, there were 3 (2.5%) early deaths and 115 (97.5%) hematologic complete remissions; 102 (88.7%) of 115 patients achieved molecular complete remission following induction therapy, and all patients were polymerase chain reaction-negative for promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha after the first cycle of consolidation therapy. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 93.0% +/- 2.9% and 92.4% +/- 3.0%, respectively. Early death, hematologic complete remissions, molecular complete remissions, and toxicities were comparable between the HR and SR groups. The cumulative incidence of relapse in the HR group was 4.7% (n = 2), and the cumulative incidence of relapse in the SR group was 0. The OS and EFS of the SR and HR groups were comparable (92.3% +/- 4.5% vs. 92.8% +/- 4.0%; X(2) = 0.263; P = .608; 92.3% +/- 4.5% vs. 91.1% +/- 4.2%, X(2) = 0.917; P = .338). The total dosage of IDA was approximately 181 to 258 mg, and no patient experienced cardiotoxicity. OS and EFS were not influenced by fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication mutation status (P = .405 and P = .528, respectively). CONCLUSION: The triple combination of ATRA and ATO plus IDA as both an induction and consolidation therapy for the HR and SR groups attained excellent outcomes, and this regimen was effective, safe, and easy, without maintenance therapy. The triple combination treatment might be a preferred frontline therapy for patients with APL, especially for those with HR or the APL fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication mutation.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*APL', '*FLT3-ITD', '*High risk', '*Prognosis', '*Triple treatment']",,['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

This study aims to provide an up-to-date summary of the key reasons for non-adherence to oral antineoplatic drugs (OAD) in people with cancer. METHODS: Electronic databases Medline, Embase, Emcare, and PsychINFO were searched for systematic reviews and studies published between January 2010 and March 2018. Data was analyzed and extracted by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: Three systematic reviews and two studies were included in the review. Key factors for non-adherence were classified as either modifiable or non-modifiable factors. Side effects, forgetfulness, and poor knowledge about OAD were identified as modifiable factors while co-payment, age, regimen complexity. and time since diagnosis were identified as non-modifiable factors. Most of the included studies focused on breast cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Low methodological quality and different adherence cut-off rates were observed in the included literature. CONCLUSIONS: More research with rigorous methodology and diverse cancer types is needed to increase evidence on the reasons for OAD non-adherence. However, findings from this study may serve to aid in drafting guidelines and suitable interventions for adherence-related support to OAD users.",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Factors', 'Medication adherence', 'Oncology', 'Oral antineoplastic drugs']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously identified a murine leukemia retrovirus-like ERV whose Env and Gag antigens are involved in autoimmune responses in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. In this study, we show that the Gag antigen is present in the islet stromal cells. Although Gag gene transcripts were present, Gag protein was not detected in diabetes-resistant mice. Cloning and sequencing analysis of individual Gag genes revealed that NOD islets express Gag gene variants with complete open-reading frames (ORFs), in contrast to the diabetes-resistant mice, whose islet Gag gene transcripts are mostly non-ORFs. Importantly, the ORFs obtained from the NOD islets are extremely heterogenous, coding for various mutants that are absence in the genome. We further show that Gag antigens are stimulatory for autoreactive T cells and identified one islet-expressing Gag variant that contains an altered peptide ligand capable of inducing IFN-gamma release by the T cells. The data highlight a unique retrovirus-like factor in the islets of the NOD mouse strain, which may participate in key events triggering autoimmunity and T1D.","['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",PMC7328525,['NOTNLM'],"['*Autoimmunity', '*Endogenous retrovirus', '*Gag', '*Microvesicles', '*Non-obese diabetic mouse', '*T cells', '*Type 1 diabetes']","['R01 DK091663/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI139564/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Copyright (c) 2020 European Federation of Immunological Societies.

Epub 2020 Apr 22.,"The activating-mutation of JAK2V617F drives the development of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Several JAK2 inhibitors such as ruxolitinib and gandotinib (LY2784544) currently in clinical trials and, provide improvements in MPNs including myelofibrosis. However, JAK2 inhibitors are non-curative and murine experiments show that JAK2 inhibitors don't eradicate MPN stem cells and it is currently unclear how they escape. We thus determined the effect of the specific JAK2V617F inhibitor LY2784544 on leukemic stem (CD34(+)) cells (LSCs) using the JAK2V617F-bearing erythroleukemia cell line HEL. The LY2784544 treatment caused a transient proliferation inhibition and apoptosis of HEL cells, but a recovery occurred within a week. Thereafter, the continuous LY2784544 exposure induced the accumulation of CD34(+) LSCs, and the CD34(+) cells increased from 2% to >90% by week 9, which was accompanied by increased clonogenic potentials. LY2784544 was capable of stimulating CD34 expression even in CD34(-) HEL cells, which indicated cellular de-differentiation. A significantly enhanced expression of the stem cell factor KLF4 was observed in LY2784544-treated HEL cells. Inhibiting KLF4 expression attenuated LY2784544-mediated accumulation of CD34(+) LSCs. Moreover, the telomerase inhibitor GRN163L abolished the LY2784544-effect. JAK2 inhibitors thus cause enrichment of LSCs and are unlikely to cure MPN as a monotherapy. Simultaneously targeting JAK2V617F and KLF4 or telomerase may be a novel strategy for MPN therapy, which should be of significance both biologically and clinically.","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (GRN163L peptide)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (LY2784544)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyridazines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*JAK2 mutation', '*KLF4', '*Leukemia stem cell', '*MPN', '*TERT', '*Telomerase']",,['Copyright (c) 2020.

METHODS: studying the anticancer activity and Drug ability of marine sponge Dysidea avara using Cell lines oral epithelial cancer cell (KB/C152) and T-lymphocytic leukemia cell line (Jurkat/ E6-1). Marine sponge was collected from Persian Gulf. Several analytical techniques have been used to obtain and recognize stigmasterol, including column chromatography, thin layer chromatography, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The PASS Prediction Activity was used to investigate the apoptosis-inducing effect of stigmasterol. The cytotoxic activity of stigmasterol was examined using yellow tetrazolium salt XTT (sodium 2, 3,-bis (2methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino) carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium) assay. The stigmasterol were docked within the protein tyrosine kinase (PTKs) (PDB code: 1t46) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRK) (PDB code: 1M17). Also, the pharmacological characteristics of stigmasterol were predicted using PerADME, SwissADME, and Molinspi ration tools. Apoptosis-inducing effect of stigmasterol indicate the stigmasterol in terms of the possibility of apoptosis in cells. RESULTS: The apoptosis inducement results of known stigmasterol were determined by PASS on-line prediction. The compound exhibit potent cytotoxic properties against KB/C152 cell compared to Jurkat/ E6-1 cell. The stigmasterol showed the cytotoxicity effects on KB/C152 and HUT78 with IC50 ranges of 81.18 and 103.03 mug/ml, respectively. Molecular docking showed that, stigmasterol bound stably to the active sites of the protein tyrosine kinase (PTKs) (PDB code: 1t46) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRK) (PDB code: 1M17). CONCLUSION: The compound showed desirable pharmacokinetic properties (ADME). This provided direct evidence of how a prospective anti-cancer agent can be stigmasterol.

Epub 2020 Apr 16.,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a central metabolic regulator that promotes cancer growth and survival under hypoxia and plays a role in the maintenance of cancer stem cells. A major challenge to interrogating the potential of targeting AMPK in cancer is the lack of potent and selective small molecule inhibitors. Compound C has been widely used as an AMPK inhibitor, but it lacks potency and has a poor selectivity profile. The multi-kinase inhibitor, sunitinib, has demonstrated potent nanomolar inhibition of AMPK activity and has scope for modification. Here, we have designed and synthesized several series of oxindoles to determine the structural requirements for AMPK inhibition and to improve selectivity. We identified two potent, novel oxindole-based AMPK inhibitors that were designed to interact with the DFG motif in the ATP-binding site of AMPK, this key feature evades interaction with the common recptor tyrosine kinase targets of sunitinib. Cellular engagement of AMPK by these oxindoles was confirmed by the inhibition of phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a known substrate of AMPK, in myeloid leukemia cells. Interestingly, although AMPK is highly expressed and activated in K562 cells these oxindole-based AMPK inhibitors did not impact cell viability or result in significant cytotoxicity. Our studies serve as a platform for the further development of oxindole-based AMPK inhibitors with therapeutic potential.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oxindoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)']",PMC7409528,['NOTNLM'],"['AMPK', 'Cancer', 'Inhibitor', 'Kinase', 'Metabolism', 'Structure-activity relationship']",['R01 CA200707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Epub 2020 Apr 17.,"Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is frequently elevated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and often leads to tumorigenesis. In recent years, numerous LSD1 inhibitors based on tranylcypromine (TCP) scaffolding have reached clinical trials. Most TCP derivatives were modified at the amino site of cyclopropane motif. Herein, we for the first time introduced a sulfonamide group in TCP benzene ring of series a compounds and performed a systematical study on structure and activity relationships by varying sulfonamide groups. The introduction of sulfonamide significantly increased the targeting capacity of TCP against LSD1. Moreover, we discovered that the Boc attached LSD1 inhibitors (labelled as series b compounds) substantially improved their anti-proliferation capacity towards AML cells. The intracellular thermal shift and LC-MS/MS results implied that Boc enhanced the drug lipophilicity and might be removed under the cancerous acidic environment to release the real pharmacophore, evidenced by the fact that a structurally similar but acidic inert pivaloyl to replace Boc dramatically dropped the cellular anti-proliferation effect. Finally, a benzyl group installed at the amino site to appropriately increase lipophilicity led to trans-4-(2-(benzylamino)-cyclopropyl)-N,N-diethylbenzenesulfonamide a10 that showed better anti-proliferation activity in AML cells and enzymatic inhibition against LSD1. Taken together, our work offers a novel TCP-based structure and provides a prodrug strategy for the discovery of potent LSD1 inhibitors by having appropriate lipophilicity.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '3E3V44J4Z9 (Tranylcypromine)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (KDM1A protein, human)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Inhibitor', '*Lipophilicity', '*Lysine-specific demethylase 1', '*Prodrug']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Yet, the detailed role of SOX30 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not been well studied. The present research was designed to investigate the detailed relevance of SOX30 in AML. The data of our study indicated that SOX30 expression was markedly downregulated in AML cells, a pattern associated with its hypermethylation. SOX30 overexpression caused a marked reduction in AML cell proliferation and colony formation, but it promoted AML cell apoptosis. By contrast, SOX30 depletion by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing had the opposite effect. Moreover, SOX30 overexpression markedly decreased beta-catenin expression, a change that led to inactivation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Notably, restoration of beta-catenin expression partially reversed SOX30-mediated tumor suppressive effect in AML cells. In an AML-derived mouse xenograft model, SOX30 overexpression remarkably retarded the tumor growth in vivo. Overall, these data of the study suggest a tumor-inhibition role of SOX30 in AML, and highlight a key role of SOX30/Wnt/beta-catenin axis in the progression of AML.","['0 (SOX Transcription Factors)', '0 (SOX30 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*GSK-3beta', '*SOX30', '*beta-catenin']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2020 May 9.,"Intracellular cAMP (i-cAMP) levels play an important role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell proliferation and differentiation. Its levels are the result of cAMP production, degradation, and exclusion. We have previously described histamine H2 receptors and MRP4/ABCC4 as two potential targets for AML therapy. Acting through histamine H2 receptors, histamine increases cAMP production/synthesis, while MRP4/ABCC4 is responsible for the exclusion of this cyclic nucleotide. In this study, we show that histamine treatment induces MRP4/ABCC4 expression, augmenting cAMP efflux, and that histamine, in combination with MRP inhibitors, is able to reduce AML cell proliferation. Histamine, through histamine H2 receptor, increases i-cAMP levels and induces MRP4 transcript and protein levels in U937, KG1a, and HL-60 cells. Moreover, histamine induces MRP4 promoter activity in HEK293T cells transfected with histamine H2 receptor (HEK293T-H2 R). Our results support that the cAMP/Epac-PKA pathway, and not MEK/ERK nor PI3K/AKT signaling cascades, is involved in histamine-mediated upregulation of MRP4 levels. Finally, the addition of histamine potentiates the inhibition of U937, KG1a, and HL-60 cell proliferation induced by MRP4 inhibitors. Our data highlight that the use of a poly-pharmacological approach aimed at different molecular targets would be beneficial in AML treatment.","['0 (ABCC4 protein, human)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Propionates)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (RAPGEF3 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Histamine H2)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (ceefourin 1)', '5Q9O54P0H7 (verlukast)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'PO572Z7917 (Probenecid)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*MRP4', '*cAMP efflux', '*histamine', '*proliferation']",,['(c) 2020 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In the National Health Insurance Research database of Taiwan, all eligible individuals in 2016 were analyzed (n = 23 696 659) and the family structures of 38 686 patients diagnosed with NMTC between 1997 and 2016 were identified. The prevalence and RRs of NMTC, chronic thyroid diseases, and common malignancies in individuals with first-degree relatives with NMTC were examined. The accountability of heritability and environmental factors to NMTC susceptibility was estimated using the polygenic liability model. RESULTS: The prevalence of NMTC was 0.16% in the general population and 0.64% in individuals with first-degree relatives with NMTC. Regarding affected relatives, the RR (95% CI) for NMTC was 20.12 (4.86-83.29) for twins, 6.43 (4.80-8.62) for siblings, 5.24 (4.55-6.03) for offspring, 5.07 (4.41-5.81) for parents, and 2.07 (1.53-2.81) for spouses. The estimated genetic, common environmental, and nonshared environmental contributions to NMTC were 28.0%, 14.3%, and 57.7%, respectively. A family history of NMTC was associated with higher risks of thyroid nodules (RR, 2.26; 95% CI, 2.18-2.35), Hashimoto thyroiditis (2.11; 1.89-2.36), Graves disease (1.49; 1.42-1.57), lung cancer (1.56; 1.32-1.85), and leukemia and lymphoma (1.24; 1.03-1.50).

Epub 2020 Apr 25.,"BACKGROUND: Selective IDH1 and IDH2 inhibitors have been approved for targeted therapy of acute myeloid leukemia. Clinical trials for solid tumors with IDH1 and IDH2 (IDH1/2) mutations are ongoing. Reports of IDH1/2-mutated non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), however, are limited. METHODS: We evaluated IDH1/2 mutations in 1,924 NSCLC specimens (92% adenocarcinoma) using a next-generation sequencing assay. RESULTS: Retrospective quality assessments identified false detection of IDH1 c.395G>A (p.R132H) resulting from cytosine deamination (C:G-->T:A) artifact in one specimen. IDH1/2 mutations were detected in 9 (0.5%) adenocarcinomas taken by fine-needle aspiration (n = 3), thoracentesis (n = 2) or core biopsy (n = 4). All nine adenocarcinomas showed high-grade features. Extensive clear cell change, however, was not observed. High expression (50% or greater) of PD-L1 was observed in two of five specimens examined. IDH1/2 mutations were associated with old age, smoking history, and coexisting KRAS mutation. Lower than expected variant allele frequency of IDH1/2 mutants and coexistence of IDH1/2 mutations with known trunk drivers in the BRAF, EGFR, and KRAS genes suggest they could be branching drivers leading to subclonal evolution in lung adenocarcinomas. Multiregional analysis of an adenocarcinoma harboring two IDH2 mutations revealed parallel evolution originating from a KRAS-mutated lineage, further supporting subclonal evolution promoted by IDH1/2 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: IDH1/2 mutations in NSCLCs are uncommon. They occur in adenocarcinomas with high-grade features and may be branching drivers leading to subclonal evolution. Accumulation of more IDH1/2-mutated NSCLCs is needed to clarify their clinicopathological characteristics and implications for targeted therapy.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

Epub 2020 Apr 25.,"BACKGROUND: In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a better understanding of leukemic cell characteristics after treatment would help to design specific therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing clinical relapse. Gene arrays have become a powerful approach to perform gene expression profiling; nevertheless, to work with residual cells entails an intensive labor. The aim of this study was to set forth an effective gene expression approach to analyze residual leukemic cells. METHODS: Leukocytes from CLL patient's samples were sorted by flow cytometry using a 6-color panel. The quality and quantity of RNA isolated from different inputs of cells were compared by two silica column protocols: RNeasy Micro and RNeasy Mini. RNA amplifications were carried out according to two manufacturer's protocols: Ovation Pico SL and Ovation Pico WTA. A total of 3.5 mug of cDNA was labeled and hybridized to Human Gene 2.0 ST arrays. RESULTS: RNA extracted from low number of input cells by RNeasy Micro showed similar RNA integrity number to that obtained from RNeasy Mini; however, the RNA quantity was higher using the RNeasy Micro Kit. In addition, those RNA samples obtained with RNeasy Micro and amplified with Ovation Pico WTA showed good quality to proceed for a gene array study, independently of the number of input cells (range: 1 x 10(4) -5 x 10(5) cells). CONCLUSIONS: We observed that this workflow is a feasible approach to obtain genomic material extracted from leukemic cells as little as 1 x 10(4) cells and it can be useful to carry out gene expression profile experiments to characterize residual leukemic cells in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['RNA', 'cDNA', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'microarrays', 'minimal residual disease']","['2014 SGR 1281/Catalan Government AGAUR', '2017 SGR 1395/Catalan Government AGAUR', 'Cellex Foundation Barcelona', 'RD12/0036/0071/Red Tematica de Investigacion Cooperativa en Cancer', 'Asociacion Espanola contra el Cancer (AECC)', 'FIS PI11/01740/Instituto de Salud Carlos III', 'FIS PI19/00753/Instituto de Salud Carlos III', 'Obra Social La Caixa Barcelona', 'Catalan Government AGAUR']",['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 24.,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has come of age, offering a potentially curative option for patients who are refractory to standard anti-cancer treatments. The success of CAR T cell therapy in the setting of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and specific types of B cell lymphoma led to rapid regulatory approvals of CD19-directed CAR T cells, first in the United States and subsequently across the globe. Despite these major milestones in the field of immuno-oncology, growing experience with CAR T cells has also highlighted the major limitations of this strategy, namely challenges associated with manufacturing a bespoke patient-specific product, intrinsic immune cell defects leading to poor CAR T cell function as well as persistence, and/or tumor cell resistance resulting from loss or modulation of the targeted antigen. In addition, both on- and off-tumor immunotoxicities and the financial burden inherent in conventional cellular biomanufacturing often hamper the success of CAR T cell-based treatment approaches. Herein, we provide an overview of the opportunities and challenges related to the first form of gene transfer therapy to gain commercial approval in the United States. Ongoing advances in the areas of genetic engineering, precision genome editing, toxicity mitigation methods and cell manufacturing will improve the efficacy and safety of CAR T cells for hematologic malignancies and expand the use of this novel class of therapeutics to reach solid tumors.","['0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR T cell', 'Cancer', 'Chimeric antigen receptor', 'Immunotherapy']","['P01 CA214278/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA241762/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA244711/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AG066100/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA214278/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA241762/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA244711/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AG066100/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the predictors of post-transplant outcomes were not well-defined. The aim of the study was to evaluate the significance of FLT3/ITD mutation by polymerase chain reaction as minimal residual disease (MRD) marker of outcomes after transplantation. We identified 43 patients (28 females and 15 males) with FLT3-mutated AML at the median age of 45 years who were allografted between 2009 and 2019. Hematological status at transplant was as follows: the first complete remission (CR1) in 29 patients, CR2 in 5, and 9 patients were transplanted in marrow aplasia (MA). Twenty-seven patients were FLT3 MRD negative at transplant. Median time from diagnosis to transplant was 16.7 months. Post-allograft CR rate was 88%. The relapse incidence (RI) was lower for patients who were FLT3 MRD negative at transplant when compared with those with FLT3 MRD positivity (41% vs 59%; p = 0.01). The patients who eradicated FLT3/ITD at day + 30 after transplant had lower RI than those with detectable FLT3/ITD (23% vs 76%; p = <0.001). The 2-year LFS and OS were 53% and 54%, with the median OS and LFS of 28 months and 27 months, respectively. Patients with CR1/2 and FLT3 MRD(-) had a 2-year OS of 80%. The FLT3 MRD negativity at transplant prolonged LFS in multivariate analysis (HR 5.3 95%CI 1.97-14.2); p < 0.001), whereas FLT3 MRD negativity and unrelated donor predicted favorable OS.","['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",PMC7340651,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'FLT3/ITD mutation', 'Leukemia-free survival', 'Minimal residual disease', 'Overall survival']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 24.,"Stroke is an important complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Nevertheless, few studies have been published to analyzed the occurrence and prognosis of stroke after allo-HSCT. From January 2007 to December 2018 in Peking University People's Hospital, 6449 patients received HSCT and there were 2.3% of patients diagnosed with stroke after allo-HSCT (hemorrhagic: 1.0%, ischemic: 1.3%). The median time to hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke after HSCT was 161 days and 137 days, respectively. In total, 8.4% of patients experienced neurological sequelae. The outcome was much worse in patients with stroke than in control subjects. The comparison of prognosis showed no statistical differences between patients with hemorrhagic stroke and those with ischemic stroke. Significant risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke were pretransplant central nervous system leukemia (CNSL), and delayed platelet engraftment. Risk factors associated with the occurrence of ischemic stroke included high-risk disease, prior venous thromboembolism (VTE), grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Haplo-identical transplantation was not a risk factor for stroke and had no impact on the prognosis compared with HLA-matched HSCT. Altogether, these results show that stroke is a severe complication after allo-HSCT. The prognosis of posttransplant stroke did not differ between hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke.",,,,,"['81670116/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)', '7171013/Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality (Beijing Natural', 'Science Foundation)', 'H2018206423/Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality (Beijing Natural', 'Science Foundation)', 'Z171100001017084/Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, robust transcriptional profiling is difficult using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, which complicates testing in clinical and archival material. We present MethCORR, an approach that allows uniform molecular characterization and classification of fresh-frozen and FFPE samples. MethCORR identifies genome-wide correlations between RNA expression and DNA methylation in fresh-frozen samples. This information is used to infer gene expression information in FFPE samples from their methylation profiles. MethCORR is here applied to methylation profiles from 877 fresh-frozen/FFPE samples and comparative analysis identifies the same two subtypes in four independent cohorts. Furthermore, subtype-specific prognostic biomarkers that better predicts relapse-free survival (HR = 2.66, 95%CI [1.67-4.22], P value < 0.001 (log-rank test)) than UICC tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging and microsatellite instability status are identified and validated using DNA methylation-specific PCR. The MethCORR approach is general, and may be similarly successful for other cancer types.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",PMC7181739,,,['R01 CA207467/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['Nat Commun. 2020 Jun 3;11(1):2880.

Several studies report outcomes of COVID-19 in predominately well persons. There are also some data on COVID-19 in persons with predominately solid cancer but controversy whether these persons have the same outcomes. We conducted a cohort study at two centres in Wuhan, China, of 128 hospitalised subjects with haematological cancers, 13 (10%) of whom developed COVID-19. We also studied 226 health care providers, 16 of whom developed COVID-19 and 11 of whom were hospitalised. Co-variates were compared with the 115 subjects with haematological cancers without COVID-19 and with 11 hospitalised health care providers with COVID-19. There were no significant differences in baseline co-variates between subjects with haematological cancers developing or not developing COVID-19. Case rates for COVID-19 in hospitalised subjects with haematological cancers was 10% (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 6, 17%) compared with 7% (4, 12%; P = 0.322) in health care providers. However, the 13 subjects with haematological cancers had more severe COVID-19 and more deaths compared with hospitalised health care providers with COVID-19. Case fatality rates were 62% (32, 85%) and 0 (0, 32%; P = 0.002). Hospitalised persons with haematological cancers have a similar case rate of COVID-19 compared with normal health care providers but have more severe disease and a higher case fatality rate.

Here we adapt the HyperTRIBE method using an RBP fused to a Drosophila RNA editing enzyme (ADAR) to globally map the mRNA targets of the RBP MSI2 in mammalian adult normal and malignant stem cells. We reveal a unique MUSASHI-2 (MSI2) mRNA binding network in hematopoietic stem cells that changes during transition to multipotent progenitors. Additionally, we discover a significant increase in RNA binding activity of MSI2 in leukemic stem cells compared with normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, resulting in selective regulation of MSI2's oncogenic targets.

We sought to establish the frequency and outcome of adolescent and adult BCR-ABL1-like ALL using a novel RNA-Seq signature in a series of patients with BCP-ALL. To this end, we developed and tested an RNA-Seq custom panel of 42 genes related to a BCR-ABL1-like signature in a cohort of 100 patients with BCP-ALL and treated with risk-adapted ALL trials. Mutations related to BCR-ABL1-like ALL were studied in a panel of 33 genes by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Also, CRLF2 overexpression and IKZF1/CDKN2A/B deletions were analyzed. Twenty out of 79 patients (12-84 years) were classified as BCR-ABL1-like (25%) based on heatmap clustering, with significant overexpression of ENAM, IGJ, and CRLF2 (P </= 0.001). The BCR-ABL1-like subgroup accounted for 29% of 15-60-year-old patients, with the following molecular characteristics: CRLF2 overexpression (75% of cases), IKZF1 deletions (64%), CDKN2A/B deletions (57%), and JAK2 mutations (57%). Among patients with postinduction negative minimal residual disease, those with the BCR-ABL1-like ALL signature had a higher rate of relapse and lower complete response duration than non-BCR-ABL1-like patients (P = 0.007). Thus, we have identified a new molecular signature of BCR-ABL1-like ALL that correlates with adverse prognosis in adult patients with ALL.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",PMC7182567,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test the hypothesis, the risk of incident primary cancer was estimated among survivors of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) and compared to a random population cohort.Nation-wide population-based matched cohort study. Cases of SAB were identified from a national database and incident primary cancers were ascertained by record linkage. Incidence rate (IR) and ratio (IRR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of 27 cancers was calculated by Poisson regression.During the first year of follow-up, 165 and 943 incident cases of cancer occurred in the case cohort (n = 12,918 (1.3%)) and the population cohort (n = 117,465 (0.8%)) for an IR of 3.78 (3.22-4.40) and 2.28 (2.14-2.43) per 100,000 person-years. The IRR was 1.65 (1.40-1.95). Of 27 cancers, 7 cancers occurred more frequently amongst cases than controls: cervical cancer (IRR 37.83 (4.23-338.47)), multiple myeloma (IRR 6.31 (2.58-15.44)), leukemia (IRR 4.73 (2.21-10.10)), sarcoma (IRR 4.73 (1.18-18.91)), liver cancer (IRR 3.64 (1.30-10.21)), pancreatic cancer (IRR 2.8 (1.27-6.16)), and urinary tract cancer (IRR 2.58 (1.23-5.39)). Compared to the control population, the risk of cancer was higher for those without comorbidity and with younger age. The overall risk of cancer during 2 to 5 years of follow-up was not increased (IRR 0.99 (95% CI: 0.89-1.11). However, the risk of pharyngeal cancer was increased (IRR 1.88 (1.04-3.39)) and the risk of liver cancer remained increased (IRR 3.93 (2.36-6.55)).The risk of primary incident cancer was 65% higher in the SAB cohort compared to the population cohort during the first year of follow-up and included 7 specific cancers.

Epub 2020 Apr 24.,"The NSD2 p.E1099K (EK) mutation is observed in 10% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples with enrichment at relapse indicating a role in clonal evolution and drug resistance. To discover mechanisms that mediate clonal expansion, we engineered B-precursor ALL (B-ALL) cell lines (Reh, 697) to overexpress wildtype (WT) and EK NSD2, but observed no differences in proliferation, clonal growth, or chemosensitivity. To address whether NSD2 EK acts collaboratively with other pathways, we used short hairpin RNAs to knockdown expression of NSD2 in B-ALL cell lines heterozygous for NSD2 EK (RS4;11, RCH-ACV, SEM). Knockdown resulted in decreased proliferation in all lines, decreased clonal growth in RCH-ACV, and increased sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, although the pattern of drug sensitivity varied among cell lines implying that the oncogenic properties of NSD2 mutations are likely cell context specific and rely on cooperative pathways. Knockdown of both Type II and REIIBP EK isoforms had a greater impact than knockdown of Type II alone, suggesting that both SET containing EK isoforms contribute to phenotypic changes driving relapse. Furthermore, in vivo models using both cell lines and patient samples revealed dramatically enhanced proliferation of NSD2 EK compared with WT and reduced sensitivity to 6-mercaptopurine in the relapse sample relative to diagnosis. Finally, EK-mediated changes in chromatin state and transcriptional output differed dramatically among cell lines further supporting a cell context-specific role of NSD2 EK. These results demonstrate a unique role of NSD2 EK in mediating clonal fitness through pleiotropic mechanisms dependent on the genetic and epigenetic landscape. IMPLICATIONS: NSD2 EK mutation leads to drug resistance and a clonal advantage in childhood B-ALL.","['0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (NSD2 protein, human)']",PMC7415532,,,"['T32 CA009161/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA140729/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['(c)2020 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,['NIHMS1587498'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A panoramic radiography showed his third upper maxillary left tooth included into the maxillary bone. The patient presented with a febrile episode. Consequently, the infectious gateway was researched. A left maxillary sinus migration of his third upper left tooth together with a bony sequestrum has been observed on a CT-scan. A surgery was then performed to remove the bony sequestrum and the tooth. The first hypothesis of tooth migration could be that the patient had an infection prior to introduction of chemotherapy. However, neither clinical or radiographic signs were observed during the initial check-up. The second hypothesis is that ATO caused osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) induced the formation of a bony sequestrum associated to the tooth migration into the sinus.

Epub 2020 Apr 21.,"The anti-apoptotic ability of Mcl-1Delta127, a caspase cleavage product of Mcl-1, is debated. We here used fluorescence imaging to assess the anti-apoptotic capacity of Mcl-1Delta127 in living cells. Fluorescence imaging of living cells expressing CFP-Mcl-1Delta127 showed that Mcl-1Delta127 existed mainly in cytoplasm. Fluorescence imaging of living cells co-expressing CFP-Mcl-1Delta127 and YFP-Bak, CFP-Mcl-1Delta127 and YFP-BimL, CFP-Mcl-1Delta127 and YFP-Puma or CFP-Mcl-1Delta127 and YFP-tBid showed that Mcl-1Delta127 markedly inhibited the oligomerization of Bak, BimL, Puma and tBid on mitochondria and also inhibited the Bak-, BimL-, Puma- or tBid-mediated cell death, resulting in their partial localization in cytoplasm. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging proved that Mcl-1Delta127 bound to Bak, BimL, Puma and tBid, respectively. Fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) analyses showed that Mcl-1Delta127 did prevent Bak oligomerization by retrotranslocating Bak from mitochondria into cytoplasm. Collectively, Mcl-1Delta127 has the same anti-apoptotic capacity as Mcl-1, and prevents apoptosis by sequestering BH3-only or Bak proteins, thus inhibiting their oligomerization on mitochondria.","['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*BH3-only proteins', '*Bak', '*Fluorescence imaging', '*Mcl-1Delta127']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, micro- and nano-fibrillated cellulose were prepared from rice straw and used as drug carriers. Both carriers in addition to another one which is nano silicon dioxide were characterized with various techniques. Methotrexate was chosen to be loaded on nano-fibrillated cellulose and nano silicon dioxide. Both methotrexate carriers were evaluated for their possible protective role against renal fibrosis induced by methotrexate in leukemia rat model. Results of this study exhibited that loading methotrexate on either nano-fibrillated cellulose or nano silicon dioxide seems to have an ameliorative role on renal function tests, inflammatory and fibrotic markers of renal tissues. Moreover, the sustained release of methotrexate for long time period maintained by nano-fibrillated cellulose carrier gives it more priority than nano silicon dioxide to be used as an effective novel drug carrier in further medical applications with minimal side effects on kidney tissue in leukemia model.","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)', '9004-34-6 (Cellulose)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Inflammation', 'Methotrexate', 'Micro-fibrillated cellulose', 'Nano-fibrillated cellulose', 'Renal fibrosis', 'Silicon dioxide']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, the mutations that cause AEL and the cell(s) that sustain the bilineage leukemia phenotype remain unknown. We here show that combined biallelic Cebpa and Gata2 zinc finger-1 (ZnF1) mutations cooperatively induce bilineage AEL, and that the major leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) population has a neutrophil-monocyte progenitor (NMP) phenotype. In pre-leukemic NMPs Cebpa and Gata2 mutations synergize by increasing erythroid transcription factor (TF) expression and erythroid TF chromatin access, respectively, thereby installing ectopic erythroid potential. This erythroid-permissive chromatin conformation is retained in bilineage LICs. These results demonstrate that synergistic transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming by leukemia-initiating mutations can generate neomorphic pre-leukemic progenitors, defining the lineage identity of the resulting leukemia.","['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)']",PMC7218711,['NOTNLM'],"['*CEBPA', '*GATA2', '*acute erythroid leukemia', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*chromatin accessibility', '*leukemia-initiating cell', '*lineage priming', '*oncogene co-operation']","['MC_UU_00016/11/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/L008963/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12009/11/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12025/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U137961146/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12009/7/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G1000729/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0900892/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12009/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0902418/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors.

Epub 2020 Apr 23.,"Tumor cells orchestrate their microenvironment. Here, we provide biochemical, structural, functional, and clinical evidence that Cathepsin S (CTSS) alterations induce a tumor-promoting immune microenvironment in follicular lymphoma (FL). We found CTSS mutations at Y132 in 6% of FL (19/305). Another 13% (37/286) had CTSS amplification, which was associated with higher CTSS expression. CTSS Y132 mutations lead to accelerated autocatalytic conversion from an enzymatically inactive profrom to active CTSS and increased substrate cleavage, including CD74, which regulates major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II)-restricted antigen presentation. Lymphoma cells with hyperactive CTSS more efficiently activated antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells in vitro. Tumors with hyperactive CTSS showed increased CD4(+) T cell infiltration and proinflammatory cytokine perturbation in a mouse model and in human FLs. In mice, this CTSS-induced immune microenvironment promoted tumor growth. Clinically, patients with CTSS-hyperactive FL had better treatment outcomes with standard immunochemotherapies, indicating that these immunosuppressive regimens target both the lymphoma cells and the tumor-promoting immune microenvironment.","['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (invariant chain)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.22.27 (cathepsin S)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*T cell activation', '*antigen processing and presentation', '*cathepsin S', '*cysteine-protease', '*follicular lymphoma', '*immune microenvironment']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 The Author(s).

The 3q rearrangements reposition a GATA2 enhancer near the EVI1 (or MECOM) locus, which results in both EVI1 overexpression and GATA2 haploinsufficiency. However, the mechanisms explaining how the misexpression of these 2 genes individually contribute to leukemogenesis are unknown. To clarify the characteristics of differentiation defects caused by EVI1 and GATA2 misexpression and to identify the cellular origin of leukemic cells, we generated a system to monitor both inv(3) allele-driven EVI1 and Gata2 expression in 3q-rearranged AML model mice. A cell population in which both EVI1 and Gata2 were highly induced appeared in the bone marrows before the onset of frank leukemia. This population had acquired serial colony-forming potential. Because hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and Mks were enriched in this peculiar population, we analyzed the independent EVI1 and GATA2 contributions to HSPC and Mk. We found that inv(3)-driven EVI1 promotes accumulation of Mk-biased and myeloid-biased progenitors, Mks, and platelets, and that Gata2 heterozygous deletion enhanced Mk-lineage skewing of EVI1-expressing progenitors. Notably, inv(3)-directed EVI1 expression and Gata2 haploinsufficient expression cooperatively provoke a leukemia characterized by abundant Mks and platelets. These hematological features of the mouse model phenocopy those observed in human 3q AML. On the basis of these results, we conclude that inv(3)-driven EVI1 expression in HSPCs and Mks collaborates with Gata2 haploinsufficiency to provoke Mk-lineage skewing and leukemogenesis with excessive platelets, thus mimicking an important feature of human AML.","['0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",PMC7189294,,,['P01 HL146372/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that rather than a surrogate for overall survival (OS), improvement in EFS may decrease the use of health care. In this retrospective study, we identified 400 patients with AML who were treated on first-line therapy trials and had OS between 2 and 36 months. We captured health care use from diagnosis until death or until the patient was censored at stem cell transplantation (SCT). We used correlation and regression analysis to determine the relation between health care use and EFS. Among patients with newly diagnosed AML, 35% had adverse-risk AML, 48% received intensive chemotherapy, and 28% received hypomethylating agents. The median EFS censored at SCT was 9.7 months. Longer EFS led to a significant decline in health care use regardless of OS. This held true for all observations, including overall health care use (r = -0.45), sum of clinic visits, emergency room visits, hospitalizations, consultations (r = -0.44), sum of invasive procedures, laboratory and imaging studies (r = -0.51), and blood product transfusions (r = -0.19). These correlations were stronger for patients who achieved a complete remission and held true across age, treatment, and disease risk subgroups. In patients with newly diagnosed AML, improvement in EFS correlates with a decrease in all health care use irrespective of OS duration.",,PMC7189295,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ninety patients were treated: 34 in dose escalation (part 1) and 56 in dose expansion (part 2). Doses of 800 to 5000 mg per day in divided doses were tested. No maximally tolerated dose was reached. Plasma inhibitory assay demonstrated that patients dosed with >/=3000 mg had sufficient levels of active drug in their trough plasma samples to achieve 95% inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation in an FLT3-ITD AML cell line. Based on a plateau in drug exposure, the 3000-mg dose was chosen as the recommended phase 2 dose. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhea (50%), fatigue (47%), and nausea (46%). Based on modified response criteria, the overall response rate to pexidartinib among all patients was 21%. Twenty-three percent of patients treated at >/=2000 mg responded. The overall composite complete response rate for the study was 11%. Six patients were successfully bridged to transplantation.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) plus arsenic trioxide (ATO) is a well-established treatment for patients with standard-risk APL, but it is not well defined for those with high-risk APL. In a prior study of patients with high-risk APL, the addition of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) to ATO plus ATRA suggested benefit. The SWOG Cancer Research Network conducted a phase 2 study to confirm the efficacy and safety of the combination of ATRA plus ATO plus GO in treating high-risk APL patients. The primary end points were 3-year event-free survival (EFS) and early (6-week) death rates associated with this combination. Seventy patients were treated. With a median follow-up of 3.4 years, the 3-year EFS and overall survival estimates were 78% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67%-86%) and 86% (95% CI, 75%-92%), respectively. Overall, 86% of patients achieved complete response. The 6-week mortality rate was 11%. The most common treatment-emergent toxicities during the induction phase included febrile neutropenia, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase elevation, hyperglycemia, hypoxia, headache, and prolonged QT interval corrected for heart rate. Retinoic acid syndrome occurred in 9% of patients. Approximately 37% of patients did not complete all planned courses of postremission therapy. The combination of ATRA plus ATO plus GO in high-risk APL patients was effective and generally well tolerated, suggesting an opportunity to offer a chemotherapy-free induction platform for patients with this disease.

Epub 2020 Apr 24.,"PURPOSE: The benefits and risks of supplementation with antioxidants during cancer therapy have been a controversial area. Few studies have systematically evaluated dietary intake of antioxidants with toxicity and survival in childhood cancer. We sought to determine the role of dietary intake of antioxidants on rates of infections, mucositis, relapse, and disease-free survival during induction and postinduction phases of therapy among children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 794 children in a prospective clinical trial for treatment of ALL. Dietary intake was prospectively evaluated by a food frequency questionnaire. The association between dietary intake of antioxidants and treatment-related toxicities and survival were evaluated with the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (q) and logistic regression and the Kaplan-Meier method, respectively. RESULTS: Dietary surveys were available for analysis from 614 (77%), and 561 (71%) participants at diagnosis and at end of induction, respectively. Of 513 participants who completed the dietary surveys at both time points, 120 (23%) and 87 (16%) experienced a bacterial infection and 22 (4%) and 55 (10%) experienced mucositis during the induction or postinduction phases of treatment, respectively. Increased intake of dietary antioxidants was associated with significantly lower rates of infection and mucositis. No association with relapse or disease-free survival was observed. Supplementation was not associated with toxicity, relapse, or survival. CONCLUSION: Consumption of antioxidants through dietary intake was associated with reduced rates of infection or mucositis, with no increased risk of relapse or reduced survival. Dietary counseling on a well-balanced diet that includes an array of antioxidants from food sources alone may confer a benefit from infections and mucositis during treatment of childhood ALL.",['0 (Antioxidants)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 24.,"A majority of infant and pediatric leukemias are caused by the mixed-lineage leukemia gene (MLL) fused with a variety of candidates. Several underlying mechanisms have been proposed. One currently popular view is that truncated MLL1 fusion and its associated complex constitutively hijacks super elongation complex, including positive transcription elongation factor b, CDK9, and cyclin T1 complex and DOT1L, to enhance the expression of transcription factors that maintain or restore stemness of leukocytes, as well as prevent the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. An alternative emerging view proposes that MLL1-fusion promotes the recruitment of TATA binding protein and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) initiation complex, so as to increase the expression levels of target genes. The fundamental mechanism of both theories are gain of function for truncated MLL1 fusions, either through Pol II elongation or initiation. Our recent progress in transcription regulation of paused Pol II through JMJD5, JMJD6, and JMJD7, combined with the repressive role of H3K4me3 revealed by others, prompted us to introduce a contrarian hypothesis: the failure to shut down transcribing units by MLL-fusions triggers the transformation: loss of function of truncated MLL1 fusions coupled with the loss of conversion of H3K4me1 to H3K4me3, leading to the constitutive expression of transcription factors that are in charge of maintenance of hematopoietic progenitor cells, may trigger the transformation of normal cells into cancer cells. Following this track, a potential treatment to eliminate these fusion proteins, which may ultimately cure the disease, is proposed.","['0 (Histones)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (histone H3 trimethyl Lys4)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*CDK9', '*JMJD5', '*JMJD6', '*MLL-fusion', '*RNA polymerase II']",['T32 AI007405/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conocarpus genus is an ornamental tree native to coastal and riverine areas of East Africa and is also planted as an ornamental plant in different areas of Pakistan. This genus has proved medicinal value as a cytotoxic, antibacterial, antiprotozoal, anti-leishmanial, antifungal and antidiabetic agent. OBJECTIVE: The current study was designed to screen the selected pharmacological attributes of sulphur containing novel compound isolated from Conocarpus lancifolius using a series of in vitro and molecular docking models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After collection and authentication of plant material, methanolic extract was prepared from which various secondary metabolites were qualitatively examined. The compound was isolated using open column chromatography and the structure was established with spectroscopic techniques such as UV-visible, infrared spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR), 13C NMR (BB, DEPT-135, 90), twodimensional correlation techniques (HMBC, HSQC) and mass spectrometry (HRMS) respectively. C. lancifolius extract and isolated compound were studied for cytotoxic and antifungal potentials using in vitro Sulforhodamine B (SRB) and disc diffusion methods, respectively. Molecular docking studies were conducted to check the interaction of the isolated compound with major oncogenic proteins. RESULTS: Qualitative phytochemical screening revealed the presence of saponins, steroids, flavonoids, anthraquinones, and cardiac glycosides while alkaloids were absent in C. lancifolius extract. Isolated compound was characterized as lancifoliate, which showed cytotoxic activity towards a variety of cancer cell lines including murine lymphocytic leukemia (P-388, IC50 = 2.65mug/ml), human colon cancer (Col-2, IC50 = 0.84mug/ml), human breast cancer (MCF-7, IC50 = 0.72mug/ml) while no cytotoxic activity was observed towards human lung cancer (Lu-1), rat normal glioma cells (ASK, IC50 = 11.6mug/ml) and human embryonic kidney cells (Kek293, IC50 = 6.74mug/ml) respectively. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of Lancifoliate towards Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus nigar (skin sample), Aspergillus flavus (pleural fluid) and Candida albicans (urine and blood samples) was found to be 54.5, 44.8, 43.5, 22.4 and 20.2mug/ml respectively. Moreover, docking results are in strong agreement with our experimental finding, which has identified lancifoliate to be a more potent antiproliferative agent than previously known compound ellipticine. CONCLUSION: C. lancifolius extract and lancifoliate possess potent cytotoxic and antifungal properties and thus has potential to be further studied. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that highlights isolation, identification and pharmacological activities of lancifoliate from Conocarpus lancifolius.","['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Phytochemicals)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'Y4S76JWI15 (Methanol)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Combretaceae', '*Conocarpus lancifolius', '*antifungal', '*cytotoxic activity', '*methanol extract', '*molecular docking']",,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 15-23% of AML genomes harbor mutations in one of two isoforms of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1 or IDH2). These enzymes are constitutive mediators of basic cellular metabolism, but their mutated forms in cancer synthesize an abnormal metabolite, 2- hydroxyglutarate, that in turn acts as a competitive inhibitor of multiple gene regulatory enzymes. As a result, leukemic IDH mutations cause changes in genome structure and gene activity, culminating in an arrest of normal myeloid differentiation. These discoveries have motivated the development of a new class of selective small molecules with the ability to inhibit the mutant IDH enzymes while sparing normal cellular metabolism. These agents have shown promising anti-leukemic activity in animal models and early clinical trials, and are now entering Phase 3 study. This review will focus on the growing preclinical and clinical data evaluating IDH inhibitors for the treatment of IDH-mutated AML. These data suggest that inducing cellular differentiation is central to the mechanism of clinical efficacy for IDH inhibitors, while also mediating toxicity for patients who experience IDH Differentiation Syndrome. Ongoing trials are studying the efficacy of IDH inhibitors in combination with other AML therapies, both to evaluate potential synergistic combinations as well as to identify the appropriate place for IDH inhibitors within existing standard-of-care regimens.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

One of the most important mechanisms leading to the occurrence of MDR is related to the modulation of cellular death pathways. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of quercetin (Q) on triggering the programed death of human promyelocytic leukemia sensitive cells HL60 as well as multidrug resistant HL60/VINC cells overexpressing P-glycoprotein and HL60/MX2 cells characterized by the presence of mutated alpha isoform of topoisomerase II and the absence of beta isoform of this enzyme. Q exerted comparable cytotoxic activities toward sensitive HL60 cells and their MDR counterparts. It was also found that this compound modulated the cellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and led to the marked decrease in cellular GSH level. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that Q used at IC50 and IC90 significantly increased the percentage of sub-G1 subpopulation of all studied leukemia cells causing oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation. The present study also indicated that Q used at IC90 triggers predominantly programed cell death of sensitive HL60 cells and their MDR counterparts by induction of apoptosis occurring with the involvement of caspase-3 and caspase-8 as well as by lysosome membrane permeabilization-dependent mechanisms.",['9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 143 pediatric recipients from January 2015 to June 2019 who were diagnosed pulmonary aGVHD or infections within 100 days after allo-HSCT were enrolled in this study. Two observers evaluated the extent and distribution (unilateral, bilateral) of the CT patterns. The patterns were then classified as ground-glass opacity (GGO) (localized, patchy, diffuse), consolidation (localized, patchy, diffuse), reticulation (localized, patchy, diffuse), nodules (localized, multiple), bronchiectasis, pleural effusion, air trapping, tree-in-bud sign, and pneumomediastinum. The onset time and radiological patterns of the two cohorts were statistically compared. RESULTS: The mean onset time of aGVHD (n = 85) and infections group (viral n = 29, bacterial n = 22, fungal n = 7, total n = 58) was 36.89 +/- 24.34 (range, 10-99 days) and 23.48 +/- 20.65 days (range, 4-94 days) with a significant difference (P = .001). The top three underlying diseases were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 49, 57.6%); acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 24, 28.2%); and aplastic anemia (AA) (7.1%) in aGVHD group and hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) (n = 33, 56.9%); AA (n = 9, 15.5%); and ALL (n = 6, 10.3) in infection group. GGO (41.2%) in aGVHD prevailed on CT, whereas GGO (53.4%) and consolidations (43.1%) were more prevalent in infections. The distribution of GGO showed more diffuse in aGVHD (P = .031) and symmetric while patchier GGO prefers infections (P < .001). No differences were found in the reticulation. Nodules were more common in infections (P = .004) while pleural effusion was more common in aGVHD group (P < .035). CONCLUSION: Imaging patterns of aGVHD on CT differ substantially from that of infections. Physicians and radiologists should be aware of such radiological differences in order to give accurate treatment. Notably, definite diagnosis should be made in combination with clinical manifestations, signs, and laboratory tests.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute graft-versus-host disease', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'child', 'computed tomography', 'infection', 'lung']",,['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 May 4.,"Benzene is a global pollutant and has been established to cause leukemia. To better understand the role of DNA methylation in benzene toxicity, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from six benzene-poisoning patients and six matched controls for genome-wide DNA methylation screening by Illumina Infinium Methylation 450 BeadChip. The Gene Chip Human Gene 2.0 ST Array (Affymetrix) was used to analyze global mRNA expression. Compared with the corresponding sites of controls, 442 sites in patients were hypermethylated, corresponding to 253 genes, and 237 sites were hypomethylated, corresponding to 130 genes. The promoter methylation and mRNA expression of CSF3R, CREB5, and F2R were selected for verification by bisulfite sequencing and real-time PCR in a larger data set with 21 cases and 23 controls. The results indicated that promoter methylation of CSF3R (p = .005) and F2R (p = .015) was significantly higher in cases than in controls. Correlation analysis showed that the promoter methylation of CSF3R (p < .001) and F2R (p < .001) was highly correlated with its mRNA expression. In the poisoning cases, neutrophil percentage was significantly different among the high, middle, and low CSF3R-methylation groups (p = .002). In particular, the neutrophil percentage in the high CSF3R-methylation group (48.10 +/- 9.63%) was significantly lower than that in the low CSF3R-methylation group (59.30 +/- 6.26%) (p = .012). The correlation coefficient between promoter methylation in CSF3R and the neutrophil percentage was -0.445 (p = .020) in cases and - 0.398 (p = .060) in controls. These results imply that hypermethylation occurs in the CSF3R promoter due to benzene exposure and is significantly associated with a reduction in neutrophils.","['0 (CSF3R protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*CSF3R', '*DNA methylation', '*benzene', '*microarray', '*neutrophils']",['National Natural Science Foundation of China/International'],"['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this work is to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for ibrutinib and its dihydrodiol metabolite to quantify pharmacokinetic inter- and intra-individual variability, to evaluate the impact of several covariates on ibrutinib pharmacokinetic parameters, and to examine the relationship between exposure and clinical outcome. METHODS: Patients treated with ibrutinib were included in the study and followed up for 2 years. Pharmacokinetic blood samples were taken from months 1 to 12 after inclusion. Ibrutinib and dihydrodiol-ibrutinib concentrations were assessed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using NONMEM version 7.4. RESULTS: A total of 89 patients and 1501 plasma concentrations were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. The best model consisted in two compartments for each molecule. Absorption was described by a sequential zero first-order process and a lag time. Ibrutinib was either metabolised into dihydrodiol-ibrutinib or excreted through other elimination routes. A link between the dosing compartment and the dihydrodiol-ibrutinib central compartment was added to assess for high first-pass hepatic metabolism. Ibrutinib clearance had 67% and 47% inter- and intra-individual variability, respectively, while dihydrodiol-ibrutinib clearance had 51% and 26% inter- and intra-individual variability, respectively. Observed ibrutinib exposure is significantly higher in patients carrying one copy of the cytochrome P450 3A4*22 variant (1167 ng.h/mL vs 743 ng.h/mL, respectively, p = 0.024). However, no covariates with a clinically relevant effect on ibrutinib or dihydrodiol-ibrutinib exposure were identified in the PK model. An external evaluation of the model was performed. Clinical outcome was expressed as the continuation or discontinuation of ibrutinib therapy 1 year after treatment initiation. Patients who had treatment discontinuation because of toxicity had significantly higher ibrutinib area under the curve (p = 0.047). No association was found between cessation of therapy due to disease progression and ibrutinib area under the curve in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. For the seven patients with mantle cell lymphoma studied, an association trend was observed between disease progression and low exposure to ibrutinib. CONCLUSIONS: We present the first population pharmacokinetic model describing ibrutinib and dihydrodiol-ibrutinib concentrations simultaneously. Large inter-individual variability and substantial intra-individual variability were estimated and could not be explained by any covariate. Higher plasma exposure to ibrutinib is associated with cessation of therapy due to the occurrence of adverse events within the first year of treatment. The association between disease progression and ibrutinib exposure in patients with mantle cell lymphoma should be further investigated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov no.

Imatinib is the pioneer phenylaminopyrimidine derivative kinase inhibitor, which is used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. With a hybrid approach, a novel series of 5-benzylidene-2-arylimino-4-thiazolidinone derivatives containing phenylaminopyrimidine core were designed, synthesized, and tested for their anticancer activity on K562 (chronic myeloid leukemia), PC3 (prostat cancer), and SHSY-5Y (neuroblastoma) cells. Since superior anticancer activity was observed on K562 cells, further biological studies of selected compounds (8, 15, and 34) were performed on K562 cells. For the synthesis of designed compounds, thiourea compounds were converted to 2-imino-1,3-thiazolidin-4-ones with alpha-chloroacetic acid in the presence of sodium acetate. 5-Benzylidene-2-imino-1,3-thiazolidin-4-one derivatives were obtained by Knoevenagel condensation of 2-imino-1,3-thiazolidin-4-ones with related aldehydes. Compounds 8, 15, and 34 were evaluated for cell viability, apoptosis studies, cell cycle experiments, and DNA damage assays. IC50 values of compounds 8, 15, and 34 were found as 5.26 +/- 1.03, 3.52 +/- 0.91, and 8.16 +/- 1.27 muM, respectively, in K562 cells. Preferably, these compounds showed less toxicity towards L929 cells compared to imatinib. Furthermore, compounds 8 and 15 significantly induced early and late apoptosis in a time-dependent manner. Compounds 15 and 34 induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and compound 8 caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. Based on DNA damage assay, compounds 8 and 15 were found to be more genotoxic than imatinib towards K562 cells. To put more molecular insight, possible Abl inhibition mechanisms of most active compounds were predicted by molecular docking studies. In conclusion, a novel series of 5-benzylidene-2-arylimino-4-thiazolidinone derivatives and their promising anticancer activities were reported herein.","['0 (4-thiazolidinone)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazolidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['2-Arylimino-4-thiazolidinone derivatives', 'Anticancer agents', 'Apoptosis', 'Molecular docking', 'Phenylaminopyrimidines']","['ECZ-046/ECZ-046', 'SAG-C-DRP-111115-0502/SAG-C-DRP-111115-0502']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 23.,"Warthin tumor is one of the most common benign salivary gland tumors. Overt lymphoma is known to occur in the lymphoid stroma of Warthin tumor. In situ follicular neoplasia is difficult to identify in routine histologic examination of lymphoid tissue and has not been reported in association with Warthin tumor. Our objective is to determine the prevalence of overt malignant lymphoma and in situ follicular neoplasia in Warthin tumor. We conducted a retrospective histological evaluation of 89 sequential Warthin tumor cases with available slides and blocks from the years 2010-2019. Of these, 84 cases were subjected to immunohistochemical testing, while 5 cases had been previously worked up for the suspicion of lymphoma. We identified two additional cases of lymphoid neoplasia associated with Warthin tumor including small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 1) and in situ follicular neoplasia (n = 1) in addition to previously reported case of follicular lymphoma included in this study. The prevalence rate of first-time detected lymphoid neoplasia in Warthin tumor is 3.4%. The prevalence rate of overt lymphoma is 2.2%, while the prevalence of in situ follicular neoplasia is 1.1%. We propose histologic criteria to identify small lymphocytic lymphoma and follicular lymphoma in Warthin tumor. These include a monotonous interfollicular expansion of small lymphocytes and germinal centers composed of a monotonous population of lymphocytes without polarity or tingible body macrophages respectively. It is very important for pathologists to perform a diligent morphological examination and perform immunohistochemistry in suspected cases to identify subtle involvement of Warthin tumor by lymphoma. In patients with involvement of Warthin tumor by in situ follicular neoplasia, concurrent lymphoma in the same tissue and other sites should be considered. Patients without overt lymphoma elsewhere likely have a low risk of progression to follicular lymphoma. The low prevalence of in situ follicular neoplasia in Warthin tumor, combined with the low rate of clinical progression to lymphoma, make routine screening of Warthin tumor for in situ follicular neoplasia unnecessary.",,PMC7669968,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic lymphoma/small lymphocytic lymphoma', 'Follicular lymphoma', 'In situ follicular neoplasia', 'Lymph node', 'Lymphoma', 'Parotid gland', 'Warthin tumor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 23.,"This study proposes a microfluidic device capable of separating monocytes from a type of cancer cell that is called T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (RPMI-8402) in a continuous flow using negative and positive dielectrophoretic forces. The use of both the hydrodynamic and dielectrophoretic forces allows the separation of RPMI-8402 from monocytes based on differences in their intrinsic electrical properties and sizes. The specific crossover frequencies of monocytes and RPMI-8402 cells have been obtained experimentally. The optimum ranges of electrode pitch-to-channel height ratio at the cross sections with different electrode widths have been generally calculated by numerical simulations of the gradients of the electric field intensities and calculation their effective values (root-mean-square). In the device, the cell sorting has been conducted empirically, and then, the separation performance has been evaluated by analyzing the images before and after dielectrophoretic forces applied to the cells. In this work, the design of a chip with 77 mum gold-titanium electrode pitch was investigated to achieve high purity of monocytes of 95.2%. The proposed device can be used with relatively low applied voltages, as low as 16.5 V (peak to peak). Thus, the design can be used in biomedical diagnosis and chemical analysis applications as a lab-on-chip platform. Also, it can be used for the separation of biological cells such as bacteria, RNA, DNA, and blood cells.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cell separation', 'Dielectrophoresis', 'Microchannel', 'Microfluidics', 'Optimization']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SLPs) were prepared in the presence of oleic acid-coated iron oxide (IO-OA) nanoparticles with 1-tetradecanol and poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) as lipid and stabilizing surfactant-like agents, respectively. The particles, typically ~850 nm in hydrodynamic size, showed heat dissipation under the applied alternating magnetic field. Cytotoxic activity of the mag.SLPs, non-magnetic SLPs, and iron oxide nanoparticles was compared concerning the mammalian cancer cell lines and their drug-resistant counterparts using trypan blue exclusion test and MTT assay. The mag.SLPs exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity against human leukemia cell lines growing in suspension (Jurkat and HL-60/wt), as well as the doxorubicin (Dox)- and vincristine-resistant HL-60 sublines. The mag.SLPs showed higher cytotoxicity toward drug-resistant sublines as compared to Dox. The human glioblastoma cell line U251 growing in a monolayer culture was also sensitive to mag.SLPs cytotoxicity. Staining of U251 cells with the fluorescent dyes Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide (PI) revealed that mag.SLPs treatment resulted in an increased number of cells with condensed chromatin and/or fragmented nuclei as well as with blebbing of the plasma membranes. While the Hoechst 33342 staining of cell suggested the pro-apoptotic activity of the particles, the PI staining indicated the pro-necrotic changes in the target cells. These conclusions were confirmed by Western blot analysis of apoptosis-related proteins, study of DNA fragmentation (DNA laddering due to the inter-nucleosomal cleavage and DNA comets due to single strand breaks), as well as by FACS analysis of the patterns of cell cycle distribution (pre-G1 phase) and Annexin V/PI staining of the treated Jurkat cells. The induction of apoptosis or necrosis by the particles used to treat Jurkat cells depended on the dose of the particles. Production of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) was proposed as a potential mechanism of mag.SLPs-induced cytotoxicity. Accordingly, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical levels in mag.SLPs-treated Jurkat leukemic cells were increased by ~20-40 and ~70%, respectively. In contrast, the non-magnetic SLPs and neat iron oxides did not influence ROS levels significantly. Thus, the developed mag.SLPs can be used for effective killing of human tumor cells, including drug-resistant ones.",,PMC7161697,['NOTNLM'],"['FACS analysis', 'ROS production', 'doxorubicin- and vincristine-resistant sublines', 'fluorescent microscopy', 'human leukemia cells', 'magnetic', 'solid lipid particles', 'temperature sensitive']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Swietek, Panchuk, Skorokhyd, Cernoch, Finiuk, Klyuchivska,', 'Hruby, Molcan, Berger, Trousil, Stoika and Horak.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As such, targeting of BCL-2 family proteins raises hopes for new therapeutic discoveries. Thus, we used multistep screening and filtering approaches that combine structure and ligand-based drug design to identify new, effective BCL-2 inhibitors from a small molecule database (Specs SC), which includes more than 210,000 compounds. This database is first filtered based on binary ""cancer-QSAR"" model constructed with 886 training and 167 test set compounds and common 26 toxicity quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) models. Predicted non-toxic compounds are considered for target-driven studies. Here, we applied two different approaches to filter and select hit compounds for further in vitro biological assays and human cell line experiments. In the first approach, a molecular docking and filtering approach is used to rank compounds based on their docking scores and only a few top-ranked molecules are selected for further long (100-ns) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and in vitro tests. While docking algorithms are promising in predicting binding poses, they can be less prone to precisely predict ranking of compounds leading to decrease in the success rate of in silico studies. Hence, in the second approach, top-docking poses of each compound filtered through QSAR studies are subjected to initially short (1 ns) MD simulations and their binding energies are calculated via molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) method. Then, the compounds are ranked based on their average MM/GBSA energy values to select hit molecules for further long MD simulations and in vitro studies. Additionally, we have applied text-mining approaches to identify molecules that contain ""indol"" phrase as many of the approved drugs contain indole and indol derivatives. Around 2700 compounds are filtered based on ""cancer-QSAR"" model and are then docked into BCL-2. Short MD simulations are performed for the top-docking poses for each compound in complex with BCL-2. The complexes are again ranked based on their MM/GBSA values to select hit molecules for further long MD simulations and in vitro studies. In total, seven molecules are subjected to biological activity tests in various human cancer cell lines as well as Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) assay.

The only curative option is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Recent data showing that aberrant DNA methylation plays a significant role in pathogenesis and correlates with clinical risk suggest a possible benefit of hypomethylating agents (HMA) in JMML treatment. Aim: The aim is to report the results of HMA-based therapy with 5-azacytidine (AZA) in three JMML patients treated in a single center, non-participating in EWOG-MDS study. Methods: The diagnosis and treatment response were evaluated according to international consensus criteria. AZA 75 mg/m(2) intravenous (i.v.) was administered once daily on days 1-7 of each 28-day cycle. All patients were monitored for hematologic response, spleen size, and evolution of extramedullary disease. Targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) were performed after the 3rd AZA cycle and before SCT to evaluate the molecular alterations and genetic response. Results: Three patients diagnosed with JMML were treated with AZA (off-label indication) in Pediatric Department of Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania between 2017 and 2019. There were two females and one male with median age 11 months, range 2-16 months. The cytogenetic analysis showed normal karyotype in all patients. Molecular analysis confirmed KRAS G13D mutation in two patients and NRAS G12D mutation in one patient. The clinical evaluation showed important splenomegaly and hepatomegaly in all 3 pts. One patient received AZA for early relapse after haploidentical HSCT and the other two patients received upfront AZA, as bridging therapy before HSCT. After HMA therapy, 2/3 patients achieved clinical partial response (cPR), 1/3 had clinical stable disease (cSD) and all had genetic stable disease (gSD) after 3 cycles and were able to receive the planned HSTC. One patient achieved clinical and genetic complete response before HSCT. During 22 cycles of AZA there were only four adverse events but only one determined dose reduction and treatment delay. Conclusion: Our data show that AZA monotherapy is safe and effective in controlling disease both in upfront and relapsed patients in order to proceed to HSCT.",,PMC7161089,['NOTNLM'],"['azacytidine', 'epigenetics', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia', 'methylation', 'mutation']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Marcu, Colita, Radu, Jercan, Bica, Asan, Coriu, Tanase,', 'Diaconu, Mambet, Botezatu, Pasca, Teodorescu, Anton, Gurban and Colita.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the absence of protective immunity, as in allogeneic bone marrow transplant patients, HAdV infections can become lethal. Alarmingly, various outbreaks of highly pathogenic, pneumotropic HAdV types have been recently reported, causing severe and lethal respiratory diseases. Effective drugs for treatment of HAdV infections are still lacking. The repurposing of drugs approved for other indications is a valuable alternative for the development of new antiviral therapies and is less risky and costly than de novo development. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is approved for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Here, it is shown that ATO is a potent inhibitor of HAdV. ATO treatment blocks virus expression and replication by reducing the number and integrity of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, important subnuclear structures for HAdV replication. Modification of HAdV proteins with small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) is also key to HAdV replication. ATO reduces levels of viral SUMO-E2A protein, while increasing SUMO-PML, suggesting that ATO interferes with SUMOylation of proteins crucial for HAdV replication. It is concluded that ATO targets cellular processes key to HAdV replication and is relevant for the development of antiviral intervention strategies.",,PMC7175289,['NOTNLM'],"['antivirals', 'arsenic', 'human adenoviruses', 'promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies', 'small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO)']",,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Many strategies have therefore been employed to express high levels of recombinant proteins in plants. Although foreign domains are fused to target proteins for high expression or as an affinity tag for purification, the retention of foreign domains on a target protein may be undesirable, especially for biomedical purposes. Thus, their removal is often crucial at a certain time point after translation. Here, we developed a new strategy to produce target proteins without foreign domains. This involved in vivo removal of foreign domains fused to the N-terminus by the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) domain/SUMO-specific protease system. This strategy was tested successfully by generating a recombinant gene, BiP:p38:bdSUMO : His:hLIF, that produced human leukemia inhibitory factor (hLIF) fused to p38, a coat protein of the Turnip crinkle virus; the inclusion of p38 increased levels of protein expression. The recombinant protein was expressed at high levels in the leaf tissue of Nicotiana benthamiana. Coexpression of bdSENP1, a SUMO-specific protease, proteolytically released His:hLIF from the full-length recombinant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum of N. benthamiana leaf cells. His:hLIF was purified from leaf extracts via Ni(2+)-NTA affinity purification resulting in a yield of 32.49 mg/kg, and the N-terminal 5-residues were verified by amino acid sequencing. Plant-produced His:hLIF was able to maintain the pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells. This technique thus provides a novel method of removing foreign domains from a target protein in planta.",,PMC7160244,['NOTNLM'],"['Nicotiana benthamiana', 'human leukemia inhibitory factor', 'mouse embryonic stem cells', 'plant-based expression systems', 'small ubiquitin-related modifier', 'small ubiquitin-related modifier-specific protease']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Islam, Choi, Muthamilselvan, Shin and Hwang.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As part of the program, pregnant women are invited to take an HTLV-1 antibody screening test, usually within the first 30 weeks of gestation, during regular pregnancy checkups. Pregnant women tested positive on the antibody screening test undergo a confirmatory test, either western blotting or line immunoassay. In indeterminate case, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used as a final test to diagnose infection. Pregnant women tested positive on a confirmatory or PCR test are identified as HTLV-1 carriers. As breastfeeding is a predominant route of postnatal HTLV-1 mother-to-child transmission, exclusive formula feeding is widely used as a postnatal preventive measure. Although there is insufficient evidence that short-term breastfeeding during </=3 months does not increase the risk of mother-to-child transmission compared to exclusive formula feeding, this feeding method is considered if the mother is eager to breastfeed her child. However, it is important that mothers and family members fully understand that there is an increase in the risk of mother-to-child transmission when breastfeeding would be prolonged. As there are only a few clinical studies on the protective effect of frozen-thawed breastmilk feeding on mother-to-child transmission of HTLV-1, there is little evidence to recommend this feeding method. Further study on the protective effects of these feeding methods are needed. It is assumed that the risk of anxiety or depression may increase in the mothers who selected exclusive formula feeding or short-term breastfeeding. Thus, an adequate support and counseling for these mothers should be provided. In addition to raising public awareness of HTLV-1 infection, epidemiological data from the nationwide program needs to be collected and analyzed. In most cases, infected children are asymptomatic, and it is necessary to clarify how these children should be followed medically.",,PMC7160230,['NOTNLM'],"['confirmatory test', 'human T-cell leukemia virus type-1', 'infection', 'mother-to-child transmission', 'nationwide antenatal screening', 'prevention']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Itabashi, Miyazawa, Sekizawa, Tokita, Saito, Moriuchi, Nerome,', 'Uchimaru and Watanabe.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate whether oncolytic virotherapy can increase immune responses to tumor antigens in human subjects, we studied T-cell responses against a panel of known myeloma TAAs using PBMC samples obtained from ten myeloma patients before and after systemic administration of an oncolytic measles virus encoding sodium iodide symporter (MV-NIS). Despite their prior exposures to multiple immunosuppressive antimyeloma treatment regimens, T-cell responses to some of the TAAs were detectable even before measles virotherapy. Measurable baseline T-cell responses against MAGE-C1 and hTERT were present. Furthermore, MV-NIS treatment significantly (P < 0.05) increased T-cell responses against MAGE-C1 and MAGE-A3. Interestingly, one patient who achieved complete remission after MV-NIS therapy had strong baseline T-cell responses both to measles virus proteins and to eight of the ten tested TAAs. Our data demonstrate that oncolytic virotherapy can function as an antigen agnostic vaccine, increasing cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses against TAAs in patients with multiple myeloma, providing a basis for continued exploration of this modality in combination with immune checkpoint blockade.","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Symporters)', '4XE5NDT4K1 (sodium-iodide symporter)']",PMC7581629,,,"['P50 CA186781/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA125614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA168719/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000135/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS1607335'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although numerous oncolytic viruses have been developed for testing in solid tumors, only a few have been reported to target acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and overall patient survival has remained low. We previously developed the oncolytic adenovirus rAd5pz-zTRAIL-RFP-SDelta24E1a (A4), which carries the viral capsid protein IX linked to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and results in increased infection of cancer cells and improved tumor targeting. To further improve the therapeutic potential of A4 by enhancing the engagement of virus and leukemia cells, we generated a new version of A4, zA4, by coating A4 with additional soluble TRAIL that is fused with a leucine zipper-like dimerization domain (zipper). ZA4 resulted in enhanced infectivity and significant inhibition of the proliferation of AML cells from cell lines and primary patient samples that expressed moderate levels of TRAIL-related receptors. ZA4 also elicited enhanced anti-AML activity in vivo compared with A4 and an unmodified oncolytic adenoviral vector. In addition, we found that the ginsenoside Rh2 upregulated the expression of TRAIL receptors and consequently enhanced the antitumor activity of zA4. Our results indicate that the oncolytic virus zA4 might be a promising new agent for treating hematopoietic malignancies such as AML.","['0 (Ginsenosides)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '78214-33-2 (ginsenoside Rh2)']",PMC7181830,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A population pharmacokinetic (popPK) model was developed, identifying patient characteristics explaining these variabilities. Patients (n=92) were treated according to the DCOG ALL-11 protocol, using therapeutic drug monitoring to individualize the PEGasparaginase doses. Non-linear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM) was used to analyze the popPK evaluating several covariates. The final model was validated using an independent database (n=28). Guidelines for starting doses and dose adjustments were developed. A one-compartment model with time-dependent clearance adequately described the popPK. Normalization of clearance and volume of distribution by body surface are (BSA) reduced inter-individual variability. Clearance was 0.084 L/day/m2 for 12.7 days, increasing with 0.082 L/day/m2/day thereafter. Clearance was 38% higher during an infection, and 11-19% higher during induction treatment than intensification and maintenance (p<0.001). Targeting an asparaginase activity level of 100 IU/L, a loading dose of 800 IU/m2 (induction) and 600 IU/m2 (intensification) is advised. In conclusion, variability of PEGasparaginase activity levels can be explained by BSA, treatment phase and the occurrence of an infection.

Malignant cell growth is characterized by disruption of normal intracellular signaling, caused by mutations or aberrant external signaling. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway) is among one of the intracellular pathways aberrantly upregulated in cancers including AML. Activation of this pathway seems important in leukemogenesis, and given the central role of this pathway in metabolism, the bioenergetics of AML cells may depend on downstream signaling within this pathway. Furthermore, observations suggest that constitutive activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway differs between patients, and that increased activity within this pathway is an adverse prognostic parameter in AML. Pharmacological targeting of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway with specific inhibitors results in suppression of leukemic cell growth. However, AML patients seem to differ regarding their susceptibility to various small-molecule inhibitors, reflecting biological heterogeneity in the intracellular signaling status. These findings should be further investigated in both preclinical and clinical settings, along with the potential use of this pathway as a prognostic biomarker, both in patients receiving intensive curative AML treatment and in elderly/unfit receiving AML-stabilizing treatment.","['0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",PMC7215987,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Akt', 'PI3K', 'chemotherapy', 'mTOR', 'metabolism', 'signaling']","['Kreftforeningen/Kreftforeningen', 'Helse Vest/Helse Vest Regionalt Helseforetak']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to assess the correlation between metabolic profiles and CV-AEs in CML patients treated with TKIs. METHODS: We investigated 39 adult CML patients in chronic-phase (mean age 49 years, range 24-70 years), with no comorbidities evidenced at baseline, who were consecutively identified with CML and treated with imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and ponatinib. All patients performed Gas-Chromatography-Mass-Spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis and were divided into two groups (with and without CV-AEs). RESULTS: Ten CV-AEs were documented. Seven CV-AEs were rated as 3 according to the Common Toxicity Criteria, and one patient died of a dissecting aneurysm of the aorta. The patients' samples were clearly separated into two groups after analysis and the main discriminant metabolites were tyrosine, lysine, glutamic acid, ornithine, 2-piperdinecarboxylic acid, citric acid, proline, phenylalanine, threonine, mannitol, leucine, serine, creatine, alanine, and 4-hydroxyproline, which were more abundant in the CV-AE group. Conversely, myristic acid, oxalic acid, arabitol, 4-deoxy rithronic acid, ribose, and elaidic acid were less represented in the CV-AE group. CONCLUSIONS: CML patients with CV-AEs show a different metabolic profile, suggesting probable mechanisms of endothelial damage.",,PMC7231160,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'GC-MS metabolomics', 'cardiovascular adverse events', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is associated with the occurrence of several syndromes of fatal diseases, including the development of lymphomas. Studies on FeLV have been reported in Colombia, and most of them have been approached from a clinical point of view. However, only a few studies have focused on the prevalence of the infection, while none have clarified which variant or FeLV viral subgroup is presently circulating in our country. Therefore, the present study investigated the prevalence of the infection associated with the molecular characterization of FeLV present in cats in Aburra Valley, Colombia. The sampling of privately owned and shelter cats was performed in female (n = 54) and male (n = 46) felines; most of them were seemingly healthy according to the owner's report, with nonspecific clinical history. Immunoassay confirmed that 59.44% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 49.81-69.06%) of felines were FeLV seropositive. The molecular testing of felines using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing showed that 30% (30/100) of felines were positive, and the most prevalent subgroup in the Aburra Valley was FeLV-A. In conclusion, the frequency of leukemia virus, as revealed by molecular and serological tests, is one of the highest reported frequencies to date, and a high molecular variation is shown in the Colombian population. More studies on the behaviour of the virus in feline populations in Columbia are warranted to determine its prevalence throughout the country.",,PMC7232207,['NOTNLM'],"['*feline viral leukemia', '*retrovirus', '*subgroup classification']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the majority of patients do not benefit from single-agent ICI and therefore new combination strategies are eagerly necessitated. In addition to conventional chemotherapy, kinase inhibitors as well as tumor-specific vaccinations are extensively investigated in combination with ICI to augment therapy responses. An unprecedented clinical outcome with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-)T cell therapy has led to the approval for relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia whereas response rates in solid tumors are unsatisfactory. Immune-checkpoints negatively impact CAR-T cell therapy in hematologic and solid malignancies and as a consequence provide a therapeutic target to overcome resistance. Established biomarkers such as programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) help to select patients who will benefit most from ICI, however, biomarker negativity does not exclude responses. Investigating alterations in the antigen presenting pathway as well as radiomics have the potential to determine tumor immunogenicity and response to ICI.

Ablation of the gene encoding p66Shc in the Emicro-TCL1 mouse model of human CLL enhances leukemogenesis and promotes leukemic cell invasiveness in both nodal and extranodal organs, providing in vivo evidence of the pathogenic role of the p66Shc defect in CLL pathogenesis.

A highly metastatic potential mouse colon cancer cell subline, Colon-26MGS, was derived from the parental cell line Colon-26 by in vivo selection using continuous subcutaneous implanting to immunocompetent mice. To clarify the mechanisms involved in the enhancement of metastasis, morphological characteristics, cell proliferation, and gene expression profiles were compared between Colon-26MGS and the parental cell. Colon-26MGS showed over 10 times higher metastatic ability compared with the parental cell, but there were no differences in morphological characteristics and in vitro proliferation rates. In addition, the Colon-26MGS-bearing mice exhibited no marked change of splenocyte population and lung pre-metastatic niche with tumor-free mice, but there were significant differences compared to Colon-26-bearing mice. RNA-seq analyses indicated that immune costimulatory molecules were significantly up-regulated in Colon-26MGS. These results suggest that Colon-26MGS showed not only higher metastatic activity, but also less induction property of host immune response compared to parental Colon-26.

Epub 2020 Apr 20.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells change their metabolic program between normoxia and hypoxia, possibly affecting cytotoxic drug potency by altering mitochondria-related cell stress responses (MRCSR) including mitophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, and mitochondrial proteostasis. We evaluated in CLL cells from nine patients, the single and multiple-combined drug potency of arsenic trioxide (ATO), valproic acid (VPA), vincristine (VCR) and MG132 as four pharmacological sensors influencing mitochondrial apoptosis, mitochondrial biogenesis, mitophagy, and mitochondrial proteostasis respectively, under normoxia and hypoxia to force hypoxia-induced metabolic reprogramming (HMR). Untreated cells from all patients remained viable under O2 levels below 0.5% for 72 h. We obtained 21 measures of drug potency and interaction at 50% effect level that we denoted drug potency signature (DPS). Using the comparative DPS between normoxia and hypoxia, two non-supervised classification algorithms discriminated CLL patients with active disease (ADT) and stable disease (NAD) and showed complete consistency with their clinical characteristics. In ADT group under hypoxia, the potency of MG132 was increased, the interaction of ATO + VPA and ATO + VPA + VCR shifted towards antagonism, and ATO + VPA + VCR + MG132 shifted towards synergism, indicating a prominent role of mitochondrial proteostasis. Classification of patients based on DPS, depended on the contrasting response of drugs under hypoxia and normoxia, owing to HMR. Using these drugs as pharmacological sensors, we linked the metabolic arrangement of CLL cells under hypoxia, to potency of drugs targeting MRCSR, and to the clinical features of individual patients, therefore providing new sources of data on disease progression, drug response and risk prognosis.",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*Drug interactions', '*Hypoxia', '*Metabolic reprogramming', '*Regulated cell death']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2020 Apr 20.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the epidemiological characteristics and survival rates of children with acute myeloid leukemia treated in hospitals in southern Brazil and compare them with international data. METHODS: A multicenter cohort study was conducted with retrospective data collection of all new patients with acute myeloid leukemia under 18 treated at five referral centers in pediatric hematology-oncology in southern Brazil between January 2005 and December 2015. RESULTS: Of the 149 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, 63.0% (n=94) were male. The median age at diagnosis was 10.5 years (range 0-18 years) and 40.3% (n=60) had a white blood cell count below 50,000/mm(2). The most common Franco-American-British (FAB) subtype was M3 (n=43, 28.9%). Nine (6.0%) patients had central nervous system disease. In M3 patients, overall survival (OS) was 69.2% and 3-year event-free survival was 67.7%; in non-M3 patients, these rates were 45.3% and 36.7%, respectively. In non-M3 patients, OS was significantly different between transplanted (61.8%) and non-transplanted (38.2%) patients (p=0.031). CONCLUSIONS: These results show a higher prevalence of the Franco-American-British M3 subtype than that reported in the international literature, as well as a decreased OS compared with that of developed countries. Further multicenter Brazilian studies with a larger sample size are encouraged to better understand the characteristics of acute myeloid leukemia, and to improve the treatment and prognosis in this population.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Childhood', '*Epidemiology']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria.

Itacitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK)1-selective inhibitor that has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models of aGVHD. We report results from the first registered study of a JAK inhibitor in patients with aGVHD. This was an open-label phase 1 study enrolling patients aged >/=18 years with first HCT from any source who developed grade IIB to IVD aGVHD. Patients with steroid-naive or steroid-refractory aGVHD were randomized 1:1 to itacitinib 200 mg or 300 mg once daily plus corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability; day 28 overall response rate (ORR) was the main secondary endpoint. Twenty-nine patients (200 mg, n = 14; 300 mg, n = 15) received >/=1 dose of itacitinib and were included in safety and efficacy assessments. One dose-limiting toxicity was reported (grade 3 thrombocytopenia attributed to GVHD progression in a patient receiving 300 mg itacitinib with preexisting thrombocytopenia). The most common nonhematologic treatment-emergent adverse event was diarrhea (48.3%, n = 14); anemia occurred in 11 patients (38%). ORR on day 28 for all patients in the 200-mg and 300-mg groups was 78.6% and 66.7%, respectively. Day 28 ORR was 75.0% for patients with treatment-naive aGVHD and 70.6% in those with steroid-refractory aGVHD. All patients receiving itacitinib decreased corticosteroid use over time. In summary, itacitinib was well tolerated and demonstrated encouraging efficacy in patients with steroid-naive or steroid-refractory aGVHD, warranting continued clinical investigations.

Among 28 genes sequenced by both platforms, a total of 39 unique somatic mutations were detected. Five mutations (13%) were detected only in ccfDNA, and 15 (38%) were detected only in bone marrow. Among the 19 mutations detected in both sources, the concordance of variant allelic frequency (VAF) assessment by both methods was high (R2 = 0.849). Mutations detected in only 1 source generally had lower VAF than those detected in both sources, suggesting that either method may miss small subclonal populations. In 3 patients, sequencing of ccfDNA detected new or persistent leukemia-associated mutations during remission that appeared to herald overt relapse. Overall, this study demonstrates that sequencing of ccfDNA in patients with AML can identify clinically relevant mutations not detected in the bone marrow and may play a role in the assessment of measurable residual disease.

A key question is the nature of the corresponding changes in chromatin conformation and its relationship to the transcriptome during this process. This question is especially intriguing since this trans-differentiation is not associated with progression through mitosis, often considered a necessary step for gross changes in chromosomal structure. Here, we characterized the transcriptional and genomic structural changes during macrophage development of primary human monocytes using RNA-seq and in situ Hi-C. We found that, during this transition, the genome architecture undergoes a massive remodeling to a degree not observed before between structured genomes, with changes in ~90% of the topologically associating domains (TADs). These changes in the TADs are associated with changed expression of immunological genes. These structural changes, however, differ extensively from those described recently in a study of the leukemia cell line, THP-1. Furthermore, up-regulation of the AP-1 family of genes that effected functionally important changes in the genomic structure during the differentiation of the THP-1 cells was not corroborated with the primary cells. Taken together, our results provide a comprehensive characterization of the changes in genomic structure during the monocyte-to-macrophage transition, establish a framework for the elucidation of processes underlying differentiation without proliferation, and demonstrate the importance of verifying with primary cells the mechanisms discovered with cultured cells.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['cellular development', 'contact domains', 'genome architecture', 'trans-differentiation']",,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Here, we propose a classification system based on normal myeloid progenitor cell subset-associated gene signatures (MAGS) for individual assignments of AML subtypes. We generated a MAGS classifier including the progenitor compartments CD34+/CD38- for haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), CD34+/CD38+/CD45RA- for megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs), and CD34+/CD38+/CD45RA+ for granulocytic-monocytic progenitors (GMPs) using regularised multinomial regression with three discrete outcomes and an elastic net penalty. The regularisation parameters were chosen by cross-validation, and MAGS assignment accuracy was validated in an independent data set (N = 38; accuracy = 0.79) of sorted normal myeloid subpopulations. The prognostic value of MAGS assignment was studied in two clinical cohorts (TCGA: N = 171; GSE6891: N = 520) and had a significant prognostic impact. Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analysis using the MAGS subtype, FAB subtype, cytogenetics, molecular genetics, and age as explanatory variables showed independent prognostic value. Molecular characterisation of subtypes by differential gene expression analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, and mutation patterns indicated reduced proliferation and overrepresentation of RUNX1 and IDH2 mutations in the HSC subtype; increased proliferation and overrepresentation of CEBPA mutations in the MEP subtype; and innate immune activation and overrepresentation of WT1 mutations in the GMP subtype. We present a differentiation-dependent classification system for AML subtypes with distinct pathogenetic and prognostic importance that can help identify candidates poorly responding to combination chemotherapy and potentially guide alternative treatments.","['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",PMC7179860,,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiplex polymerase chain reaction with 2 detection methods (agarose gel and gene scanning) was used to detect intragenic deletions and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for whole-gene deletions. Differences between groups (normal vs. deleted IKZF1) were analyzed by the chi test, the Kaplan-Meier test was used to calculate relapse-free survival and overall survival, and Cox regression was performed for multivariant analysis. Minimum follow-up was 4.5 years. Incidence of IKZF1 deletions was 12.9% (n=20), with an equal amount of intragenic and complete gene deletions. Adverse karyotype (P=0.048), high-risk category (P=0.030), occurrence of relapse (P=0.021), and medullar relapse (P=0.011) were statistically associated with the presence of deletions in IKZF1. Relapse-free survival at 54 months was lower in patients harboring an IKZF1 deletion than that in patients with IKZF1-wt (40.0% vs. 66.7%; P=0.014).

We conducted a systematic review to investigate the role of bisphosphonates in reducing pain, improving mobility, and stabilizing lesions in pediatric leukemia survivors. METHODS: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we searched the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. Five of 221 articles retrieved met our inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Bisphosphonates, especially when combined with dietary calcium and vitamin D supplements and physical therapy (supplements/PT) were associated with improved pain and mobility in 54% and 50% of patients, respectively. A significantly greater proportion of patients treated with bisphosphonates (83%) reported mild/moderate pain or no pain compared with those with supplements/PT alone (36%) (P<0.001). Sixty-six percent of patients treated with bisphosphonates achieved improved/full mobility compared with 27% of those treated with supplements/PT alone (P=0.02). However, 46% of patients showed progressive joint destruction despite bisphosphonate therapy. No adverse events were reported, except for acute phase reactions to intravenous therapies.

Epub 2020 Jun 19.,"Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are innate-like CD1d-restricted T cells that express the invariant T cell receptor (TCR) composed of Valpha24 and Vbeta11 in humans. iNKT cells specifically recognize glycolipid antigens such as alpha-galactosylceramide (alphaGalCer) presented by CD1d. iNKT cells show direct cytotoxicity toward CD1d-positive tumor cells, especially when CD1d presents glycolipid antigens. However, iNKT cell recognition of CD1d-negative tumor cells is unknown, and direct cytotoxicity of iNKT cells toward CD1d-negative tumor cells remains controversial. Here, we demonstrate that activated iNKT cells recognize leukemia cells in a CD1d-independent manner, however still in a TCR-mediated way. iNKT cells degranulated and released Th1 cytokines toward CD1d-negative leukemia cells (K562, HL-60, REH) as well as alphaGalCer-loaded CD1d-positive Jurkat cells. The CD1d-independent cytotoxicity was enhanced by natural killer cell-activating receptors such as NKG2D, 2B4, DNAM-1, LFA-1 and CD2, but iNKT cells did not depend on these receptors for the recognition of CD1d-negative leukemia cells. In contrast, TCR was essential for CD1d-independent recognition and cytotoxicity. iNKT cells degranulated toward patient-derived leukemia cells independently of CD1d expression. iNKT cells targeted myeloid malignancies more than acute lymphoblastic leukemia. These findings reveal a novel anti-tumor mechanism of iNKT cells in targeting CD1d-negative tumor cells and indicate the potential of iNKT cells for clinical application to treat leukemia independently of CD1d.","['0 (Antigens, CD1d)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD1D protein, human)', '0 (Costimulatory and Inhibitory T-Cell Receptors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering)']",PMC7385353,['NOTNLM'],"['CD1d', 'CD2', 'LFA-1', 'leukemia', 'natural killer T-Cells']","['Masato Kawano Memorial Public Interest Foundation for Promotion of Pediatrics', 'KAKENHI/18K16108/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', 'Research award for young researchers/Japanese Leukemia Research Fund', 'Therapeutics Research Initiative Grant/2018-Y7,/Chiba University']","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Epub 2020 May 23.,"Treatment-free remission (TFR), in which patients discontinue pharmacotherapy and remain in molecular remission, is an emerging treatment goal for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Attainment of TFR requires an increased frequency of molecular monitoring, to ensure that patients maintain a deep molecular response. The objective of this analysis was to assess the economic impact of stopping nilotinib among Japanese TFR-eligible patients. A Markov model evaluated the economic impact of TFR among the study population, TFR-eligible CML patients diagnosed since 2012. The model compared patients who had discontinued tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment (ie, attempted TFR) with patients that continued TKI treatment. A 3-y time horizon was modeled from a Japanese public payer perspective. Costs associated with drug treatment, hospital/physician visits, and molecular monitoring were considered. TFR-eligible patients were calculated from Japanese CML incidence rates and efficacy was derived from nilotinib trials. Japanese co-payment maximums were utilized to assess the patient perspective. An estimated 761 and 140 patients were eligible for first- and second-line nilotinib, respectively, in 2019. Assuming that 100% of eligible patients complied, TFR was associated with cost savings of yen7 625 174 640 (US$66 567 775) over 3 y. In scenarios with reduced willingness to attempt TFR, cost savings persisted. Achievement of TFR was estimated to markedly reduce out-of-pocket expenses for CML patients, regardless of the timing of relapse. Stopping nilotinib for TFR-eligible patients in Japan may result in significant cost savings to both payers and patients. Monitoring costs contributed little to overall annual costs and decreased over time.","['0 (Pyrimidines)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",PMC7385357,['NOTNLM'],"['budget impact', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'molecular monitoring', 'nilotinib', 'treatment-free remission']",['Novartis Pharma K.K.'],"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Epub 2020 Jul 14.,"Aggressive B-cell lymphomas present as a heterogeneous spectrum of disease. A primary diagnosis in the bone marrow (BM) may be challenging in terms of diagnostic classification and clinical handling, owing to limited architectural information. Aggressive B-cell lymphomas can be subdivided into entities that typically present primarily in the BM, and cases with BM involvement in which the bulk of disease is present in other organs. One main topic at the 2018 BM workshop of the European Association of Haematopathology/Society of Hematopathology was therefore aggressive B-cell lymphomas with a primary BM presentation. The spectrum of cases submitted to this topic gave a good overview of commonly encountered problems, as well as unusual manifestations, and highlighted areas of imprecise disease definitions and diagnostic grey zones. The categories submitted to the workshop included cases of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) with unusual features, high-grade B-cell lymphomas (HG-BCLs) with and without so-called double/triple-hit, and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) with a primary BM presentation. Areas of difficulties included the morphological boundaries of HG-BCL not otherwise specified, cases with MYC and bcl-2 or bcl-6 translocations and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) expression, which were categorised as B-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma if most cells showed TdT positivity, and the clinicopathological overlap between intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, CD5-positive DLBCL, and DLBCL with primary presentations in the BM, spleen, and liver. This review summarises our understanding of the main aggressive B-cell lymphoma categories with a common primary BM presentation and potential problem areas, and makes suggestions for the immunophenotypic and genetic work-up, illustrated by the interesting and challenging cases submitted to the workshop.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['EAHP/SH bone marrow workshop', 'aggressive B-cell lymphoma', 'bone marrow biopsy', 'bone marrow-spleen-liver large B-cell lymphoma', 'diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', 'high-grade B-cell lymphoma', 'intravascular large B-cell lymphoma', 'primary bone marrow presentation']",['IG 2018 21835/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro'],['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Epub 2020 Apr 23.,"Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are a subset of mesenchymal stem cells that their therapeutic effects in various diseases make them an interesting tool in cell therapy. In the current study, we aimed to overexpress interferon-beta (IFN-beta) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) cytokines in human ADSCs to evaluate the impact of this overexpression on human ADSCs properties. Here, we designed a construct containing IFN-beta and LIF and then, transduced human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) by this construct via a lentiviral vector (PCDH-513B). We assessed the ability of long-term expression of the transgene in transduced cells by western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques on Days 15, 45, and 75 after transduction. For the evaluation of stem cell properties, flow cytometry and differentiation assays were performed. Finally, the MTT assay was done to assess the proliferation of transduced cells compares to controls. Our results showed high-efficiency transduction with highest expression rates on Day 75 after transduction which were 70 pg/ml for IFN-beta and 77.9 pg/ml for LIF in comparison with 25.60 pg/ml and 27.63 pg/ml, respectively, in untransduced cells (p = .0001). Also, transduced cells expressed a high level of ADSCs surface markers and successfully differentiated into adipocytes, chondrocytes, neural cells, and osteocytes besides the preservation rate of proliferation near untreated cells (p = .88). All in all, we successfully constructed an hADSC population stably overexpressed IFN-beta and LIF cytokines. Considering the IFN-beta and LIF anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects as well as immune-regulatory properties of hADSCs, the obtained cells of this study could be subjected for further evaluations in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice model.","['0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs)', '*interferon-beta (IFN-beta)', '*lentiviral vector', '*leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)', '*overexpression']",,"['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this systematic review, we compared the prognosis of CTS subtypes overexpression in leukemia and solid tumors, and investigated the effect of different factors on CTS prognosis. We systematically searched published articles indexed in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane library, ISI Web of Science, and EmBase databases from February 2000 until January 2020. Among the selected leukemia and solid tumors studies, overexpression of CTS subtypes in newly diagnosed and treated patients were with poor prognosis in 43 studies (79.6%) and with good prognosis in 9 studies (16.6%). However, there were 2 studies (3.8%) with either good or poor prognosis, depending on conditions and caner stage and host cell. The relation between CTS and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in leukemia and solid tumors was mentioned in 7 studies (13%). Overexpression of CTS subtypes in all new case patients had contributed to the induction of poor prognosis. It seems that CTS subtypes, based on the type of cancer and its stage, the type of host cells, and the probable relation with HLA, breed good or poor prognosis in patients with cancer. Therefore, monitoring the overexpression of CTS subtypes and determining the effect of each of these factors on CTS prognosis could be helpful in predicting cancer prognosis both in newly diagnosed or under treatment patients. They could also be useful in finding ways for improving the efficiency of contemporary therapeutic strategies in various types of leukemia and solid tumors.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*cathepsins', '*human leukocyte antigen', '*leukemia', '*neoplasm']",,"['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 23.,"The transcription factor RUNX1, a pivotal regulator of HSCs and haematopoiesis, is a frequent target of chromosomal translocations, point mutations or altered gene/protein dosage. These modifications lead or contribute to the development of myelodysplasia, leukaemia or platelet disorders. A better understanding of how regulatory elements contribute to fine-tune the RUNX1 expression in haematopoietic tissues could improve our knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for normal haematopoiesis and malignancy insurgence. The cohesin RAD21 was reported to be a regulator of RUNX1 expression in the human myeloid HL60 cell line and during primitive haematopoiesis in zebrafish. In our study, we demonstrate that another cohesin, NIPBL, exerts positive regulation of RUNX1 in three different contexts in which RUNX1 displays important functions: in megakaryocytes derived from healthy donors, in bone marrow samples obtained from adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and during zebrafish haematopoiesis. In this model, we demonstrate that alterations in the zebrafish orthologue nipblb reduce runx1 expression with consequent defects in its erythroid and myeloid targets such as gata1a and spi1b in an opposite way to rad21. Thus, also in the absence of RUNX1 translocation or mutations, additional factors such as defects in the expression of NIPBL might induce haematological diseases.","['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (NIPBL protein, human)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (nipblb protein, zebrafish)']",PMC7294146,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*NIPBL', '*RUNX1', '*haematopoiesis', '*zebrafish']",,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Epub 2020 Apr 23.,"BACKGROUND: Rearrangements of chromosome 8q24/MYC (8q24/MYC-r), resulting from t(8;14)(q24;q32), t(2;8)(p11;q24), or t(8;22)(q24;q11), are mainly associated with Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia (BL) and rarely observed in patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). The characteristics of BCP-ALL with 8q24/MYC-r are poorly understood. PROCEDURE: A retrospective nationwide study of data from patients with pediatric BCP-ALL with 8q24/MYC-r in Japan was conducted to clarify the clinical and biological characteristics associated with 8q24/MYC-r BCP-ALL. RESULTS: Ten patients with BCP-ALL with 8q24/MYC-r, including three with double-hit leukemia (DHL) (two with t(8;14)(q24;q32) and t(14;18)(q32;q21) and one with t(8;14) and t(3;22)(q27;q11)), were identified. Patients with BCP-ALL with 8q24/MYC-r had higher median age and uric acid and lactate dehydrogenase levels, than those without 8q24/MYC-r. All patients were initially treated with ALL-type chemotherapy; however, four, including one with DHL, were switched to BL-type chemotherapy, based on cytogenetic findings. One patient relapsed after standard-risk ALL-type chemotherapy, and two patients with DHL did not attain complete remission with chemotherapy; all three died within 11 months. The other seven patients treated with BL-type or high-risk ALL-type chemotherapy are alive without disease. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical and laboratory features of BL with IG-MYC rearrangement, displaying a BCP immunophenotype (Wagener et al. and Herbrueggen et al. termed it as pre-BLL), are similar to those of BCP-ALL with 8q24/MYC-r. Low-risk ALL-type chemotherapy may not be appropriate for them, and further studies are required to establish an adequate therapeutic strategy. Further studies of DHL to identify new treatment strategies are also needed.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*8q24/MYC rearrangement', '*B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia', '*double-hit lymphoma/leukemia', '*immunophenotype']",,"['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 23.,"INTRODUCTION: Indications for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are primarily dependent on risk stratification at diagnosis and relapse status. We sought to determine whether access to HSCT is influenced by regional and socioeconomic factors. METHODS: Children with newly diagnosed AML aged < 15 years between 2001 and 2015 were identified using the Cancer in Young People in Canada national population-based registry. Factors potentially associated with the receipt of HSCT were studied using univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: Overall, 568 children with newly diagnosed AML were included and 262 (46%) received HSCT. A greater proportion of patients, 103/157 (65.6%), underwent HSCT after first or subsequent relapse compared to 159/411 (38.7%) patients who underwent transplant before relapse. Among patients for whom HSCT would be considered before relapse, factors associated with higher odds of HSCT in a multivariable analysis were: poor versus good-risk cytogenetics (Odds ratio [OR]: 30.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.7-117.0), diagnosis during 2012-2015 versus 2001-2006 (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.6-6.3), diagnosis in eastern Canada versus central Canada (OR: 3.7, 95% CI: 1.9-7.3), and age 10-14 years versus age < 1 year (OR: 5.4, 95% CI: 2.3-12.8). Among patients for whom HSCT would be considered after first relapse, higher odds of HSCT was associated with diagnosis at a HSCT center (OR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.1-4.1). CONCLUSION: Patients diagnosed at a HSCT performing center and patients from eastern Canada had higher odds of receiving HSCT. This may suggest preferential access to HSCT for certain patients.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*access to care', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*geographical', '*hematopoietic stem cell transplant', '*sociodemographic', '*universal health care']",,"['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, only 30% of these cases have fully matched sibling donors (MSDs). Alternatively, matched unrelated donors (MUDs) and haploidentical (haplo) donors from first-degree relatives increase the access to transplantation, with some reported differences in outcomes. The current systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted with the aim of summarizing the results of those studies to compare the efficacy and toxicity of MSD-HSCT and MUD-HSCT versus haplo-HSCT for patients with AML or MDS. Articles published before September 15, 2018, were individually searched for in two databases (MEDLINE and EMBASE) by two investigators. The effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each eligible study were combined using the Mantel-Haenszel method. A total of 14 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The overall survival rates were not significantly different between the groups, with pooled odds ratios of the chance of surviving at the end of the study when comparing haplo-HSCT to MSD-HSCT and comparing haplo-HSCT to MUD-HSCT of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.70 to 1.04; I (2) = 0%) and 1.12 (95% CI: 0.89 to 1.41; I (2) = 33%), respectively. The pooled analyses of other outcomes also showed comparable results, except for the higher grade 2 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) for patients who received haplo-HSCT than those who received MSD-HSCT, and the better GvHD-free, relapse-free survival and the lower chronic GvHD than the patients in the MUD-HSCT group. These observations suggest that haplo-HSCT is a reasonable alternative with comparable efficacy if MSD-HSCT and MUD-HSCT cannot be performed. Nonetheless, the primary studies included in this meta-analysis were observational in nature, and randomized-controlled trials are still needed to confirm the efficacy of haplo-HSCT.",,PMC7444220,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*conditioning regimen', '*haploidentical', '*stem cell', '*transplantation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 22.,"Minimal residual disease (MRD) offers a highly independent prognostic factor for leukemia patients. However, challenges confronting conventional MRD assays are high invasiveness, as well as limited detection sensitivity and clinical applicability. Inspired by the self-adaptive skeleton and multiple suckers or tendrils of climbing plants, a biomimetic Multivalent Aptamer Nanoclimber (MANC)-functionalized microfluidic chip (MANC-Chip) is reported for minimally invasive, highly sensitive and clinically applicable MRD detection in the peripheral blood of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. The MANCs are synthesized by a simple co-polymerization reaction. Due to their flexible structure and cooperative multivalent effect, MANCs dramatically enhance the binding affinity of aptamers targeting leukemia cells. A deterministic lateral displacement-patterned microfluidic chip is designed to further increase the collision probability between MANCs and leukemia cells. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of multivalent binding and enhanced collision, a high capture efficiency of 92.2% for leukemia cells is achieved. Moreover, the captured leukemia cells can be released with high efficiency of 88.9% and high viability of 93.8% via nuclease treatment prior to downstream analysis. Overall, the excellent features of MANC-Chip make it very useful for precise detection of MRD and better understanding of leukemia.",['0 (Oligonucleotides)'],,['NOTNLM'],"['*T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*aptamers', '*microfluidic chips', '*minimal residual disease', '*multivalent effect']",,"['(c) 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Epub 2020 Jun 30.,"OBJECTIVE: Prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and despite the high objective risks associated with HSCT, fear of progression (FoP) has only sparsely been studied in patients with acute leukemia until now. The aim of this study was the assessment of the prevalence of FoP, and any relevant correlates and typical concerns. METHODS: We included 59 adult patients with acute leukemia who were tested prior to their first HSCT during an in-patient stay. Patients completed self-report measures assessing FoP (Fear of Progression Questionnaire-Short Form, FoP-Q-SF) and relevant correlates of FoP (eg, patients' physical state, depression, psychosocial distress, or social support). RESULTS: About one third of the patients (35.6%; n = 21) had high FoP. Higher FoP was associated with previous cancer diagnosis, as well as depression, anxiety, reduced physical functioning, lower mental health-related quality of life, and lower positive social support. The greatest fears reported by these patients reflected common fears of cancer patients (eg, fear about leaving their families behind), but also specific fears related to the current situation (eg, fear of severe medical treatments during the course of the illness). CONCLUSIONS: This was the first study providing an extensive analysis of FoP in leukemia patients prior to the extreme situation of HSCT. FoP is frequent and of major clinical importance for these patients. Hence, we recommend that patients undergo routine screening for FoP, to identify highly distressed patients at an early stage, and to offer targeted support.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*cancer', '*clinical oncology', '*fear of disease progression', '*leukemia', '*psychooncology']",,"['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have revealed that IgM also plays an important role in immune regulation and immunological tolerance. Mice lacking secretory IgM not only exhibit impaired production of antigen-specific IgG and are more susceptible to bacterial and viral infections, but also produce autoantibodies and are prone to develop autoimmune diseases. For many years, IgM has been thought to function predominantly by binding to antigen and activating complement (C') system. It is now clear that IgM can also elicit its function through the IgM Fc receptor (FcmuR). In this chapter, we will review the role of FcmuR in B cell development, maturation, survival and activation, antibody production, host defense against bacterial and viral infections, and B cell tolerance.

However, recent reports have suggested that physician-diagnosed early-life infections increase ALL risk, thereby raising the possibility that stronger responses to infections might promote risk. We examined whether medically diagnosed infections were related to childhood ALL risk in an integrated health-care system in the United States. Cases of ALL (n = 435) diagnosed between 1994-2014 among children aged 0-14 years, along with matched controls (n = 2,170), were identified at Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate risk of ALL associated with history of infections during first year of life and across the lifetime (up to diagnosis). History of infection during first year of life was not associated with ALL risk (odds ratio (OR) = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60, 1.21). However, infections with at least 1 medication prescribed (i.e., more ""severe"" infections) were inversely associated with risk (OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.88). Similar associations were observed when the exposure window was expanded to include medication-prescribed infections throughout the subjects' lifetime (OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.85).",,PMC7670873,['NOTNLM'],"['*childhood ALL', '*childhood leukemia', '*early-life infections', '*medical record']",['R01 CA185058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

The main characteristic of LPs is that they satisfy multiple expansion points and its derivatives as a mechanism to replicate behaviour of the nonlinear problem, giving more accuracy within the region of interest. Therefore, the main contribution of this work is that LP satisfies the successive derivatives in some specific points, resulting more accurate polynomials than Taylor expansion does for the same degree of their respective polynomials. Such characteristic makes of LPs a handy and powerful tool to approximate different kind of differential equations including: singular problems, initial condition and boundary-valued problems, equations with discontinuities, coupled differential equations, high-order equations, among others. Additionally, we show how the process to obtain the polynomials is straightforward and simple to implement; generating a compact, and easy to compute, expression. Even more, we present the process to approximate Gelfand's equation, an equation of an isothermal reaction, a model for chronic myelogenous leukemia, Thomas-Fermi equation, and a high order nonlinear differential equations with discontinuities getting, as result, accurate, fast and compact approximate solutions. In addition, we present the computational convergence and error studies for LPs resulting convergent polynomials and error tendency to zero as the order of LPs increases for all study cases. Finally, a study of CPU time shows that LPs require a few nano-seconds to be evaluated, which makes them suitable for intensive computing applications.",,PMC7160581,['NOTNLM'],"['Differential equations', 'Mathematics', 'Multiple expansions', 'Semi-analytic approximations', 'Taylor series']",,['(c) 2020 The Authors.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although bone morphology protein 2-inducible kinase (BMP2K) has been implied to be a potential target for fasudil, a potent polyploidy-inducing compound, the function of BMP2K in megakaryopoiesis and AMKL remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the role of BMP2K as a novel regulator in megakaryocyte polyploidization and differentiation and its implication in AMKL therapy. Results: BMP2K upregulation was observed in human megakaryopoiesis and leukemia cells whereas BMP2K was downregulated in AMKL cells forced to undergo terminal differentiation. Functionally, BMP2K suppressed MLN8237-induced megakaryocytic differentiation in AMKL cells and dampened megakaryocyte differentiation in primary mouse fetal liver cells. Furthermore, BMP2K overexpression conferred resistance to multiple chemotherapy compounds in AMKL cells. Mechanistically, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) interacted with BMP2K and partially mediated its function. In transient MLN8237 and nocodazole challenge cell model, BMP2K reduced cell percentage of G2/M phase but increased G1 phase, suggesting a role of BMP2K antagonizing polyploidization and promoting mitosis by regulating cell cycle in megakaryopoiesis. Conclusions: BMP2K negatively regulates polyploidization and megakaryocyte differentiation by interacting CDK2 and promoting mitosis in megakaryopoiesis.

Epub 2020 Apr 8.,"Prolonged mitosis often results in apoptosis(1). Shortened mitosis causes tumorigenic aneuploidy, but it is unclear whether it also activates the apoptotic machinery(2). Separase, a cysteine protease and trigger of all eukaryotic anaphases, has a caspase-like catalytic domain but has not previously been associated with cell death(3,4). Here we show that human cells that enter mitosis with already active separase rapidly undergo death in mitosis owing to direct cleavage of anti-apoptotic MCL1 and BCL-XL by separase. Cleavage not only prevents MCL1 and BCL-XL from sequestering pro-apoptotic BAK, but also converts them into active promoters of death in mitosis. Our data strongly suggest that the deadliest cleavage fragment, the C-terminal half of MCL1, forms BAK/BAX-like pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane. MCL1 and BCL-XL are turned into separase substrates only upon phosphorylation by NEK2A. Early mitotic degradation of this kinase is therefore crucial for preventing apoptosis upon scheduled activation of separase in metaphase. Speeding up mitosis by abrogation of the spindle assembly checkpoint results in a temporal overlap of the enzymatic activities of NEK2A and separase and consequently in cell death. We propose that NEK2A and separase jointly check on spindle assembly checkpoint integrity and eliminate cells that are prone to chromosome missegregation owing to accelerated progression through early mitosis.","['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (NEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (NIMA-Related Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.49 (Separase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 22.,"EZH2, a component of the polycomb repressive complex 2, catalyses the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27, a chromatin mark associated with transcriptional repression. EZH2 loss-of-function mutations are seen in myeloid neoplasms and are associated with an adverse prognosis. Missense mutations in the SET/CXC domain abrogate catalytic activity as assessed by in vitro histone methylation assays, but missense mutations clustering in the conserved DI and DII regions retain activity. To understand the role of DI and DII mutations, we initially developed a cell-based histone methylation assay to test activity in a cellular context. Murine induced pluripotent stem cells lacking EZH2 were transiently transfected with wild type or mutant EZH2 (n = 15) and any resulting histone methylation was measured by flow cytometry. All DI mutations (n = 5) resulted in complete or partial loss of methylation activity whilst 5/6 DII mutations retained activity. Next, we assessed the possibility of splicing abnormalities induced by exon 8 mutations (encoding DII) using RT-PCR from primary patient samples and mini-gene assays.

Print 2020 Jun 16.,"RNA modifications play diverse roles in regulating RNA function, and viruses co-opt these pathways for their own benefit. While recent studies have highlighted the importance of N (6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A)-the most abundant mRNA modification-in regulating retrovirus replication, the identification and function of other RNA modifications in viral biology have been largely unexplored. Here, we characterized the RNA modifications present in a model retrovirus, murine leukemia virus (MLV), using mass spectrometry and sequencing. We found that 5-methylcytosine (m(5)C) is highly enriched in viral genomic RNA relative to uninfected cellular mRNAs, and we mapped at single-nucleotide resolution the m(5)C sites, which are located in multiple clusters throughout the MLV genome. Further, we showed that the m(5)C reader protein ALYREF plays an important role in regulating MLV replication. Together, our results provide a complete m(5)C profile in a virus and its function in a eukaryotic mRNA.IMPORTANCE Over 130 modifications have been identified in cellular RNAs, which play critical roles in many cellular processes, from modulating RNA stability to altering translation efficiency. One such modification, 5-methylcytosine, is relatively abundant in mammalian mRNAs, but its precise location and function are not well understood. In this study, we identified unexpectedly high levels of m(5)C in the murine leukemia virus RNA, precisely mapped its location, and showed that ALYREF, a reader protein that specifically recognizes m(5)C, regulates viral production. Together, our findings provide a high-resolution atlas of m(5)C in murine leukemia virus and reveal a functional role of m(5)C in viral replication.","['0 (ALYREF protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)']",PMC7307164,['NOTNLM'],"['*5-methylcytosine', '*ALYREF', '*NSUN2', '*RNA modification', '*epitranscriptome', '*murine leukemia virus', '*retrovirus']","['RM1 HG008935/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 GM126745/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007381/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI141343/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM113194/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Microbiology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in spite of all these new developments, multiple myeloma remains an incurable disease with inevitable relapse in the majority of patients. Venetoclax is a selective antiapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitor that induces cell death in multiple myeloma cells, particularly in those harboring t(11,14)(q13;q32). We report two cases of patients with multiple myeloma with t(11,14)(q13;q32) who were treated with venetoclax/carfilzomib/dexamethasone with rapid initial response; however, the response was short-lived. CASES PRESENTATION: Patient 1 was a 50-year-old Saudi man with International Staging System stage III kappa light chain multiple myeloma with normal karyotype diagnosed in May 2013. He received bortezomib/thalidomide/dexamethasone treatment and underwent autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Three years later, he presented with disease progression and received multiple lines of chemotherapy, including carfilzomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone. Venetoclax/carfilzomib/dexamethasone was started after acquiring t(11,14)(q13;q32) 5 years into his disease course. He achieved complete remission, with disease progression after cycle 6. Patient 2 was a 48-year-old Saudi man with International Staging System stage III immunoglobulin G kappa multiple myeloma with t(11,14)(q13;q32) diagnosed in May 2017. He received bortezomib/thalidomide/dexamethasone treatment and underwent autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Eighteen months later, he had disease progression, and he received multiple lines of chemotherapy, including carfilzomib/dexamethasone. He was shifted to venetoclax/carfilzomib/dexamethasone in April 2019 and had an initial clinical response; two months later, he progressed to plasma cell leukemia with rapid deterioration to multiorgan failure. CONCLUSIONS: Acquired t(11;14)(q13;q32) is unreported in the multiple myeloma literature. In the era of targeted therapy, it is essential to repeat the cytogenetic and multiple myeloma fluorescence in situ hybridization panel with each disease progression. Multiple myeloma remains a challenging hematological malignancy despite advances in personalized/precision medicine.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '72X6E3J5AR (carfilzomib)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",PMC7178736,['NOTNLM'],"['Multiple myeloma', 'Relapsed/refractory', 'Venetoclax', 't(11:14)(q13;q32)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 May 6.,"Here, we present a new series of hydrazide-bearing class I selective HDAC inhibitors designed based on panobinostat. The cap, linker, and zinc-binding group were derivatized to improve HDAC affinity and antileukemia efficacy. Lead inhibitor 13a shows picomolar or low nanomolar IC50 values against HDAC1 and HDAC3 and exhibits differential toxicity profiles toward multiple cancer cells with different FLT3 and p53 statuses. 13a indirectly inhibits the FLT3 signaling pathway and down-regulates master antiapoptotic proteins, resulting in the activation of pro-caspase3 in wt-p53 FLT3-ITD MV4-11 cells. While in the wt-FLT3 and p53-null cells, 13a is incapable of causing apoptosis at a therapeutic concentration. The MDM2 antagonist and the proteasome inhibitor promote 13a-triggered apoptosis by preventing p53 degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that apoptosis rather than autophagy is the key contributing factor for 13a-triggered cell death. When compared to panobinostat, 13a is not mutagenic and displays superior in vivo bioavailability and a higher AUC0-inf value.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Trp53 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9647FM7Y3Z (Panobinostat)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",PMC7684764,,,"['P20 GM103542/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA163452/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001863/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS1644660'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite HyperD being an initiating oncogenic event affiliated with childhood B-ALL, the mitotic and chromosomal defects associated with HyperD B-ALL (HyperD-ALL) remain poorly characterized. Here, we have used 54 primary pediatric B-ALL samples to characterize the cellular-molecular mechanisms underlying the mitotic/chromosome defects predicated to be early pathogenic contributors in HyperD-ALL. We report that HyperD-ALL blasts are low proliferative and show a delay in early mitosis at prometaphase, associated with chromosome-alignment defects at the metaphase plate leading to robust chromosome-segregation defects and nonmodal karyotypes. Mechanistically, biochemical, functional, and mass-spectrometry assays revealed that condensin complex is impaired in HyperD-ALL cells, leading to chromosome hypocondensation, loss of centromere stiffness, and mislocalization of the chromosome passenger complex proteins Aurora B kinase (AURKB) and Survivin in early mitosis. HyperD-ALL cells show chromatid cohesion defects and an impaired spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), thus undergoing mitotic slippage due to defective AURKB and impaired SAC activity, downstream of condensin complex defects. Chromosome structure/condensation defects and hyperdiploidy were reproduced in healthy CD34+ stem/progenitor cells upon inhibition of AURKB and/or SAC. Collectively, hyperdiploid B-ALL is associated with a defective condensin complex, AURKB, and SAC.","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (condensin complexes)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase B)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)']",PMC7413752,,,"['NC/P002412/1/National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of', 'Animals in Research/United Kingdom']",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antithrombin (AT) replacement has been suggested to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) and thus may increase exposure to ASP. We report herein the results of the prophylactic replacement strategy in the pediatrics-inspired prospective GRAALL-2005 study. Between 2006 and 2014, 784 adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia- ALL were included. The incidence rate of VTE was 16%, with 69% of cases occurring during induction therapy. Most patients received AT supplementation (87%). After excluding patients who did not receive L-ASP or who developed thrombosis before L-ASP, AT supplementation did not have a significant impact on VTE. Administration of fibrinogen concentrates was associated with an increased risk of VTE, whereas transfusion of fresh frozen plasma had no effect. Heparin prophylaxis was associated with an increased risk of VTE. Prophylactic measures were not associated with an increased risk of grade 3 to 4 bleeding complications. The rate of VTE recurrence after L-ASP reintroduction was 3% (1 of 34). In ALL patients receiving L-ASP therapy, the use of fibrinogen concentrates may increase the risk of thrombosis and should be restricted to rare patients with hypofibrinogenemia-induced hemorrhage. VTE developed despite extensive AT supplementation, which suggests the need for additional prophylactic measures. Although this large descriptive study was not powered to demonstrate the efficacy of these prophylactic measures, it provides important insight to guide future trial design.

Larval bioassay against Aedes aegypti of V. agnus-castus, O. campechianum and O. carnosum essential oils showed LC50 values of 97.55 +/- 0.35, 81.45 +/- 0.35 and 109.49 +/- 0.35 mug/mL, respectively. The in vitro cytotoxic activities of the essential oils has been evaluated on breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), lung carcinoma (NCI-H292), pro-myelocytic leukemia (HL-60), and cervical adenocarcinoma (HEP-2) human cell lines, and pro-myelocytic leukemia cells lines (HL-60) were found to be the most sensitive to all the essential oils tested than the others. This is the first report on larvicidal and cytotoxic activities of these essential oils.","['0 (Insecticides)', '0 (Oils, Volatile)', '0 (Plant Oils)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on database mining and validated experiments, our present data show that TRPM4 is selectively overexpressed in AML patients and cell lines with the MLL gene rearrangement. We analyzed the correlation between TRPM4 expression and clinical parameters in a validated cohort of AML patients. Increased TRPM4 expression was associated with significant leukocytosis (p = .028), M4/M5 subtype (p = .000), FLT3-ITD mutation (p = .034), MLL status (p = .007) and a higher risk stratification (p = .001). Knockdown of TRPM4 mediated by siRNA impaired proliferation and arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase in MLL-rearranged leukemia cells. We suggested that TRPM4 may be involved in the pathogenesis of MLL-rearranged leukemia through regulating the AKT/GLI1/Cyclin D1 pathway. The transcription factor HOXA9 was found to be responsible for upregulation of TRPM4 expression by binding to its promoter. In conclusion, TRPM4 is overexpressed in MLL-rearranged AML and blockade of TRPM4 may be an alternative therapeutic approach in AML patients with high TRPM4 expression.","['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (TRPM Cation Channels)', '0 (TRPM4 protein, human)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein GLI1)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*HOXA9', '*MLL', '*TRPM4']",,['Copyright (c) 2020.

Because more than 80 fusion partners have been identified to date, the molecular functions of MLL fusion protein complexes appear diverse. However, over the past decade, the common functions utilized for leukemic transformation have begun to be elucidated. It appears that most (if not all) MLL fusion protein complexes utilize the AF4/ENL/P-TEFb and DOT1L complexes to some extent. Based on an understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms, several molecular targeting drugs are being developed, opening paths to novel therapies. Here, we review the recent progress made in identifying the molecular functions of various MLL fusions and categorize the numerous fusion partners into several functionally-distinct groups to help discern commonalities and differences among various MLL fusion protein complexes.","['0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Histone acetyltransferase', '*Histone methyltransferase', '*Leukemia', '*MLL', '*Protein complex', '*Transcription']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast to many other leukemia-associated mutations, several MLL-fusions are powerful oncogenes that transform hematopoietic stem cells but also more committed progenitor cells. Here, I review different approaches that were used to express MLL fusions in the murine hematopoietic system which often, but not always, resulted in highly penetrant and transplantable leukemias that closely phenocopied the human disease. Due to its simple and reliable nature, reconstitution of irradiated mice with bone marrow cells retrovirally expressing the MLL-AF9 fusion became the most frequently in vivo model to study the biology of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). I review some of the most influential studies that used this model to dissect critical protein interactions, the impact of epigenetic regulators, microRNAs and microenvironment-dependent signals for MLL fusion-driven leukemia. In addition, I highlight studies that used this model for shRNA- or genome editing-based screens for cellular vulnerabilities that allowed to identify novel therapeutic targets of which some entered clinical trials. Finally, I discuss some inherent characteristics of the widely used mouse model based on retroviral expression of the MLL-AF9 fusion that can limit general conclusions for the biology of AML.

Epub 2020 Apr 19.,"Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy remains the most important neurological problem of the newborn. Delays in diagnosing perinatal brain injuries are common, preventing access to acute therapies. Therefore, there is a critical need for therapeutic strategies that are beneficial when delivered beyond 24 h after birth. Here we show that Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) functions as an essential injury-induced neurotrophic cytokine in the CNS and that non-invasively administering LIF as late as 3 days after a hypoxic-ischemic insult improves neurological function. Using a mouse model of late preterm brain injury we show that astroglial and microglial/macrophage reactivity to hypoxia-ischemia was diminished at 3 days of recovery, but then exacerbated at 2 weeks of recovery in LIF haplodeficient mice. There also were significantly more CD68+/Iba-1+ cells in the ipsilateral striatum in LIF-Het mice compared to WT mice at 2 weeks of recovery. This desynchronized glial response was accompanied by increased neuronal cell death in the striatum and neocortex (Fluorojade C), hypomyelination (reduced MBP staining and thinner external capsule), increased extent of brain damage (Nissl) and diminished neurological function on sensorimotor tests. To our surprise, injured LIF-Het mice had ~7-fold higher IGF-1 levels than injured WT mice at 3 days after HI injury. Intranasally administered LIF activated the Jak-Stat-3 pathway both within the subventricular zone and the neocortex at 30 min after administration. When delivered with a delay of 3 days after the insult, intranasal LIF reduced the extent of brain injury by ~60%, attenuated astrogliosis and microgliosis in striatum, improved subcortical white matter thickness, increased numbers of Olig2+ cells in corpus callosum and improved performance on sensorimotor tests at 2 weeks of recovery.

Epub 2020 May 22.,"Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 induction is an important cause of drug-drug interactions, making early identification of drug candidates with CYP3A4 induction liability in drug development a prerequisite. Here, we present three-dimensional (3D) spheroid cultures of primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) as a novel CYP3A4 induction screening model. Screening of 25 drugs (12 known CYP3A4 inducers in vivo and 13 negative controls) at physiologically relevant concentrations revealed a 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity of the system. Three of the in vivo CYP3A4 inducers displayed much higher CYP3A4 induction capacity in 3D spheroid cultures as compared with in two-dimensional (2D) monolayer cultures. Among those, we identified AZD1208, a proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) kinase inhibitor terminated in phase I of development due to unexpected CYP3A4 autoinduction, as a CYP3A4 inducer only active in 3D spheroids but not in 2D monolayer cultures. Gene knockdown experiments revealed that AZD1208 requires pregnane X receptor (PXR) to induce CYP3A4. Rifampicin requires solely PXR to induce CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, while phenobarbital-mediated induction of these CYPs did not show absolute dependency on either PXR or constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), suggesting its ability to switch nuclear receptor activation. Mechanistic studies into AZD1208 uncovered an involvement of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway in CYP3A4 induction that is sensitive to the culture format used, as revealed by its inhibition of ERK1/2 Tyrosine 204 phosphorylation and sensitivity to epidermal growth factor (EGF) pressure. In line, we also identified lapatinib, a dual epidermal growth factor receptor/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (EGFR/HER2) inhibitor, as another CYP3A4 inducer only active in 3D spheroid culture. Our findings offer insights into the pathways involved in CYP3A4 induction and suggest PHH spheroids for preclinical CYP3A4 induction screening.","['0 (Constitutive Androstane Receptor)', '0 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers)', '0 (NR1I2 protein, human)', '0 (Pregnane X Receptor)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 1.14.14.55 (CYP3A4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",,,,,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

As a result, novel approaches will be required to achieve cures in more newly diagnosed patients. Multiple immune-based therapies have demonstrated considerable efficacy in the setting of relapsed or refractory (R/R) disease, including CD19 targeting with blinatumomab and tisagenlecleucel and CD22 targeting with inotuzumab ozogamicin.

Transient transfections, luciferase activity assay, RT-qPCR, CCK-8, and Western blot were used to carry out the research.Results: In this study, we found that SNHG4 was downregulated in AML patients compared to healthy participants. SNHG4 and miR-10a can interact with each other. However, overexpression of SNHG4 and miR-10a failed to affect the expression of each other. Instead, SNHG4 overexpression led to upregulated PTEN, a downstream target of miR-10a.

Epub 2020 May 6.,"The nonlinear signal response of electrospray ionization (ESI) presents a critical limitation for mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative analysis. In the field of metabolomics research, this issue has largely remained unaddressed; MS signal intensities are usually directly used to calculate fold changes for quantitative comparison. In this work, we demonstrate that, due to the nonlinear ESI response, signal intensity ratios of a metabolic feature calculated between two samples may not reflect their real metabolic concentration ratios (i.e., fold-change compression), implying that conventional fold-change calculations directly using MS signal intensities can be misleading. In this regard, we developed a quality control (QC) sample-based signal calibration workflow to overcome the quantitative bias caused by the nonlinear ESI response. In this workflow, calibration curves for every metabolic feature are first established using a QC sample injected in serial injection volumes. The MS signals of each metabolic feature are then calibrated to their equivalent QC injection volumes for comparative analysis. We demonstrated this novel workflow in a targeted metabolite analysis, showing that the accuracy of fold-change calculations can be significantly improved. Furthermore, in a metabolomic comparison of the bone marrow interstitial fluid samples from leukemia patients before and after chemotherapy, an additional 59 significant metabolic features were found with fold changes larger than 1.5, and an additional 97 significant metabolic features had fold changes corrected by more than 0.1. This work enables high-quality quantitative analysis in untargeted metabolomics, thus providing more confident biological hypotheses generation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 15.,"The FMSlike tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3ITD) mutation represents the most frequent genetic alteration in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is associated with poor prognosis. The mutation promotes cancer cell survival and proliferation, and shifts their glucose metabolism towards aerobic glycolysis, a frequent alteration in cancer. In the present study, the impact of melatonin on the viability of AML cell lines with (MV411 and MOLM13) or without the FLT3ITD mutation (OCIAML3 and U937) was evaluated. Melatonin induces cell death in AML cells carrying the FLT3ITD mutation, but only inhibits the proliferation of AML cells without this mutation. Consistently, melatonin decreases tumor growth and increases animal survival in a xenograft model of FLT3ITD AML. Toxicity is related to a decrease in glucose uptake, lactate dehydrogenase activity, lactate production and hypoxiainducible factor1alpha activation. Melatonin also regulates the expression of glucose metabolismrelated genes, impairing the balance between anaplerosis and cataplerosis, through the upregulation of the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (PCK2). Collectively, the present findings highlight the regulation of glucose metabolism, currently considered a possible therapeutic target in cancer, as a key event in melatonininduced cytotoxicity, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic tool for the treatment of patients with AML, particularly those carrying the FLT3ITD mutation that results in low basal expression levels of PCK2.","['0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 4.1.1.49 (PCK2 protein, human)', 'EC 4.1.1.49 (Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (ATP))', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*melatonin', '*FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication', '*cancer metabolism', '*gluconeogenesis', '*hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha', '*cell death']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Mar 16.,"First discovered as an oncogene in leukaemia, recent reports highlight an emerging role for the protooncogene BCL3 in solid tumours. Importantly, BCL3 expression is upregulated in >30% of colorectal cancer cases and is reported to be associated with a poor prognosis. However, the mechanism by which BCL3 regulates tumorigenesis in the large intestine is yet to be fully elucidated. In the present study, it was shown for the first time that knocking down BCL3 expression suppressed cyclooxygenase2 (COX2)/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) signalling in colorectal cancer cells, a pathway known to drive several of the hallmarks of cancer. RNAimediated suppression of BCL3 expression decreased COX2 expression in colorectal cancer cells both at the mRNA and protein level. This reduction in COX2 expression resulted in a significant and functional reduction (3050%) in the quantity of protumorigenic PGE2 produced by the cancer cells, as shown by enzyme linked immunoassays and medium exchange experiments. In addition, inhibition of BCL3 expression also significantly suppressed cytokineinduced (TNFalpha or IL1beta) COX2 expression. Taken together, the results of the present study identified a novel role for BCL3 in colorectal cancer and suggested that expression of BCL3 may be a key determinant in the COX2meditated response to inflammatory cytokines in colorectal tumour cells. These results suggest that targeting BCL3 to suppress PGE2 synthesis may represent an alternative or complementary approach to using nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [(NSAIDs), which inhibit cyclooxygenase activity and suppress the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin], for prevention and/or recurrence in PGE2driven tumorigenesis.","['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (BCL3 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*COX-2', '*PGE2', '*BCL-3', '*colorectal cancer', '*hallmarks of cancer']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Feb 20.,"Triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer with a high degree of malignancy. TNBC is prone to distant metastasis and has a poor prognosis. A number of TNBCrelated microRNAs (miRNAs) have been studied and identified. However, the detailed roles of miR5745p in TNBC remain poorly understood. miR5745p, SRY (sex determining region Y)box 2 (SOX2), Bcell lymphoma/leukaemia 11A (BCL11A), SKI like protooncogene (SKIL) and epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT)related miRNAs and proteins were measured by reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR and western blotting analysis, respectively. A luciferase reporter assay was employed to validate the direct targeting of SOX2 and BCL11A by miR5745p. MTT, colony formation and Transwell assays were performed to analyse the biological functions of miR5745p in TNBC cells. A nude mouse xenograft model was used to verify the effects of miR5745p on the tumorigenesis of TNBC in vivo. The results demonstrated that miR5745p levels were decreased in breast cancer tissues and cells. miR5745p repressed proliferation, migration and EMT in TNBC cells. Further experiments confirmed that miR5745p reduced tumour size and metastasis in vivo. miR5745p targeted BCL11A and SOX2 to inhibit the SKIL/transcriptional coactivator with PDZbinding motif/connective tissue growth factor axis, and the inhibitory effect of miR5745p in TNBC cells was at least partly dependent on SOX2 and BCL11A. In addition, the regulation of downstream oncogenes by SOX2 was dependent on BCL11A. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the association between the miR5745p/BCL11A/SOX2 axis and the tumorigenesis of TNBC, which provides a new mechanism for understanding the progression of TNBC.","['0 (BCL11A protein, human)', '0 (CCN2 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN574 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SKIL protein, human)', '0 (SOX2 protein, human)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcriptional Coactivator with PDZ-Binding Motif Proteins)', '0 (WWTR1 protein, human)', '139568-91-5 (Connective Tissue Growth Factor)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*triple-negative breast cancer', '*microRNA-574-5p', '*SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2', '*B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 11A', '*SKI like proto-oncogene', '*epithelial-mesenchymal transition']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study demonstrated that MSI2 was upregulated in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and was inversely associated with the clinical outcome of the patients. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated that the small compound largazole binds to and may be a potential inhibitor of MSI2.

Largazole also inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis of NSCLC and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells (including bone marrow mononuclear cells harvested from CML patients).

METHODS: The clinical data of 725 patients with agranulocytosis in the First Hospital of Lanzhou University from May 2015 to May 2018 were retrospectively analyzed, including sex, age, primary disease, treatment stage, agranulocytosis degree, agranulocytosis duration, nosocomial infection, infectous site, average length of stay and average days of infection. Univariate analysis (Chi-square test) and multivariate analysis (non-conditional Logistic regression models) were used to analyze the risk factors of nosocomial infection. RESULTS: The most common sites of nosocomial infection in agranulocytosis patients with hematological maliguancies were upper respiratory tract, accounting for 24.0%, followed by lung (16.2%) and blood stream (13.8%). In disease composition, acute leukemia holded the first place, accounting for 82.1%, among which the acute myeloid leukemia had the highest infection rate, accounting for 73.3%, followed by acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The infection rates were 68.0% and 66.7% for multiple myeloma, 79.3% and 84.5% for acute leukemia at the initial induction and relapse stages, respectively. 184 pathogenic bacteria were isolated clinically, of which 126 were a Gram-negative bacteria, 23 were Gram-positive bacteria and 35 were fungi, accounting for 68.48%, 12.50% and 19.02%, respectively. It was found that age, primary disease, degree and duration of granulocyte deficiency, chemotherapy, glucocorticoid use and disease status all associated with nosocomial infection (P0.05). Multivariate unconditional logistic regression analysis showed that acute leukemia, absolute count of neutrophils0.2x10(9)/L, chemotherapy and disease unremitting were the main risk factors of nosocomial infection. CONCLUSION: The patients with malignant hematological agranulocytosis are a high-risk population of nosocomial infection. Nosocomial infection rate is still high, especially in patients with acute leukemia who have received chemotherapy or without complete remission or neutrophil absolute count less than 0.2x10(9)/L. Thus early intervention measures should be taken to reduce the incidence of nosocomial infection and mortality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Jurkat cells and HL-60 cells were seeded in PVA+GO aerogel scaffolds for culture, and the structure of cells were observed by the scanning electron microscopy. Cell proliferation activity was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), cell phenotypes were analyzed by flow cytometry after fluorescent staining, then were compared with 2D cultured cells. Ara-C was used in drug resistance experiment, and CCK8 was used to detected cell proliferation activity. RESULTS: The proliferation activity of Jurkat cells grown in aerogel scaffolds was higher than that by 2D cultured in long-term culture. However, in HL-60 cells, the proliferation activity on 3D scaffold only at the 8th to 20th day was higher than that on the traditional 2D culture. Expression of CD4 in Jurkat cells increased after culture for 30 days, but the cell phenotypes in the 3D aerogel scaffolds were similar to 2D cultured cells. Phenotype of HL-60 cells was certainly changed after culture for 30 days, the cells can be divided into CD13(+)CD14(-)CD45(+)HLA-DR(+),CD13(-)CD14(-)-CD45(+)HLA-DR(+) and CD13(-)CD14(-)CD45(+)HLA-DR(-) groups, and a new CD13(+)CD14(-)CD45(-)HLA-DR(+) group of cells appeared in the cells cultured in 3D scaffolds, but not in 2D cultured cells. Drug resistance experiments showed that Jurkat cells in aerogel scaffolds have stronger drug resistance than those in 2D culture. CONCLUSION: PVA+GO (1 wt%) aerogel scaffolds can improve the proliferation and drug resistance of leukemia cells, and the phenotypes were the same as those in 2D culture, which can be used for cell amplification and biology characteristics studies and drug experiments. However, cell phenotypes should be analyzed before culture, and the effects of phenotypes changes on drug resistance should be eliminated.","['0 (graphene oxide)', '7782-42-5 (Graphite)', '9002-89-5 (Polyvinyl Alcohol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 111 patients primarily diagnosed as MDS or MDS/AML were selected. Bone marrow samples from patients were collected or bone marrow smears prepared at the initial diagnosis were used for detecting the somatic gene mutations of 58 genes related with hematologic tumors by high-throughput gene sequencing. And the correlation of gene mutations with the age of patients was analyzed. RESULTS: The positive rate of total gene mutation was 87.39% (97/111) in 111 patients, and 231 mutations in 28 different genes were detected in the patients with positive gene mutation. The patients of mutation-positive group were significantly older than that of the mutation-negative group (P0.001). Among the mutation-positive patients, the mutation rate in the senile group (>/=60 years) was 100% (14/14), followed by 89.04% (74/85) in the adult group (15-59 years) and 75% (9/12) in the children group (</=14 years). The average number of mutations in the children group, the adult group and the senile group were respectively 1.44, 2.47 and 2.5; the number of mutations in the adult group was greater than that in the children group (P0.05).The most common mutations in the children group occurred in signal transduction gene (46.15%, 6/13); The most common mutations in both the adult group (22.40%, 41/183) and the senile group (34.29%, 12/35) occurred in epigenetic regulatory gene; the mutation rate of transcription factor gene in the senile group was higher than that in the children group (50.00% vs 8.33%) (P0.05); the mutation rates of the splicing factor gene in the adult group and the senile group were higher than that in the children group (44.71% vs 8.33%) (P0.05), (47.06% vs 8.33%) (P0.05). CONCLUSION: The tumor-associated somatic gene mutations in patients with MDS and MDS/AML are significantly different between the different age groups, especially the children group and the adults group as well as the senile group, suggesting that the occurrence of MDS in children may involve genetic factors that are significantly different from those of adults and the senile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Bone marrow samples from 82 CLL patients were collected and cultured with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), CpG-oligonucleotide plus interleukin-2 (CpG-ODN DSP30+IL-2) for 72 hours. Chromosomes were prepared and analyzed by conventional cytogenetics (CC). Meanwhile, D13S25, Rb1, ATM, p53 and CSP12 probes were used for interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH) test. The differences of chromosome culture and iFISH test results between two cell stimulants were compared. RESULTS: The success rate of karyotype culture in PHA and CpG-ODN DSP30+IL-2 immunostimuli (analyzable mitotic t >20) was 90.2% (74 cases), 68.3% (56 cases) respectively, and the detection rate of abnormal karyotype was 13.5% (10 cases) and 46.4% (26 cases), respectively. The success rate of karyotype culture in PHA group was significantly higher than that in CpG-ODN DSP30+IL-2 group (P=0.01). The detection rate of abnormal karyotypes in CpG-ODN DSP30+IL-2 group was significantly higher than that in PHA group, and the difference was statistically significant (P=0.003). The detection rate of abnormal karyotypes in iFISH group was 74.4% (61 cases), which was significantly higher than that in CpG-ODN DSP30+IL-2 group (P=0.000). iFISH detection could verify the abnormalities detected by CC analysis. CONCLUSION: Application of CpG-ODN DSP30+IL-2 immunostimulation method in culture of CLL cells can enhance the detection rate of abnormal karyotypes, especially the detection of various translocations suggesting poor prognosis.","['0 (CPG-oligonucleotide)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The 98 patients with leukemia in our hospital were divided into two groups according to the diagnosis of patients: ALL group (56 cases) and ANLL group (42 cases). The 50 healthy persons subjected to physical examination were selected as control group. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) were separated from the venous blood samples of three groups, and the expression levels of LKB1 gene were detected by RT-PCR and were compared among three groups. Patients in ALL group were divided into two groups according to the expression level of LKB1 gene: low expression group (39 cases) and high expression group (17 cases). Follow-up 3 years, the curves of OS and DFS in two groups were gained by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The ratios of CR and recurrence were compared between two groups. The related risk factors (all P<0.05) influencing the survival of patients with ALL were confirmed by multivariate logistic analysis. RESULTS: The expression level of LKB1 gene of control group was 1.56(1.38-1.74)>ALL group 1.32(1.22-1.40)>ANLL group 0.89(0.78-1.02). There were statistical differences among the three groups (all P<0.05). Compared with low expression group, the CR rate in high expression group were higher, but the recurrence rate were lower in high expression group (all P<0.05). Follow-up 3 years, the OS and DFS rates in high expression group were higher than those in low expression group (all P<0.05). There was negative relation between expression level of LKB1 gene and clinical risk level of ALL patients (r=-0.712, P=0.039). For standard risk ALL, the patients in LKB1 low expression group was significantey lower than that in high expression group; and for high risk ALL, the patients in LKB1 low expression group was significant higher than that in high expression group. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that the age (OR=2.872, P=0.020), peripheral blood immature cell count (OR=2.268, P=0.028) were independent risk factors for survival of patients with ALL, and the expression level of LKB1 gene (OR=0.426, P=0.016) is protective factor. CONCLUSION: The expression level of LKB1 gene in patients with ALL is low, moreover the more low expression level of LKB1 gene were, the more severe ill condition and more poor prognosis were.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The effect of costunolide on the viability of K562 cells was detected by CCK-8 assay. The cell apoptosis and the level of ROS in K562 cells were detected by flow cytometry. The expression level of related proteins were analyzed using Western blot. RESULTS: The CCK-8 viability assay showed that costunolide at the gradient concentrations of 0-50 mumol/L significantly inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells after exposure for 24 h. The IC50 value of costunolide was approximately 15.70+/-2.13 mumol/L, with statistically significant difference (P0.05). Treatment with 15 mumol/L costunolide for 24 and 48 h induced apoptosis of K562 cells with the apoptotic rate significantly increasing from (1.77+/-0.59) % in the control group to (17.68+/-2.84) % and (30.65+/-4.54) % (P0.05) respectively.

RESULTS: The expression levels of miR-146a and miR-221 of PBMNC in T-ALL group were significantly higher than those in control group (5.83+/-1.54 vs 0.96+/-0.17) (7.13+/-2.60 vs 1.64+/-0.51) (P0.01). The expression levels of miR-146a and miR-221 in refractory group were significantly higher than those in remission group and initial group (8.74+/-2.35 vs 1.70+/-0.63 and 5.83+/-1.54) (11.316+/-4.83 vs 2.62+/-0.85 and 7.13+/-2.60) (P0.01). The expression levels of miR-146a and miR-221 correlated with white blood cell count, risk typing and MRD (P0.05). ROC curve analysis showed that the best cutoff values of miR-146a and miR-221 for diagnosing childhood T-ALL were 3.90 and 5.28, resoectively. While the AUC (95% CI) of the T-ALL jointy diagnosed by miR-146a and miR-221 was 0.835 (0.764-0.892), and it's sensitivity and specificity were 85.0% and 77.2%, respectively. The correlation analysis showed that the expression levels of miR-146a and miR-221 in PBMNC of children with T-ALL positively correlated with the white blood cell count (r=0.705, r=0.653, P0.01), and that of miR-146a positively correlated with miR-221 (r=0.784, P0.01). CONCLUSION: The expression of miR-146a and miR-221 is up-regulated in children with T-ALL and closely relates with the prognosis of children with T-ALL. The combined detection of miR-146a and miR-221 is certain value for diagnosis of T-ALL.","['0 (MIRN146 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN221 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Eighteen female NOD/SCID mice aged 3 to 4 weeks were randomly divided into control group, model group A and model group B (6 in each group). Before inoculation, each mouse was intraperitoneally injected with cyclophosphamide 2 mg/(kg.d) for 2 d, and the mice in model groups were inoculated with cells within 24 h after pretreatment. The mice in model group were inoculated with THP-1 cell suspension in logarithmic growth phase by 1x10(7) cells/group (group A) and 5x10(6) cells/group (group B), the mice in the control group were injected with the same amount of normal saline in the tail vein. The general situation was observed, blood routine test and peripheral blood leukocyte classification were performed at 7, 14, 21, 28 d of inoculation before the pre-treatment, and at the time sacrifice. Before dying, tissue of mice were collected and histological examination was performed. RESULTS: Pilereation, droopiness and hypkinesia could be observed from d 7 and d 10 of inoculation cells in model group. Compared with the control group, the body weight of the mice in model group A and B decreased significantly after 21 days of inoculation (P<0.01), and the white blood cell counts increased significantly after 28 days of modeling (P<0.01). Among them, the above-mentioned presentation in inoculation of 1x10(7) group A was the most significant. Histopathological sections showed diffuse infiltration of leukemia cells in the spleen of the model group. The immunohistochemistry results indicated that the leukemia cells were positive for anti-human CD13, which confirmed the successful establishment of the model. CONCLUSION: After pretreatment with intraperitoneal injection of CTX in NOD/SCID mice, the injection of 1x10(7) or 5x10(6) THP-1 cells in tail vein of each mouse can successfully construct an acute myeloid leukemia animal model.

METHODS: The detection of bone marrow morphology,cytogenetics, JAK2 V617F gene were performed before and after transformation, as well as the immunological tests after transformation was performed in 3 patients with ET into AML. The characteristics, clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of the patients before and after transformation were compared. RESULTS: Case 1 transformed into AML-M2a 5 years after diagnosis of ET. The patient abandoned treatment and was discharged from hospital. Case 2 transformed into AML 6 years after diagnosis of ET. After one course of chemotherapy, bone marrow was partially relieved, and platelets continued to rise up to 702x10(9)/L, presenting as ET bone marrow image. One year later, AML relapsed and no remission was observed after chemotherapy. Case 3 transformed into AML-M6a 7 years after diagnosis of ET. The patient abandoned treatment and was discharged from hospital. The morphological heteromorphism of 3 cases of AML transformed from ET was more obvious than that of patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia. The AML could not be classified accurately based on morphology simply, but could be classified accurately based on immunological detection. JAK2 V617F gene was positive before and after transformation in case 1 and case 2 of ET, the case 3 showed that JAK2 V617F gene was positive at ET stage and negative after AML transformation. Complex chromosome karyotypes were detected by routine karyotype analysis after ET transformation into AML in case 1, while normal karyotypes were found in case 2 and case 3. CONCLUSION: The morphological abnormality of AML transformed from ET is more significant than that of newly diagnosed acute leukemia, and it needs immunological detection to classify it accurately. The transformation of ET into AML may not involve JAK2 V617F gene mutation, but may be related with the occurrence of abnormal chromosome karyotypes. The condition of AML transformed from ET is dangerous and the effect of chemotherapy is poor.",['EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: AML mouse models were established by intravenous injection of HL-60 cells. The SR1 of 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg was intraperitoneally injected into AML models once a day for 1 week. The survival rate of mice, tumor volume and weight were measured, and protein levels of Caspase-3 and VEGF were determined by immunohistochemistry. And protein levels of p-PI3K, PI3K, p-AKT and AKT were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: SR1 significantly inhibited the growth of tumors (P0.01, r=-0.9994, -0.9952) and increased the survival rate of mice (P0.01). SR1 significantly increased the protein level of apoptosis-related Caspase-3(P0.01, r=0.9855), and decreased the protein level of migration-related protein VEGF (P0.01, r=-0.9848). The protein levels of p-PI3K and p-AKT were down-regulated by SR1, Thus, the relative protein levels of p-PI3K/PI3K and p-AKT/AKT were significantly decreased (P0.01, r=-0.9372, -0.9953). Above-mentioned effects showed a significant positive/negative correlation with the concentration of SR1. CONCLUSION: SR1 inhibits the growth, invasion and migration of tumor cells, and increas survival of mice through affecting expression of Caspase-3, VEGF, p-PI3K, and p-AKT.","['0 (Ginsenosides)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'Z62692362Z (notoginsenoside R1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: ELISA was used to detect the expression level of Netrin-1 in peripheral blood serum from 48 child ALL patients (newly diagnosed, recurrent), and its relevance with clinical indicators was statistically analyzed. The blood serum samples from 27 children with non malignant hematological diseases were choosen as controls. Leukemia cell lines of Jurkat,Molt-4,SUP-B15 and Raji were cultivated filled semicirclein vitrofilled semicircle, after treated with different concentrations of recombinant human Netrin-1 protein the invasive ability of the cells was detected by Transwell method the effect of Netrin-1 to the proli feration of cells was detected by CCK-8 method The expression and phosphorylation level of key molecules, such as FAK,Erk1/2,PI3K and Akt signaling pathway were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: The expression of Netrin-1 in child patients was significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). With the increasing of Netrin-1 level, the level of Plt (r=0.483, P<0.05) increased, while the level of WBC (r=-0.290, P<0.05) decreased, and there were no significant correlation with age, Hb level and the proportion of immature cells in bone marrow. When the concentration of Netrin-1 was 25-50 ng/ml, the level of Netrin-1 positively correlated with WBC (r=0.886, P<0.05) ; the level of Netrin-1 significantly decreased when the patient's WBC was 50x10(9)/L and Plt 20x10(9)/L(P=0.042P=0.001); The expression level of Netrin-1 was significantly different in the risk group(P=0.017), and level of Netrin-1 in high-risk group was significantly higher than that in low risk group and middle risk group, but there was no significant difference of Netrin-1 expression in sex, hepatosplenomegaly, MRD, recurrence and chromosome abnormality. Netrin-1 could promote the invasiveness of the four kinds of cells (P<0.05). With the increase of Netrin-1 concentration, the number of cells increased at first and then decreased, and the number of cells in the invading chamber was the highest when the concentration of Netrin-1 was 100 ng/ml; the survival rate of the four kinds of cells significantly increased when the concentration of Netrin-1 was 25 ng/ml(P<0.05), and SUP-B15 cells showed the highest cell survival rate at a concentration of 100 ng/ml; The survival rate of the four kinds of cells showed a tendency : survival of cells increased at low concentration of Netrin-1 and survival of cells decreased at high concentration of Netrin-1. The results of Western blot showed that Netrin-1 activated the phosphorylation level of key molecules such as FAK,Erk1/2,PI3K,Akt signaling pathway (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: There is abnormal expression of Netrin-1 in serum of children with ALL. Netrin-1 may affect the occurrence and development of ALL by increasing the proliferation and invasiveness of leukemia cells, and may become a risk factor of ALL or a potential target in biotherapy.",['158651-98-0 (Netrin-1)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The indoles inhibitors were docked in the enzyme's active pocket in order to survey the inhibition mechanism and extract the ligands' conformations. The docking outcome shows that the active inhibitors have strong van der Waals interactions with residues of Ile185, Leu44, Leu120 and Leu174, hydrogen bonds with residues of Asp128, Arg122 and Glu171 and pi-pi interaction with the residue of Phe49. The sum of these interactions is ~80 kcal mol(-1) contributing ~90% of total binding free energies. Using docking-based molecular descriptors, the unsupervised and supervised classifications were successfully carried out with the accuracy of 0.82 and 0.95, respectively, to categorize the active/inactive Pim kinase inhibitors. The vigorous quantitative assessment was performed using different machine learning techniques. The constructed QSAR model [(r (2) cal, r (2) p, r (2) m and Q (2) LOO) > 0.80 and (SE cal, SEp and SE LOO) < 0.22] indicates that the molecular descriptors of nN, RDF20v and E1v can describe both the inhibition activities and the inhibition mechanism.

G-CSFR mutations are associated with some hematological malignancies. Previous studies show the efficacy of ibrutinib (a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in mutated G-CSFR leukemia models but do not address broader signaling mechanisms. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A label-free quantitative proteomics workflow to evaluate the cellular effects of ibrutinib treatment is established. This includes three biological replicates of normal and mutated G-CSFR expressed in a mouse progenitor cell (32D cell line) with and without ibrutinib treatment. RESULTS: The proteomics dataset shows about 1000 unique proteins quantified with nearly 400 significant changes (p value < 0.05), suggesting a highly dynamic network of cellular signaling in response to ibrutinib. Importantly, the dataset is very robust with coefficients of variation for quantitation at 13.0-20.4% resulting in dramatic patterns of protein differences among the groups. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This robust dataset is available for further mining, hypothesis generation, and testing. A detailed understanding of the restructuring of the proteomics signaling cascades by ibrutinib in leukemia biology will provide new avenues to explore its use for other related malignancies.","['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",PMC7492401,['NOTNLM'],"['*G-CSFR (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor)', '*SWATH Proteomics', '*ibrutinib', '*label-free quantitation', '*leukemia']","['CA196658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 ES007250/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA196658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1S10 RR027015-01/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR027015/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'ES007250/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['(c) 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Epub 2020 Apr 22.,"INTRODUCTION: This study characterized the multidose pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of posaconazole tablets used as prophylactic antifungal therapy in Chinese patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) at risk for invasive fungal infection (IFI). METHODS: Participants in this open-label, single-arm, phase 1b study received posaconazole 300 mg twice daily on day 1 and then once daily for up to 28 days. In the intensive PK sampling subgroup, posaconazole was administered under fasting conditions on days 1 and 8, and blood samples were regularly collected over 24 h. Trough PK sampling was conducted in all participants on days 1, 2, 3, 8, 14, 21, and 28 without regard for food intake. Population PK characteristics were predicted using PK modeling. Primary endpoints were steady-state average concentration (Cavg) and percentage of participants with steady-state Cavg (predicted and observed) > 500 ng/ml. Treatment safety and efficacy were secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Sixty-five adult Chinese participants were enrolled. On day 8, steady-state arithmetic mean Cavg was 1610 ng/ml (% coefficient of variation [%CV] 42.8%) in the intensive PK subgroup (n = 20). All participants achieved a steady-state Cavg > 500 ng/ml. Predicted Cavg (pCavg) was 1770 ng/ml (%CV 33.7%) in the total population (n = 64); 92.2% of participants had pCavg values >/= 500 ng/ml (n = 59). The posaconazole tablet safety profile was consistent with that of the oral formulation, and the IFI rate was 3%. CONCLUSION: In Chinese AML patients, the posaconazole 300-mg tablet provided PK data comparable with those of previous studies and was generally well tolerated and efficacious.

Recent developments in molecular targeting have shown promising results in treating leukemia, paving the way for novel treatment strategies. The discovery of drugs that promote apoptosis in leukemic cells has translated to encouraging activity in clinical trials. B-cell lymphoma (BCL)-2 inhibition has been at the center of drug development efforts to target apoptosis in AML. Remarkable clinical success with venetoclax has revolutionized the ways we treat hematological malignancies. Several landmark trials have demonstrated the potent antitumor activity of venetoclax, and it is now frequently combined with traditional cytotoxic agents to treat AML. However, resistance to BCL-2 inhibition is emerging, and alternative strategies to address resistance mechanisms have become an important focus of research. A number of clinical trials are now underway to investigate a plurality of novel agents that were shown to overcome resistance to BCL-2 inhibition in preclinical models. Some of the most promising data come from studies on drugs that downregulate myeloid cell leukemia (MCL)-1, such as cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) inhibitors. Furthermore, innovative approaches to target apoptosis via extrinsic pathways and p53 regulation have added new cytotoxic agents to the arsenal, including drugs that inhibit inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family proteins and murine double minute 2 (MDM2).

Epub 2020 Apr 21.,"Fate determination in self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSCs and HPCs) is ultimately controlled by gene expression, which is profoundly influenced by the global and local chromatin state. Cellular metabolism directly influences the chromatin state through the dynamic regulation of the enzymatic activities that modify DNA and histones, but also generates genotoxic metabolites that can damage DNA and thus pose threat to the genome integrity. On the other hand, mechanisms modulating the chromatin state impact metabolism by regulating the expression and activities of key metabolic enzymes. Moreover, through regulating either DNA damage response directly or expression of genes involved in this process, chromatin modulators play active and crucial roles in guarding the genome integrity, breaching of which results in defective HSPC function. Therefore, HSPC function is regulated by the dynamic and two-way interactions between metabolism and chromatin. Here, we review recent advances that provide a chromatin perspective on the major impacts the metabolic and genotoxic factors can have on HSPC function and fate determination.","['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)']",PMC7541408,['NOTNLM'],"['Chromatin', 'DNA damage response', 'Demethylation', 'Genome integrity', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Histone modifications', 'Metabolism']","['R01 DK105531/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '1354-19/Leukemia and Lymphoma Society', '128609-RSG-15-166-01-DMC/American Cancer Society', 'R01DK105531/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS1586725'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anthracyclines are among the most common and effective drugs for the treatment of children ALL. However, long-term consumption and higher doses of these drugs may lead to toxic effects on the heart of children. For this purpose, in the present study, the baseline and posttreatment echocardiography status was evaluated in children with ALL during 7 years. Materials and Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study was performed on 53 children with ALL who were under the age of 18 years. Different factors including risk groups, age, gender, white blood cells, dosage, and duration of treatment, as well as baseline and posttreatment echocardiography findings including EF, E/E(/), E(/)/A(/), MVE/A were evaluated in all patients. Results: All enrolled patients had not any abnormalities in the baseline echocardiography preventing the beginning of chemotherapy. The results of this study did not show a significant difference in mean baseline echocardiography parameters after treatment including EFE/E/ E//A/ , MVE/A. In addition, there was no significant difference in mean EF, E(/)/A(/) , MVE/A, and E/E(/) before and after treatment among SR, IR, and HR groups. Although there was no significant difference in the mean EF, E(/)/A(/), and MVE/A before and after treatment between male and female sex, the mean E/E(/) after chemotherapy in girls (8.5 +/- 0.7) was significantly higher than the mean before treatment (6.85 +/- 1.5) (P < 0.001). It was also higher than the mean in boys (7.04 +/- 0.99) (P = 0.019). Although there was no significant relationship between the duration of chemotherapy and the mean of EFE/E(/) E(/)/A(/) , MVE/A after treatment, high dose of the drug was found to be significantly associated with a gradual decrease of EF or systolic function of the heart (P < 0.001). There was no significant relationship between drug dose and other parameters of echocardiography including E(/) A(/), MVE/A, and E/E(/) after treatment. Conclusion: It appears that chemotherapy should not be delayed by echocardiography. Based on the findings presented herein, increasing the dose of anthracycline can be considered as an effective factor in reducing the systolic function of the heart (EF reduction). On the other hand, chemotherapy in the period of 1 to 5.3 years does not seem to have a significant effect on the mean parameters of EF, E/E(/), E(/)/, and MVE/A although another study with higher sample size and follow-up is needed to confirm these results.",,PMC7113966,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'anthracycline', 'cardiac toxicity', 'conventional echocardiography', 'tissue Doppler echocardiography (TDE)']",,['Copyright: (c) Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care.'],,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current treatments are insufficient, and new therapies are needed. Recent discoveries suggest that AML may be particularly sensitive to chemotherapeutics that target mitochondria. To further investigate this sensitivity, six compounds that target mitochondria [IACS-010759, rotenone, cytarabine, etoposide, ABT-199 (venetoclax), and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone] were each paired with six compounds with other activities, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (midostaurin and dasatinib), glycolytic inhibitors (2-deoxy-D-glucose, 3-bromopyruvate, and lonidamine), and the microtubule destabilizer vinorelbine. The 36 resulting drug combinations were tested for synergistic cytotoxicity against MOLM-13 and OCI-AML2 AML cell lines. Four combinations (IACS-010759 with vinorelbine, rotenone with 2-deoxy-D-glucose, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone with dasatinib, and venetoclax with lonidamine) showed synergistic cytotoxicity in both AML cell lines and were selective for tumor cells, as survival of healthy PBMCs was dramatically higher. Among these drug pairs, IACS-010759/vinorelbine decreased ATP level and impaired mitochondrial respiration and coupling efficiency most profoundly.

The long-term use of ruxolitinib has not been explicitly studied outside the context in the treatment of multiple myeloma. With current clinical trials underway for the use of ruxolitinib in srGVHD, there are still no current guidelines or protocols for long-term clinical use. Of the available literature showing ruxolitinib utilization for srGVHD, most cases lead to resolution and eventual discontinuation.

CLI pain is challenging to control despite multimodal pharmacologic analgesia and surgical intervention. We described the successful use of a continuous local anesthetic infusion via a popliteal nerve catheter to control severe refractory ischemic lower limb pain in a patient who failed surgical intervention and performed a brief narrative literature review on regional anesthesia for ischemic pain. Case Presentation. A 74-year-old female with acute myelogenous leukemia presented with CLI after experiencing left popliteal artery occlusion. Palliative medicine service was consulted for pain management in the setting of escalating narcotic dose requirements. She experienced a complicated hospital course with several failed attempts at surgical revascularization due to arterial rethrombosis. In accordance with the patient's goals of care, a continuous popliteal nerve catheter was placed, despite the high risk nature of an intervention in an immunocompromised patient with thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 30,000 platelets/microliter) and ongoing therapeutic anticoagulation. The patient experienced immediate relief while transitioning to comfort care. Conclusion: This is the first report of successful analgesia for CLI via a continuous popliteal catheter in a patient with rethrombosis and failed surgical revascularization. Based on our collaborative experience, we recommend the development of partnerships between the acute pain service and palliative care service to facilitate the early evaluation and decision to utilize regional anesthesia for treatment of CLI.",,PMC7166256,,,,"[""Copyright (c) 2020 Ryan S.

Epub 2020 Apr 21.,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell immunotherapy is rapidly emerging as a promising novel treatment for malignancies. To broaden the success of CAR T-cell treatment for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), we attempted to construct a CD26 CAR T-cell product to target tyrosine kinase inhibitor-insensitive leukaemia stem cells (LSCs), which have been a challenge to cure for several decades and can be discriminated from healthy stem cells by the robust biomarker CD26. Of additional interest is that CD26 has also been reported to be a multi-purpose therapeutic target for other malignancies. Here, we constructed CD26 CAR T cells utilizing lentiviral transduction methods and verified them by flow cytometry analysis and RNA-seq. We found that the initial expansion of CD26 CAR-transduced T cells was delayed due to transient fratricide, but subsequent expansion was accelerated. CD26 CAR T cells exhibited cytotoxicity against the CD26(+) T-cell lymphoma cell line Karpas 299, CD26-overexpressing K562 cells and primary CML LSCs, activated multiple effector functions in co-culture assays, and limited tumour progression in a mouse model; but there was some off-tumour cytotoxicity towards activated lymphocytes. In conclusion, these results establish the feasibility of using CD26 as an antigen for CAR T cells targeting CD26(+) tumour cells.","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (DPP4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The functional connections of this network integrate external stimuli into cell signals, including physical forces to mechanical responses of the nucleus. Canonically, the morphological characteristics of the nucleus, as shape and size, have served for pathologists to stratify and diagnose cancer patients; however, novel biophysical techniques must exploit physical parameters to improve cancer diagnosis. By using multiple particle tracking (MPT) technique on chromatin granules, we designed a SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features)-based algorithm to study the mechanical properties of isolated nuclei and in living cells. We have determined the apparent shear stiffness, viscosity and optical density of the nucleus, and how the chromatin structure influences on these biophysical values. Moreover, we used our MPT-SURF analysis to study the apparent mechanical properties of isolated nuclei from patients of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We found that leukemia cells exhibited mechanical differences compared to normal lymphocytes. Interestingly, isolated nuclei from high-risk leukemia cells showed increased viscosity than their counterparts from normal lymphocytes, whilst nuclei from relapsed-patient's cells presented higher density than those from normal lymphocytes or standard- and high-risk leukemia cells. Taken together, here we presented how MPT-SURF analysis of nuclear chromatin granules defines nuclear mechanical phenotypic features, which might be clinically relevant.",['0 (Chromatin)'],PMC7174401,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have analyzed the potential therapeutic value of the farnesyltransferase inhibitor, tipifarnib, in 25 TCL cell lines through the identification of genomic and/or immunohistochemical markers of tipifarnib sensitivity. More than half of the cell lines (60%) were considered to be sensitive. Tipifarnib reduced cell viability in these T-cell leukemia and TCL cell lines, induced apoptosis and modified the cell cycle. A mutational study showed TP53, NOTCH1 and DNMT3 to be mutated in 84.6%, 69.2% and 30.0% of sensitive cell lines, and in 62.5%, 0% and 0% of resistant cell lines, respectively. An immunohistochemistry study showed that p-ERK and RelB were associated as potential biomarkers of tipifarnib sensitivity and resistance, respectively. Data from RNA-seq show that tipifarnib at IC50 after 72 h downregulated a great variety of pathways, including those controlling cell cycle, metabolism, and ribosomal and mitochondrial activity. This study establishes tipifarnib as a potential therapeutic option in T-cell leukemia and TCL. The mutational state of NOTCH1, p-ERK and RelB could serve as potential biomarkers of tipifarnib sensitivity and resistance.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Quinolones)', 'MAT637500A (tipifarnib)']",PMC7174413,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prognosis is correlated with many factors such as age, gender, white blood cell (WBC) count, CD10, French-American-British (FAB) classification, and many others. Many of these factors are included in this study as they play a major role in establishing the best treatment protocol. This study aims to demonstrate clinical and laboratory features of childhood ALL in Syria. They were treated at Children's University Hospital, the only working major cancer centre in Syria at the time of the study. Data of 203 patients who aged 0-14 years were obtained for this study. Most patients (48.8%) aged (5-9) years with a male predominance (60.9%). The major features for ALL included lymphadenopathy (82.9%), presenting with systemic symptoms (74.9%), T-ALL subclass (20.2%), L2 FAB classification (36.1%), low educational levels for fathers (53%) and mothers (56.2%), having a high risk (48.4%), and having a duration of symptoms before evaluation for more than 4 weeks (42.6%). Only three (1.5%) patients had normal full blood counts (FBC) and only one (0.5%) patient had an isolated high WBC count at time of presentation. Most patients had either abnormal platelet count (89.3%) or low haemoglobin level (88.8%) when presenting with only (2.0%) having normal levels for both. This suggests that having normal haemoglobin and platelet count can be used for quick screening in crisis time like in Syria for prioritising patients. Many prognostic factors were significantly different from medical literature which emphasises the importance of local studies in the developping countries. This study included a high prevalence of T-all, L2 FAB classification, high-risk and other variables which require further studies to evaluate the aetiology of these features, especially that treatment protocols may have a higher mortality in developing countries when not adjusted to local variables.","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Hemoglobins)']",PMC7174306,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sox3 is also expressed in other locations, notably within the spermatogonial stem/progenitor cell population in postnatal testis. Independent studies have shown that Sox3 null mice exhibit a spermatogenic block as young adults, the mechanism of which remains poorly understood. Using a panel of spermatogonial cell marker genes, we demonstrate that Sox3 is expressed within the committed progenitor fraction of the undifferentiated spermatogonial pool. Additionally, we use a Sox3 null mouse model to define a potential role for this factor in progenitor cell function. We demonstrate that Sox3 expression is required for transition of undifferentiated cells from a GFRalpha1+ self-renewing state to the NGN3 + transit-amplifying compartment. Critically, using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that SOX3 binds to a highly conserved region in the Ngn3 promoter region in vivo, indicating that Ngn3 is a direct target of SOX3. Together these studies indicate that SOX3 functions as a pro-commitment factor in spermatogonial stem/progenitor cells.","['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gfra1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neurog3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', '0 (Sall4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Sox3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)']",PMC7174399,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early signals suggested that survival might be increasing in this population. However, confirmation studies have been lacking. The goal of this study was to assess trends in survival rates over time in cancer patients admitted to the ICU for sepsis or septic shock over the last 2 decades. DATA SOURCE: Seven European ICUs. STUDY SELECTION: A hierarchical model taking into account the year of admission and the source dataset as random variables was used to identify risk factors for day 30 mortality. DATA EXTRACTION: Data from cancer patients admitted to ICUs for sepsis or septic shock were extracted from the Groupe de Recherche Respiratoire en Reanimation Onco-Hematologique database (1994-2015). DATA SYNTHESIS: Overall, 2,062 patients (62% men, median [interquartile range] age 59 yr [48-67 yr]) were included in the study. Underlying malignancies were solid tumors (n = 362; 17.6%) or hematologic malignancies (n = 1,700; 82.4%), including acute leukemia (n = 591; 28.7%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 461; 22.3%), and myeloma (n = 244; 11.8%). Two-hundred fifty patients (12%) underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and 640 (31.0%) were neutropenic at ICU admission. Day 30 mortality was 39.9% (823 deaths). The year of ICU admission was associated with significant decrease in day 30 mortality over time (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.98; p = 0.001). Mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 3.25; 95% CI, 2.52-4.19; p < 0.01) and vasopressors use (odds ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.10-1.83; p < 0.01) were independently associated with day 30 mortality, whereas underlying malignancy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and neutropenia were not. CONCLUSIONS: Survival in critically ill oncology and hematology patients with sepsis improved significantly over time. As outcomes improve, clinicians should consider updating admission policies and goals of care in this population.",,,,,,,['Crit Care Med. 2020 Jun;48(6):925-926. PMID: 32433081'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the evident role of T cell-mediated immunity in response to allogeneic stem cell transplantation and donor lymphocyte infusions, strategies that enhance immune activation and mitigate immune dysfunction represent attractive therapeutic platforms to improve clinical outcomes in AML. Pre-clinical data suggest that immune dysfunction is a major contributor to AML progression and relapse. Increased expression of immune checkpoints such as programmed death 1 (PD-1) contributes to AML immune evasion and is associated with disease progression. Immune checkpoint inhibition is being explored in AML with early evidence of clinical activity, particularly in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy and hypomethylating agents. In this review, we explore the scientific rationale behind the use of immune checkpoint inhibition either as single agents or in combination with hypomethylating agents or cytotoxic chemotherapy and provide a clinical update of both completed and ongoing trials in AML.","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*PD-1', '*PD-L1', '*T cell-mediated immunity', '*immune checkpoint inhibition', '*stem cell transplantation']",,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: AYAs 12-25 years of age participated in a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of a resilience intervention. They were fluent in English and either diagnosed with new cancer (NC) or advanced cancer (AC). At baseline and 6 months, participants self-reported sexual activity and substance use. We describe the percentage of AYAs who endorsed each behavior and a count of total behaviors endorsed by each respondent. We describe frequencies by sex/gender (male/female), age (<18/>/=18), and disease status (AC/NC). Results: Participants (N = 92) were majority white/Caucasian (57%), 12-17 years old (73%), and diagnosed with leukemia/lymphoma (62%); 32% had AC. Responses were not associated with the intervention; hence, we summarized data from the whole cohort. At both time points, median behavior endorsed was 2. At baseline and follow-up, 87% and 81% endorsed at least 1 behavior: 13% and 15% were sexually active, 75% and 73% of whom used birth control inconsistently; and 22% and 22% reported drinking alcohol, 31% and 27% using prescription opioids/sedatives, 19% and 22% using other drugs, and 9% and 7% using tobacco. Young adults engaged in most behaviors more frequently than adolescents (e.g., 48% vs. 12% alcohol at baseline); males engaged in sexual activity more frequently than females (e.g., 20% vs. 5% sexually active at baseline); and AYAs with NC engaged in most behaviors more frequently than those with AC (18% vs. 0% sexually active at baseline).

In this study, the cytotoxicities of 1 and its acetyl derivative (2) were evaluated against human tumor cells. These sesquiterpene lactones were cytotoxic against human acute myeloid leukemia (U-937 and HL-60) cells, even in cells over-expressing the pro-survival protein Bcl-2, but melanoma (SK-MEL-1) and human mononuclear cells isolated from blood of healthy donors were more resistant. Both compounds are apoptotic inducers in human leukemia U-937 cells. Cell death was mediated by the processing and activation of initiator and effector caspases and the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and it was blocked by a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor and (in the case of sesquiterpene lactone 2) by the selective caspase-3/7, -8, and -9 inhibitors.

These polyploidized cells display premature senescence and sort the damaged DNA into the cytoplasm. In this study, we explored MS in the MDA-MB-231 cell line treated with doxorubicin (DOX). We found selective release into the cytoplasm of telomere fragments enriched in telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), telomere capping protein TRF2, and DNA double-strand breaks marked by gammaH2AX, in association with ubiquitin-binding protein SQSTM1/p62. This occurs along with the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) and DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR) in the nuclear promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies. The cells in repeated MS cycles activate meiotic genes and display holocentric chromosomes characteristic for inverted meiosis (IM). These giant cells acquire an amoeboid phenotype and finally bud the depolyploidized progeny, restarting the mitotic cycling. We suggest the reversible conversion of the telomerase-driven telomere maintenance into ALT coupled with IM at the sub-telomere breakage sites introduced by meiotic nuclease SPO11. All three MS mechanisms converging at telomeres recapitulate the amoeba-like agamic life-cycle, decreasing the mutagenic load and enabling the recovery of recombined, reduced progeny for return into the mitotic cycle.","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (SQSTM1 protein, human)', '0 (Sequestosome-1 Protein)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",PMC7215480,['NOTNLM'],"['ALT', 'SQSTM1/p62', 'amoeboid conversion', 'budding of mitotic progeny', 'cellular senescence', 'extranuclear DNA', 'genotoxic treatment', 'inverted meiosis', 'mtTP53 cancer', 'polyploidization']","['1.1.1.2/VIAA/3/19/463/European Regional Development Fund', 'UMO-2015/17/B/NZ3/03531/Polska Akademia Nauk', 'SAF2017-89791-R/Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion', 'PhD Student Scholarship/Latvijas Universitates Fonds']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of smoking status in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) treated with intensive chemotherapy. We conducted a nationwide cohort study based on data obtained from the Danish National Leukaemia Registry (DNLR). The study comprised Danish patients aged 18-75 years, diagnosed with AML between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2012. Medical records were reviewed and data on smoking status were collected. A total of 1040 patients (median age 59 years) were included, and 602 patients (58.9%) were categorised as ever-smokers and the remaining as never-smokers. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates revealed that ever-smokers had a significant shorter median overall survival (OS) at 17.2 months [95% CI (14.9;19.1)] compared to never-smokers at 24.5 months (95% CI [19.2;30.7]). Multivariate analysis revealed smoking status as a significant prognostic factor for inferior OS with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.22 [95% CI (1.04;1.44)].

Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) microparticles modified with preformed NRs were used as sacrificial templates for the fabrication of hollow PAH/PMA/NR capsules incorporated with NRs. The hollow capsules were found to be 4.5 +/- 0.5 microm in size and appeared with uniformly distributed NRs in the interior of the capsules. The morphology of the capsules transformed from pore free continuous structure to porous structure under laser light irradiation at 808 nm and 0.5 W cm(-2). The encapsulation experiments showed that the hydrophilic drug (doxorubicin hydrochloride, Dox) was encapsulated in the interior of the capsules while the hydrophobic drug (nimbin, NB) was entrapped in the porous polymeric network of the layer components. The encapsulation efficiency was found to be 30% for both Dox and NB. The release experiments showed an initial burst release followed by sustained release up to 3 h. Notably, the release was completed within 30 min under NIR irradiation at 808 nm. The estimated IC50 values against THP-1 cells were 75 and 1.8 microM for NB and Dox, respectively. The dual drug loaded capsules showed excellent anticancer activity against THP-1 cells under NIR light exposure in in-vitro experiments. Thus, such remotely addressable dual-drug loaded capsules with the provision for encapsulation of natural drugs demonstrate high potential for use as theranostics in cancer therapy.","['0 (Capsules)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Limonins)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Polymethacrylic Acids)', '25087-26-7 (polymethacrylic acid)', '30551-89-4 (polyallylamine)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'N4CTG7K9IU (nimbin)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Gold nanorods', 'Microcapsules', 'NIR drug delivery', 'Nimbin and Doxorubicin']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we identify a class of small-molecule iHAPs (improved heterocyclic activators of PP2A) that kill leukemia cells by allosterically assembling a specific heterotrimeric PP2A holoenzyme consisting of PPP2R1A (scaffold), PPP2R5E (B56epsilon, regulatory), and PPP2CA (catalytic) subunits. One compound, iHAP1, activates this complex but does not inhibit dopamine receptor D2, a mediator of neurologic toxicity induced by perphenazine and related neuroleptics. The PP2A complex activated by iHAP1 dephosphorylates the MYBL2 transcription factor on Ser241, causing irreversible arrest of leukemia and other cancer cells in prometaphase. In contrast, SMAPs, a separate class of compounds, activate PP2A holoenzymes containing a different regulatory subunit, do not dephosphorylate MYBL2, and arrest tumor cells in G1 phase. Our findings demonstrate that small molecules can serve as allosteric switches to activate distinct PP2A complexes with unique substrates.","['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Activators)', '0 (MYBL2 protein, human)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (PPP2R5E protein, human)', '0 (Phenothiazines)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPP2CA protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'GS9EX7QNU6 (phenothiazine)']",PMC7397863,['NOTNLM'],"['*MYBL2', '*PP2A', '*PPZ', '*cell cycle arrest', '*dopamine receptor', '*perphenazine', '*phenothiazine', '*prometaphase', '*protein phosphatase 2A']","['R01 CA214608/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA218278/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA210064/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In the Friend virus (FV) model, regulatory T cells (Tregs) were found to induce CD8(+) T cell dysfunction before viral clearance is achieved and thus contribute to viral chronicity. Although studied for decades, the exact suppressive mechanisms of Tregs in the FV model remain elusive and an unavailable therapeutic target. However, extracellular IL-2 and intracellular NF-kappaB signaling were shown to be important pathways for Treg expansion and activation. Therefore, we decided to focus on these two pathways to test therapeutic approaches inhibiting Treg activation during FV infection. In this study, we show that the inhibition of either IL-2 or the NF-kappaB subunit c-Rel, impaired Treg expansion and activation at 2 weeks post-FV infection. Total numbers of Tregs as well as activated Tregs were reduced in FV-infected mice after treatment with anti-IL-2 antibodies or the c-Rel blocking reagent pentoxifylline.

Over the last several years, the search toward novel and less-toxic therapeutic strategies for T-ALL/T-LBL patients has largely focused on the identification of cell-intrinsic properties of the tumor cell. However, non-cell-autonomous activation of specific oncogenic pathways might also offer opportunities that could be exploited at the therapeutic level. In line with this, we here show that endogenous interleukin 7 (IL7) can increase the expression of the oncogenic kinase proviral integration site for Moloney-murine leukemia 1 (PIM1) in CD127+ T-ALL/T-LBL, thereby rendering these tumor cells sensitive to in vivo PIM inhibition. In addition, using different CD127+ T-ALL/T-LBL xenograft models, we also reveal that residual tumor cells, which remain present after short-term in vivo chemotherapy, display consistent upregulation of PIM1 as compared with bulk nontreated tumor cells. Notably, this effect was transient as increased PIM1 levels were not observed in reestablished disease after abrogation of the initial chemotherapy. Furthermore, we uncover that this phenomenon is, at least in part, mediated by the ability of glucocorticoids to cause transcriptional upregulation of IL7RA in T-ALL/T-LBL patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells, ultimately resulting in non-cell-autonomous PIM1 upregulation by endogenous IL7. Finally, we confirm in vivo that chemotherapy in combination with a pan-PIM inhibitor can improve leukemia survival in a PDX model of CD127+ T-ALL. Altogether, our work reveals that IL7 and glucocorticoids coordinately drive aberrant activation of PIM1 and suggests that IL7-responsive CD127+ T-ALL and T-LBL patients could benefit from PIM inhibition during induction chemotherapy.","['0 (Cytokines)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",,,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['Blood. 2020 May 7;135(19):1616-1617.

Although FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown clinical responses, they cannot eliminate primitive FLT3-ITD+ AML cells, which are potential sources of relapse. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms underlying FLT3-ITD+ AML maintenance and drug resistance is essential to develop novel effective treatment strategies. Here, we demonstrate that FLT3 inhibition induces histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) upregulation through FOXO1- and FOXO3-mediated transactivation in FLT3-ITD+ AML cells. Upregulated HDAC8 deacetylates and inactivates p53, leading to leukemia maintenance and drug resistance upon TKI treatment. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of HDAC8 reactivates p53, abrogates leukemia maintenance, and significantly enhances TKI-mediated elimination of FLT3-ITD+ AML cells. Importantly, in FLT3-ITD+ AML patient-derived xenograft models, the combination of FLT3 TKI (AC220) and an HDAC8 inhibitor (22d) significantly inhibits leukemia progression and effectively reduces primitive FLT3-ITD+ AML cells. Moreover, we extend these findings to an AML subtype harboring another tyrosine kinase-activating mutation. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that HDAC8 upregulation is an important mechanism to resist TKIs and promote leukemia maintenance and suggests that combining HDAC8 inhibition with TKI treatment could be a promising strategy to treat FLT3-ITD+ AML and other tyrosine kinase mutation-harboring leukemias.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (FOXO1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O1)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",,,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['Blood. 2020 Apr 23;135(17):1416-1417.

However, current risk stratification algorithms dichotomize variables and apply risk factors independently, which may incorrectly assume identical associations across biologically heterogeneous subsets and reduce statistical power. Accordingly, we developed and validated a prognostic index (PIUKALL) that integrates multiple risk factors and uses continuous data. We created discovery (n = 2405) and validation (n = 2313) cohorts using data from 4 recent trials (UKALL2003, COALL-03, DCOG-ALL10, and NOPHO-ALL2008). Using the discovery cohort, multivariate Cox regression modeling defined a minimal model including white cell count at diagnosis, pretreatment cytogenetics, and end-of-induction minimal residual disease. Using this model, we defined PIUKALL as a continuous variable that assigns personalized risk scores. PIUKALL correlated with risk of relapse and was validated in an independent cohort. Using PIUKALL to risk stratify patients improved the concordance index for all end points compared with traditional algorithms. We used PIUKALL to define 4 clinically relevant risk groups that had differential relapse rates at 5 years and were similar between the 2 cohorts (discovery: low, 3% [95% confidence interval (CI), 2%-4%]; standard, 8% [95% CI, 6%-10%]; intermediate, 17% [95% CI, 14%-21%]; and high, 48% [95% CI, 36%-60%; validation: low, 4% [95% CI, 3%-6%]; standard, 9% [95% CI, 6%-12%]; intermediate, 17% [95% CI, 14%-21%]; and high, 35% [95% CI, 24%-48%]). Analysis of the area under the curve confirmed the PIUKALL groups were significantly better at predicting outcome than algorithms employed in each trial. PIUKALL provides an accurate method for predicting outcome and more flexible method for defining risk groups in future studies.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,['Blood. 2020 Sep 17;136(12):1468.

Indeed, germline RUNX1 mutations result in the well-described autosomal-dominant familial platelet disorder with predisposition to hematologic malignancies (RUNX1-FPD, FPD/AML, FPDMM); approximately 44% of affected individuals progress to AML or myelodysplastic syndromes. Using the Leucegene RUNX1 AML patient group, we sought to investigate the proportion of germline vs acquired RUNX1 mutations in this cohort. Our results showed that 30% of RUNX1 mutations in our AML cohort are germline. Molecular profiling revealed higher frequencies of NRAS mutations and other mutations known to activate various signaling pathways in these patients with RUNX1 germline-mutated AML. Moreover, 2 patients (mother and son) had co-occurrence of RUNX1 and CEBPA germline mutations, with variable AML disease onset at 59 and 27 years, respectively.

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of vincristine, injected directly into the dorsal hippocampus, in spatial memory using the spatial cone field discrimination task. Long Evans rats were trained in the cone field, and after reaching training criterion received bilateral vincristine infusions into the dorsal hippocampus. Vincristine-treated animals presented unilateral or bilateral hippocampal lesions. Animals with bilateral lesions showed lower spatial working and reference memory performance than control animals, but task motivation was unaffected by the lesions. Working and reference memory of animals with unilateral lesions did not differ from animals with bilateral lesions and control animals.

CAR-T therapy has been extensively applied in the clinical setting; however, few systematic studies have evaluated the cost of CAR-T treatment. This study was conducted to evaluate the total cost and cost structure of CAR-T therapy and identify potential risk factors leading to increased costs. METHODS: We identified the associated risk factors in 89 patients in a phase 1/2 study. The cohort included patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 55) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL, n = 34). RESULTS: Overall, the treatment of the ALL cohort was costlier than that of the NHL cohort (P < 0.001). Furthermore, in the ALL cohort, it was costlier to treat patients with a high tumor burden (P < 0.001), high cytokine release syndrome (CRS) grade (P < 0.001), and complications of infection after CAR-T cell infusion (CTI) in the whole cohort (P = 0.013) than patients with a low tumor burden, with low CRS grade, and without infection, respectively. CRS grade and length of stay (P </= 0.005) were independent risk factors associated with the total cost in both the ALL and NHL cohorts during CAR-T therapy. A high tumor burden, duration of fever, and treatment with tocilizumab were independent risk factors associated with the total cost in the ALL cohort (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CAR-T treatment should be extended to patients with a low tumor burden or patients in a state of complete remission, and a corticosteroid approach, as opposed to tocilizumab, may reduce costs.","['0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",PMC7444226,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell malignancies', '*chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy', '*risk', '*total cost']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite its widespread application and success for the initial treatment of leukaemia, a majority of patients eventually develop acquired resistance to chlorambucil. In this regard, we have designed and synthesised a novel hybrid molecule, chloram-HDi that simultaneously impairs DNA and HDAC enzymes. Chloram-HDi efficiently inhibits the proliferation of HL-60 and U937 leukaemia cells with GI50 values of 1.24 microM and 1.75 microM, whereas chlorambucil exhibits GI50 values of 21.1 microM and 37.7 microM against HL-60 and U937 leukaemia cells, respectively. The mechanism behind its remarkably enhanced cytotoxicity is that chloram-HDi not only causes a significant DNA damage of leukaemia cells but also downregulates DNA repair protein, Rad52, resulting in the escalation of its DNA-damaging effect. Furthermore, chloram-HDi inhibits HDAC enzymes to induce the acetylation of alpha-tubulin and histone H3.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",PMC7191901,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage', 'cancer', 'histone deacetylases', 'leukaemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 21.,"Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) mutations occur in approximately 30% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases, suggesting FLT3 as an attractive target for AML treatment. Early FLT3 inhibitors enhance antileukemia efficacy by inhibiting multiple targets, and thus had stronger off-target activity, increasing their toxicity. Recently, a number of potent and selective FLT3 inhibitors have been developed, many of which are effective against multiple mutations.

Epub 2020 Jun 14.,"To elucidate dynamic changes in native BCR-ABL and alternatively spliced tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant but function-dead BCR-ABL(Ins35bp) variant, following commencement or discontinuation of TKI therapy, each transcript was serially quantified in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) by deep sequencing. Because both transcripts were amplified together using conventional PCR system for measuring International Scale (IS), deep sequencing method was used for quantifying such BCR-ABL variants. At the initial diagnosis, 7 of 9 patients presented a small fraction of cells possessing BCR-ABL(Ins35bp) , accounting for 0.8% of the total IS BCR-ABL, corresponding to actual BCR-ABL(Ins35bp) value of 1.1539% IS. TKI rapidly decreased native BCR-ABL but not BCR-ABL(Ins35bp) , leading to the initial increase in the proportion of BCR-ABL(Ins35bp) . Thereafter, both native BCR-ABL and BCR-ABL(Ins35bp) gradually decreased in the course of TKI treatment, whereas small populations positive for TKI-resistant BCR-ABL(Ins35bp) continued fluctuating at low levels, possibly underestimating the molecular response (MR). Following TKI discontinuation, sequencing analysis of 54 patients revealed a rapid relapse, apparently derived from native BCR-ABL(+) clones. However, IS fluctuating at low levels around MR4.0 marked a predominant persistence of cells expressing function-dead BCR-ABL(Ins35bp) , suggesting that TKI resumption was unnecessary. We clarified the possible mechanism underlying mis-splicing BCR-ABL(Ins35bp) , occurring at the particular pseudo-splice site within intron8, which can be augmented by TKI treatment through inhibition of RNA polymerase II phosphorylation. No mutations were found in spliceosomal genes. Therefore, monitoring IS functional BCR-ABL extracting BCR-ABL(Ins35bp) would lead us to a correct evaluation of MR status, thus determining the adequate therapeutic intervention.","['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",PMC7385367,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'BCR-ABLIns35bp', 'MRD', 'alternative splicing', 'chronic myeloid leukemia']","['Bristol-Myers Squibb', '16H05340/Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research', 'Grant in Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas ""Stem Cell Aging and', 'Disease""', '25115002/Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan']","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Epub 2020 Apr 20.,"BACKGROUND: Optimal hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening strategies for cancer patients have not been established. We compared the performance of selective HCV screening strategies. METHODS: We surveyed patients presenting for first systemic anticancer therapy during 2013-2014 for HCV risk factors. We estimated the prevalence of positivity for HCV antibody (anti-HCV) and examined factors associated with anti-HCV status using Fisher's exact test or Student's t test. Sensitivity was calculated for screening patients born during 1945-1965, patients with >/= 1 other risk factor, or both cohorts (""combined screening""). RESULTS: We enrolled 2122 participants. Median age was 59 years (range, 18-91); 1138 participants were women. Race/ethnicity distribution was white non-Hispanic, 76% (n = 1616); Hispanic, 11% (n = 233); black non-Hispanic, 8% (n = 160); Asian, 4% (n = 78); and other, 2% (n = 35). Primary cancer distribution was non-liver solid tumor, 78% (n = 1664); hematologic cancer, 20% (n = 422); and liver cancer, 1% (n = 28). Prevalence of anti-HCV was 1.93% (95% CI, 1.39%-2.61%). Over 28% of patients with detectable HCV RNA were unaware of infection. Factors significantly associated with anti-HCV positivity included less than a bachelor's degree, birth in 1945-1965, chronic liver disease, injection drug use, and blood transfusion or organ transplant before 1992. A total of 1315 participants (62%), including 39 of 41 with anti-HCV, reported >/= 1 risk factor. Sensitivity was 80% (95% CI, 65-91%) for birth-cohort-based, 68% (95% CI, 52-82%) for other-risk-factor-based, and 95% (95% 83-99%) for combined screening. CONCLUSION: Combined screening still missed 5% of patients with anti-HCV. These findings favor universal HCV screening to identify all HCV-infected cancer patients.","['0 (Hepatitis C Antibodies)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Drug therapy', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Neoplasms', 'Virus activation']","['K07CA132955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA167202/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA016672/MD Anderson Cancer Center Clinical Trials Support Resource', 'K07CA132955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA167202/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 20.,"The effects of 100 muM of 3',5'-cGMP, cAMP, cCMP, and cUMP as well as of the corresponding membrane-permeant acetoxymethyl esters on anti-CD3-antibody (OKT3)-induced IL-2 production of HuT-78 cutaneous T cell lymphoma (Sezary lymphoma) cells were analyzed. Only 3',5'-cGMP significantly reduced IL-2 production. Flow cytometric analysis of apoptotic (propidium iodide/annexin V staining) and anti-proliferative (CFSE staining) effects revealed that 3',5'-cGMP concentrations > 50 muM strongly inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of HuT-78 cells (cultured in the presence of alphaCD3 antibody). Similar effects were observed for the positional isomer 2',3'-cGMP and for 2',-GMP, 3'-GMP, 5'-GMP, and guanosine. By contrast, guanosine and guanosine-derived nucleotides had no cytotoxic effect on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) xenograft cells. The anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of guanosine and guanosine-derived compounds on HuT-78 cells were completely eliminated by the nucleoside transport inhibitor NBMPR (S-(4-Nitrobenzyl)-6-thioinosine). By contrast, the ecto-phosphodiesterase inhibitor DPSPX (1,3-dipropyl-8-sulfophenylxanthine) and the CD73 ecto-5'-nucleotidase inhibitor AMP-CP (adenosine 5'-(alpha,beta-methylene)diphosphate) were not protective. We hypothesize that HuT-78 cells metabolize guanosine-derived nucleotides to guanosine by yet unknown mechanisms. Guanosine then enters the cells by an NBMPR-sensitive nucleoside transporter and exerts cytotoxic effects.

The application of different scores may cause variability in the determination of disease prognosis. This study was conducted to stratify patients of CML in accordance with Sokal, Hasford, and EUTOS scoring systems and to determine the concordance rate of risk categories, calculated by using all three scoring systems. Methods This study was conducted at King Edward Medical University from January 2013 to May 2019. A total of 114 patients were diagnosed with CML in the chronic phase during the study period and included in the analysis. Variables of interest were computed using Microsoft Excel. These variables include age, spleen size, platelet count, the percentage of myeloblasts in the peripheral blood, as well as the percentage of basophils and eosinophils in the peripheral blood. Using these baseline variables, the prognostic category of each patient was calculated using Sokal, Hasford, and EUTOS scores. Results The male to female ratio of patients included in the study was 1.43. The mean age was 39.3+/-1.58 years, with an age range of 13 to 95 years. A total of only 4 out of 73 patients were categorized as a low-risk category, whereas 23 out of 80 patients were categorized into a high-risk category by all three scoring systems. The assignment of prognostic categories was variable, depending on which prognostic score was applied. The concordance rate of Sokal vs Hasford was 53%, Sokal vs EUTOS 64%, and Hasford vs EUTOS 98%. Conclusion There is considerable inter-variability between the various prognostic indicators. In general, the Hasford and EUTOS scores assign some patients to a lower risk category when compared to Sokal score.",,PMC7164706,['NOTNLM'],"['cml', 'eutos', 'hasford', 'prognosis', 'scores', 'sokal']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020, Aijaz et al.']",,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 20.,"Despite evidence of chronic inflammation in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and cell-intrinsic dysregulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in MDS hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), the mechanisms responsible for the competitive advantage of MDS HSPCs in an inflammatory milieu over normal HSPCs remain poorly defined. Here, we found that chronic inflammation was a determinant for the competitive advantage of MDS HSPCs and for disease progression. The cell-intrinsic response of MDS HSPCs, which involves signaling through the noncanonical NF-kappaB pathway, protected these cells from chronic inflammation as compared to normal HSPCs. In response to inflammation, MDS HSPCs switched from canonical to noncanonical NF-kappaB signaling, a process that was dependent on TLR-TRAF6-mediated activation of A20. The competitive advantage of TLR-TRAF6-primed HSPCs could be restored by deletion of A20 or inhibition of the noncanonical NF-kappaB pathway. These findings uncover the mechanistic basis for the clonal dominance of MDS HSPCs and indicate that interfering with noncanonical NF-kappaB signaling could prevent MDS progression.","['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Tnfaip3 protein, mouse)']",PMC7402480,,,"['R01 DK102759/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK113639/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 HL135787/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['Nat Immunol. 2020 May;21(5):489-490.

Epub 2020 Apr 20.,"Recent investigations indicate that hematopoiesis is coregulated by innate immunity signals and by pathways characteristic of the activation of innate immunity cells that also operate in normal hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs). This should not be surprising because of the common developmental origin of these cells from a hemato/lymphopoietic stem cell. An important integrating factor is the Nlrp3 inflammasome, which has emerged as a major sensor of changes in body microenvironments, cell activation, and cell metabolic activity. It is currently the best-studied member of the inflammasome family expressed in hematopoietic and lymphopoietic cells, including also HSPCs. It is proposed as playing a role in (i) the development and expansion of HSPCs, (ii) their release from bone marrow (BM) into peripheral blood (PB) in stress situations and during pharmacological mobilization, (iii) their homing to BM after transplantation, and (iv) their aging and the regulation of hematopoietic cell metabolism. The Nlrp3 inflammasome is also involved in certain hematological pathologies, including (i) myelodysplastic syndrome, (ii) myeloproliferative neoplasms, (iii) leukemia, and (iv) graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) after transplantation. The aim of this review is to shed more light on this intriguing intracellular protein complex that has become a ""rising star"" in studies focused on both normal steady-state and pathological hematopoiesis.","['0 (Inflammasomes)', '0 (NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein)']",PMC7266743,,,"['R01 DK074720/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL134644/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 GM127211/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 HL124266/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM103527/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 20.,"Leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) underlie cancer therapy resistance but targeting these cells remains difficult. The Wnt-beta-catenin and PI3K-Akt pathways cooperate to promote tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy. In a mouse model in which both pathways are activated in stem and progenitor cells, LSCs expanded under chemotherapy-induced stress. Since Akt can activate beta-catenin, inhibiting this interaction might target therapy-resistant LSCs. High-throughput screening identified doxorubicin (DXR) as an inhibitor of the Akt-beta-catenin interaction at low doses. Here we repurposed DXR as a targeted inhibitor rather than a broadly cytotoxic chemotherapy. Targeted DXR reduced Akt-activated beta-catenin levels in chemoresistant LSCs and reduced LSC tumorigenic activity. Mechanistically, beta-catenin binds multiple immune-checkpoint gene loci, and targeted DXR treatment inhibited expression of multiple immune checkpoints specifically in LSCs, including PD-L1, TIM3 and CD24. Overall, LSCs exhibit distinct properties of immune resistance that are reduced by inhibiting Akt-activated beta-catenin. These findings suggest a strategy for overcoming cancer therapy resistance and immune escape.","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)']",PMC8010717,,,"['P30 CA168524/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM100701/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS1677737'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our late-stage diversification strategy provides efficient access to a library of bryostatin analogs, which per our design retain affinity for PKC but exhibit variable PKC translocation kinetics.

Here, we show that TRPM2 is highly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The role of TRPM2 in AML was studied following depletion with CRISPR/Cas9 technology in U937 cells. In in vitro experiments and in xenografts, depletion of TRPM2 in AML inhibited leukemia proliferation, and doxorubicin sensitivity was increased. Mitochondrial function including oxygen consumption rate and ATP production was reduced, impairing cellular bioenergetics. Mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial calcium uptake were significantly decreased in depleted cells. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) were significantly increased, and Nrf2 was decreased, reducing the antioxidant response. In TRPM2-depleted cells, ULK1, Atg7, and Atg5 protein levels were decreased, leading to autophagy inhibition. Consistently, ATF4 and CREB, two master transcription factors for autophagosome biogenesis, were reduced in TRPM2-depleted cells. In addition, Atg13 and FIP200, which are known to stabilize ULK1 protein, were decreased. Reconstitution with TRPM2 fully restored proliferation, viability, and autophagy; ATF4 and CREB fully restored proliferation and viability but only partially restored autophagy. TRPM2 expression reduced the elevated ROS found in depleted cells. These data show that TRPM2 has an important role in AML proliferation and survival through regulation of key transcription factors and target genes involved in mitochondrial function, bioenergetics, the antioxidant response, and autophagy. Targeting TRPM2 may represent a novel therapeutic approach to inhibit myeloid leukemia growth and enhance susceptibility to chemotherapeutic agents through multiple pathways.","['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (TRPM Cation Channels)', '0 (TRPM2 protein, human)', '0 (Transient Receptor Potential Channels)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",PMC7170900,,,"['R01 HL119306/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM109882/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL137426/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM117014/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 HL109920/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL086699/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antiapoptotic members such as BCL-XL or MCL-1 safeguard the outer mitochondrial membrane and prevent accidental cell death in a functionally redundant and/or compensatory manner. However, BCL-XL/MCL-1-mediated ""dual apoptosis protection"" also impairs response of cancer cells to chemotherapy. Here, we show that hyperosmotic stress in the tumor environment abrogates dual BCL-XL/MCL-1 protection. Hypertonicity triggers upregulation of NOXA and loss of MCL-1 and thereby enforces exclusive BCL-XL addiction. Concomitant targeting of BCL-XL is sufficient to unlock the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in colorectal cancer cells. Functionally, ""osmotic reprogramming"" of the tumor environment grants contextual synthetic lethality to BCL-XL inhibitors in dually BCL-XL/MCL-1-protected cells. Generation of contextual synthetic lethality through modulation of the tumor environment could perspectively boost efficacy of anticancer drugs.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Pmaip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",PMC7171071,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Mar 20.,"BACKGROUND: We retrospectively analyzed patients with untreated aggressive adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma who received the modified EPOCH (mEPOCH) regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received up to 6 mEPOCH cycles. Etoposide (50 mg/m(2)/day), doxorubicin (10 mg/m(2)/day), and vincristine (0.4 mg/m(2)/day) were each given as a continuous 96-hour infusion on days 1 to 4. Prednisolone (40 mg/m(2)/day) was given intravenously or orally on days 1 to 4 and then tapered and stopped on day 7, and carboplatin (dose calculated for each patient individually using Calvert's formula according to a target under the curve of 3 mg/mL/min) was given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion on day 6. RESULTS: In 103 patients, overall response rate and complete response rate were 58% and 25%, respectively. With a median follow-up of 8.9 months, the median survival time was 9.8 months (95% confidence interval, 7.2-13.9 months). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.2 months (95% confidence interval, 3.4-5.7 months). Patients who completed >/= 4 cycles experienced significantly better overall survival and PFS compared with those who completed < 4 cycles. Twenty-eight patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after mEPOCH and demonstrated significantly prolonged overall survival and PFS compared with those who did not undergo transplantation.

The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of FeVBPs and haemoplasmas in cats across Italy and to identify potential risk factors linked to their occurrence. METHODS: Blood samples from 958 owned cats living in the North (n = 556), Centre (n = 173) and South (n = 229) of Italy were tested for Babesia spp., Hepatozoon spp., Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp. and filarioids by conventional PCR (cPCR) and for haemoplasmas and Bartonella spp. by SYBR green real-time PCR. Cats included in the study represent a sub-sample from a larger number of animals enrolled in a previous study, which were selected based on the geographical origin. Data on cats' positivity for Leishmania infantum, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), available from the previous study, were included and examined. Potential risk factors for pathogen infection were assessed in relationship to categorical variables including sex, geographical origin, breed, neutering status and age of cats. RESULTS: Out of the 958 cats, 194 (20.2%) were positive for at least one of the tested pathogens, 89 (16%) from the North, 32 (18.5%) from the Centre and 73 (31.9%) from the South of Italy. A high prevalence of FeVBPs was detected in male cats (n = 125, 27.8%), living in the southern part of the country (n = 73, 31.9%), younger than 18 months of age (n = 24, 22.4%) and not neutered (n = 39; 27.5%). In particular, 24 cats (2.5%) tested PCR-positive for Bartonella spp., of which 1.6% for B. henselae and 0.9% for B. clarridgeiae. A total of 111 cats scored PCR-positive for haemoplasmas (11.6%), specifically ""Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum"" (n = 95, 9.9%), M. haemofelis (n = 14, 1.5%) and ""Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis"" (n = 2, 0.2%). Moreover, 39, 31 and 8 cats were positive for FeLV (4.1%), L. infantum (3.2%) and FIV (0.8%), respectively. Co-infections were registered for 19 (9.8%) cats. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the occurrence of haemoplasmas and FeVBPs throughout Italy. Preventive measures to protect both animal and human health should be carried out also for owned cats, even if no health status of animals has been assessed in this study.","['0 (DNA, Bacterial)']",PMC7171850,['NOTNLM'],"['Bartonella spp.', 'Cat', 'Feline immunodeficiency virus', 'Feline leukemia virus', 'Haemoplasmas', 'Leishmania infantum', 'Vector-borne pathogens', 'Zoonosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 21.,"Background and Purpose- Women have worse stroke outcomes than men, especially after menopause. Few studies have focused on female-specific mechanisms, other than hormones. We investigated the role of the blood protein VTN (vitronectin) after ischemic stroke in mice. Methods- Adult male and female VTN knockout and wild-type littermates and C57BL/6 mice received a middle cerebral artery occlusion and the injured brain tissue analyzed 24 hours to 3 weeks later for cell loss and inflammation, as well as neurological function. Blood VTN levels were measured before and after stroke. Results- Intravenously injected VTN leaked extensively from bloodstream into brain infarct and penumbra by 24 hours after stroke. Strikingly, VTN was detrimental in female, but not male, mice, as shown by reduced brain injury (26.2+/-2.6% versus 13.4+/-3.8%; P=0.018; n=6 and 5) and forelimb dysfunction in female VTN knockout mice. Stroke increased plasma VTN 2- to 8-fold at 24 hours in females (36+/-4 versus 145+/-24 mug/mL; P<0.0001; n=10 and 7), but not males (62+/-8 versus 68+/-6; P>0.99; n=10 and 7), and returned to control levels by 7 days. Individually variable VTN levels at 24 hours correlated with stroke-induced brain injury at 7 days only in females. VTN promoted stroke-induced microglia/macrophage activation and leukocyte infiltration in females. Proinflammatory IL (interleukin)-6 greatly increased in the striatum at 24 hours in wild-type mice but was increased approximately 60% less in female (739+/-159 versus 268+/-111; P=0.02; n=7 and 6), but not male (889+/-178 versus 1179+/-295; P=0.73; n=10 and 11), knockout mice. In individual wild-type females, plasma VTN levels correlated with striatal IL-6 expression at 24 hours. The female-specific effect of VTN-induced IL-6 expression following stroke was not due to gonadal hormones, as shown by ovariectomy and castration. Lastly, intrastriatal injection of IL-6 in female mice immediately before stroke reversed the VTN knockout phenotypes of reduced brain injury and microglia/macrophage activation. Conclusions- VTN plays a novel sexually dimorphic detrimental pathophysiological role in females and might ultimately be a therapeutic target to improve stroke outcomes in women.","['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vitronectin)', '0 (interleukin-6, mouse)']",PMC7249257,['NOTNLM'],"['*blood', '*cell death', '*inflammation', '*ischemia', '*mice', '*sex characteristics', '*stroke']","['C06 RR030651/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG029493/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS102745/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS1578339'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These transporters are responsible for influx of cytarabine and reduced hENT1 expression is a major resistance mechanism in acute myeloid leukemia. We determined hENT1 and hCNT1 protein expression by immunocytochemistry in 50 diagnostic pediatric acute myeloid leukemia patient samples. All samples expressed hENT1 [9/43 (21%) low; 26/43 (60%) medium and 8/43 (19%) high] and hCNT1 [2/42 (5%) low; 35/42 (83%) medium and 5/42 (12%) high] at the cell membrane and cytoplasm. Statistical analysis showed a non-significant relationship between survival and transporter expression and in vitro drug sensitivity. In conclusion, the nucleoside transporters hENT1 and hCNT1 are broadly expressed in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia at diagnosis.","['0 (Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SLC29A1 protein, human)', '0 (cif nucleoside transporter)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'bovine serum albumin (BSA)', 'cytarabine (Ara-C)', 'deoxynucleoside analogs (NAs)', 'human concentrative nucleoside transporter-1 (hCNT1)', 'human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (hENT1)', 'phosphate buffered saline (PBS)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report a Chinese boy who do not show the characteristic of hypertrichosis cubiti, and was misdiagnosed as blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome at first. We found a de novo frameshift mutation (p.Glu390Lysfs*10) in the KMT2A gene, which was not reported before. Our study increases the cohort of Chinese WDSTS patients, and expand the WDSTS phenotypic and variation spectrum. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient demonstrated typical craniofacial features of blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome, including small palpebral fissures, ptosis, telecanthus, and epicanthus inversus, besides he had congenital heart disease (ventricular septal defects), strabismus, hypotonia, amblyopia, delayed speech and language development, delayed psychomotor development, and amblyopia (HP:0000646) which was not reported before. DIAGNOSIS: FOXL2 gene was cloned and sequenced, however, there was no mutation detected in this patient. The result of Chromosomal microarray analysis was normal. The patient was diagnosed as WDSTS by whole exome sequencing. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received cardiac surgery, frontalis suspension and regular speech and occupational therapy. He also treated with growth hormone (GH). OUTCOMES: The patient's symptoms are improved after cardiac surgery and frontalis suspension, he can express himself well now and had a 10 cm gain in height. LESSONS: As the relationship between genotype and phenotype becomes more and more clear, WES is incredibly powerful tool to diagnose the disease of WDSTS.","['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'Blepharophimosis, Ptosis, and Epicanthus Inversus', 'Growth Deficiency and Mental Retardation with Facial Dysmorphism', 'Hairy elbows']",PMC7440326,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: 79 AML patients with positive RUNX1-RUNX1T1 who received intensive consolidation therapy in CR(1) state from July 2011 to August 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression model were used to figure out the effect of leukocyte counts at onset and gene mutations for prognosis. Results: C-KIT, FLT3, CEBPA and DNMT3A gene mutations were found in 25 (31.6%) , 6 (7.6%) , 7 (8.9%) and 1 (1.3%) patient among the population. Mutations in C-KIT exon17 and C-KIT exon8 were detected in 19 (24.1%) and 5 (6.3%) cases, respectively, and mutations of FLT3-ITD were confirmed in 5 (6.3%) cases. The higher leukocyte counts presented at onset of leukemia, the shorter overall survival (OS) was seen in these patients (P=0.03) . Patients with C-KIT exon17 mutation had significantly shorter OS (P=0.01) and disease free survival (DFS) (P=0.006) compared with those without gene mutations, and patients with FLT3-ITD gene mutation got the inferior OS (P=0.048) and DFS (P=0.071) . Conclusion: In AML patients with positive RUNX1-RUNX1T1 receiving intensive consolidation therapy, the white blood cell counts at onset of leukemia, C-KIT mutations in exon 17, and FLT3-ITD gene mutations suggest poor prognosis, which would contribute to elaborate risk stratification, personalized treatment and predict prognosis for these patients.","['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",PMC7357927,['NOTNLM'],"['Genetic mutations', 'Leukemia, myeloid, acute', 'RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion gene', 'Second-generation sequencing']","['81970138/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'BRA2018391/Jiangsu Province ""333""project', 'QNRC2016719/Jiangsu Province Medical Youth Talent Program', '2016-WSN-123/Jiangsu Provincial Six Talent Peaks', 'GSW2019007/Gusu Key Medical Talent Progam']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: A hybridoma strain (6E11) capable of stably secreting CD123 antibody was obtained by a monoclonal screening technique, and the hybridoma cells were expanded and injected intraperitoneally to the pretreated Balb/c mice. Ascites was collected and purified to obtain the monoclonal antibody (mAb) . The affinity and specificity of 6E11 mAb were measured. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains of the 6E11 mAb were cloned by RT-PCR from the 6E11 mouse hybridoma. We generated a new CD123 specific chimeric antigen receptor with a scFv fragment derived from 6E11 antibody, designated as 6E11 CAR. T cells were transduced with lentiviral supernatant from 293T cells transfected with 6E11 CAR plasmid to generate 6E11 CAR-T cells. The specific cytotoxicity of 6E11 CAR-T against CD123(+) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and primary AML cells in vitro were evaluated by co-culture experiments, degranulation experiments and cytokine releasing assay. Results: 1 in circle A hybridoma cell line 6E11 stably secreting anti-human CD123 antibody was developed and its variable region sequences were obtained. 2 in circle The 6E11 mAb has high affinity for CD123 protein (Kd value: 2.1 nmol/L) . The 6E11 mAb specifically recognizes CD123(+) cell line THP-1 cells and does not respond to CD123(-) cell line Jurkat cells. 3 in circle 6E11 CAR-T cells were successfully generated with a CAR expression rate higher than 60%. 4 in circle 6E11 CAR-T cells could specifically kill CD123(+) MV4-11 cell line but had no killing effect on the CD123(-) K562 cell line. Compared with vector-T cells, 6E11 CAR-T cells have higher killing rate to MV4-11 cells[ (98.60+/-1.20) %vs (20.28+/-6.74) %, P<0.001]. MV4-11 cells activated 6E11 CAR-T cells significantly but not Vector-T cells[ (26.33+/-3.30) %vs (1.17+/-0.06) %, P<0.001]. 6E11 CAR-T cells released more cytokines than vector-T cells when co-cultured with MV4-11[IL-2: (92.90+/-1.51) pg/ml vs (6.05+/-3.41) pg/ml, P<0.001; TNF-alpha: (1 407.20+/-91.95) pg/ml vs (7.86+/-0.85) pg/ml, P<0.001; IFN-gamma: (5 614.60+/-170.17) pg/ml vs (8.42+/-2.70) pg/ml, P<0.001]. The IFN-gamma, IL-2 and TNF-alpha in the 6E11 CAR-T group were similar to those in the Vector-T group when co-cultured with K562. 6E11 CAR-T cells could be activated by bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) derived from CD123(+) AML patients and effectively kill these BMMNC cells from CD123(+) AML patients. Conclusion: 6E11 hybridoma cell line can stably secrete highly specific monoclonal antibodies against human CD123, which can be used to detect the expression of human CD123. It can also be used to target human CD123 protein in tumor immunotherapy. CD123 CAR-T cells with 6E11 Ig variable region sequence have specific anti-leukemic activity in vitro, which may provide a new option for further clinical research of AML.","['0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)']",PMC7357918,['NOTNLM'],"['Antigen recognition region', 'CD123', 'Chimeric antigen receptor', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, myeloid, acute']","['81830005/State Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2016-I2M-1-007/CAMS Initiative Fund for Medical Sciences']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We interrogated human tissue microarray samples via immunohistological analysis to address whether levels of KLF1 protein are associated with leukemia. We have made the unexpected findings that higher KLF1 levels are correlated with cells containing abnormal chromosomes, and that high KLF1 expression is not limited to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) associated with erythroid/megakaryoblastic differentiation. Expression of KLF1 is associated with poor survival. Further analyses reveal that KLF1 directly regulates a number of genes that play a role in chromosomal integrity. Together these results suggest that monitoring KLF1 levels may provide a new marker for risk stratification and prognosis in patients with AML.","['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (erythroid Kruppel-like factor)']",PMC7269198,['NOTNLM'],"['*EKLF/KLF1', '*Erythropoiesis', '*Leukemia', '*Tissue microarrays', '*Transcription factor']","['R01 DK046865/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA133608/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2020 Apr 18.,"Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is an aggressive peripheral T cell neoplasm caused by infection with human T cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1). Its prognosis remains extremely poor. Tax, the most important regulatory protein for HTLV-1, is associated with the aggressive proliferation of host cells and is also a major target antigen for CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). Based on our previous findings that Tax-specific CTLs with a T cell receptor (TCR) containing a unique amino-acid sequence motif exhibit strong HLA-A*24:02-restricted, Tax301-309-specific activity against HTLV-1, we aimed to develop a Tax-redirected T cell immunotherapy for ATL. TCR-a/beta genes were cloned from a previously established CTL clone and transduced into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy volunteers using a retroviral siTCR vector. Then the cytotoxic efficacy against HTLV-1-infected T cells or primary ATL cells was assessed both in vitro and in vivo. The redirected CTLs (Tax-siCTLs) produced a large amount of cytokines and showed strong killing activity against ATL/HTLV-1-infected T cells in vitro, although they did not have universal activity against ATL cells. Next, in a xenograft mouse model using an HTLV-1-infected T cell line (MT-2), in all mice treated with Tax-siCTLs, the tumor rapidly diminished and finally disappeared without normal tissue damage, although all mice that were untreated or treated with non-gene-modified PBMCs died because of tumor progression. Our findings confirm that Tax-siCTLs can exert strong anti-ATL/HTLV-1 effects without a significant reaction against normal cells and have the potential to be a novel immunotherapy for ATL patients.","['0 (Gene Products, tax)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adult T cell leukemia', '*Cytotoxic T cells', '*Human T cell lymphotropic virus type-1', '*T cell immunotherapy', '*Tax']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2020 Apr 18.,"The effects of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation on cord blood transplant (CBT) are unclear. We assessed the effect of CMV reactivation in adult single-unit CBT without in vivo T cell depletion. Of 3147 eligible cases, 2052 were acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 643 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 452 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). CMV reactivation up to 100 days after CBT was associated with better overall survival (OS) compared with no reactivation cases (57.3% versus 52.6% at 3 years after CBT), whereas nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was increased in ALL (16.2% versus 8.9%) and standard disease risk (17.1% versus 10.6%, P = .014) by CMV reactivation. On multivariate analysis, CMV reactivation had favorable effects on relapse in MDS (hazard ratio [HR], .55; P = .044) and high disease risk (HR, .77; P = .047). In NRM, only standard-risk cases showed adverse effects of CMV reactivation (HR, 1.56; P = .026). OS was significantly improved with CMV reactivation in a subgroup of patients with AML (HR, .84; P = .044), MDS (HR, .68; P = .048), and high disease risk (HR, .81; P = .013). This favorable effect of CMV reactivation on OS in AML and high disease risk cases was maintained even after considering the effect of grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease. Thus, CMV reactivation might have beneficial or adverse effects on relapse, NRM, and OS, depending on the disease type or disease risk.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cord blood transplantation', '*Cytomegalovirus reactivation', '*Nonrelapse mortality', '*Relapse']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2020 May 15.,"BACKGROUND: Androgens function through DNA and non-DNA binding-dependent signalling of the androgen receptor (AR). How androgens promote erythropoiesis is not fully understood. DESIGN AND METHODS: To identify the androgen signalling pathway, we treated male mice lacking the second zinc finger of the DNA-binding domain of the AR (AR(DeltaZF2) ) with non-aromatizable 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (5alpha-DHT) or aromatizable testosterone. To distinguish direct hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic mechanisms, we performed bone marrow reconstitution experiments. RESULTS: In wild-type mice, 5alpha-DHT had greater erythroid activity than testosterone, which can be aromatized to estradiol. The erythroid response in wild-type mice following 5alpha-DHT treatment was associated with increased serum erythropoietin (EPO) and its downstream target erythroferrone, and hepcidin suppression. 5alpha-DHT had no erythroid activity in AR(DeltaZF2) mice, proving the importance of DNA binding by the AR. Paradoxically, testosterone, but not 5alpha-DHT, suppressed EPO levels in AR(DeltaZF2) mice, suggesting testosterone following aromatization may oppose the erythroid-stimulating effects of androgens. Female wild-type mice reconstituted with AR(DeltaZF2) bone marrow cells remained responsive to 5alpha-DHT. In contrast, AR(DeltaZF2) mice reconstituted with female wild-type bone marrow cells showed no response to 5alpha-DHT. CONCLUSION: Erythroid promoting effects of androgens are mediated through DNA binding-dependent actions of the AR in non-hematopoietic cells, including stimulating EPO expression.","['0 (Androgens)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EPO protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA-binding actions', 'androgen receptor signalling', 'androgens', 'erythropoiesis', 'erythropoietin', 'genetically modified androgen receptor mouse model', 'non-hematopoietic cells']","['National Health and Medical Research Council', 'Medical Research Future Fund', 'The Eva and Les Erdi Major Research Grants', 'Sir Edward Dunlop Medical Research Foundation Grants', 'The Austin Medical Research Fund', 'Leukaemia Foundation', 'Merck & Co.', 'Australian Cancer Research Foundation', 'The University of Melbourne MRGS']",['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of hospitalization, hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities, and success in proceeding to alloSCT. Baseline characteristics of the cohorts were well matched, though patients receiving Ara-C couplets had more co-morbidities (48.5% vs 33%; P = .07). OR was achieved in 43.7% of MEC and 54.4% of Ara-C couplets patients (P = .10). Ara-C couplets patients also trended towards a longer OS and PFS, more frequently proceeded to alloSCT (31% vs 54.4%; P = .003), and experienced less febrile neutropenia (94% vs 72%; P < .001) and grade 3/4 gastrointestinal toxicities (17.2% vs 2.94%; P = .005). No significant differences in other toxicities or median duration of hospitalization were noted. This is the first multi-institutional study directly comparing these regimens in a racially diverse population of R/R AML patients. Although these regimens have equivalent efficacy in terms of achieving OR, Ara-C couplets use is associated with significant reductions in toxicities, suggesting it should be used more frequently in these patients.","['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",,,,['T32 CA009566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mortality rate outside of clinical IC trials, predictors of death, and resource utilization during admission for IC have not been thoroughly examined. We used the Premier Healthcare database to identify adult patients (aged 18-89 years) treated with cytarabine-anthracycline-based IC during their first recorded inpatient stay for AML during the contemporary period of 2010 to 2017. We identified factors associated with inpatient death or discharge to hospice, using multivariable logistic regression models. We also assessed the patterns of inpatient healthcare resource utilization. A total of 6442 patients with AML from 313 hospitals who were treated with IC were identified. Median age was 61 years (interquartile range [IQR], 50-68 years), and 56% were men. Median length of stay was 29 (IQR, 25-38) days, with rates of in-hospital death and discharge to hospice of 12.3% and 3.7% (17.9% and 6.3% among patients aged >/=65 years), respectively. Predictors of in-hospital death or discharge to hospice included older age, geographic region, and lower hospital volume. During admission, 28.0%, 12.6%, and 4.0% of patients required treatment in intensive care units, mechanical ventilation, and dialysis, respectively. Despite improvements in supportive care in the contemporary era, inpatient mortality during first hospitalization for adult patients with AML treated with IC in the US remains high particularly among older patients.","['0 (Anthracyclines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",PMC7189301,,,['UL1 TR001863/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. METHODS: In 2014, 122 nurses in a continuing education programme for healthcare personnel in Norway rated a sample of 38 diseases according to how prestigious they see these as being among healthcare workers in general. RESULTS: The nurses were found to rank myocardial infarction, leukaemia, and brain stroke at the top of the prestige hierarchy and depressive neurosis, anxiety neurosis, and fibromyalgia at the bottom. Their rankings overlap significantly with those previously documented for physicians and suggest that nurses assess the diseases through a 'cure' rather than a 'care' perspective on health care. CONCLUSION: The nurses ordered diseases in a prestige hierarchy and their rankings are strikingly like those of physicians. The findings are of significant relevance to nursing practice and set a new course for future research into prestige and nursing culture. IMPACT: The findings should encourage nurses - individually and collectively - to reflect on whether and how notions of disease prestige influence their decision-making. By showing that nurses as well as physicians are able to rate diseases according to prestige, the study suggests new avenues for future disease prestige research.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['clinical decision-making', 'culture', 'disease', 'esteem', 'nursing', 'prestige', 'survey']",['204324/The Research Council of Norway'],"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

However, public debate over the safety of the trivalent MMR vaccine and the resultant drop in vaccination coverage in several countries persists, despite its almost universal use and accepted effectiveness. This is an update of a review published in 2005 and updated in 2012. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness, safety, and long- and short-term adverse effects associated with the trivalent vaccine, containing measles, rubella, mumps strains (MMR), or concurrent administration of MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine (MMR+V), or tetravalent vaccine containing measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella strains (MMRV), given to children aged up to 15 years. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2019, Issue 5), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to 2 May 2019), Embase (1974 to 2 May 2019), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (2 May 2019), and ClinicalTrials.gov (2 May 2019). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), prospective and retrospective cohort studies (PCS/RCS), case-control studies (CCS), interrupted time-series (ITS) studies, case cross-over (CCO) studies, case-only ecological method (COEM) studies, self-controlled case series (SCCS) studies, person-time cohort (PTC) studies, and case-coverage design/screening methods (CCD/SM) studies, assessing any combined MMR or MMRV / MMR+V vaccine given in any dose, preparation or time schedule compared with no intervention or placebo, on healthy children up to 15 years of age. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. We grouped studies for quantitative analysis according to study design, vaccine type (MMR, MMRV, MMR+V), virus strain, and study settings. Outcomes of interest were cases of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, and harms. Certainty of evidence of was rated using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included 138 studies (23,480,668 participants). Fifty-one studies (10,248,159 children) assessed vaccine effectiveness and 87 studies (13,232,509 children) assessed the association between vaccines and a variety of harms. We included 74 new studies to this 2019 version of the review. Effectiveness Vaccine effectiveness in preventing measles was 95% after one dose (relative risk (RR) 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.13; 7 cohort studies; 12,039 children; moderate certainty evidence) and 96% after two doses (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.28; 5 cohort studies; 21,604 children; moderate certainty evidence). The effectiveness in preventing cases among household contacts or preventing transmission to others the children were in contact with after one dose was 81% (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.89; 3 cohort studies; 151 children; low certainty evidence), after two doses 85% (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.75; 3 cohort studies; 378 children; low certainty evidence), and after three doses was 96% (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.23; 2 cohort studies; 151 children; low certainty evidence). The effectiveness (at least one dose) in preventing measles after exposure (post-exposure prophylaxis) was 74% (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.50; 2 cohort studies; 283 children; low certainty evidence). The effectiveness of Jeryl Lynn containing MMR vaccine in preventing mumps was 72% after one dose (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.76; 6 cohort studies; 9915 children; moderate certainty evidence), 86% after two doses (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.35; 5 cohort studies; 7792 children; moderate certainty evidence). Effectiveness in preventing cases among household contacts was 74% (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.49; 3 cohort studies; 1036 children; moderate certainty evidence). Vaccine effectiveness against rubella is 89% (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.42; 1 cohort study; 1621 children; moderate certainty evidence). Vaccine effectiveness against varicella (any severity) after two doses in children aged 11 to 22 months is 95% in a 10 years follow-up (rate ratio (rr) 0.05, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.08; 1 RCT; 2279 children; high certainty evidence). Safety There is evidence supporting an association between aseptic meningitis and MMR vaccines containing Urabe and Leningrad-Zagreb mumps strains, but no evidence supporting this association for MMR vaccines containing Jeryl Lynn mumps strains (rr 1.30, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.56; low certainty evidence). The analyses provide evidence supporting an association between MMR/MMR+V/MMRV vaccines (Jeryl Lynn strain) and febrile seizures. Febrile seizures normally occur in 2% to 4% of healthy children at least once before the age of 5. The attributable risk febrile seizures vaccine-induced is estimated to be from 1 per 1700 to 1 per 1150 administered doses. The analyses provide evidence supporting an association between MMR vaccination and idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura (ITP). However, the risk of ITP after vaccination is smaller than after natural infection with these viruses. Natural infection of ITP occur in 5 cases per 100,000 (1 case per 20,000) per year. The attributable risk is estimated about 1 case of ITP per 40,000 administered MMR doses. There is no evidence of an association between MMR immunisation and encephalitis or encephalopathy (rate ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.61; 2 observational studies; 1,071,088 children; low certainty evidence), and autistic spectrum disorders (rate ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.01; 2 observational studies; 1,194,764 children; moderate certainty). There is insufficient evidence to determine the association between MMR immunisation and inflammatory bowel disease (odds ratio 1.42, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.16; 3 observational studies; 409 cases and 1416 controls; moderate certainty evidence). Additionally, there is no evidence supporting an association between MMR immunisation and cognitive delay, type 1 diabetes, asthma, dermatitis/eczema, hay fever, leukaemia, multiple sclerosis, gait disturbance, and bacterial or viral infections. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Existing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of MMR/MMRV vaccines support their use for mass immunisation. Campaigns aimed at global eradication should assess epidemiological and socioeconomic situations of the countries as well as the capacity to achieve high vaccination coverage. More evidence is needed to assess whether the protective effect of MMR/MMRV could wane with time since immunisation.","['0 (Chickenpox Vaccine)', '0 (Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine)', '0 (Vaccines, Attenuated)']",PMC7169657,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration.

The mechanisms of T cell dysfunction in CLL are not well understood. Studying immunity against chronic viruses allows for detailed analysis of the effect of CLL on T cells chronically exposed to a specific antigen. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivations are rare in CLL, which corroborates with preserved CMV-specific T cell function. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is another herpesvirus that results in chronic infection, but unlike CMV, is characterized by subclinical reactivations in CLL patients. Since both herpesviruses induce strong CD8(+) T cell responses, but have different clinical outcomes, studying these specific T cells may shed light on the mechanisms of CLL-induced T cell dysfunction. We first analyzed the phenotype of EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells in CLL and healthy controls, and found that in CLL EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells are in an advanced differentiation state with higher expression of inhibitory receptors. Secondly, CLL-derived EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells show reduced cytotoxic potential, in contrast to CMV-specific T cells. Finally, we performed transcriptome analysis to visualize differential modulation by CLL of these T cell subsets. While T cell activation and differentiation genes are unaffected, in EBV-specific T cells expression of genes involved in synapse formation and T cell exhaustion is altered. Our findings on the heterogeneity of antigen specific T cell function in CLL aids in understanding immune-dysregulation in this disease.",,PMC7162091,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 the Author(s).

They may emerge from any part of the mesentery and grow to any size, thus conditioning a wide range of clinical manifestations that renders them easily mistaken for different gastrointestinal pathologies. Diagnosis encompasses a mixture of clinical suspicion, imaging techniques and sometimes surgery, and curative treatment is based on complete surgical resection of the cyst. We hereby present a case of a mesenteric cyst that developed on the anterior abdominal wall of a 59-year-old man awaiting allogeneic bone marrow transplantation after being diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia. He was admitted to the emergency room with complaints of an increased abdominal perimeter and increased weight, not associated with alterations to his dietary or physical exercise habits. Suspecting ascites in the context of leukaemic progression, the patient was admitted to the medical ward; however, subsequent study identified a mesenteric cyst as the most probable diagnosis and the patient was proposed to undergo surgery. He underwent laparotomic cyst excision without complications and the histological evaluation of the surgical specimen confirmed the diagnosis. LEARNING POINTS: Although rare entities, mesenteric cysts should be suspected whenever nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms are present and liquid collections are identified.Treatment consists of complete surgical excision, which, although not free of complications, is usually safe and the recurrence rate is very low.In light of the lymphatic theory with respect to the aetiology of mesenteric cysts, this nosologic entity should be highly suspected in oncologic patients where lymphangiogenesis is potentiated.",,PMC7162577,['NOTNLM'],"['Mesenteric cyst', 'abdominal mass', 'ascites', 'chronic myeloid leukaemia']",,['(c) EFIM 2020.'],,"['Conflicts of Interests: The Authors declare that there are no competing', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aims of this study are to explore the long-term outcome of newly childhood acute myeloid patients treated at Hue Central Hospital from 2010 to 2019.A retrospective study was conducted on 98 children with AML who admitted Hue Central Hospital from January 2010 to December 2019. The diagnosis was confirmed by morphological FAB criteria, cytochemistry and immunophenotype. Patients were treated with using modified AML 7-3 Regimen. Social supports were provided to patients/families. A total of 98 children with AML were analyzed with mean age of 5.6 years ranging from 3 months to 15 years. The male to female ratio was 1.8:1. The overall complete remission rate after induction were 82.6%). Patients accounted for 46 (46.9%) had relapses which occurred in during chemotherapy n=27 (27,6%), after finishing chemotherapy n=19(19,4%). Overall survival at 3 years were 23.2%. The event-free survival at 3 years were 20.2%o. Abandonment cases were 4 (4.1%). During the period study, abandonment has been reduced successfully with holistic strategies such as financial support, managing family group, providing education, early follow-up of patients who missed appointments and free accommodation near hospital for patients/families. However, with a high rate patient achieved complete remission after induction phase (82.6%), but the overal survival and event-free survival at 3 years were still low in my hospital (23.2 % and 20.2% respectively).

In particular, the study aims to determine whether maternal locus of control can influence sick children's coping styles, and if this relation can be used to predict maladjustments. The study analyzed a cohort of 60 pediatric leukemia patients undergoing treatment and a group formed by their mothers. The participants were recruited from two Pediatric Onco- Hematology Units in Italy. The Child Behavioral Style Scale (CBSS) was used to assess children's coping strategies, whereas the Parental Health Locus of Control Scale (PHLCS) was employed to analyze maternal locus of control. A linear regression model was applied to verify a possible interdependent relationship between children's coping styles and maternal locus of control. The differences in mean CBSS scores were analyzed by K-S test. Multivariate analysis of variance was performed to assess any potential effect of child's gender, hospital context and maternal socio-cultural status on children's coping strategies. Our results show a significant relationship between children's coping strategies and maternal locus of control. In particular, the scales mass media, fate and healthcare professionals display a predictive effect on children's monitoring coping style, given the positive correlation observed (F=3.28, P=0.008). In contrast, the same scales negatively correlate with blunting coping style (F=3.5, P=0.005). Our results reveal several interesting resources having a profound impact on the psychological functioning of children with leukemia undergoing treatment as well as their mothers. Furthermore, with regard to the central hypothesis of the study, our findings show both positive and negative correlations between specific scales of maternal locus of control and children's coping style, which could be used to predict children at risk of emotional maladjustment.",,PMC7160854,['NOTNLM'],"['children', 'coping', 'leukemia', 'locus of control', 'mothers']",,['(c)Copyright: the Author(s).'],,['Conflict of interest: the authors declare no conflict of interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, bioactive phospho-therapy with black phosphorus nanosheets (BPs) for in vivo tumor suppression is studied. Methods: Orthotopic liver tumor and acute myeloid leukemia are chosen as the models for the solid tumor and hematological tumor, respectively. BPs are injected into mice through the tail vein and tumor growth is monitored by IVIS bioluminescence imaging. Tumor tissues and serum samples are collected to determine the suppression effect and biosafety of BPs after treatment. Results: The in vitro studies show that BPs with high intracellular uptake produce apoptosis- and autophagy-mediated programmed cell death of human liver carcinoma cells but do not affect normal cells. BPs passively accumulate in the tumor site at a high concentration and inhibit tumor growth. The tumor weight is much less than that observed from the doxorubicin (DOX)-treated group. The average survival time is extended by at least two months and the survival rate is 100% after 120 days. Western bolt analysis confirms that BPs suppress carcinoma growth via the apoptosis and autophagy pathways. In addition, administration of BPs into mice suffering from leukemia results in tumor suppression and long survival. Conclusions: This study reveals that BPs constitute a type of bioactive anti-cancer agents and provides insights into the application of inorganic nanomaterials to cancer therapy.","['0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '27YLU75U4W (Phosphorus)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",PMC7163432,['NOTNLM'],"['*bioactive phospho-therapy', '*black phosphorus', '*cancer therapy', '*selective cell killing', '*two-dimensional nanomaterials']",,['(c) The author(s).'],,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, the RT-PCR result for PML-RARA of this patient was a false negative and mutational analysis of AML-related genes showed SNP rs2454206 in the TET2 gene and yielded negative findings in other genes including AML1, ASXL1, CEBPA, DNMT3A, FLT3, KIT, NPM1, TP53, and U2AF1. After the early usage of arsenic trioxide combinated with ATRA and vigorous supportive treatment to maintain PLT >/=30x10(9)/L and FIB >1500 mg/L, this patient was under MMR and HCR without any clinical symptoms or signs until now. Conclusion: False negative reslults of RT-PCR analysis for PML-RARA are rare in APL and ider(17) is even more infrequent. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of APL with ider(17) and false negative RT-PCR analysis results. The role of ider(17) in APL is still an ongoing investigation and limited by the small number of published cases.

Herein we report a patient diagnosed with therapy-related AML 2 months after chemoradiotherapy for esophageal cancer. A 61-year-old man with dysphagia was diagnosed with locally advanced esophageal cancer with para-aortic lymph node metastasis. Laboratory blood test did not reveal any abnormality except mild macrocytic anemia. To alleviate dysphagia due to malignant esophageal stenosis, the patient underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy of 60 Gy in 30 fractions with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil at a local area in thoracic esophagus. Dysphagia alleviated during chemoradiotherapy; however, pancytopenia did not recover after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, and general fatigue with fever developed 13 weeks after the last day of chemoradiotherapy. To rule out hematological malignancy, bone marrow biopsy was performed. The bone marrow smear and flow cytometry analysis indicated the development of AML. Chromosomal test revealed a complex karyotype, suggesting that AML was associated with myelodysplastic syndrome. The patient died 1 month after the diagnosis of therapy-related AML. Thus, the findings indicate that therapy-related AML may develop during the acute phase of chemoradiotherapy and bone marrow biopsy is necessary when prolonged pancytopenia exists after chemoradiotherapy.",,PMC7154239,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute adverse event', 'Chemoradiotherapy', 'Esophageal cancer', 'Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 by S.

There is a paucity of data related to their prognostic implications in children. We describe 2 pediatric patients with FLT3-activating mutations as a feature of their AML. Both were diagnosed in infancy. The first experienced induction failure and had refractory disease without expression of FLT3-TKD mutation on subsequent bone marrow evaluations. His disease also harbored a KMT2A-PICALM gene rearrangement. He died of invasive fungal disease nine months after diagnosis. The second had a post-induction remission but developed swelling of the left calcaneus shown on biopsy to be a myeloid sarcoma positive for a new BRAF V600E mutation in addition to his known KMT2A rearrangement but without FLT3-TKD mutation. Despite multiple courses of therapy including BRAF/MEK-inhibition, he died of progressive disease nine months after diagnosis. FLT3 inhibition was not utilized in either patient as studies have largely focused on its role in internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations and because the mutation was no longer detectable in either patient on subsequent evaluation.

PG2 extracted from A. membranaceus has been demonstrated as a novel alternative medicine for cancer patients. Recently, we demonstrated that PG2 enhanced chemotherapy through bystander effect and reduced the expression of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1 in tumor cells. Many tumors have been proven to have a high expression of programmed cell death protein ligand-1 (PD-L1), which binds with programmed cell death protein-1(PD-1) in immune cells, thus causing immune tolerance within the tumor microenvironment. With decreased expression of PD-L1, increased immune response can be observed, which might be helpful when developing tumor immunotherapy. The antitumor therapeutic effect mediated by PG2 may associate with an inflammatory immune response at the tumor site. However, the molecular mechanism that by which PG2 inhibits PD-L1 is still incompletely known. The expression of PD-L1 was decreased after tumor cells were treated with PG2. In addition, the cell signaling pathway in tumor cells was evaluated by Western blotting analysis after PG2 treatment. PG2 can downregulate the expression of PD-L1 on the cell surface via the protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (p70S6K) pathway. In conclusion, our results indicate that PG2 inhibits PD-L1 expression and plays a crucial role in immunotherapy, which might be a promising strategy combined with other treatments.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (Cd274 protein, mouse)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",PMC7163360,['NOTNLM'],"['programmed cell death protein ligand-1', 'the extracts of Astragalus membranaceus (PG2)', 'tumor immune tolerance']",,['(c) The author(s).'],,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Materials and Methods: In the present study, we used RT-PCR to detect the expression of SOCS2-AS in FLT3-ITD+, FLT3-ITD- AML patients and different AML cell lines. The colony formation and CCK-8 assay were performed to analyze the proliferation ability, and the flow cytometry was performed to analyze the capacity of apoptosis in Molm-13 and MV4-11 cells. The Western blot was applied to detect the expression of STAT5 and p-STAT5. The RNA pull-down and luciferase activity were used to investigate the interaction between SOCS2-AS and miR-221. Results: The results indicate that SOCS2-AS shows overexpression in FLT3-ITD+ AML patients compared to FLT3-ITD- AML patients. Si-SOCS2-AS can inhibit the proliferation, boost the apoptosis and induce the cycle arrest in Molm-13 cells, and SOCS2-AS overexpression promotes proliferation and colony formation in MV4-11 cells. The miR-221 shows overexpression in FLT3-ITD+ AML patients compared to FLT3-ITD- AML patients. And the expression level of miR-221 and SOCS2-AS shows negative correlation in FLT3-ITD+ AML patients. Functionally, SOCS2-AS could be interacted with miR-221 in AML cells. After SOCS2-AS knockdown, the phosphorylation level of STAT5 was significantly decreased. Moreover, miR-221 inhibitor can rescue the viability in cells after si-SOCS2-AS transfection. And it is stated that SOCS2-AS regulates the STAT5 signal transduction pathway with sponging miR-221. Conclusion: In conclusion, this study confirms the molecular mechanism of SOCS2-AS in AML by targeting the miR-221/STAT5 signaling pathway.

The natural product Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) exhibits significant anti-tumor effect in various human cancers, however, the mechanism remains elusive. Methods: The inhibitory effect of Tan IIA NSCLC cells was determined by MTS and soft agar assays. The activation of EGFR signaling and the protein level of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) were examined by immunoblot (IB), immunohistochemical staining (IHC), and ubiquitination analysis. The in vivo anti-tumor effect was validated by the xenograft mouse model. Results: Tan IIA inhibits NSCLC cells through suppression of EGFR signaling. Tan IIA decreases cell viability and colony formation in EGFR wild type and activating mutant cell lines. The IB data further confirmed that Tan IIA suppresses EGFR phosphorylation time- and dose-dependently. Tan IIA destabilizes Mcl-1 and shortens the half-life. Ubiquitination analysis showed that treatment with Tan IIA promotes Mcl-1 ubiquitination and degradation. Further study showed that the downregulation of EGFR-Akt signaling is required for Tan IIA-induced Mcl-1 reduction. Ectopic overexpression of constitutively activated Akt1 compromised these antitumor efficacies in Tan IIA-treated NSCLC cells. Finally, Tan IIA inhibited the in vivo tumor growth. Conclusion: Our data indicate that Tan IIA acts as an EGFR signaling inhibitor, and targeting EGFR-Akt-Mcl1 axis could provide a new option for NSCLC treatment.",,PMC7135250,['NOTNLM'],"['Mcl-1', 'Tanshinone IIA', 'epidermal growth factor receptor', 'non-small cell lung cancer', 'ubiquitination']",,['(c) 2020 Gao et al.'],,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma often presents with cervical lymph node metastasis, and can pose a diagnostic challenge in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who may have pre-existing palpable neck nodes. METHODS: A retrospective case review of a health board was conducted to identify patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with a previous diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. RESULTS: Four patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma that developed after non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were identified. Two patients had a background of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with chemotherapy. The remaining two patients had a background of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia under active surveillance. Three out of the four patients died within 30 months of diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma following non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is aggressive.

NUDT15 was identified as a novel thiopurine regulator conferring 6MP sensitivity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of NUDT15 variants on 6MP-induced neutropenia in Thai children with ALL. Materials & methodology: Genotyping of NUDT15 (c.415C>T; rs116855232) and c.36_37insGGAGTC; rs554405994) was performed by Sanger sequencing in 100 patients with ALL. Patients were classified into wild-type (group 1), heterozygous variant (group 2) and homozygous variant (group 3). Clinical and laboratory features during the first 6 months of maintenance therapy were investigated. Therapy-induced neutropenia was observed in 31 patients during the weeks 1-8 (early myelotoxicity), while therapy-induced neutropenia was observed in 47 patients during the weeks 9-24 (late myelotoxicity). Results: There were 85 wild-type patients, 14 heterozygous variant patients and one homozygous variant patient. NUDT15 variants were associated with neutropenia as compared with wild-type (odds ratio: 17.862; 95% CI: 4.198-75.992, padj = 9.5 x 10(-5)). Multivariate analysis showed that the low-risk group was associated with neutropenia (p = 0.014) in the first 8 weeks of 6MP therapy. Group 2 and group 3 patients had significantly lower absolute neutrophil counts compared with group 1. The adjusted dose during the first 6 months of maintenance therapy with NUDT15 genotype group 1, 2 and 3 were 50, 36.6 and 12.5 mg/m(2)/day, respectively.

Epub 2020 Apr 30.,"G-quadruplexes (GQs) are highly ordered nucleic acid structures that play fundamental roles in regulating gene expression and maintaining genomic stability. GQs are topologically diverse and enriched in promoter sequences of growth regulatory genes and proto-oncogenes, suggesting that they may serve as attractive targets for drug design at the level of transcription rather than inhibiting the activity of the protein products of these genes. The c-kit promoter contains three adjacent GQ-forming sequences that have proposed antagonistic effects on gene expression and thus are promising drug targets for diseases such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors, mast cell disease, and leukemia. Because GQ stability is influenced by primary structure, secondary structure, and ion interactions, a greater understanding of GQ structure, dynamics, and ion binding properties is needed to develop novel, GQ-targeting therapeutics. Here, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to systematically study the c-kit2 and c-kit* GQs, evaluating nonpolarizable and polarizable force fields (FFs) and examining the effects of base substitutions and cation type (K(+), Na(+), and Li(+)) on the dynamics of their isolated and linked structures. We found that the Drude polarizable FF outperformed the additive CHARMM36 FF in two- and three-tetrad GQs and solutions of KCl, NaCl, and LiCl. Drude simulations with different cations agreed with the known GQ stabilization preference (K(+) > Na(+) > Li(+)) and illustrated that tetrad core-ion coordination differs as a function of cation type. Finally, we showed that differences in primary and secondary structure influence loop sampling, ion binding, and core-ion energetics of GQs.","['0 (Ions)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",PMC7221321,,,['R35 GM133754/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['NIHMS1586205'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 19.,"CONTEXT: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rare disease in children, with only 50% to 60% event-free survival. Among patients with AML, 10% do not respond to first-line chemotherapy. There is no recommendation concerning second-line treatments. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) is a monoclonal antibody targeting CD33, linked to calicheamicin. We report the efficacy and tolerance of a salvage regimen of fludarabin, cytarabine, and GO (FLA-GO) in patients refractory to first-line treatment. METHODS: Eight patients (median age 14.5 years), who had more than 2% minimal residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry (MRD flow), received gemtuzumab 3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 7, associated with cytarabine 2000 mg/m(2) and fludarabin 30 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 5. RESULTS: Six patients achieved complete remission (CR) (blast count morphology </=5 x 10(-2) , CR-MRD flow <1 x 10(-3) for four patients). Five patients received a second course. We observed 11 episodes of febrile neutropenia, including 6 septicemias without complication. There was no fungal infection or toxic death. Two patients received granulocyte colony stimulating factor. One patient had partial platelet recovery; one, prolonged pancytopenia. All patients received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We observed five mild-to-severe sinusoidal obstruction syndromes during HSCT procedures, particularly in patients who did not receive defibrotide prophylaxis. At the date of last contact (median follow-up: 58 months; range: 22-78), six patients were in continuous CR with negative MRD. Two patients died of post-HSCT relapse. CONCLUSION: FLA-GO is a good salvage regimen for pediatric refractory AML, with significant but acceptable toxicity. HSCT is mandatory to achieve sustained CR in these patients.","['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML: molecular diagnosis and therapy', '*gemtuzumab', '*minimal residual disease', '*pediatric hematology/oncology', '*refractory AML', '*salvage therapy']",,"['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 19.,"PURPOSE: Anastomotic leakage constitutes a dreaded complication after colorectal surgery, leading to increased morbidity and mortality as well as prolonged hospitalization. Most leakages become clinically apparent about 8 days after surgery; however, early detection is quintessential to reduce complications and to improve patients' outcome. We therefore investigated the significance of specific protein expression profiles as putative biomarkers, indicating anastomotic leakage. METHODS: In this single-center prospective cohort study serum and peritoneal fluid samples-from routinely intraoperatively inserted drainages-of colorectal cancer patients were collected 3 days after colorectal resection. Twenty patients without anastomotic leakage and 18 patients with an anastomotic leakage and without other complications were included. Protein expression of seven inflammatory markers in serum and peritoneal fluid was assessed by multiplex ELISA and correlated with patients' clinical data. RESULTS: Monocyte chemoattractant protein 2 (CCL8/MCP-2), leukemia-inhibiting factor (LIF), and epithelial-derived neutrophil-activating protein (CXCL5/ENA-78) were significantly elevated in peritoneal fluid but not in serum samples from patients subsequently developing anastomotic leakage after colorectal surgery. No expressional differences could be found between grade B and grade C anastomotic leakages. CONCLUSION: Measurement 3 days after surgery revealed altered protein expression patterns of the inflammatory markers CCL8/MCP2, LIF, and CXCL5/ENA-78 in peritoneal fluid from patients developing anastomotic leakage after colorectal surgery. Further studies with a larger patient cohort with inclusion of different variables are needed to evaluate their potential as predictive biomarkers for anastomotic leakage.","['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CCL8 protein, human)', '0 (CXCL5 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL8)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL5)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",PMC7320065,['NOTNLM'],"['Anastomotic leakage', 'CCL8', 'CXCL5', 'Colorectal cancer', 'LIF']","['WE 3548/4-1/DFG, KFO 227', '2012/Surgery Foundation Heidelberg']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 19.,"Patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP CML) can be effectively treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and achieve a lifespan similar to the general population. The success of TKIs, however, requires long-term and sometimes lifelong treatment; thus, patient-assessed health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has become an increasingly important parameter for treatment selection. Bosutinib is a TKI approved for CP CML in newly diagnosed adults and in those resistant or intolerant to prior therapy. In the Bosutinib Trial in First-Line Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment (BFORE), bosutinib demonstrated a significantly higher major molecular response rate compared with imatinib, with maintenance of HRQoL (measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia (FACT-Leu) questionnaire), after 12 months of first-line treatment. We examined relationships between molecular response (MR) and HRQoL. MR values were represented by a log-reduction scale (MRLR; a continuous variable). A repeated-measures longitudinal model was used to estimate the relationships between MRLR as a predictor and each FACT-Leu domain as an outcome. Effect sizes were calculated to determine strength of effects and allow comparisons across domains. The majority of FACT-Leu domains (with the exception of social well-being and physical well-being) demonstrated a significant relationship with MRLR (p < 0.05). Our results showed variable impact of clinical improvement on different dimensions of HRQoL. For patients who achieved MR(5), emotional well-being and leukemia-specific domains showed the greatest improvement, with medium differences in effect sizes, whereas social well-being and physical well-being had the weakest relationship with MR.","['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",PMC7237399,['NOTNLM'],"['Bosutinib', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Health-related quality of life', 'Imatinib', 'Molecular response']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a trial of eltrombopag in patients with MDS, MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with 20-30% myeloblasts after HMA failure and mean baseline platelet count </= 50 x 10(9)/L. Eltrombopag was escalated from 50 mg daily up to 200 mg daily. The primary objective was to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD). 37 patients were enrolled, and MTD was not reached. Responses were observed in 9 patients (24%), 2 achieving marrow CR with hematologic improvement (HI), 1 marrow CR without HI, and 6 HI. Median overall survival was 7.5 months. Eltrombopag was well-tolerated and yielded modest responses in heavily treated, predominantly higher-risk MDS patients after HMA failure. Future studies should focus on determining characteristics that predict response.","['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'S56D65XJ9G (eltrombopag)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Myelodysplastic syndromes', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*azacitidine', '*decitabine', '*eltrombopag']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 May 3.,"Cross-linking of the B-cell receptor (BCR) induces transcriptional activation of immediate early genes (IEGs) including EGR1 and DUSP2 in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Here, we have shown that this transcriptional activation correlated with histone H3 threonine 6 and 11 phosphorylation. Both transcription and histone post-translational modifications are repressed by ibrutinib, a small molecule inhibitor used in CLL treatment. Moreover, we have identified the death-associated protein kinase 3 (DAPK3), as the kinase mediating these histone phosphorylation marks in response to activation of the BCR signalling pathway with this kinase being recruited to RNA polymerase II in an anti-IgM-dependent manner. DAPK inhibition mimics ibrutinib-induced repression of both IEG mRNA and histone H3 phosphorylation and has anti-proliferative effect comparable to ibrutinib in CLL in vitro. DAPK inhibitor does not repress transcription itself but impacts on mRNA processing and has a broader anti-tumour effect than ibrutinib, by repressing both anti-IgM- and CD40L-dependent activation.","['0 (Histones)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '1114-81-4 (Phosphothreonine)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DAPK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Death-Associated Protein Kinases)']",PMC7266284,['NOTNLM'],"['*CLL', '*DAPK3', '*H3T11', '*Ibrutinib', '*histone phosphorylation', '*mRNA processing']",,['(c) 2020 The Authors.

ABL-class genes). Using FISH with probes for these genes, we screened 55 pediatric and 50 adult B-other cases. Three (6%) of the adult but none of the childhood B-other cases were positive for ABL-class aberrations. RT-PCR and sequencing confirmed a rare SFPQ-ABL1 fusion in one adult B-other case with t(1;9)(p34;q34). Only six SFPQ-ABL1-positive BCP ALLs have been reported, present case included. A review of these shows that all harbored fusions between exon 9 of SFPQ and exon 4 of ABL1, that the fusion is typically found in adolescents/younger adults without hyperleukocytosis, and that IKZF1 deletions are recurrent. The few patients not treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation relapsed, strengthening the notion that TKI should be added to the therapy of SFPQ-ABL1-positive BCP ALL.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PTB-Associated Splicing Factor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ABL1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['* SFPQ-ABL1 fusion', '*B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*t(1;9)(p34;q34)']",,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Epub 2020 May 6.,"Relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a major determinant of outcome. A number of molecularly directed treatment options have recently emerged making comprehensive diagnostics an important pillar of clinical decision making at relapse. Acknowledging the high degree of individual genetic variability at AML relapse, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has opened the opportunity for assessing the unique clonal hierarchy of individual AML patients. Knowledge on the genetic makeup of AML is reflected in patient customized treatment strategies thereby providing improved outcomes. For example, the emergence of druggable mutations at relapse enable the use of novel targeted therapies, including FLT3 inhibitors or the recently approved IDH1/2 inhibitors ivosidenib and enasidenib, respectively. Consequently, some patients may undergo novel bridging approaches for reinduction before allogeneic stem cell transplantation, or the identification of an adverse prognostic marker may initiate early donor search.

Stx consists of one enzymatic A subunit and five B subunits (StxB) that are involved in binding. The StxB pentamer specifically recognizes a glycosphingolipid, globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), as a receptor; therefore, it can be used as a probe to detect Gb3. This chapter describes the preparation of recombinant Stx1B proteins using E. coli, their conjugation with fluorescent dyes, and their application for flow cytometry. The prepared fluorescent StxB proteins bound to cells of several lines, including the HeLa human cervix adenocarcinoma cell line and the THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cell line. Furthermore, the probe was useful for confirmation of several sphingolipid-deficient HeLa cell lines that were constructed using genome editing.","['0 (Alexa Fluor 555)', '0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', '0 (LAPTM4A protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '0 (Shiga Toxins)', '0 (Sphingolipids)', '0 (Sulfonic Acids)', '0 (TM9SF2 protein, human)', '0 (stxB toxin)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Affinity purification', '*Flow cytometry', '*Fluorescent Stx1B', '*Gb3', '*Glycosphingolipid', '*Shiga toxin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 18.,"BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have dramatically improved survival outcomes in patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-CP) and are associated with a manageable safety profile. However, long-term TKI administration can lead to cardiovascular or renal adverse events. One goal in discontinuation of TKIs was reduction of adverse events, but it is unclear whether chronic toxicities are ameliorated as a result. In this study, we evaluated changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with CML-CP before and after TKI discontinuation. Long-term TKI treatment appears to induce renal toxicity, as eGFR at the time of TKI discontinuation correlated with the duration of TKI treatment (r = - 0.478, p = 0.005). Patients who received imatinib as first-line treatment exhibited lower eGFR levels than those treated with dasatinib or nilotinib, which may be correlated with long-term treatment (p = 0.027). After TKI discontinuation, no significant increases in eGFR were seen either in patients with treatment-free remission (66.8-71.2 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) or molecular relapse (64.8-68.7 ml/min/1.73 m(2), p = 0.666). These data indicate that TKI-induced renal toxicities are associated with long-term TKI treatment, and may be irreversible even following treatment discontinuation.","['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Dasatinib', 'Imatinib', 'Nilotinib', 'Renal toxicities']","['19K17860/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', '17K09908/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the state of granulopoiesis in a patient during treatment, places the clinician in an advantageous position. Mathematical models are aids able to present the clinician with insight into the behaviour of myeloid-derived leucocytes. The main objective of this investigation was to determine whether a proposed model of ALL during induction therapy would be a usable descriptor of the system. The model assumes the co-occurrence of the independent leukaemic and normal marrow populations. It is comprised of four delay-differential equations, capturing the fundamental characteristics of the blood and bone marrow myeloid leucocytes and B-lineage lymphoblasts. The effect of treatment was presumed to amplify cell loss within both populations. Clinical data was used to inform the construction, calibration and examination of the model. The model is promising-presenting a good foundation for the development of a clinical supportive tool. The predicted parameters and forecasts aligned with clinical expectations. The starting assumptions were also found to be sound. A comparative investigation highlighted the differing responses of similarly diagnosed patients during treatment and further testing on patient data emphasized patient specificity. Model examination recommended the explicit consideration of the suppressive effects of treatment on the normal population production. Additionally, patient-related factors that could have resulted in such different responses between patients need to be considered. The parameter estimates require refinement to incorporate the action of treatment. Furthermore, the myeloid populations require separate consideration. Despite the model providing explanation, incorporating these recommendations would enhance both model usability and predictive capacity.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*clinical data', '*delay-differential equations', '*granulocyte', '*lymphoblast', '*mathematical model']",,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

METHODS: The eukaryotic expression vector of PSF was transfected with liposomes transiently, then flow cytometry was used to detect the expression level of PSF on the cell surface 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after vector transfections. We constructed a chimeric expression vector, streptavidin binding peptide (SBP)-PSF, meanwhile this vector was transfected and made SBP-PSF fusion protein overexpress. In addition, we used streptavidin magnetic beads to precipitate the cellular chaperonin of PSF and then identified its chaperonin by mass spectrometry (MS). Lentiviral vectors containing cytokeratin18 (K18) interference sequences were transfected into 293T cells to prepare lentivirus. HL60 and HL60/DOX cells were infected with lentivirus to obtain stable interfering K18 cell lines. Next, flow cytometry was used to test the membrane relocation level of PSF. Together, these methods confirmed the similar or different mechanisms of the PSF redistributing to membrane synergistically mediated by K18 in HL60 and HL60/DOX cells. RESULTS: The expression of membrane relocated PSF was detected every day for three days (at the end of 24 h, 48 h and 72 h) after transient overexpression. The expressing rate of PSF on the cell surface was 22.4%+/-3.5%, 37.9%+/-6.0%, 58.3%+/-8.8%, respectively in sensitive HL60 cells, while that was 4.7%+/-0.5%, 3.9%+/-0.6%, 2.9%+/-0.6% , respectively in resistant HL60/DOX cells. The difference of expressing rate on each day was significant, P<0.01. We identified K18 detected by co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrum assay which was the cellular chaperone of PSF. We found that K18 knockdown decreased the PSF expression level which redistributed on cell surface from 48.9%+/-5.4% to 6.2%+/-1.0% in sensitive HL60 cells, and from 9.11%+/-1.2% to 2.21%+/-0.51% in resistant HL60/DOX cells, respectively. CONCLUSION: K18 is the intracellular chaperonin of PSF. The interaction of PSF and K18 mediates its redistribution to cell membrane in sensitive cells. While in resistant cells, PSF failed to relocate at the cell surface and accumulated in cells, which mediated resistance to chemotherapeutics.","['0 (Keratin-18)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",PMC7433459,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For standard-risk patients, we recommend the following: ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (IRd) (preferred), cyclophosphamide lenalidomide and dexamethasone (CRd), daratumumab lenalidomide and dexamethasone (DRd), lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (RVd), or cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (CyBorD). For high-risk patients we recommend carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRd) (preferred) or RVd. Decreasing the dose of dexamethasone to 20 mg and giving bortezomib subcutaneously once a week is recommended. We recommend delaying autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), unless the patient has high-risk disease that is not responding well, or if the patient has plasma cell leukemia (PCL). Testing for COVID-19 should be done before ASCT. If a patient achieves a very good partial response or better, doses and frequency of drug administration can be modified. After 10-12 cycles, lenalidomide maintenance is recommended for standard-risk patients and bortezomib or ixazomib are recommended for high-risk patients. Daratumumab-based regimens are recommended for relapsed patients. Routine ASCT is not recommended for relapse during the epidemic unless the patient has an aggressive relapse or secondary PCL.

Epub 2020 Apr 7.,"INTRODUCTION: Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, it is known that the severe course of the disease occurs mostly among the elderly, whereas it is rare among children and young adults. Comorbidities, in particular, diabetes and hypertension, clearly associated with age, besides obesity and smoke, are strongly associated with the need for intensive treatment and a dismal outcome. A weaker immunity of the elderly has been proposed as a possible explanation of this uneven age distribution. Thus, there is concern that children treated for cancer may allso be at risk for an unfavourable course of infection. Along the same line, anecdotal information from Wuhan, China, mentioned a severe course of COVID-19 in a child treated for leukaemia. AIM AND METHODS: We made a flash survey on COVID-19 incidence and severity among children on anticancer treatment. Respondents were asked by email to fill in a short Web-based survey. RESULTS: We received reports from 25 countries, where approximately 10,000 patients at risk are followed up. At the time of the survey, more than 200 of these children were tested, nine of whom were positive for COVID-19. Eight of the nine cases had asymptomatic to mild disease, and one was just diagnosed with COVID-19. We also discuss preventive measures that are in place or should be taken and treatment options in immunocompromised children with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Thus, even children receiving anticancer chemotherapy may have a mild or asymptomatic course of COVID-19. While we should not underestimate the risk of developing a more severe course of COVID-19 than that observed here, the intensity of preventive measures should not cause delays or obstructions in oncological treatment.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'COVID-19 drug treatment']",PMC7141482,['NOTNLM'],"['*Anticancer chemotherapy', '*COVID-19', '*Children', '*Immunosuppression']",,['Copyright (c) 2020.

ATO-induced apoptotic death in K562 cells was characterized by ROS-mediated mitochondrial depolarization, MCL1 downregulation, p38 MAPK activation, and Akt inactivation. ATO-induced BCR-ABL1 downregulation caused Akt inactivation but not p38 MAPK activation. Akt inactivation increased GSK3beta-mediated MCL1 degradation, while p38 MAPK-mediated NFkappaB activation coordinated with HDAC1 suppressed MCL1 transcription. Inhibition of p38 MAPK activation or overexpression of constitutively active Akt increased MCL1 expression and promoted the survival of ATO-treated cells. Overexpression of MCL1 alleviated mitochondrial depolarization and cell death induced by ATO. The same pathway was found to be involved in ATO-induced death in MEG-01 cells. Remarkably, YM155 synergistically enhanced the cytotoxicity of ATO on K562 and MEG-01 cells through suppression of MCL1 and survivin. Collectively, our data indicate that ATO-induced p38 MAPK- and Akt-mediated MCL1 downregulation triggers apoptosis in K562 and MEG-01 cells, and that p38 MAPK activation is independent of ATO-induced BCR-ABL1 suppression.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Akt-controlled MCL1 degradation', 'Arsenic trioxide', 'Leukemia', 'p38 MAPK-modulated MCL1 transcription']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Two independent reviewers extracted relevant data. A total of 35 hematologic malignancy studies with CD19 CAR-T cell were included (1412 participants). Severe cytokine release syndrome (sCRS) proportion was experienced by 18.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.128-0.259; P = 0.000) of 982 patients with the National Cancer Institute/Lee/common terminology criteria for adverse events grading system. The pooled neurotoxicity proportion was 21.7% (95% CI, 0.167-0.287; P = 0.000) of 747 patients with the same grading system. For all of the 25 clinical trials with the same grading system, subgroup analysis was performed. Based on the different disease type, a pooled prevalence of 35.7% was observed with event rate (ER) of 0.358 (95% CI, 0.289-0.434; P = 0.000) for ALL in 12 clinical trials. For lymphoma, a pooled prevalence of 13% was observed with ER of 0.073 (95% CI, 0.028-0.179; P = 0.000) in eight clinical trials. It was demonstrated that the patients who were older than 18 years of age have the lower sCRS incidence of 16.1% (95% CI, 0.110-0.250; P = 0.000) compared with 28.6% of the remaining population who were younger than 18 years of age (95% CI, 0.117-0.462: P = 0.023) in our analysis. Based on the different co-stimulatory domain, the sCRS of 16.5% was observed with ER of 0.175 (95% CI, 0.090-0.312; P = 0.000) for 4-1BB. The sCRS of 22.2% was observed with ER of 0.193 (95% CI, 0.107-0.322; P = 0.000) for CD28. For both the CD28 and 4-1BB, the sCRS of 17.3% was observed with ER of 0.170 (95% CI, 0.067-0.369; P = 0.003). Sub-analysis sCRS of the impact with cell dose and specific disease indication were also demonstrated. Limitations include heterogeneity of study populations, as well as high risk of bias of included studies. These results are helpful for physicians, patients and the other stakeholders to understand the adverse events and to further promote the improvement of CAR-T cell therapy in the future.","['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*T-cell therapy', '*acute lymphocytic leukemia', '*chimeric antigen receptor', '*cytokine release syndrome', '*lymphoma', '*neurologic toxicity']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy.

We compare the efficacy of acalabrutinib with or without obinutuzumab against chlorambucil with obinutuzumab in patients with treatment-naive chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. METHODS: ELEVATE TN is a global, phase 3, multicentre, open-label study in patients with treatment-naive chronic lymphocytic leukaemia done at 142 academic and community hospitals in 18 countries. Eligible patients had untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and were aged 65 years or older, or older than 18 years and younger than 65 years with creatinine clearance of 30-69 mL/min (calculated by use of the Cockcroft-Gault equation) or Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics score greater than 6. Additional criteria included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 2 or less and adequate haematologic, hepatic, and renal function. Patients with significant cardiovascular disease were excluded, and concomitant treatment with warfarin or equivalent vitamin K antagonists was prohibited. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) centrally via an interactive voice or web response system to receive acalabrutinib and obinutuzumab, acalabrutinib monotherapy, or obinutuzumab and oral chlorambucil. Treatments were administered in 28-day cycles. To reduce infusion-related reactions, acalabrutinib was administered for one cycle before obinutuzumab administration. Oral acalabrutinib was administered (100 mg) twice a day until progressive disease or unacceptable toxic effects occurred. In the acalabrutinib-obinutuzumab group, intravenous obinutuzumab was given on days 1 (100 mg), 2 (900 mg), 8 (1000 mg), and 15 (1000 mg) of cycle 2 and on day 1 (1000 mg) of cycles 3-7. In the obinutuzumab-chlorambucil group, intravenous obinutuzumab was given on days 1 (100 mg), 2 (900 mg), 8 (1000 mg), and 15 (1000 mg) of cycle 1 and on day 1 (1000 mg) of cycles 2-6. Oral chlorambucil was given (0.5 mg/kg) on days 1 and 15 of each cycle, for six cycles. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival between the two combination-therapy groups, assessed by independent review committee. Crossover to acalabrutinib was allowed in patients who progressed on obinutuzumab-chlorambucil. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of treatment. Enrolment for this trial is complete, and the study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02475681. FINDINGS: Between Sept 14, 2015, and Feb 8, 2017, we recruited 675 patients for assessment. 140 patients did not meet eligibility criteria, and 535 patients were randomly assigned to treatment. 179 patients were assigned to receive acalabrutinib-obinutuzumab, 179 patients were assigned to receive acalabrutinib monotherapy, and 177 patients were assigned to receive obinutuzumab-chlorambucil. At median follow-up of 28.3 months (IQR 25.6-33.1), median progression-free survival was longer with acalabrutinib-obinutuzumab and acalabrutinib monotherapy, compared with obinutuzumab-chlorambucil (median not reached with acalabrutinib and obinutuzumab vs 22.6 months with obinutuzumab, hazard ratio [HR] 0.1; 95% CI 0.06-0.17, p<0.0001; and not reached with acalabrutinib monotherapy vs 22.6 months with obinutuzumab, 0.20; 0.13-0.3, p<0.0001). Estimated progression-free survival at 24 months was 93% with acalabrutinib-obinutuzumab (95% CI 87-96%), 87% with acalabrutinib monotherapy (81-92%), and 47% with obinutuzumab-chlorambucil (39-55%). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse event across groups was neutropenia (53 [30%] of 178 patients in the acalabrutinib-obinutuzumab group, 17 [9%] of 179 patients in the acalabrutinib group, and 70 [41%] of 169 patients in the obinutuzumab-chlorambucil group). All-grade infusion reactions were less frequent with acalabrutinib-obinutuzumab (24 [13%] of 178 patients) than obinutuzumab-chlorambucil (67 [40%] of 169 patients). Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 37 (21%) patients given acalabrutinib-obinutuzumab, 25 (14%) patients given acalabrutinib monotherapy, and 14 (8%) patients given obinutuzumab-chlorambucil. Deaths occurred in eight (4%) patients given acalabrutinib-obinutuzumab, 12 (7%) patients given acalabrutinib, and 15 (9%) patients given obinutuzumab-chlorambucil. INTERPRETATION: Acalabrutinib with or without obinutuzumab significantly improved progression-free survival over obinutuzumab-chlorambucil chemoimmunotherapy, providing a chemotherapy-free treatment option with an acceptable side-effect profile that was consistent with previous studies. These data support the use of acalabrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab or alone as a new treatment option for patients with treatment-naive symptomatic chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

Vitamins K2 and K3, but not vitamin K1, reduced viabilities of Jurkat, MOLT-4, and MOLT-4/DNR cells. The influence potency of vitamin K3 was larger than that of vitamin K2 in all of the three cell lines. MOLT-4/DNR cells seemed to be more sensitive toward the effects of vitamins K2 and K3. The cytotoxicity of vitamins K2 and K3 on these leukemia cells seems to be related to apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest. Vitamin K2 and K3 treatment induced cleavage of PARP obviously. Moreover, vitamins K2 and K3 specifically down-regulated the expressions of cyclin A2 in all of the three cell lines. However, the effects of vitamins K2 and K3 on the cell cycle profiling in Jurkat, MOLT-4, and MOLT-4/DNR cells varied with the cell type. Vitamins K2 and K3 also decreased the viability of mitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our observations suggest that vitamins K2 and K3 have bilateral cytotoxic effects on activated human peripheral lymphocytes and the human leukemic T cells.","['11032-49-8 (Vitamin K 2)', '723JX6CXY5 (Vitamin K 3)', '84-80-0 (Vitamin K 1)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*apoptosis', '*cell cycle', '*human T lymphoblastoid leukemia cells', '*peripheral blood mononuclear cells', '*vitamin K']",,['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 15.,"Patients with refractory or relapsed (R/R) B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and highly aggressive B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) have a very dismal prognosis and limited treatment options. The advent of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy constitutes a milestone in current cell and gene therapies, covering the unmet need of treatment of high-risk patients and bringing immunotherapies one step closer toward cancer therapeutics, including hematologic malignancies. CAR T cells targeting CD19 antigen have shown startling remission rates in heavily pretreated B-ALL and B-NHL patients, in whom CAR T cell therapy may sometimes be their last-resort treatment. However, a high proportion of these patients evade immune surveillance by CAR T cells losing their initial deep responses, which leads to disease recurrence as either CD19-positive or CD19-negative relapse. As a result, many investigators have questioned the need for consolidative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) after CAR T cell therapy, once a patient has achieved remission. There remains much controversy regarding whether CAR T cells should be a bridge therapy to allo-HCT or a definitive treatment, owing to the paucity of strong evidence-based data. In this context, here we review the existing data regarding the necessity, safety, and outcomes of allo-HCT performed after autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy in B-ALL and B-NHL patients.","['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*CAR T cells', '*Non-Hodgkin lymphoma', '*Relapse']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2020 Apr 15.,"In eukaryotes, histone H3K4 methylation by the MLL/SET1 family histone methyltransferases is enriched at transcription regulatory elements including gene promoters and enhancers. The level of H3K4 methylation is highly correlated with transcription activation and is one of the most frequently used histone post-translational modifications to predict transcriptional outcome. Recently, it has been shown that rearrangement of the cellular landscape of H3K4 mono-methylation at distal enhancers precedes cell fate transition and is used for identification of novel regulatory elements for development and disease progression. Similarly, broad H3K4 tri-methylation regions have also been used to predict intrinsic tumor suppression properties of regulator regions in a variety of cellular models. Understanding the regulation for how H3K4 methylation is deposited and regulated is of paramount importance. In this review, we will discuss new findings on how the MLL/SET1 family enzymes are regulated on chromatin and their potential functional and regulatory implications.

Epub 2020 Apr 15.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammation is a known risk factor of cancer development, including inflammation-driven leukemogenesis. Evaluation of inflammation-related cytokines in early diagnosis stages is crucial to understand the development of hematologic malignancy. Our aim was to measure three cytokines- neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE) in bone marrow (BM) samples from patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancy and compare these measurements with the control. Additionally, we evaluated whether NGAL was significantly associated with sRAGE, VEGF, and several hematological parameters. METHODS: BM samples were collected from 73 patients, who were classified into myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), plasma cell neoplasm (PCN) and control groups according to the BM smear and pathology review. An immunoassay, a Luminex assay, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to quantitate NGAL, VEGF, and sRAGE, respectively, while all measurements of NGAL, VEGF and sRAGE were performed on BM supernatants. Data on hematological parameters were collected from medical records. Intergroup comparisons were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis H-test and Pearson Chi-Square test. Single and multiple regression analyses were performed to analyze the relationships among the parameters. RESULTS: The independent factors associated with NGAL were neutrophil counts and VEGF. As for both NGAL and VEGF, the MPN (n = 23) group showed the highest level, while the MDS (n = 12) group showed low levels. NGAL levels in the AML (n = 13) and MDS groups were lower than in the control group (n = 14). The MPN group demonstrated higher VEGF levels than the AML and MDS groups. The MDS group showed lower VEGF levels than the PCN (n = 11) group. No statistical difference between the hematologic malignancy and control groups or among the hematologic malignancy groups was observed for sRAGE levels. CONCLUSION: NGAL was related to neutrophil count and VEGF. NGAL and VEGF showed similar intergroup patterns, reflecting that NGAL was associated with VEGF.","['0 (AGER protein, human)', '0 (LCN2 protein, human)', '0 (Lipocalin-2)', '0 (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow', 'Hematologic malignancy', 'NGAL', 'VEGF', 'sRAGE']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with CML aged 18 to 64 years were identified using IBM MarketScan Commercial Database between April 1, 2011 and December 31, 2014. Patients were required to be continuously enrolled 3 months before and 12 months after TKI (imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib) initiation. TKI adherence is estimated using the proportion of days covered (PDC), defined as the percentage of the PDC by the prescription fill during the 12-month study period (adherent patients have PDC >/=80%). Health care cost differences between adherent and nonadherent patients were estimated using generalized linear models. Health care utilization was compared using negative binomial regression models. All models were controlled for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 863 patients, where 355 (41.1%) patients were classified as adherent. Over the study period, nonadherent patients incurred US$10,974 more in medical costs (P<0.001), and US$1663 more in non-TKI pharmacy costs (P<0.01). Adherent patients incurred US$28,184 more in TKI pharmacy costs (P<0.001) that resulted in US$18,305 more in overall total health care costs (P<0.001). Adherent patients, however, were estimated to be less likely to have all-cause hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio, 0.32; P<0.001), or CML-specific hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio, 0.31; P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CML with better adherence experienced fewer hospitalizations, resulting in medical service cost savings. These lower medical costs, however, were more than offset by higher TKI medication costs observed during the first year of TKI therapy.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 May 28.,"MMAE is a potent antimitotic drug used as payload of an antibody-drug conjugate which shows potent activity in preclinical and clinical studies against a range of lymphomas, leukemia and solid tumors. Liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometric method was developed for the quantification of MMAE and its preclinical pharmacokinetics. The method consisted of protein precipitation using acetonitrile (ACN) for sample preparation and liquid chromatography - quadrupole - time-of-flight - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-qTOF-MS/MS) analysis in the positive ion mode. A quadratic regression (weighted 1/concentration(2) ), with an equation y = ax(2) + bx + c, was used to fit calibration curves over the concentration range of 1.01-2,200 ng/mL for MMAE. The qualification run met the acceptance criteria of +/-25% accuracy and precision values for QC samples. Recovery was 42.84%. The dilution integrity was determined for 5-fold dilution and the accuracy and precision ranged within +/-25%. The stability results indicated that MMAE was stable for the following conditions: short-term (4 h), long-term (4 weeks), freeze/thaw (3 cycles) and post-preparative stability (12 h).

This article describes the clinical pharmacokinetic profile of gilteritinib. METHODS: The pharmacokinetic profile of gilteritinib was assessed from five clinical studies. RESULTS: Dose-proportional pharmacokinetics was observed following once-daily gilteritinib administration (dose range 20-450 mg). Median maximum concentration was reached 2-6 h following single and repeat dosing of gilteritinib; mean elimination half-life was 113 h. Elimination was primarily via feces. Exposure to gilteritinib was comparable under fasted and fed conditions. Gilteritinib is primarily metabolized via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4; coadministration of gilteritinib with itraconazole (a strong P-glycoprotein inhibitor and CYP3A4 inhibitor) or rifampicin (a strong P-glycoprotein inducer and CYP3A inducer) significantly affected the gilteritinib pharmacokinetic profile. No clinically relevant interactions were observed when gilteritinib was coadministered with midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate) or cephalexin (a multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 substrate). Unbound gilteritinib exposure was similar between subjects with hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function. CONCLUSIONS: Gilteritinib exhibits a dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile in healthy subjects and in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Gilteritinib exposure is not significantly affected by food. Moderate-to-strong CYP3A inhibitors demonstrated a significant effect on gilteritinib exposure. Coadministration of gilteritinib with CYP3A4 or multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 substrates did not impact substrate concentrations. Unbound gilteritinib was comparable between subjects with hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function; dose adjustment is not warranted for patients with hepatic impairment.

Here we investigated Mcl-1 (an anti-apoptotic protein) in experimental allergic airway inflammation using transgenic overexpressing human Mcl-1 mice (hMcl-1) and reducing Mcl-1 by a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. Overexpression of Mcl-1 exacerbated allergic airway inflammation, with increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cellularity, eosinophil numbers and total protein, and an increase in airway mucus production. Eosinophil apoptosis was suppressed by Mcl-1 overexpression, with this resistance to apoptosis attenuated by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition which also rescued Mcl-1-exacerbated allergic airway inflammation.

Many of the enzymes involved in their conjugation are dysregulated in cancers and involved in cancer cell response to therapies. We describe here the identification of biomarkers of the activity of these enzymes and their use to predict acute myeloid leukemias (AML) response to standard chemotherapy (daunorubicin-DNR and cytarabine-Ara-C). We compared the ability of extracts from chemosensitive and chemoresistant AML cells to conjugate ubiquitin or SUMO-1 on 9,000 proteins spotted on protein arrays. We identified 122 proteins whose conjugation by these posttranslational modifiers marks AML resistance to DNR and/or Ara-C. Based on this signature, we defined a statistical score predicting AML patient response to standard chemotherapy. We finally developed a miniaturized assay allowing for easy assessment of modification levels of the selected biomarkers and validated it in patient cell extracts. Thus, our work identifies a new type of ubiquitin-based biomarkers that could be used to predict cancer patient response to treatments.","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",PMC7167290,,,,['(c) 2020 Gatel et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Mar 20.,"BACKGROUND: Abnormalities of chromosome 3 in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), that is, inversion 3 (inv[3]), translocation 3q (t[3q]), or deletion 3q (del[3q]), are defined as poor-risk karyotypes in the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R). The objective of this study was to further define the outcomes of patients with MDS with chromosome 3 abnormalities and address the impact of hypomethylating agent (HMA) therapy on this patient subset. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Through the MDS Clinical Research Consortium, we identified 411 patients with chromosome 3 abnormalities and MDS or oligoblastic acute myeloid leukemia (20%-30% blasts). RESULTS: Specific chromosome 3 aberrations and cytogenetic complexity were predictive of survival; patients with t(3q) and isolated chromosome 3 had improved overall survival (OS), albeit still poor, whereas patients with complex cytogenetics, including those with 3p abnormalities, had inferior OS. Overall response rates to HMAs among this patient population were similar to those of patients with nonchromosome 3-MDS (52%, with a 25% complete remission rate), although with higher response rates in decitabine-treated patients (69% vs. 45%, P = .008). HMA therapy improved the OS of patients with higher-risk MDS compared with intensive chemotherapy (median OS of 15.5 vs. 8.2 months; P = .017). This improvement remained significant in multivariate analyses (hazard ratio, 0.60; P = .018); however, there were no chromosome 3 aberrations among this subgroup predictive of improved response rates to or survival from HMAs. CONCLUSION: Patients with MDS with chromosome 3 abnormalities represent a cytogenetic cohort with poor OS, and there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Chromosome 3 aberrations', '*Cytogenetics', '*Inversion 3', '*Translocation 3']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The patient less than 18-months-old has special clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic features that all paediatricians are interested in determining, with the aim of achieving greater survival and a lower morbidity throughout the lives of their patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, descriptive study was carried out using the clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic variables in patients less than 18-months-old diagnosed with an oncological-haematological that received chemotherapy in a Paediatric Oncology Unit between January 2007 and August 2019. RESULTS: A total of 72 patients were diagnosed with 76 cancers that required chemotherapy. The most common cancer was leukaemia (21 patients), followed by neuroblastoma (15 patients), and tumours of the central nervous system (12 patients). The presentation of ""life-threatening symptoms"" was seen in 20.8% of cases, particularly in tumours of neural origin (13/15). Although 18% of patients showed no symptoms on diagnosis, just over half (51%) of the diagnoses took place in the ""advanced stages"". Particularly in the case of solid tumours in which 23.6% were diagnosed with metastases. A significant percentage of genetic alterations implicated in the aetiopathogenesis of the different cancers were found. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer in the first stages of life is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge due to its phenotypical diversity, its genetic load, and its therapeutic difficulties.

Epub 2020 Apr 15.,"BACKGROUND: Qualitative and quantitative defects in natural killer (NK) cells have been noted in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), providing rationale for infusion of donor-derived NK cells. We previously showed that decitabine enhances expression of NKG2D ligands in AML with additive cytotoxicity when NK cells and Fc (fragment crystallizable region)-engineered CD33 monoclonal antibody (CD33mAb) was used. We conducted a phase 1 study evaluating decitabine and haploidentical NK cells in relapsed AML. Using patient samples from this study, we evaluated whether ex vivo donor-derived expanded NK cells with or without CD33mAb was effective in decitabine-treated AML. METHODS: Bone marrow aspirates were collected from patients at pre- and post-NK cell infusion. NK cells from healthy donors were expanded for 14 days using irradiated K562 feeder cells displaying membrane-bound IL-21 (mbIL-21). Patient samples were used to test in vitro activity of mbIL-21 NK cells +/- CD33m Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and AML patient derived xenograft (PDX) mice were developed to test in vivo activity. RESULTS: Upon incubation with primary AML blasts, mbIL-21 NK cells showed variable donor-dependent intra-cellular interferon-gamma production, which increased with CD33mAb-coated AML. ADCC assays revealed mbIL-21 NK cells effectively lysed primary AML blasts with higher activity on CD33mAb-coated AML. Importantly, CD33mAb-dependent enhanced cytotoxicity by mbIL-21 NK cells was maintained in AML cells from patients even 24 days post-decitabine treatment. In vivo infusion of mbIL-21 NK cells in AML PDX mice, treated with CD33mAb, reduced the tumor burden. DISCUSSION: These data show the therapeutic utility of mbIL-21 NK cells that can be further potentiated by addition of CD33mAb in AML.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'MKM3CA6LT1 (interleukin-21)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",PMC8176194,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD33 antibody', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity', '*interleukin-21', '*membrane-bound interleukin-21 natural killer cells', '*natural killer cellular therapy']","['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Copyright (c) 2020.

Spatially varying environmental factors such as traffic-related air pollution, background radiation and agricultural pesticides might contribute to the development of childhood cancer. This study is the first investigation of the spatial disease mapping of childhood cancers using exact geocodes of place of residence. METHODS: We included 5947 children diagnosed with cancer in Switzerland during 1985-2015 at 0-15 years of age from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. We modelled cancer risk using log-Gaussian Cox processes and indirect standardisation to adjust for age and year of diagnosis. We examined whether the spatial variation of risk can be explained by modelled ambient air concentration of NO2, modelled exposure to background ionising radiation, area-based socio-economic position (SEP), linguistic region, duration in years of general cancer registration in the canton or degree of urbanisation. RESULTS: For all childhood cancers combined, the posterior median relative risk (RR), compared to the national level, varied by location from 0.83 to 1.13 (min to max). Corresponding ranges were 0.96 to 1.09 for leukaemia, 0.90 to 1.13 for lymphoma, and 0.82 to 1.23 for central nervous system (CNS) tumours. The covariates considered explained 72% of the observed spatial variation for all cancers, 81% for leukaemia, 82% for lymphoma and 64% for CNS tumours. There was weak evidence of an association of CNS tumour incidence with modelled exposure to background ionising radiation (RR per SD difference 1.17; 0.98-1.40) and with SEP (1.6; 1.00-1.13). CONCLUSION: Of the investigated diagnostic groups, childhood CNS tumours showed the largest spatial variation. The selected covariates only partially explained the observed variation of CNS tumours suggesting that other environmental factors also play a role.",,PMC7165384,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bayesian spatial modelling', '*Cancer clusters', '*Central nervous system cancer', '*Childhood cancer', '*Point processes']",,,,,,,"['Swiss Paediatric Oncology Group', 'Swiss National Cohort Study Group']","['Ammann RA', 'Scheinemann K', 'Ansari M', 'Popovic MB', 'Brazzola P', 'Greiner J', 'Grotzer M', 'Hengartner H', 'Kuehne T', 'Rossler J', 'Niggli F', 'Schilling F', 'von der Weid N', 'Egger M', 'Spoerri A', 'Zwahlen M', 'Puhan M', 'Bopp M', 'Roosli M', 'Bochud M', 'Oris M']","['Ammann, R A', 'Scheinemann, K', 'Ansari, M', 'Popovic, M Beck', 'Brazzola, P', 'Greiner, J', 'Grotzer, M', 'Hengartner, H', 'Kuehne, T', 'Rossler, J', 'Niggli, F', 'Schilling, F', 'von der Weid, N', 'Egger, Matthias', 'Spoerri, Adrian', 'Zwahlen, Marcel', 'Puhan, Milo', 'Bopp, Matthias', 'Roosli, Martin', 'Bochud, Murielle', 'Oris, Michel']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 17.,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of the BCR-ABL fusion protein have dramatically changed the mortality of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) but they carry a risk of serious vascular morbidity. While TKIs do not cure CML, daily oral administration of a TKI can control CML and TKIs are chronic medications. Interestingly, vascular complications can occur at any time a patient is on a TKI. Therefore, it is imperative that all care team members and patients are aware of and watching for possible vascular complications. In the following review, a case of arterial thrombosis secondary to the TKI ponatinib is presented as well as a discussion of thrombotic and vascular adverse events reported with TKIs. TKIs are metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system and important drug interactions to consider are reviewed. Finally, we present a multidisciplinary approach to the management of patients with CML on TKIs.","['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*arterial thrombosis', '*cardiovascular disease', '*peripheral artery disease (PAD)', '*risk factors', '*stroke', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors', '*venous thromboembolism (VTE)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mucormycosis is the third leading cause of invasive fungal infections after Aspergillus and Candida infections. The first clinical symptoms are usually non-specific, which can lead to a late diagnosis and delayed therapy. PURPOSE: The objective of this report is to summarize data in the literature about mucormycosis and to present a case report of a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, who developed this infection at our center. Risk factors for the development of mucormycosis, clinical symptoms, radiology, laboratory results, and outcome were retrospectively evaluated. CASE: We describe a 6-years-old female patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. During the induction phase of therapy, the patient developed febrile neutropenia and did not respond to therapy with a combination of antibiotics and supportive treatment. Pansinusitis and orbitocellulitis developed. Examination of the biological material revealed that the etiological agent was a Rhizopus sp. The patient was treated with a combination of antimycotic drugs, but the infection disseminated to the central nervous system. She underwent radical surgical resection of the affected tissue. At this time, she is still under treatment with antimycotic and oncology agents, but is in remission of the main diagnosis and in good clinical condition. CONCLUSION: Mucormycosis is an invasive fungal infection with high morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and initiation of effective therapy using a combination of amphotericin B administration and surgery are necessary to obtain a favorable outcome. The authors declare they have no potential conflicts of interest concerning drugs, products, or services used in the study.

Epub 2020 Apr 17.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in adults. In the past years, new therapeutic approaches (e.g., ibrutinib or venetoclax) have been established and greatly improved treatment of CLL. However, complete control or cure of the disease have not been reached so far. Thus, reliable prognostic markers are an imperative for treatment decisions. Recent studies have revealed an essential role for B cell receptor (BCR) signaling in the pathogenesis, prognosis, and therapy of CLL. A heterogeneous response to receptor stimulation with anti-IgM treatment culminating in different calcium flux capabilities has been demonstrated by several authors. However, the methods employed have not reached clinical application. Here, we report on a flow cytometry-based assay to evaluate calcium flux capabilities in CLL and demonstrate that compromised BCR signaling with diminished calcium flux is associated with a significantly better clinical outcome and progression free survival. In summary, our data strongly support the role of compromised BCR signaling as an important prognostic marker in CLL and establish a novel diagnostic tool for its assessment in clinical settings.","['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR signaling', '*CLL', '*calcium flux', '*flow cytometry', '*prognosis']",,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Epub 2020 May 1.,"Previous observations have reported controversial conclusions regarding cell dose and survival endpoints after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We conducted a retrospective analysis on 414 adult patients (median age 54 years, range, 18-74 years) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first and second complete remission. They received a T-cell replete allogeneic HSCT from haploidentical donors, using peripheral blood stem cells, between 2006-2018. Median number of infused CD34+ was 6.58 x 10(6) /kg (range, 2.2-31.2 x 10(6) /kg). Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was post-transplant cyclophosphamide in 293 patients and anti-lymphocyte serum in 121 patients. Conditioning was myeloablative in 179 patients and reduced-intensity in 235 patients. After a median follow-up of 23.3 months (range, 12.1-41.8 months), 2-year overall survival (OS) was 64.5% (95% CI 59.3%-69.7%) with leukemia-free survival (LFS) of 57.3% (95% CI 51.8%-62.7%) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) of 23.3% (95% CI 19%-27.7%). Grades III-IV acute GVHD day+100 incidence was 14.6% while extensive chronic GVHD was 14.4% at 2-years. Thirteen (3.2%) patients experienced graft failure. We found the optimal CD34+/kg threshold defining high (n = 334) vs low cell dose (n = 80) at 4.96 x 10(6) . Recipients of >4.96 x 10(6) /kg CD34+ cells experienced less NRM (Hazard ratio [HR] 0.48; 95% CI 0.30-0.76) and prolonged LFS (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.43-0.91) and OS (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.40-0.88) compared to those in the lower cell dose cohort. Larger cohort studies are needed to confirm these findings.","['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,,,,"['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has long been accepted that information is epigenetically inherited in plants. Although many questions regarding the underlying mechanisms remain to be answered, it is now evident that epigenetic mechanisms are also responsible for the transmission of phenotypes in animals.

Epub 2020 Mar 21.,"Clinical management and risk stratification of B-lymphoblastic leukemia/ lymphoma (B-ALL/LBL) depend largely on identification of chromosomal abnormalities obtained using conventional cytogenetics and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) testing. In the last few decades, testing algorithms have been implemented to support an optimal risk-oriented therapy, leading to a large improvement in overall survival. In addition, large scale genomic studies have identified multiple aberrations of prognostic significance that are not routinely tested by existing modalities. However, as chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are increasingly used in clinical management of hematologic malignancies, these abnormalities may be more readily detected. In this article, we have compiled a comprehensive, evidence-based review of the current B-ALL literature, focusing on known and published subtypes described to date. More specifically, we describe the role of various testing modalities in the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic relevance. In addition, we propose a testing algorithm aimed at assisting laboratories in the most effective detection of the underlying genomic abnormalities.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-ALL', '*Chromosomal microarray Analysis', '*Diagnosis', '*FISH', '*NGS', '*Prognosis']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2020 Apr 15.,"In mammalian cells, the SET1/MLL complexes are the main writers of the H3K4 methyl mark that is associated with active gene expression. The activities of these complexes are critically dependent on the association of the catalytic subunit with their shared core subunits, WDR5, RBBP5, ASH2L, and DPY30, collectively referred as WRAD. In addition, some of these core subunits can bind to proteins other than the SET1/MLL complex components. This review starts with discussion of the molecular activities of these core subunits, with an emphasis on DPY30 in organizing the assembly of the SET1/MLL complexes with other associated factors. This review then focuses on the roles of the core subunits in stem cells and development, as well as in diseased cell states, mainly cancer, and ends with discussion on dissecting the responsible activities of the core subunits and how we may target them for potential disease treatment.

In this study, we investigated whether a strain of avian leukosis virus (ALV), associated with avian osteopetrosis and mesenchymal neoplasms, is able to induce fowl glioma. We encountered avian osteopetrosis and mesenchymal neoplasms, including myxosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma, in Japanese native chickens used for both egg-laying and meat production. These birds were also affected by non-suppurative encephalitis and glioma in their brains. Four ALV strains (GifN_001, GifN_002, GifN_004, GifN_005) were isolated, and a phylogenic analysis of envSU showed that these isolates were classified into different clusters from FGVp and the variants previously reported. Whereas the envSU shared a high identity (94.7%) with that of Rous sarcoma virus (strain Schmidt-Ruppin B) (RSV-SRB), the identity between envTM of GifN_001 and that of FGVp was high (94.5%), indicating that GifN_strains may emerge by recombination between FGVp and other exogenous ALVs. Specific-pathogen-free chickens inoculated in ovo with GifN_001 revealed fowl glioma and cerebellar hypoplasia. These results suggest that the newly isolated strains have acquired neuropathogenicity to chickens.",['Cerebellar Hypoplasia'],,['NOTNLM'],"['Avian leukosis virus', 'avian osteopetrosis', 'experimental infection', 'glioma', 'myxosarcoma', 'rhabdomyosarcoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We, therefore, performed an updated meta-analysis in multi-ethnic groups using specialized software for genome-wide association studies meta-analysis. Materials & methods: PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar were searched up to October 2018. An odds ratio (OR) with the corresponding 95% CI was used to evaluate the strength in the association. Results: This meta-analysis included 16 studies with 2337 cases and 9494 controls. In the overall population, significant relationship between Arg72Pro polymorphism of TP53 and leukemia susceptibility was found in two genetic models (recessive model: OR = 1.276, 95% CI = 1.102-1.476; p = 0.01; overdominant model: OR = 0.891, 95% CI = 0.802-0.988; p = 0.03). In stratified studies with ethnicity, a significant association was found in five ethnic groups, including Chinese, Americans, Africans, Japanese and Indians. Conclusion: We demonstrated that an association exist between leukemia risk and TP53 gene codon Arg72Pro polymorphism in the recessive and overdominant genetic models. Also, our findings show that the TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism may influence leukemia development in different populations.",['0 (Codon)'],,['NOTNLM'],"['TP53', 'genes', 'leukemia', 'meta-analysis', 'polymorphism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, clinical adoption in Singapore remains low despite commercial availability of these diagnostics. This expert opinion review examines the key challenges to the clinical adoption of NGS-based diagnostics in Singapore, provides recommendations on impactful initiatives to improve adoption, and also offers practical guidance on specific cancer types in which NGS-based diagnostics are appropriate for use in Singapore. Limited patient affordability is one major challenge to clinical adoption of NGS-based diagnostics, which could be improved by enabling patient access to more funds for specific cancer types with clear benefits. Expert opinion based on current evidence and clinical experience supports the upfront use of hotspot panels in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), metastatic colorectal cancer, advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia. Comprehensive genomic profiling could be considered for upfront use in select patients with NSCLC and ovarian cancer, or in refractory patients with the four cancer types.

Numeral trials are underway to understand the optimal CAR-T cell design and dose to maximize efficacy and mitigate toxicity. Currently two CAR-T cell therapy products, axicabtagene ciloleucel and tisagenlecleucel, are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, which have shown excellent responses in otherwise poor prognostic lymphomas and leukemias. The favorable outcomes achieved of this therapy were noted to be durable during long-term follow-up. Understanding the challenges associated with manufacturing and the reasons for T cell failure including poor T cell expansion, persistence, and tumor resistance are critical for its wide-scale application in order to attain the full potential of this novel therapy. Here we review the salient features of the different CAR-T products and discuss the pivotal trials that led to its approval.","['0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Axicabtagene ciloleucel', 'CAR T-cell', 'Cytokine-release syndrome', 'Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', 'Follicular lymphoma', 'Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome', 'Immunotherapy', 'Lisocabtagene maraleucel', 'Siltuximab', 'Tisagenlecleucel', 'Tocilizumab']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A mouse model recently suggested that p53 regulates telomere metabolism, but the clinical relevance of this finding remained uncertain. Here, a germline missense mutation of MDM4, a negative regulator of p53, was found in a family with features suggestive of dyskeratosis congenita, e.g., bone marrow hypocellularity, short telomeres, tongue squamous cell carcinoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. Using a mouse model, we show that this mutation (p.T454M) leads to increased p53 activity, decreased telomere length, and bone marrow failure. Variations in p53 activity markedly altered the phenotype of Mdm4 mutant mice, suggesting an explanation for the variable expressivity of disease symptoms in the family. Our data indicate that a germline activation of the p53 pathway may cause telomere dysfunction and point to polymorphisms affecting this pathway as potential genetic modifiers of telomere biology and bone marrow function.","['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MDM4 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",PMC7148086,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

Methods: Our method based on utilizing the most recent flow cytometeric techniques and instruments in measuring mNPM. Attributed to their availability and technical feasibility, we used human leukemia cell lines to validate our method. Results: The main findings were differential expression of wild-type NPM (wtNPM) within the same sample. Furthermore flow cytometry (FCM) was a simple straightforward tool for quantitative assay of mNPM. Conclusions: In this work we developed an innovative technique that could enable quantitative assay of mNPM, and ease its use as a biomarker in cytogenetic and molecular prognostication of primary AML.

Despite treatment advances, post-treatment quality of life remains highly affected. Studies addressing the molecular mechanisms of these diseases are critical for the development of effective, rapid and selective therapies, since few therapeutic strategies succeed in being effective without triggering high-grade toxicities or debilitating late effects. Our aim of this study was to verify changes in the expression of genes involved in the malignant phenotype of hematological malignancies, by treating human cell lines in vitro with classic chemotherapeutic agents and the demethylating agent, decitabine. Methods: KASUMI-1 and K-562 human myeloid leukemia cell lines were plated at a density of 3 x 10(4) cells/well and treated with increasing concentrations of different chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in the clinical setting. After 24 and 48 h of treatment, cell viability was tested, and RNA was extracted. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to evaluate the gene expression of IDH2, TET2 and KDM2B. Results: A modulation in gene expression was observed before and after treatment with classic chemotherapeutic agents. It was possible to demonstrate a difference in gene expression when cells were treated with chemotherapeutic agents or decitabine alone when compared to chemotherapeutic agents in association with decitabine. Conclusions: The genes tested, and the modulation of their expression during in vitro treatments suggest that IDH2, TET2, and KDM2B should be further investigated as potential biomarkers for ongoing treatment response and follow-up for patients diagnosed with hematological malignancies of the myeloid lineage.",,PMC7153660,['NOTNLM'],"['Chemotherapy', 'Decitabine', 'Gene expression biomarkers', 'Myeloid leukemia']",,"['Copyright 2019, Alves et al.']",,"['The authors hereby declare that there is no conflict of interest pertaining to', 'the work described here.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Opportunistic infections in CLL happen predominantly in the context of immunosuppressive therapy and/or relapsed/refractory disease. Herpes simplex viral (HSV) lymphadenitis is a rare phenomenon in treatment-naive CLL patients with only six cases reported in the English-language literature. Its diagnosis is challenging; its management and the outcome of the subsequent treatment for CLL are not well documented. We report three cases of rapidly progressive lymphadenopathy occurring in the context of previously untreated CLL, clinically and radiologically mimicking Richter's transformation, but histologically confirmed as necrotic HSV lymphadenitis. We describe the presentation, diagnosis and management of all three cases, including for the first time the positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) appearance of this condition, as well as how we later on delivered CLL-directed immunochemotherapy safely and successfully without recrudescence of HSV-related disease. Our cases underscore the importance of obtaining biopsy in all cases of rapidly progressive or disconcordant lymphadenopathy in CLL patients, or in those with highly (18)FDG-avid adenopathy on PET-CT.",,PMC7153685,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'HSV', 'Herpes simplex', 'Lymphadenitis', 'Lymphadenopathy', 'Lymphoma', 'Lymphoproliferative diseases', 'Small lymphocytic leukemia']",,"['Copyright 2019, Hodgson et al.']",,['None to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Jun 30.,"In 2017, 20,110 people in the United States were diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Of these patients, 5-15% will ultimately undergo Richter's syndrome (RS), a transformation to a more aggressive lymphoma, most commonly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) type. Particularly when the transformation is clonally related, prognosis is poor in these individuals with a median survival of only 5 - 14 months. This is an area of unmet need, and as such, the benefits of novel approaches with targeted therapies should be explored. Our patient is a 70-year-old female who was diagnosed with CLL in 2010. In 2016, she presented to her general practitioner with new B symptoms and leukocytosis. Cytogenetics on peripheral blood was notable for known trisomy 12 (52.8% of cells) and new 17p deletion (93.4% of cells). She received five cycles of ofatumumab with complete resolution of systemic symptoms but mixed response on interim computed tomography (CT) scan with ensuing rise in her white blood cell (WBC) and lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH). A positron emission tomography (PET) scan had disproportionate uptake in the porta hepatis lymph nodes and subsequent lymph node biopsy confirmed transformation. She was started on R-CHOP chemotherapy but tolerated it very poorly. She was transitioned to venetoclax monotherapy in April 2017 and achieved a partial response by CT and bone marrow biopsy. This has been maintained over the last 12 months allowing the patient to travel and maintain a high quality of life. While the pathogenesis to RS is poorly understood, there have been several studies to identify tumor genetic changes predisposing to transformation. Of the proposed factors, a review of the literature consistently suggests p53 tumor suppressor gene mutation and/or 17p deletion to be associated with RS. Venetoclax is a selective BCL-2 inhibitor that is now approved for CLL patients with 17p deletion. This case serves as an example encouraging the use and study of novel agents such as venetoclax alone or in combination with traditional regimens or other novel agents to mitigate the poor prognosis of 17p deletion associated RS. Further research, however, is required to clarify the pathogenesis of RS and identify optimal treatment strategies.",,PMC7153679,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Richter transformation', 'Venetoclax']",,"['Copyright 2019, Kollipara et al.']",,"['Parmeswaran Venugopal is a consultant for Bayer and AbbVie pharmaceuticals.

We aim to evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib-based regimens in CLL. Seven databases were searched in accordance with PRISMA statement guidelines using the following keywords: chronic lymphocytic leukemia, CLL, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib, and PCI-32765. Data from only prospective clinical trials was included. In a phase 3 trial (n = 136), the overall response rate (ORR) with ibrutinib was 92% whereas 18% patients had a complete response (CR). Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) at 2 years were 89% and 95% respectively. Phase 3 trial (n = 195) with single agent ibrutinib showed ORR of 63%. PFS at 6 months and OS at 12 months were 88% and 90% respectively. In a phase 2 trial of relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) or high risk treatment naive (TN) patients, combination of ibrutinib and rituximab (n = 104) achieved an ORR of 100% (CR 28%) as compared to ORR 98% (CR 21%) with ibrutinib monotherapy (n = 102) with no significant difference in PFS. Combination of ibrutinib and ublituximab (n = 64) had an ORR of 78% (CR 7%) in a phase 3 study. In del17p negative R/R patients, combination of bendamustine/rituximab (BR) and ibrutinib (n = 289) achieved an ORR of 83% (CR/CRi 10%) and the 18 month PFS was 79%. In a phase 2 trial treated with ibrutinib (n = 145), patients with del17p R/R disease achieved an ORR of 64% and the 24 month PFS and OS was 63% and 75% respectively. In TN del17p patients (n = 35), ORR was 97% (CR-0) and the 24 month PFS and OS were 82% and 84% respectively with single agent ibrutinib. Ibrutinib is the treatment of choice for patients with del17p mutation and has good efficacy in RR/TN patients without del17p mutation.

Its clinical picture imitates a variety of syndromes and diseases due to its pathophysiology. Its diagnosis is relatively simple due to the prominence of NK malignant cells in peripheral blood and its clinical aggressiveness. In certain circumstances though, the presence of blast NK cells and the natural course of the disease can be so modified by the treatment of one of the imitated diseases, especially when using steroids, that it becomes very difficult to diagnose early in its course. We present a case of a 16-year-old Mexican male who initiated symptoms imitating dengue to severe dengue for which he received steroids, apparently inducing a partial remission; he was then diagnosed as having community acquired pneumonia, then sepsis, septic shock w/disseminated intravascular coagulation, primary hemophagocytic syndrome, severe hepatitis, lupus and finally hyper IgE. It was not until 1 day before dying of hemorrhagic shock, a month after initiating symptoms, when the (re)emergence of blast NK cells in peripheral blood allowed the correct diagnosis to be made. Knowledge of ANKL pathophysiology may raise awareness of this multifaceted malignancy and may open up possibilities for its therapy.

Epub 2018 Sep 1.,"Background: Although T-cell cytokine's role in the long-term control of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is well established, previous studies showed contradicting results regarding imatinib (IM) effect on the endogenous T-cell function by IM. The purpose of this study was to determine the relation between the endogenous T-cell function prior to therapy and the degree of response to IM therapy in CP CML. In addition, modulation of the endogenous T-cell function during IM therapy was studied. Methods: We evaluated Th1 (gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)), Th2 (interleukin (IL-4)) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha cytokine synthesis by activated T-cell subsets in 20 patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase (CP CML) using flow cytometry before and during IM therapy compared to patients with IM resistance (IM Res) and healthy donors. Results: Patients with optimal response (CML OR) to IM demonstrated a lower pre-treatment Th1 cytokine compared to that of healthy donors, and a higher percentage of Th2 and TNF-alpha producing T cells compared to that of healthy donors, non-optimal responders (CML nOR) and those with IM Res. A shift from Th2 profile to Th1 profile and initial decline of TNF-alpha producing T cells was detected early during therapy in optimal responders which was coinciding with complete hematological remission with a significant increase in the percentages of CD4+ve/IFN-gamma+ve cells (P = 0.01) and a significant drop of in CD8+ve/IL-4+ve T cells (P = 0.04). Conclusion: We believe that pre-treatment levels of IL-4 and/or TNF-alpha may have a role in identifying CP CML patients who may respond to IM therapy; however, further investigation is needed.",,PMC7155834,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'Imatinib', 'Optimal versus non-optimal responder', 'T-cell subsets', 'Th1 cytokines', 'Th2 cytokine']",,"['Copyright 2018, Hassan et al.']",,['All authors have no conflict of interest to report.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding molecular basis of AML leukemogenesis could lead to the emergence of effective targeted therapies for AML. AML bearing nucleophosmin (NPM) gene mutation has distinct features. This study was conducted to investigate the role of mutated (m) NPM in pathogenesis of de novo AML through studying its contribution in proliferation of AML cell line cells. Methods: Two types of human leukemia cell lines were used. One of them was a model for AMLs with mNPM and the other for AMLs with wild type (wt) NPM. Assessment of the proliferative role of mNPM in AML was carried out using cell culture and viability studies. The obtained results were reaffirmed by immunocytochemical and immunoblotting techniques. Results: Analysis of results was done with the appropriate computer software. It showed higher proliferative potential of cells with mNPM compared to those bearing wtNPM only. Furthermore, the immunocytochemical studies demonstrated subcellular localization of NPM isoforms during various phases of mitosis. Mitosis was associated with cytoplasmic translocation of wtNPM in certain phases, while localization of mNPM remained unchanged throughout the cell cycle. Results of immunoblotting showed little or no change in protein expression of either NPM moieties during mitosis. Conclusions: The current study demonstrated important contribution of NPM gene mutation in enhancing proliferation of AML cell lines. These results confirmed the role of mNPM in AML leukemogenesis, and highlighted the importance of targeting mNPM in new evolving AML therapies.",,PMC7155854,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Leukemogenesis', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Proliferation']",,"['Copyright 2018, Khaled et al.']",,['There was no conflict of interest associated with this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the patient developed acute sudden onset paraplegia, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of spine showed acute cord compression which necessitated emergency radiotherapy after which chemotherapy was started on hyper-CVAD (hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone) protocol. MRI showed dramatic resolution of the mass. Very few cases of B-ALL with DH rearrangement with true precursor B-cell phenotype (positivity for TdT with negativity for surface light chain) have been reported. Many of these had frequent central nervous system (CNS) involvement, with complex karyotypes, highly aggressive course, with short survival of less than 1 year. This case however showed very good response to treatment. In contrary to DHL, de novo B-ALL with double-hit rearrangements is more prevalent in pediatrics and young adults. Although most of reported cases represent transformation of follicular lymphoma, our patient's young age, acute onset and absent lymphadenopathies all support de novo ALL.",,PMC7155824,['NOTNLM'],"['Acquired FXIII deficiency', 'BCL-2', 'Double hit B-ALL', 'MYC']",,"['Copyright 2017, Soliman et al.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Jul 20.,"Transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) is a rare complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with variable presentations. TA-TMA has often been described as a diagnosis of exclusion but a renal biopsy is rarely pursued to confirm the diagnosis, an essential step for our patient with renally limited TMA. We report a case report from the onconephrology clinic and review the literature associated with TA-TMA as it relates to diagnosis and treatment. A 45-year-old woman with acute myeloid leukemia and stage 3 chronic kidney disease underwent a matched unrelated donor allogenic HSCT. Postoperatively, she developed gastrointestinal graft versus host disease (GvHD) and was treated with tacrolimus, sirolimus, budesonide, and beclomethasone. Following discharge, she developed uncontrolled hypertension and required losartan, amlodipine, carvedilol, clonidine patch, and hydralazine as needed. On day 180 post-transplant, she developed lower extremity edema and acute kidney injury (AKI) with creatinine increasing to 2 mg/dL. On day 480 post-transplant, she developed worsening thrombocytopenia, anemia, new hematuria, left flank pain, and worsening renal function with creatinine peaking to 6 mg/dL. Peripheral smear revealed no schistocytes, lactate dehydrogenase of 265 mg/dL, and urinalysis with 100 mg/dL protein. ADAMTS 13 activity was normal (92%) and no inhibitor was detected. She became anuric and was started on hemodialysis. Renal biopsy revealed glomerular changes consistent with TA-TMA. During HSCT, systemic vascular endothelial injury triggers microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, platelet consumption, injury of glomerular endothelial cells and fibrin occluded renal capillaries. Thus, TA-TMA should be considered in HSCT patients with elevated LDH, proteinuria, hypertension, and AKI. However, a diagnosis is difficult to confirm without a renal biopsy. Treatment involves discontinuing potentially toxic agents such as calcineurin inhibitors and sirolimus, prescribing adequate antimicrobial treatment, and using renal replacement therapy if needed. A renal biopsy early in the course of disease not only confirms the diagnosis, but may limit the extent of disease.",,PMC7155822,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow transplant', 'Interstitial nephritis', 'Renal biopsy', 'Thrombotic microangiopathy']",,"['Copyright 2017, Mirza et al.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Mar 21.,"Background: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies target red blood cells leading to marked decrease in their lifespan. The classification of AIHA is based on the immunochemical properties of the RBC autoantibody. Warm antibody AIHA (wAIHA) accounts for 75-80% of all adult AIHA cases. The treatment of wAIHA is mainly corticosteroids. Our retrospective study aimed to study the clinical profile and management of wAIHA. Methods: Data of 75 patients admitted with wAIHA or presented to outpatient department (previous medical records) with wAIHA between January 2003 and January 2016 were analyzed. Results: In our study, females constituted 12 and 26 patients of primary and secondary wAIHA, while males constituted 17 and 20 patients of primary and secondary wAIHA, respectively. Mean hemoglobin level at AIHA onset was found to be 7.1 +/- 1.7 g/dL in primary wAIHA group and 6.3 +/- 1.2 g/dL in secondary wAIHA group, which is statistically significant. Splenectomy was used as mode of treatment in one (3.4%) patient of primary wAIHA group and 15 (32.60%) patients of secondary wAIHA group, which is statistically significant. Mean age of wAIHA onset was 69.7 +/- 21.5 years in wAIHA group secondary to lymphoma and 54.3 +/- 25.7 years in other wAIHA group, which is statistically significant. Conclusion: The most common causes of secondary wAIHA are B-cell lymphoma, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), common variable immune deficiency, renal cell carcinoma and secondary to drug usage (alpha methyldopa and carbamazepine), respectively. Reducing the cumulative dose of corticosteroids with second line treatment whenever possible and therefore reducing the risk of sepsis, specifically in older patients with comorbidities will reduce morbidity and mortality.",,PMC7155818,['NOTNLM'],"['Complete response', 'Corticosteroids', 'Direct antiglobulin test', 'Partial response', 'Prednisone', 'Rituximab', 'Warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia']",,"['Copyright 2017, Sudulagunta et al.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of senile osteoporosis increases year by year. There is no gold standard of treatment for osteoporosis. Tomatidine is the aglycone derivative of tomatine, having the ability to treat various diseases, including osteoporosis. However, the mechanism by which tomatidine improves osteoporosis has not been fully elucidated. Tomatidine is a potential and promising drug for osteoporosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, the KEGG pathways that tomatidine-targeted genes enriched in were obtained using bioinformatics methods. The KEGG pathways involved in osteoporosis that were also associated with tomatidine-targeted genes were selected. After analysis of these pathways, essential genes that may be involved in this biological process were identified and validated experimentally. RESULTS We found 110 osteoporosis related KEGG pathways and 76 tomatidine-targeted genes-related KEGG pathways were obtained. 39 shared KEGG pathways were identified. The top 5 pathways were: pathway of chronic myeloid leukemia, pathway of B cell receptor signaling, pathway in cancer, bladder cancer pathway, and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation pathway. MAPK1, MAP2K1, MAPK3, RAF1 were involved in all the 5 pathways. The p53 signaling pathway and the MAPK signaling pathway were involved in the 5 KEGG pathways. In vitro experiments showed that downregulating p53 expression could be potentially protective for osteoporosis. CONCLUSIONS Tomatidine can improve osteoporosis, and one of the mechanisms of its action is achieved by modulating p53. Tomatidine may be a promising drug for osteoporosis.","['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '2B73S48786 (tomatidine)', '31U6547O08 (Tomatine)']",PMC7191956,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RUNX1-EVI1 is a fusion protein formed by the t(3;21) translocation linking two transcription factors required for normal hematopoiesis. RUNX1-EVI1 expression is found in myelodysplastic syndrome, secondary acute myeloid leukemia, and blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia; with clinical outcomes being worse than in patients with RUNX1-ETO, RUNX1 or EVI1 mutations alone. RUNX1-EVI1 is usually found as a secondary mutation, therefore the molecular mechanisms underlying how RUNX1-EVI1 alone contributes to poor prognosis are unknown. To address this question, we induced expression of RUNX1-EVI1 in hematopoietic cells derived from an embryonic stem cell differentiation model. Induction resulted in disruption of the RUNX1-dependent endothelial-hematopoietic transition, blocked the cell cycle and undermined cell fate decisions in multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells. Integrative analyses of gene expression with chromatin and transcription factor binding data demonstrated that RUNX1-EVI1 binding caused the re-distribution of endogenous RUNX1 within the genome and interfered with both RUNX1 and EVI1 regulated gene expression programs. In summary, RUNX1-EVI1 expression alone leads to extensive epigenetic reprogramming which is incompatible with healthy blood production.","['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",PMC8168488,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Local hypoxia is among the conditions that cause immunosuppression, acting at least in part through the upregulation of extracellular adenosine levels, which potently suppress T cell responses and skew macrophages towards an M2 phenotype. Hence, there is intense investigation to identify drugs that target this axis. By using the TCL1 adoptive transfer CLL mouse model, we show that adenosine production and signaling are upregulated in the hypoxic lymphoid niches, where intense colonization of leukemic cells occurs. This leads to a progressive remodeling of the immune system towards tolerance, with expansion of T regulatory cells (Tregs), loss of CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity and differentiation of murine macrophages towards the patrolling (M2-like) subset. In vivo administration of SCH58261, an inhibitor the A2A adenosine receptor, re-awakens T cell responses, while limiting Tregs expansion, and re-polarizes monocytes towards the inflammatory (M1-like) phenotype. These results show for the first time the in vivo contribution of adenosine signaling to immune tolerance in CLL, and the translational implication of drugs interrupting this pathway. Although the effects of SCH58261 on leukemic cells are limited, interfering with adenosine signaling may represent an appealing strategy for combination-based therapeutic approaches.","['0 (Receptors, Purinergic P1)']",PMC8094100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated incidence, type and risk factors for second malignant neoplasms in patients included in Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster protocols for childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 3590 patients <15 years of age at diagnosis registered between 01/1981 and 06/2010 were analyzed. Second malignant neoplasms were reported by the treating institutions and the German Childhood Cancer Registry. After median follow-up of 9.4 years (Quartile, Q1 6.7 and Q3 12.1) 95 second malignant neoplasms were registered (26 carcinomas including 9 basal cell carcinomas, 21 acute myeloid leukemias/myelodysplastic syndromes, 20 lymphoid malignancies, 12 CNS-tumors, and 16 other). Cumulative incidence at 20 years was 5.7+/-0.7%, standard incidence ratio excluding basal cell carcinomas was 19.8 (95% CI 14.5-26.5). Median time from initial diagnosis to second malignancy was 8.7 years (range: 0.2-30.3). Acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-type therapy, cumulative anthracycline dose, and cranial radiotherapy for brain tumor-development were significant risk factors in univariate analysis only. In multivariate analysis including risk factors significant in univariate analysis, female sex (HR 1.87, 95% CI 1.23-2.86, p=0.004), CNS-involvement (HR 2.24, 95% CI 1.03-4.88, p=0.042), lymphoblastic lymphoma (HR 2.60, 95% CI 1.69-3.97, p<0.001), and cancer-predisposing condition (HR 11.2, 95% CI 5.52-22.75, p<0.001) retained an independent risk. Carcinomas were the most frequent second malignant neoplasms after non-Hodgkin lymphoma in childhood followed by acute myeloid leukemia and lymphoid malignancies.

Erypoegin K has a chiral carbon at the C-2'' position of its furan ring and naturally occurs as a racemic mixture of (S)- and (R)-isomers. In the present study, we semi-synthesized (RS)-erypoegin K from genistein and separated the optical isomers by HPLC using a chiral column to characterize its apoptosis-inducing activity. Apoptotic cell death was assessed by analyzing caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation, nuclear fragmentation, and genomic DNA ladder formation. (S)-erypoegin K showed exclusive anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing activity, with an IC50 value of 90 nM, about 50% lower than that of its racemic mixture (175 nM). By contrast, no apoptosis-inducing activity was shown by the (R)-isomer. In addition, methylglyoxal accumulation in the culture medium was observed only in cells treated with (S)-erypoegin K.

Epub 2020 Apr 13.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is characterized by an overproliferation of blood cells, is divided into several subtypes in adults and children. Of those subtypes, acute monocytic leukemia (M4/M5, AMoL) is reported to be associated with abnormal gene fusions that result in monocytic cell differentiation being blocked. However, few studies have shown a relationship between cellular metabolism and the initiation of AMoL. Here, we use the open-access database TCGA to analyze the expression of enzymes in the metabolic cycle and find that PFKFB4 is highly expressed in AMoL. Subsequently, knocking down PFKFB4 in THP-1 and U937 cells significantly inhibits cell growth and increases the sensitivity of cells to chemical drug-induced apoptosis. In line with the gene-editing alterations, treatment with a PFKFB4 inhibitor exhibits similar effects on THP-1 and U937 proliferation and apoptosis. In addition, we find that PFKFB4 functions as a reliable target of the epigenetic regulator MLL, which is a well-known modulator in AMoL. Mechanistically, MLL promotes PFKFB4 expression at the transcriptional level through the putative E2F6 binding site in the promoter of the pfkfb4 gene. Taken together, our results suggest PFKFB4 serves as a downstream target of MLL and functions as a potent therapeutic target in AMoL.","['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (PFKFB4 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.1.105 (Phosphofructokinase-2)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute monocytic leukemia', '*Apoptosis', '*MLL', '*PFKFB4', '*Transcription']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2020 Apr 14.,"The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly impacted the delivery of cellular therapeutics, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. This impact has extended beyond patient care to include logistics, administration, and distribution of increasingly limited health care resources. Based on the collective experience of the CAR T-cell Consortium investigators, we review and address several questions and concerns regarding cellular therapy administration in the setting of COVID-19 and make general recommendations to address these issues. Specifically, we address (1) necessary resources for safe administration of cell therapies; (2) determinants of cell therapy utilization; (3) selection among patients with B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; (4) supportive measures during cell therapy administration; (5) use and prioritization of tocilizumab; and (6) collaborative care with referring physicians. These recommendations were carefully formulated with the understanding that resource allocation is of the utmost importance, and that the decision to proceed with CAR T cell therapy will require extensive discussion of potential risks and benefits. Although these recommendations are fluid, at this time it is our opinion that the COVID-19 pandemic should not serve as reason to defer CAR T cell therapy for patients truly in need of a potentially curative therapy.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', 'I031V2H011 (tocilizumab)']",PMC7194685,['NOTNLM'],"['*COVID-19', '*Cellular therapy', '*Chimeric antigen receptor T cells', '*Coronavirus', '*Pandemic']","['P01 CA214278/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

We report on event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates in the Republic of Ireland (ROI) during 2000-2017, and evaluate novel predictors of outcome. Methods Data was collected by retrospective review of patient medical records. Results Thirty-three patients were identified (twenty-five [76%] males, eight [24%] females), fourteen [42%] having stage III disease at presentation. Six [18%] had stage IV disease.

Epub 2020 May 6.,"New strategies to eradicate cancer stem cells in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) include a combination of imatinib with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) ligands. Recently, we identified the partial PPARgamma agonist telmisartan as effective sensitizer of resistant K562 CML cells to imatinib treatment. Here, the importance of the heterocyclic core on the cell death-modulating effects of the telmisartan-derived lead 4'-((2-propyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)methyl)-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-carboxylic acid (3 b) was investigated. Inspired by the pharmacodynamics of HYL-6d and the selective PPARgamma ligand VSP-51, the benzimidazole was replaced by a carbazole or an indole core. The results indicate no correlation between PPARgamma activation and sensitization of resistant CML cells to imatinib. The 2-COOH derivatives of the carbazoles or indoles achieved low activity at PPARgamma, while the benzimidazoles showed 60-100 % activation. Among the 2-CO2 CH3 derivatives, only the ester of the lead (2 b) slightly activated PPARgamma. Sensitizing effects were further observed for this non-cytotoxic 2 b (80 % cell death), and to a lesser extent for the lead 3 b or the 5-Br-substituted ester of the benzimidazoles (5 b).","['0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'U5SYW473RQ (Telmisartan)']",PMC7318623,['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*imatinib resistance', '*peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma', '*sensitizers', '*structure-activity relationship']",,['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Histone aggregation, assessed by Laser Scanning Cytometry via the retention of the aggregates in isolated nuclei, was observed in the case of H2A. The dominant effect of the anthracycline on H2B was its massive accumulation in the cytoplasm of the Jurkat leukemia cells concomitant with its disappearance from the nuclei, detected by confocal microscopy and mass spectrometry. A similar effect of the anthracycline was observed in primary human lymphoid cells, and also in monocyte-derived dendritic cells that harbor an unusually high amount of H2B in their cytoplasm even in the absence of Dox treatment. The nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation of H2B was not affected by inhibitors of major biochemical pathways or the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B, but it was completely diminished by PYR-41, an inhibitor with pleiotropic effects on protein degradation pathways. Dox and PYR-41 acted synergistically according to isobologram analyses of cytotoxicity. These large-scale effects were detected already at Dox concentrations that may be reached in the typical clinical settings, therefore they can contribute both to the anti-cancer mechanism and to the side-effects of this anthracycline.","['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Histones)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'Y031I2N1EO (leptomycin B)']",PMC7162453,,,,,,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 16.,"PURPOSE: To describe long-term outcomes of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cells in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). METHODS: Between January 2013 and June 2016, 42 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL were enrolled in this study and 38 were infused with anti-CD19 CART cells (CART-19). Of these, 28 patients were initially randomly assigned to receive a low (5 x 10(7)) or high (5 x 10(8)) dose of CART-19, and 24 were evaluable for response assessment. After an interim analysis, 10 additional patients received the selected (high) dose and of these, eight were evaluable for response. Patients were followed for a median 31.5 months (range, 2 to 75 months). RESULTS: At 4 weeks, the complete and overall responses for the 32 evaluable patients were 28% (90% CI, 16% to 44%) and 44% (90% CI, 29% to 60%), respectively. The median overall survival (OS) for all patients was 64 months; there was no statistically significant difference between low- and high-dose groups (P = .84). Regardless of dose, prolonged survival was observed in patients who achieved a CR versus those who did not (P = .035), with median OS not reached in patients with CR versus 64 months in those without CR. The median progression-free survival was 40.2 months in patients with CR and 1 month in those without a CR (P < .0001). Toxicity was comparable in both dose groups. CONCLUSION: In patients with advanced CLL, a 5 x 10(8) dose of CART-19 may be more effective than 5 x 10(7) CART-19 at inducing CR without excessive toxicity. Attainment of a CR after CART-19 infusion, regardless of cell dose, is associated with longer OS and progression-free survival in patients with relapsed CLL.","['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",PMC8265376,,,['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT02640209'],,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 16.,"Over the last decade, the Janus kinase1/2 (JAK1/2) inhibitor ruxolitinib has emerged as a cornerstone of myelofibrosis (MF) management. Ruxolitinib improves splenomegaly and symptoms regardless of driver mutation status, and confers a survival advantage in patients with intermediate-2/high risk MF. However, cytopenias remain problematic, and evidence for a robust anti-clonal effect is lacking. Furthermore, the median duration of spleen response to ruxolitinib in clinical trials is approximately 3 years, and ruxolitinib does not appear to affect the risk of leukemic transformation. There is no therapy approved specifically for patients whose disease 'progresses' on ruxolitinib, defining which remains challenging. The recent regulatory approval of the JAK2 inihibitor fedratinib partially fulfills this unmet need, but much remains to be done. Other JAK inhibitors and a plethora of novel agents are being studied in the ruxolitinib 'failure' setting, as well as 'add-on' therapies to ruxolitinib in patients having a 'sub-optimal' response.","['0 (Janus Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",PMC8565616,['NOTNLM'],"['*Myelofibrosis', '*clinical trials', '*fedratinib', '*momelotinib', '*rational combinations', '*ruxolitinib failure']",['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['NIHMS1621231'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 30.,"High rates of glycolysis in tumors have been associated with cancer metastasis, tumor recurrence, and poor outcomes. In this light, single cells that exhibit high glycolysis are specific targets for therapy. However, the study of these cells requires efficient tools for their isolation. We use a droplet microfluidic technique developed in our lab, Sorting by Interfacial Tension (SIFT), to isolate cancer cell subpopulations based on glycolysis without the use of labels or active sorting components. By controlling the flow conditions on chip, the threshold of selection can be modified, enabling the isolation of cells with different levels of glycolysis. Hypoxia in tumors, that can be simulated with treatment with CoCl2, leads to an increase in glycolysis, and more dangerous tumors. The device was used to enrich CoCl2 treated MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells from an untreated population. It is also used to sort K562 human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells that have either been treated or untreated with 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG), a pharmaceutical that targets cell metabolism. The technique provides a facile and robust way of separating cells based on elevated glycolytic activity; a biomarker associated with cancer cell malignancy.",,PMC7473507,,,['R15 GM129674/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['NIHMS1622688'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are reported as critical regulators in diseases. GEPIA database indicated that long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 221 (LINC00221) was conspicuously down-regulated in acute myeloid leukemia. However, its expression pattern in ALL has not been revealed. This work was carried out to study the role of LINC00221 in ALL cells. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) quantified LINC00221 expression in ALL cells. The function of LINC00221 in ALL was determined by ki-67 immunofluorescence staining, EdU, TUNEL, JC-1, and caspase-3/8/9 activity assays. RNA pull down and Ago2-RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays investigated the interaction between miR-152-3p and LINC00221 or ATPase sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transporting 2 (ATP2A2). Our study revealed the low expression of LINC00221 in ALL cells. Subsequently, LINC00221 was verified to bind with miR-152-3p. Moreover, functional assays pointed out that LINC00221 overexpression posed anti-proliferation and pro-apoptosis effects in ALL cells, and these effects could be separately reversed by miR-152-3p up-regulation. Afterward, LINC00221 was revealed to regulate ATP2A2 expression via sponging miR-152-3p. Additionally, ATP2A2 was verified to involve in regulating LINC00221-mediated ALL cell proliferation and apoptosis.

Epub 2020 Apr 16.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous neoplasm characterized by the monoclonal proliferation of immature progenitors. It is the most common acute leukemia in adults and its incidence increases with age. The standard traditional treatment in fit patients was the '3 + 7' regimen and cytarabine consolidation followed or not with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Recently, several targeted therapies such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin targeting the CD33(+) AML, midostaurin, gilteritinib and crenolanib inhibiting FLT3-positive AML and ivosidenib and enasidenib blocking IDH-mutated AML have been approved. These new drugs led to the change of the landscape of the treatment of AML and transforming this disease to a targetable one. We aimed in this paper to review the implications of each new target, the mechanisms of action of these new drugs and we discuss all the studies leading to the approval of these new drugs in their indications according to each target.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3', 'IDH1/2', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'crenolanib', 'enasidenib', 'gemtuzumab ozogamicin', 'gilteritinib', 'ivosidenib', 'midostaurin', 'quizartinib']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Nov 14.,"On November 15, 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended the extension of indication for blinatumomab to include the treatment of adults with minimal residual disease (MRD) positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Blinatumomab was authorized to treat relapsed or refractory B-precursor ALL, and the change concerned an extension of use. On March 29, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval to blinatumomab to treat both adults and children with B-cell precursor ALL who are in remission but still have MRD. On July 26, 2018, the CHMP had originally adopted a negative opinion on the extension. The reason for the initial refusal was that although blinatumomab helped to reduce the amount of residual cancer cells in many patients, there was no strong evidence that it led to improved survival. During the re-examination, the CHMP consulted the scientific advisory group. The CHMP agreed with the expert group's conclusion that, although there was no strong evidence of patients living longer, the available data from the main study (MT103-203) indicated a good durable response to blinatumomab, with an overall complete response rate for the primary endpoint full analysis set (defined as all subjects with an Ig or T-cell receptor polymerase chain reaction MRD assay with the minimum required sensitivity of 1 x 10(-4) at central lab established at baseline [n = 113]) as 79.6% (90/113; 95% confidence interval, 71.0-86.6), with a median time to complete MRD response of 29.0 days (range, 5-71). Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the benefits of blinatumomab outweigh its risks and recommended granting the change to the marketing authorization. The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, following reassessment, considered that significant benefit continued to be met and recommended maintaining the orphan designation and thus 10 years market exclusivity (the Orphan Designation is a legal procedure that allows for the designation of a medicinal substance with therapeutic potential for a rare disease, before its first administration in humans or during its clinical development). The marketing authorization holder for this medicinal product is Amgen Europe B.V. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Immunotherapy with blinatumomab has excellent and sustainable results, offering new hope for patients with minimal residual disease-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a disease with poor prognosis. New recommendations and change of practice for treatment of this patient group are detailed.","['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)']",PMC7160312,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*CHMP', '*COMP', '*EMA', '*Hematopoietic stem cell transplant', '*Minimal residual disease', '*PRAC']",,['(c) AlphaMed Press 2019.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2019 Oct 31.,"BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has been shown to be a prognostic factor for cancer survival in randomized clinical trials and observational ""real-world"" cohort studies; however, it remains unclear which HRQoL domains are the best prognosticators. The primary aims of this population-based, observational study were to (a) investigate the association between the novel European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core30 (QLQ-C30) summary score and all-cause mortality, adjusting for the more traditional sociodemographic and clinical prognostic factors; and (b) compare the prognostic value of the QLQ-C30 summary score with the global quality of life (QoL) and physical functioning scales of the QLQ-C30. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2008 and 2015, patients with cancer (12 tumor types) were invited to participate in PROFILES disease-specific registry studies (response rate, 69%). In this secondary analysis of 6,895 patients, multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to investigate the association between the QLQ-C30 scores and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: In the overall Cox regression model including sociodemographic and clinical variables, the QLQ-C30 summary score was associated significantly with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 99% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.82). In stratified analyses, significant associations between the summary score and all-cause mortality were observed for colon, rectal, and prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple myeloma. The QLQ-C30 summary score had a stronger association with all-cause mortality than the global QoL scale (HR, 0.82; 99% CI, 0.77-0.86) or the physical functioning scale (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.77-0.85). CONCLUSION: In a real-world setting, the QLQ-C30 summary score has a strong prognostic value for overall survival for a number of populations of patients with cancer above and beyond that provided by clinical and sociodemographic variables. The QLQ-C30 summary score appears to have more prognostic value than the global QoL, physical functioning, or any other scale within the QLQ-C30. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The finding that health-related quality of life provides distinct prognostic information beyond known sociodemographic and clinical measures, not only around cancer diagnosis (baseline) but also at follow-up, has implications for clinical practice. Implementation of cancer survivorship monitoring systems for ongoing surveillance may improve post-treatment rehabilitation that leads to better outcomes.",,PMC7160310,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*Health-related quality of life', '*Mortality', '*Patient-reported outcome', '*Survival']",,"['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2020 Apr 16.,"Enumeration of blasts and promonocytes is essential for World Health Organization (WHO) classification of myelomonocytic neoplasms. The accuracy of distinguishing blasts, promonocytes and monocytes, including normal vs abnormal monocytes, remains controversial. The objective of this analysis is to assess concordances between experienced hematopathologists in classifying cells as blasts, promonocytes, and monocytes according to WHO criteria. Each of 11 hematopathologists assessed glass slides from 20 patients [12 with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and 8 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)] including blood and BM aspirate smears, and limited nonspecific esterase (NSE) stains. All cases were blindly reviewed. Fleiss' extension of Cohen's kappa for multiple raters was used on these variables, separately for peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM). Spearman's rank correlation was used to assess correlations between each pair of hematopathologists for each measurement. For the classification based on the sum of blasts and promonocytes in the BM, Fleiss' kappa was estimated as 0.744. For PB, categorizing patients according to the sum of blasts and promonocytes, Fleiss' kappa was estimated as 0.949. Distinction of abnormal monocytes from normal monocytes in PB did not achieve a good concordance and showed strong evidence of differences between hematopathologists (P < .0001). The hematopathologists achieved a good concordance rate of 74% in CMML vs AML classification and a high k rate, confirming that criteria for defining the blasts equivalents (blasts plus promonocytes) could be applied consistently. Identification of monocyte subtypes (abnormal vs normal) was not concordant. Our results support the practice of combining blasts/promonocytes into a single category.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['abnormal monocyte', 'concordance', 'monoblast', 'promonocyte']","['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NCI Grant P30 CA016672/Cancer Center Support Grant']",['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,['Bone Marrow Pathology Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Ninety-one fully or partially fit patients (61%) were allocated to intensive chemotherapy and 58 (39%) frail patients to best supportive care (BSC). Intensively treated patients, showing early death and complete response (CR) rate respectively of 5.5% and 73.6%, received 61 consolidations, followed by autologous transplant (ASCT), stem cell transplantation (SCT) or gemtuzumab ozogamicin, depending on mobilization outcome and donor availability. RESULTS: The 8-year overall survival (OS) of these patients was 20.4%, with median duration of 11.4 months significantly superior to the 1.5 months of BSC arm (p < 0.001). Hyperleukocytosis and cytogenetics were predictors of survival with a relative risk of 1.8 in patients with poor karyotype without hyperleukocytosis (p = 0.02) and 3 in those with hyperleukocytosis (>/= 50,000/mul) (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: MGA allowed tailored post-consolidation in 53.8% of patients after high-dose aracytin induction, with long-term survival doubling that reported in the literature after standard-dose cytarabine regimens.

Discussion of prognosis and current treatment indications including novel therapies, linked to understanding of the underlying molecular pathogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Improved understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of HCLc, particularly the causative mutation BRAF V600E, leading to constitutive activation of the MEK/ERK signalling pathway and increased cell proliferation. HCLc is caused by BRAF V600E mutation in most cases. Purine nucleoside analogue (PNA) therapy is the mainstay of treatment, with the addition of rituximab, improving response and minimal residual disease (MRD) clearance. Despite excellent responses to PNAs, many patients will eventually relapse, requiring further therapy. Rarely, patients are refractory to PNA therapy. In relapsed/refractory patients, novel targeted therapies include BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi), anti-CD22 immunoconjugate moxetumomab and Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi).

Epub 2020 Apr 15.,"PURPOSE: Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations lead to formation of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which is elevated in several solid and liquid tumors. Ivosidenib (AG-120) is a targeted, potent, oral inhibitor of the mutant IDH1 protein. We describe detailed pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ivosidenib in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies with an IDH1 mutation treated in a phase I study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02074839). METHODS: Patients received single and multiple oral doses of ivosidenib from 100 mg twice daily to 1200 mg once daily (QD) in 28-day continuous cycles. Concentrations of ivosidenib and 2-HG in plasma, and 2-HG in bone marrow, were assessed at routine intervals. Plasma 4beta-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratios were assessed as a marker of CYP3A activity. RESULTS: Ivosidenib was rapidly absorbed and slowly eliminated (half-life 72-138 h) after single and multiple dosing. Ivosidenib exhibited dose- and time-dependent pharmacokinetics, with exposure increasing sub-proportionally to dose, and clearance increasing with increasing dose. Plasma 2-HG concentrations were maximally and persistently inhibited in the majority of patients receiving 500-mg QD ivosidenib, to concentrations close to those observed in healthy subjects. Ivosidenib pharmacokinetics were not affected by mild or moderate renal impairment, mild hepatic impairment, age, weight, sex, race, or co-administration of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Moderate-to-strong CYP3A4 inhibitors decreased ivosidenib clearance. Ivosidenib also induced CYP3A enzyme activity, with increases in 4beta-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratios of 119-168% at 500-mg QD ivosidenib. CONCLUSIONS: Ivosidenib 500-mg QD has favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies with an IDH1 mutation.

Governments will not be able to minimise both deaths from COVID-19 and the economic impact of viral spread in mitigation of this current COVID-19 pandemic, according to Anderson et al. 2020 [1], Keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put in place measures to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn. The current global picture shows small chains of transmission in many countries and large chains resulting in extensive spread in a few countries, such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan.

By dynamic association with their binding partners, SLiMs enable assembly of multiprotein complexes, pivotal for the regulation of various aspects of cell biology in higher organisms. Despite their importance, there is a paucity of molecular tools to study SLiMs of endogenous proteins in live cells. LC3 interacting regions (LIRs), being quintessential for orchestrating diverse stages of autophagy, are a prominent example of SLiMs and mediate binding to the ubiquitin-like LC3/GABARAP family of proteins. The role of LIRs ranges from the posttranslational processing of their binding partners at early stages of autophagy to the binding of selective autophagy receptors (SARs) to the autophagosome. In order to generate tools to study LIRs in cells, we engineered high affinity binders of LIR motifs of three archetypical SARs: OPTN, p62, and NDP52. In an array of in vitro and cellular assays, the engineered binders were shown to have greatly improved affinity and specificity when compared with the endogenous LC3/GABARAP family of proteins, thus providing a unique possibility for modulating LIR interactions in living systems. We exploited these novel tools to study the impact of LIR inhibition on the fitness and the responsiveness to cytarabine treatment of THP-1 cells - a model for studying acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Our results demonstrate that inhibition of LIR of a single autophagy receptor is insufficient to sensitize the cells to cytarabine, while simultaneous inhibition of three LIR motifs in three distinct SARs reduces the IC50 of the chemotherapeutic.",,PMC7137635,['NOTNLM'],"['AML - acute myeloid leukemia', 'LIR interaction', 'cytarabine', 'inhibitors', 'phage display', 'selective autophagy receptor', 'short linear motifs (SLiMs)']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Putyrski, Vakhrusheva, Bonn, Guntur, Vorobyov, Brandts, Dikic', 'and Ernst.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the related analysis results, we identified that lncRNA NR-104098 is a suppressor gene that is significantly upregulated in AML cells. LncRNA NR-104098 could inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation in AML cells in vitro and also play main role in the mouse xenografts. Mechanically, it was confirmed that lncRNA NR-104098 may effectively inhibit EZH2 transcription by directly binding to E2F1 and recruiting E2F1 to the EZH2 promoter. In addition, ATPR can significantly increase the expression of lncRNA NR-104098, whereas knocking down NR104098 can inhibit the inhibitory effect of ATPR on the proliferation and induction differentiation of AML cells.

Oncologic diagnosis at a median age of 12.0 years was Hodgkin lymphoma in 20, sarcoma in 17, acute leukemia in 24, relapse leukemia in 10, and others in 8 patients. Cumulative anthracycline dose exceeded 300 mg/m(2) in 28 patients. Twenty six patients also received mediastinal irradiation. Decreased peak respiratory oxygen uptake in % predicted on CPET, increased levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP), increased global longitudinal strain on TTE speckle tracking, and diastolic dysfunction on TDI were the most prominent findings on detailed cardiology follow-up. In contrast to HCM patients, childhood cancer survivors did not show left ventricular hypertrophy (LVPWd z-score median 0.9 vs. 2.8, p < 0.001), hyperdynamic systolic function on TTE (Ejection fraction 62 +/- 7 vs. 72 +/- 12%, p = 0.001), or fibrotic myocardial changes on CMR (Late gadolinium positive 0/13 vs. 13/36, p = 0.001; extracellular volume fraction 22 +/- 2 vs. 28 +/- 3, p < 0.001) at time of follow-up. There was no correlation between chest radiation exposure and abnormal cardiac findings. Cumulative anthracycline dose was the only significant independent predictor on multivariate analysis for any cardiovascular abnormality on follow-up (p = 0.036). Conclusion: Increasing cumulative anthracycline dose during cancer treatment correlates with subclinical cardiac dysfunction in childhood cancer survivors best detected by elevated cardiac serum biomarkers, decreased exercise capacity on CPET, and abnormalities on echocardiographic speckle tracking and TDI.",,PMC7136405,['NOTNLM'],"['anthracycline', 'biomarker', 'cardiotoxicity', 'cardiovascular', 'childhood cancer', 'speckle tracking', 'subclinical', 'tissue doppler']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Wolf, Reiner, Kuhn, Hager, Muller, Meierhofer, Oberhoffer,', 'Ewert, Schmid and Weil.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

toxicities. One of the key signaling pathways known to be frequently activated and dysregulated in AML is PI3K/AKT. Its dysregulation is associated with aggressive cell growth and drug resistance. We investigated the activity of Phenybutyl isoselenocyanate (ISC-4) in primary cells obtained from newly diagnosed AML patients, diverse AML cell lines, and normal cord blood cells. ISC-4 significantly inhibited survival and clonogenicity of primary human AML cells without affecting normal cells. We demonstrated that ISC-4-mediated p-Akt inhibition caused apoptosis in primary AML (CD34(+)) stem cells and enhanced efficacy of cytarabine. ISC-4 impeded leukemia progression with improved overall survival in a syngeneic C1498 mouse model with no obvious toxic effects on normal myelopoiesis. In U937 xenograft model, bone marrow cells exhibited significant reduction in human CD45(+) cells in ISC-4 (~87%) or AraC (~89%) monotherapy groups compared to control. Notably, combination treatment suppressed the leukemic infiltration significantly higher than the single-drug treatments (~94%). Together, the present findings suggest that ISC-4 might be a promising agent for AML treatment.",,PMC7140985,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Akt', 'AraC', 'apoptosis', 'isoselenocyanate-4', 'primary human AML cells', 'xenograft']",['P01 CA171983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Copyright (c) 2020 Annageldiyev, Tan, Thakur, Dhanyamraju, Ramisetti, Bhadauria,', 'Schick, Zeng, Sharma, Dunton, Dovat, Desai, Zheng, Feith, Loughran, Amin, Sharma,', 'Claxton and Sharma.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The descriptive retrospective cohort study was conducted at The Children's Hospital Lahore, Pakistan, and comprised clinical information sheets of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia patients from September 2014 to August 2015. Data regarding demographics, risk categorisation, rapid early response and induction-remission assessment was collected separately for Group 1 patients treated with Lahore protocol and Group 2 patients using United Kingdom acute lymphoblastic leukaemia-2011 interim guidelines. Data was analysed using SPSS version 20.0. RESULTS: Of the 98 patients who had a median age of 6.4 years (interquartile range: 1.5-16 years), 48(49%) were in Group 1 and 50(51%) in Group 2. There were 14(29%) patients with standard risk in Group 1 while 34(71%) were high-risk. The corresponding numbers in Group 2 were 30(60%) and 20(40%) in Group 2. Rapid early response was noted in 18(37.5%) patients in Group 1 and 11(28%) in Group 2. Remission was achieved in 38(79%) patients in Group 1 and 36(72%) in Group 2. There was significant association of rapid early response with induction-remission in Group 2 (p<0.05) but not in Group 1 (p>0.05).

Epub 2020 Apr 16.,"Daratumumab (Dara), a multiple myeloma (MM) therapy, is an antibody against the surface receptor CD38, which is expressed not only on plasma cells but also on NK cells and monocytes. Correlative data have highlighted the immune-modulatory role of Dara, despite the paradoxical observation that Dara regimens decrease the frequency of total NK cells. Here we show that, despite this reduction, NK cells play a pivotal role in Dara anti-MM activity. CD38 on NK cells is essential for Dara-induced immune modulation, and its expression is restricted to NK cells with effector function. We also show that Dara induces rapid CD38 protein degradation associated with NK cell activation, leaving an activated CD38-negative NK cell population. CD38+ NK cell targeting by Dara also promotes monocyte activation, inducing an increase in T-cell costimulatory molecules (CD86/80) and enhancing anti-MM phagocytosis activity ex vivo and in vivo. In support of Dara's immunomodulating role, we show that MM patients that discontinued Dara therapy because of progression maintain targetable unmutated surface CD38 expression on their MM cells, but retain effector cells with impaired cellular immune function. In summary, we report that CD38+ NK cells may be an unexplored therapeutic target for priming the immune system of MM patients.","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '4Z63YK6E0E (daratumumab)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",PMC7572537,,,"['R01 CA194742/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA238429/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA201382/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS1578110'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells have self-renewal capacity and differentiation potential and contribute to multiple tumor malignancies, such as recurrence, metastasis, heterogeneity, multidrug resistance, and radiation resistance. The biological activities of CSCs are regulated by several pluripotent transcription factors, such as OCT4, Sox2, Nanog, KLF4, and MYC. In addition, many intracellular signaling pathways, such as Wnt, NF-kappaB (nuclear factor-kappaB), Notch, Hedgehog, JAK-STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription), PI3K/AKT/mTOR (phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin), TGF (transforming growth factor)/SMAD, and PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor), as well as extracellular factors, such as vascular niches, hypoxia, tumor-associated macrophages, cancer-associated fibroblasts, cancer-associated mesenchymal stem cells, extracellular matrix, and exosomes, have been shown to be very important regulators of CSCs. Molecules, vaccines, antibodies, and CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor T cell) cells have been developed to specifically target CSCs, and some of these factors are already undergoing clinical trials. This review summarizes the characterization and identification of CSCs, depicts major factors and pathways that regulate CSC development, and discusses potential targeted therapy for CSCs.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",PMC7005297,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we show that targeting CDK9 with voruciclib in combination with venetoclax results in synergistic antileukemic activity against AML cell lines and primary patient samples. CDK9 inhibition enhances venetoclax activity through downregulation of Mcl-1 and c-Myc. However, downregulation of Mcl-1 is transient, which necessitates an intermittent treatment schedule to allow for repeated downregulation of Mcl-1. Accordingly, an every other day schedule of the CDK9 inhibitor is effective in vitro and in vivo in enhancing the efficacy of venetoclax. Our preclinical data provide a rationale for an intermittent drug administration schedule for the clinical evaluation of the combination treatment for AML.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Imino Furanoses)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK9 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)', 'W66XP666AM (voruciclib)']",PMC7042303,,,['P30 CA022453/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We established a CpG methylation panel that can distinguish ALL and AML blood from normal blood as well as ALL blood from AML blood with high sensitivity and specificity. We then developed a methylation-based survival classifier with 23 CpGs for ALL and 20 CpGs for AML that could successfully divide patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, with significant differences in clinical outcome in each leukemia type.

duplication (ITD) mutations of FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) are the most frequent genetic alterations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and predict a poor prognosis. FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) provide short-term clinical responses, but the long-term prognosis of FLT3/ITD(+) AML patients remains poor. Notch signaling is important in numerous types of tumors. However, the role of Notch signaling in FLT3/ITD(+) AML remains to be elucidated. In the current study, we found that Notch signaling was activated upon FLT3-TKI treatment in FLT3/ITD(+) cell lines and primary cells. As Notch signaling can be blocked by gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), we examined the combinatorial antitumor efficacy of FLT3-TKIs and GSIs against FLT3/ITD(+) AML and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. As a result, we observed synergistic cytotoxic effects, and the treatment preferentially reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in FLT3/ITD(+) AML cell lines and in primary AML cells. Furthermore, the combination of FLT3-TKI and GSI eradicated leukemic cells and prolonged survival in an FLT3/ITD(+) patient-derived xenograft AML model.

Print 2020 Jun 1.,"ND10 nuclear bodies, as part of the intrinsic defenses, impose repression on incoming DNA. Infected cell protein 0 (ICP0), an E3 ubiquitin ligase of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), can derepress viral genes by degrading ND10 organizers to disrupt ND10. These events are part of the initial tug of war between HSV-1 and host, which determines the ultimate outcome of infection. Previously, we reported that ICP0 differentially recognizes promyelocytic leukemia (PML) isoforms. ICP0 depends on a SUMO-interaction motif located at residues 362 to 364 (SIM362-364) to trigger the degradation of PML isoforms II, IV, and VI, while using a bipartite sequence flanking the RING domain to degrade PML I. In this study, we investigated how the SUMO-SIM interaction regulates the degradation of PML II and PML II-associated proteins in ND10. We found that (i) the same regulatory mechanism for PML II degradation was detected in cells permissive or nonpermissive to the ICP0-null virus; (ii) the loss of a single SIM362-364 motif was restored by the presence of four consecutive SIMs from RNF4, but was not rescued by only two of the RNF4 SIMs; (iii) the loss of three C-terminal SIMs of ICP0 was fully restored by four RNF4 SIMs and also partially rescued by two RNF4 SIMs; and (iv) a PML II mutant lacking both lysine SUMOylation and SIM was not recognized by ICP0 for degradation, but was localized to ND10 and mitigated the degradation of other ND10 components, leading to delayed viral production. Taken together, SUMO regulates ICP0 substrate recognition via multiple fine-tuned mechanisms in HSV-1 infection.IMPORTANCE HSV-1 ICP0 is a multifunctional immediate early protein key to effective replication in the HSV-1 lytic cycle and reactivation in the latent cycle. ICP0 transactivates gene expression by orchestrating an overall mitigation in host intrinsic/innate restrictions. How ICP0 coordinates its multiple active domains and its diverse protein-protein interactions is a key question in understanding the HSV-1 life cycle and pathogenesis. The present study focuses on delineating the regulatory effects of the SUMO-SIM interaction on ICP0 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity regarding PML II degradation. For the first time, we discovered the importance of multivalency in the PML II-ICP0 interaction network and report the involvement of different regulatory mechanisms in PML II recognition by ICP0 in HSV-1 infection.","['0 (CALCOCO2 protein, human)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNF4 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)']",PMC7307090,['NOTNLM'],"['*HSV-1', '*ICP0', '*SUMO-interaction', '*virus-host interactions']",['R01 AI118992/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Microbiology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we characterize the oral mycobiome, including mycobiome-bacteriome interactions, in the setting of remission-induction chemotherapy (RIC) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Oral samples (n = 299) were prospectively collected twice weekly from 39 AML patients during RIC until neutrophil recovery. Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA gene (V4) and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequencing were used to determine bacterial and fungal diversity and community composition. Intrakingdom and interkingdom network connectivity at baseline (T1) and at midpoint (T3) and a later time point (T6) were assessed via SPIEC-EASI (sparse inverse covariance estimation for ecological association inference). In this exploratory study, mycobiome alpha-diversity was not significantly associated with antibiotic or antifungal receipt. However, postchemotherapy mycobiome alpha-diversity was lower in subjects receiving high-intensity chemotherapy. Additionally, greater decreases in Malassezia levels were seen over time among patients on high-intensity RIC compared to low-intensity RIC (P = 0.003). A significantly higher relative abundance of Candida was found among patients who had infection (P = 0.008), while a significantly higher relative abundance of Fusarium was found among patients who did not get an infection (P = 0.03). Analyses of intrakingdom and interkingdom relationships at T1, T3, and T6 indicated that interkingdom connectivity increased over the course of IC as bacterial alpha-diversity diminished. In (to our knowledge) the first longitudinal mycobiome study performed during AML RIC, we found that mycobiome-bacteriome interactions are highly dynamic. Our study data suggest that inclusion of mycobiome analysis in the design of microbiome studies may be necessary to optimally understand the ecological and functional role of microbial communities in clinical outcomes.IMPORTANCE This report highlights the importance of longitudinal, parallel characterization of oral fungi and bacteria in order to better elucidate the dynamic changes in microbial community structure and interkingdom functional interactions during the injury of chemotherapy and antibiotic exposure as well as the clinical consequences of these interrelated alterations.",,PMC7160678,['NOTNLM'],"['*Malassezia', '*induction chemotherapy', '*interkingdom interactions', '*leukemia', '*mycobiome']","['K01 AI143881/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Copyright (c) 2020 Robinson et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH) plays an important role in the disposition of MTX. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency distribution of five SNPs in the human GGH gene and their effects on serum MTX concentrations and clinical outcomes in Chinese children with ALL. Genotyping of 149 pediatric patients for GGH rs11545078 C>T, rs11545077 G>A, rs1800909 T>C, rs11545076 T>G, and rs3758149 C>T was performed using the Sequenom MassARRAY system. Serum MTX concentrations were determined using a fluorescence polarization immunoassay. The five SNPs studied were in strong linkage. The minor allele frequencies for rs11545078, rs11545077, rs1800909, rs11545076, and rs3758149 were 5.3, 15.0, 14.3, 15.0, and 15.0%, respectively. Four haplotypes (CGTTC, CACGT, TACGT, and TATGT) were observed at frequencies of 84.9, 9.8, 4.5, and 0.8%, respectively. The median C/D ratios of serum MTX at 24 h and 42 h in children with variant haplotypes (12.30 and 0.08 mumol/L per g/m(2), respectively) were higher than those in wild haplotype carriers (11.85 and 0.07 mumol/L per g/m(2), respectively). The event-free survival of patients with variant haplotypes (89.2%) was significantly better than that of patients with wild haplotypes (71.9%, P < 0.05). The relapse rate in children with variant haplotypes (8.1%) was lower than that in children with wild haplotypes (15.6%). These findings have implications for the efficacious use of MTX in childhood ALL patients.","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 3.4.19.9 (gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy fails to eliminate quiescent leukemic blasts in the bone marrow, leading to about 50% of patient relapse by increasing AML burden in the bone marrow, blood, and extramedullar sites. We developed a protein-based nanoparticle conjugated to the potent antimitotic agent Auristatin E that selectively targets AML blasts because of their CXCR4 receptor overexpression (CXCR4+) as compared to normal cells. The therapeutic rationale is based on the involvement of CXCR4 overexpression in leukemic blast homing and quiescence in the bone marrow, and the association of these leukemic stem cells with minimal residual disease, dissemination, chemotherapy resistance, and lower patient survival. METHODS: Monomethyl Auristatin E (MMAE) was conjugated with the CXCR4 targeted protein nanoparticle T22-GFP-H6 produced in E. coli. Nanoconjugate internalization and in vitro cell viability assays were performed in CXCR4+ AML cell lines to analyze the specific antineoplastic activity through the CXCR4 receptor. In addition, a disseminated AML animal model was used to evaluate the anticancer effect of T22-GFP-H6-Auristatin in immunosuppressed NSG mice (n = 10/group). U of Mann-Whitney test was used to consider if differences were significant between groups. RESULTS: T22-GFP-H6-Auristatin was capable to internalize and exert antineoplastic effects through the CXCR4 receptor in THP-1 and SKM-1 CXCR4+ AML cell lines. In addition, repeated administration of the T22-GFP-H6-Auristatin nanoconjugate (9 doses daily) achieves a potent antineoplastic activity by internalizing specifically in the leukemic cells (luminescent THP-1) to selectively eliminate them. This leads to reduced involvement of leukemic cells in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, liver, and spleen, while avoiding toxicity in normal tissues in a luminescent disseminated AML mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: A novel nanoconjugate for targeted drug delivery of Auristatin reduces significantly the acute myeloid leukemic cell burden in the bone marrow and blood and blocks its dissemination to extramedullar organs in a CXCR4+ AML model. This selective drug delivery approach validates CXCR4+ AML cells as a target for clinical therapy, not only promising to improve the control of leukemic dissemination but also dramatically reducing the severe toxicity of classical AML therapy.","['0 (Aminobenzoates)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nanoconjugates)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (auristatin)']",PMC7160905,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Auristatin nanoconjugate', '*CXCR4', '*Disseminated AML mouse model', '*Leukemic stem cells', '*Targeted nanoparticle']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a systematic literature review to analyze the outcomes reported for both mother and fetus when APL is diagnosed during pregnancy. PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases were systematically searched to identify studies reporting cases of APL during pregnancy. Sixty-six articles met the eligibility criteria (53 single case reports). Ninety-two patients were eligible for induction therapy, with most them being treated with all-trans retinoic acid alone (32%) or combined with chemotherapy (43%), while the remaining patients received chemotherapy alone. Three patients were treated with arsenic-based regimens after delivery. Overall complete remission rate was 89%, with no statistically significant differences according to the type of induction and gestational age. During the first trimester, women were more likely to experience spontaneous and induced abortion compared to those during the second trimester (88% vs. 30%) (p < 0.0001), while only one patient diagnosed during the third trimester terminated in stillbirth. Twelve of 16 infants with neonatal complications had respiratory distress syndrome. Except two early deaths (Potter's syndrome and pulmonary hemorrhage), all neonates evolved favorably. This study confirms that gestational age does not affect the results in the mother, but is closely related to fetal viability.

The proteins were implicated in DNA damage signaling and repair, chromatin remodeling, telomerase activity, and in modulating the transcriptional activities of proto-oncogenes such as c-Myc and beta-catenin. Moreover, both proteins were found to be overexpressed in several different types of cancers such as breast, lung, kidney, bladder, and leukemia. Given their various roles and strong involvement in carcinogenesis, the RUVBL proteins are considered to be novel targets for the discovery and development of therapeutic cancer drugs. Here, we describe the identification of sorafenib as a novel inhibitor of the ATPase activity of human RUVBL2. Enzyme kinetics and surface plasmon resonance experiments revealed that sorafenib is a weak, mixed non-competitive inhibitor of the protein's ATPase activity. Size exclusion chromatography and small angle X-ray scattering data indicated that the interaction of sorafenib with RUVBL2 does not cause a significant effect on the solution conformation of the protein; however, the data suggested that the effect of sorafenib on RUVBL2 activity is mediated by the insertion domain in the protein. Sorafenib also inhibited the ATPase activity of the RUVBL1/2 complex. Hence, we propose that sorafenib could be further optimized to be a potent inhibitor of the RUVBL proteins.","['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Protein Aggregates)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (RUVBL2 protein, human)']",PMC7226205,['NOTNLM'],"['*AAA+ proteins', '*Inhibition', '*RUVBL1', '*RUVBL2', '*Sorafenib']",['PJT-148564/CIHR/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: In total, 60 patients were included, of which 28 patients received MEC and 32 received FLAG-IDA. A complete response (CR) rate of 48.3% was observed. Of the included patients, 16 (27%) died before undergoing bone marrow assessment. No statiscally significant difference in CR rate was found between the two protocols (p=0.447). The median survival in the total cohort was 4 months, with a 3-year overall survival (OS) rate of 9.7%. In a multivariable model including age, fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) status, and stem-cell transplantation (SCT), only the last two indicators remained significant: FLT3-ITD mutation (hazard ratio [HR]=4.6, p<0.001) and SCT (HR=0.43, p=0.01). CONCLUSION: In our analysis, there were no significant differences between the chosen regimens. High rates of early toxicity were found, emphasizing the role of supportive care and judicious selection of patients who are eligible for intensive salvage therapy in this setting.

Epub 2020 Apr 12.,"Over the last 15 years the Diagnostic Center of Acute Leukemia (DCAL) at the Frankfurt University has diagnosed and elucidated the Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) recombinome with >100 MLL fusion partners. When analyzing all these different events, balanced chromosomal translocations were found to comprise the majority of these cases (~70%), while other types of genetic rearrangements (3-way-translocations, spliced fusions, 11q inversions, interstitial deletions or insertion of chromosomal fragments into other chromosomes) account for about 30%. In nearly all those complex cases, functional fusion proteins can be produced by transcription, splicing and translation. With a few exceptions (10 out of 102 fusion genes which were per se out-of-frame), all these genetic rearrangements produced a direct MLL fusion gene, and in 94% of cases an additional reciprocal fusion gene. So far, 114 patients (out of 2454 = ~5%) have been diagnosed only with the reciprocal fusion allele, displaying no MLL-X allele. The fact that so many MLL rearrangements bear at least two fusion alleles, but also our findings that several direct MLL fusions were either out-of-frame fusions or missing, raises the question about the function and importance of reciprocal MLL fusions. Recent findings also demonstrate the presence of reciprocal MLL fusions in sarcoma patients. Here, we want to discuss the role of reciprocal MLL fusion proteins for leukemogenesis and beyond.","['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2020 The Author.

Epub 2020 Apr 13.,"Strategic management of populations of interacting biological species routinely requires interventions combining multiple treatments or therapies. This is important in key research areas such as ecology, epidemiology, wound healing and oncology. Despite the well developed theory and techniques for determining single optimal controls, there is limited practical guidance supporting implementation of combination therapies. In this work we use optimal control theory to calculate optimal strategies for applying combination therapies to a model of acute myeloid leukaemia. We present a versatile framework to systematically explore the trade-offs that arise in designing combination therapy protocols using optimal control. We consider various combinations of continuous and bang-bang (discrete) controls, and we investigate how the control dynamics interact and respond to changes in the weighting and form of the pay-off characterising optimality. We demonstrate that the optimal controls respond non-linearly to treatment strength and control parameters, due to the interactions between species. We discuss challenges in appropriately characterising optimality in a multiple control setting and provide practical guidance for applying multiple optimal controls.

Epub 2020 Apr 12.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common hematological malignancy among adults and is characterized by accumulation of immature myeloid cells. Different genetic factors have role in the occurrence of AML. Among different proteins, RUNX1 and BAALC are involved in the development AML. It has been shown that BAALC overexpression is a factor that indicate shorter disease free survival in a subset of AML patients. RUNX1 has been implicated in the development of breast, prostate, lung, and skin cancers. The aim of this study is determination of the prevalence of common polymorphisms in BAALC (rs6999622 and rs62527607) and RUNX1 (rs13051066 and rs61750222) in AML patients compared with healthy subjects. A total of 100 AML patients and 100 healthy control subjects were included in our study. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and the polymorphisms were genotyped by applying ARMS and PCR-RFLP methods. Finally, data was analyzed using SPPSS software. Our results demonstrate a significant association between the RUNX1 rs13051066 and AML in the co-dominant (odd ratio = 6.66, 95% Cl = 1.85-25, p = .006) and dominant (GT + TT versus GG: odd ratio = 6.15, 95% CI = 1.73-21.87, p = .002) models. The RUNX1 rs13051066 polymorphism is associated with risk of AML in Iranian population. Future studies should consider larger sample size for assessment of RUNX1 gene polymorphisms, and employ cytogenetic and molecular analyses in AML patients from different ethnic origins.","['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*BAALC', '*PCR-RFLP', '*Polymorphism', '*RUNX1']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The frequency of alternative NUDT15 alleles, in particular those that cause a drastic loss of gene function, varies widely among geographically distinct populations. In the general population of northern Brazilian, high toxicity rates (65%) have been recorded in patients treated with the standard protocol for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which involves thiopurine-based drugs. The present study characterized the molecular profile of the coding region of the NUDT15 gene in two groups, non-admixed Amerindians and admixed individuals from the Amazon region of northern Brazil. METHODS: The entire NUDT15 gene was sequenced in 64 Amerindians from 12 Amazonian groups and 82 admixed individuals from northern Brazil. The DNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform. The exome libraries were prepared using the Nextera Rapid Capture Exome (Illumina) and SureSelect Human All Exon V6 (Agilent) kits. The allelic variants were annotated in the ViVa(R) (Viewer of Variants) software. RESULTS: Four NUDT15 variants were identified: rs374594155, rs1272632214, rs147390019, andrs116855232. The variants rs1272632214 and rs116855232 were in complete linkage disequilibrium, and were assigned to the NUDT15*2 genotype. These variants had high frequencies in both our study populations in comparison with other populations catalogued in the 1000 Genomes database. We also identified the NUDT15*4 haplotype in our study populations, at frequencies similar to those reported in other populations from around the world. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that Amerindian and admixed populations from northern Brazil have high frequencies of the NUDT15 haplotypes that alter the metabolism profile of thiopurines.","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.6.1.- (NUDT15 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Pyrophosphatases)']",PMC7159207,,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 90% of cases are due to biallelic mutations in the Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond (SBDS) gene. Additional phenotypic features variably associated with SDS include skeletal, neurologic, hepatic, cardiac, endocrine, and dental abnormalities. We report five subjects with SDS who developed a range of inflammatory manifestations. Three patients developed inflammatory eye conditions. Single cases of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, and scleroderma were also noted. Clinical presentation and treatment responses are described. Proteomic analysis revealed increased inflammatory signatures in SDS subjects as compared to controls. Treatment of inflammatory manifestations in patients with SDS may be complicated by potential myelosuppressive toxicities of anti-rheumatic medications. Further research is needed to better understand the potential link between inflammatory disorders and SDS to inform effective treatment strategies.","['0 (Proteins)', '0 (SBDS protein, human)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Shwachman-Diamond syndrome', '*autoimmune', '*inflammation', '*neutropenia']","['T32 HL007574-36/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 DK099808/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review, we summarize our current understanding of cell metabolism dysregulation in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL). Reprogramming of cellular bioenergetic processes can be expected in the three distinct stages of cALL: at diagnosis, during standard chemotherapy, and in cases of relapse. Upregulation of glycolysis, dependency on anaplerotic energy sources, and activation of the electron transport chain have all been observed in cALL. While the current treatment strategies are tackling some of these aberrations, cALL cells are likely to be able to rewire their metabolism in order to escape therapy, which may contribute to a refractory disease and relapse. Finally, here we focus on novel therapeutic approaches emerging from our evolving understanding of the alterations of different metabolic networks in lymphoblasts.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bioenergetics', '*cALL', '*cell metabolism', '*therapy']",,"['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the effect of G9a inhibition on leukemia stem cells (LSCs), which are responsible for AML drug resistance and recurrence, is unclear. In this study, we investigated the underlying mechanisms of the LSC resistance to G9a inhibition. METHODS: We evaluated the effects of G9a inhibition on the unfolded protein response and autophagy in AML and LSC-like cell lines and in primary CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemic blasts from patients with AML and investigated the underlying mechanisms. The effects of treatment on cells were evaluated by flow cytometry, western blotting, confocal microscopy, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production assay. RESULTS: The G9a inhibitor BIX-01294 effectively induced apoptosis in AML cell lines; however, the effect was limited in KG1 LSC-like cells. BIX-01294 treatment or siRNA-mediated G9a knockdown led to the activation of the PERK/NRF2 pathway and HO-1 upregulation in KG1 cells. Phosphorylation of p38 and intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were suppressed. Pharmacological or siRNA-mediated inhibition of the PERK/NRF2 pathway synergistically enhanced BIX-01294-induced apoptosis, with suppressed HO-1 expression, increased p38 phosphorylation, and elevated ROS generation, indicating that activated PERK/NRF2 signaling suppressed ROS-induced apoptosis in KG1 cells. By contrast, cotreatment of normal hematopoietic stem cells with BIX-01294 and a PERK inhibitor had no significant proapoptotic effect. Additionally, G9a inhibition induced autophagy flux in KG1 cells, while autophagy inhibitors significantly increased the BIX-01294-induced apoptosis. This prosurvival autophagy was not abrogated by PERK/NRF2 inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: PERK/NRF2 signaling plays a key role in protecting LSCs against ROS-induced apoptosis, thus conferring resistance to G9a inhibitors. Treatment with PERK/NRF2 or autophagy inhibitors could overcome resistance to G9a inhibition and eliminate LSCs, suggesting the potential clinical utility of these unique targeted therapies against AML.",['0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)'],PMC7158163,['NOTNLM'],"['Autophagy', 'G9a', 'Leukemia stem cells', 'PERK/NRF2', 'Resistance']",['NRF-2018R1C1B5047502/National Research Foundation of Korea'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As more data is generated, oncogenic drivers for specific cancer types are discovered along with their associated risks. This in turn leads to potential treatment strategies that pave the way to precision medicine. However, significant financial and analytical barriers make it infeasible to sequence the entire genome of every patient. In contrast, targeted sequencing panels give reliable information on relevant portions of the genome at a fiscally responsible cost. Therefore, we have created the Targeted Panel (TarPan) Viewer, a software tool, to investigate this type of data. RESULTS: TarPan Viewer helps investigators understand data from targeted sequencing data by displaying the information through a web browser interface. Through this interface, investigators can easily observe copy number changes, mutations, and structural events in cancer samples. The viewer runs in R Shiny with a robust SQLite backend and its input is generated from bioinformatic algorithms reliably described in the literature. Here we show the results from using TarPan Viewer on publicly available follicular lymphoma, breast cancer, and multiple myeloma data. In addition, we have tested and utilized the viewer internally, and this data has been used in high-impact peer-reviewed publications. CONCLUSIONS: We have designed a flexible, simple to setup viewer that is easily adaptable to any type of cancer targeted sequencing, and has already proven its use in a research laboratory environment. Further, we believe with deeper sequencing and/or more targeted application it could be of use in the clinic in conjunction with an appropriate targeted sequencing panel as a cost-effective diagnostic test, especially in cancers such as acute leukemia or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that require rapid interventions.",,PMC7158102,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Copy number', 'Somatic mutations', 'Structural variants', 'Visualization']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 27.,"INTRODUCTION: Immune surveillance is the dynamic process whereby the immune system identifies and kills tumor cells based on their aberrant expression of stress-related surface molecules or presentation of tumor neoantigens. It plays a crucial role in controlling the initiation and progression of hematologic cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma, and it has been reported that diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) fails to express specific cell-surface molecules that are necessary for the recognition and elimination of tumor cells. AREAS COVERED: This review is based on a systematic search strategy to identify relevant literature in the PubMed and Embase databases. Ten candidate genes are identified based on mutational frequency, and functions with detailed mapping performed for hotspot alterations that may have a functional impact on malignant transformation and decreased immune surveillance efficacy. EXPERT OPINION: Ongoing development of technology and bioinformatics tools combined with data from large clinical cohorts have the potential to define the mutational landscape associated with immune surveillance in DLBCL. Specific functional studies are required to make an unambiguous link between genetic aberrations and biological impact on impaired immune surveillance.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*DLBCL', '*Immune surveillance', '*candidate genes', '*immune escape', '*somatic mutation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 15.,"The majority of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients will respond to standard chemotherapy, however, resistance is a prevalent problem contributing to incomplete responses, refractory disease, and ultimately patient death. Therefore, choosing more sensitive and effective chemotherapy regimens is of key clinical importance. In order to explore this issue, we investigated and optimized PharmaFlow, an automated flow cytometry method for evaluating the sensitivity of leukemia cells to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs ex vivo. We examined bone marrow samples from 38 Chinese AML patients and incubated them for 48 or 72 h with a panel of 7 single drugs and 6 combinations with cytarabine at different concentrations. Leukemic cell depletion was assessed by PharmaFlow and drug response parameter, called PharmaFlow score, was estimated using population pharmacodynamic models. We identified that most chemotherapeutic drugs and combinations could effectively eliminate pathological cells ex vivo. Estimated drug activities strongly correlated with the patients' duration to achieve clinical remission and PharmaFlow chemosensitivity measured ex vivo was highly predictive of the clinical outcome after chemotherapy. Applying a classification model, we determined a PharmaFlow score of 89.4 as the threshold to predict response to chemotherapy. Using this threshold, we found that in 84.2% of cases patient's cell response ex vivo predicted the observed clinical response and performed similarly or better than prognostic subgroups determined by cytogenetic characteristics. PharmaFlow has the potential to predict chemosensitivity for de novo, secondary and relapsed AML patients prior to treatment and may guide clinicians to tailor treatments and improve patient outcome.",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,['NOTNLM'],"['*PharmaFlow', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*chemosensitivity']",,['(c)2020 Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interconnectivity between these two pathways has been suggested, but the molecular detail of how they impact each other remains elusive. Proteasomal deubiquitinase (DUB) is an important constituent in the UPS and has proved to be a novel anticancer target. We have previously found that a novel DUB inhibitor, nickel complex NiPT, induces apoptosis in both cultured tumor cell lines and cancer cells from acute myeloid leukemia human patients. In this study, we found that NiPT triggered autophagy both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, NiPT targets two DUBs, USP14, and UCHL5, and increased the total cellular level of polyubiquitination. Deletion of the Ubiquitin Associated (UBA) domain of P62 that is required for polyubiquitin binding prevented NiPT-induced autophagy. NiPT-induced autophagy is through either concomitant activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, or eliciting endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress by activating activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP). Moreover, NiPT could induce more lung cancer cells undergoing apoptosis if it synergistically uses autophagy inhibitors, suggesting that NiPT-induced autophagy protects cancer cell from death. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that autophagy inhibition enhances the anticancer effects of proteasomal DUB inhibitor and might be an effective treatment strategy for lung cancer.",,PMC7119081,['NOTNLM'],"['DUBs', 'LC3', 'NiPT', 'UPS', 'anticancer therapy', 'autophagy', 'metal-based compounds', 'p62']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Chen, Chen, Xu, Yang, Yang, Yang, Yan, Zhang, Feng and Liu.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data coming from the phase III 'DUO' trial, in fact, showed a superior progression-free survival (PFS) in CLL patients treated with duvelisib compared to ofatumumab. AREAS COVERED: This review provides analysis of the mechanism of action of duvelisib and includes the rationale for the use of double inhibition. The authors also give their clinical experience with duvelisib. Overall, despite the high efficacy of the drug, some concern remains on duvelisib-related adverse events leading to treatment interruption in a significant proportion of patients. EXPERT OPINION: Considering the unmet need of salvage therapies in patients failing BTK and/or Bcl2 inhibitors, treatment with duvelisib represents a new valid option in the CLL therapeutic armamentarium.

Epub 2020 Mar 1.,"Doxorubicin (DOX) is one of the secondary metabolites of Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius. It is a common and effective chemotherapeutic agent used for the treatment of different diseases, including lymphoma, leukemia, breast cancer, and solid tumors. However, this medicine causes cardiotoxic side effects, which limit its clinical application. The present study examined the cardiomyopathy induced by DOX via echocardiography and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The main objective was to evaluate the capacity of echocardiography and TEM as diagnostic tools for DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Moreover, the correlation between intracellular and functional changes due to cardiotoxicity was assessed in a rat model. Cardiomyopathy was induced in rats by two cumulative doses of DOX. Group I received DOX 12 [i.e., 12 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (IP)] and group II received DOX 15 (i.e., 15 mg/kg, IP) in six equal doses over two weeks. Group III as the control (Ctrl) group received normal saline as a vehicle. Mortality during the study was only observed in the DOX 15 group. The echocardiographic assessments revealed significant changes in ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and heart rate in the groups which received DOX. In addition, severe cardiac arrhythmia was evident in DOX-treated groups. Remarkable adverse effects, such as moderately degenerated cells and inflated mitochondria were observed in the TEM analysis of rat hearts in the DOX groups. The present study indicated that rat models are suitable for investigating DOX-induced cardiomyopathy, especially at the dose of 12 mg/kg. Furthermore, echocardiography and TEM examinations were found to be valuable methods for the determination of cardiotoxicity in rats due to DOX.","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",PMC8410154,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cardiomyopathy', '*Doxorubicin', '*Echocardiography', '*Electron microscopy', '*Rat heart']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020, Archives of Razi Institute.

Epub 2020 Apr 14.,"BACKGROUND: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare, untreatable neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of alpha-synuclein in oligodendroglial inclusions. As such, MSA is a synucleinopathy along with Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies. Activation of the abelson tyrosine kinase c-Abl leads to phosphorylation of alpha-synuclein at tyrosine 39, thereby promoting its aggregation and subsequent neurodegeneration. The c-Abl inhibitor nilotinib used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia based on data collected in preclinical models of PD might interfere with pathogenic mechanisms that are relevant to PD and dementia with Lewy bodies, which motivated its assessment in an open-label clinical trial in PD and dementia with Lewy bodies patients. The objective of this study was to assess the preclinical efficacy of nilotinib in the specific context of MSA. METHODS: Mice expressing human wild-type alpha-synuclein in oligodendrocytes received daily injection of nilotinib (1 or 10 mg/kg) over 12 weeks. Postmortem analysis included the assessment of c-Abl activation, alpha-synuclein burden, and dopaminergic neurodegeneration. RESULTS: alpha-Synuclein phosphorylated at tyrosine 39 was detected in glial cytoplasmic inclusions in MSA patients. Increased activation of c-Abl and alpha-synuclein phosphorylation at tyrosine 39 were found in transgenic mice. Despite significant inhibition of c-Abl and associated reduction of alpha-synuclein phosphorylation at tyrosine 39 by 40%, nilotinib failed to reduce alpha-synuclein aggregate burden (including phosphorylation at serine 129) in the striatum and cortex or to lessen neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra. CONCLUSIONS: This preclinical study suggests that partial inhibition of c-Abl and reduction of alpha-synuclein phosphorylation at tyrosine 39 may not be a relevant target for MSA.

To gain knowledge about the pathology that may contribute to disease progression and fatality, we performed postmortem needle core biopsies of lung, liver, and heart in four patients who died of COVID-19 pneumonia. The patients' ages ranged from 59 to 81, including three males and one female. Each patient had at least one underlying disease, including immunocompromised status (chronic lymphocytic leukemia and renal transplantation) or other conditions (cirrhosis, hypertension, and diabetes). Time from disease onset to death ranged from 15 to 52 days. All patients had elevated white blood cell counts, with significant rise toward the end, and all had lymphocytopenia except for the patient with leukemia. Histologically, the main findings are in the lungs, including injury to the alveolar epithelial cells, hyaline membrane formation, and hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, all components of diffuse alveolar damage. Consolidation by fibroblastic proliferation with extracellular matrix and fibrin forming clusters in airspaces is evident. In one patient, the consolidation consists of abundant intra-alveolar neutrophilic infiltration, consistent with superimposed bacterial bronchopneumonia. The liver exhibits mild lobular infiltration by small lymphocytes, and centrilobular sinusoidal dilation. Patchy necrosis is also seen. The heart shows only focal mild fibrosis and mild myocardial hypertrophy, changes likely related to the underlying conditions. In conclusion, the postmortem examinations show advanced diffuse alveolar damage, as well as superimposed bacterial pneumonia in some patients. Changes in the liver and heart are likely secondary or related to the underlying diseases.",,PMC7156231,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Major advances in cancer genetics over the past decade have revealed that the genes encoding IDHs are frequently mutated in a variety of human malignancies, including gliomas, acute myeloid leukaemia, cholangiocarcinoma, chondrosarcoma and thyroid carcinoma. A series of seminal studies further elucidated the biological impact of the IDH mutation and uncovered the potential role of IDH mutants in oncogenesis. Notably, the neomorphic activity of the IDH mutants establishes distinctive patterns in cancer metabolism, epigenetic shift and therapy resistance.

With better understanding of CLL biology, trends are shifting towards the use of targeted therapies. The objective of this article is to review the safety and efficacy of various novel agents that specifically target the dysregulated pathways, with particular attention to elderly patients. Agents like B-cell receptor (BCR) inhibitors (Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors [ibrutinib]), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors (idelalisib), spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitors (entospletinib), Bcl-2 inhibitors (venetoclax), immunomodulators (lenalidomide), and monoclonal antibodies (obinutuzumab, ofatumumab) have shown activity in CLL with a very favorable toxicity profile.

We sought to find the safety and efficacy of InO in a real-world setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicenter cohort analysis on 84 RR ALL patients who received InO outside of clinical trials was conducted to evaluate response and toxicity. RESULTS: The median (range) age of patients at InO initiation was 50 (20-87) years. Forty patients (48%) had >/= 3 therapies and 23 patients (27%) underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HCT) before InO. The median (range) number of cycles of InO provided was 2 (1-6), and cumulative dose was 3.3 (1.8-9.3) mg/m(2). Overall response rate (complete remission/complete remission with incomplete count recovery) was 63%; 44% had complete remission with minimal residual disease negativity. Twenty-three patients (27%) with response received allo-HCT. The median duration of response was 11.5 months and when censored at allo-HCT was not reached (51% in remission at 2 years). The median overall survival after InO was 11.6 months and when censored at time of allo-HCT was 13.6 months. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events observed were transaminitis (16%), hyperbilirubinemia (5%), bleeding (4%), veno-occlusive disease (2%), and hyperglycemia (2%). In multivariate analysis, allo-HCT after InO did not retain favorable significance for duration of response (hazard ratio = 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.89-1.61; P = .2) or overall survival (hazard ratio = 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-3.25; P = .85). CONCLUSION: InO was well tolerated and had significant efficacy in RR B-cell ALL patients.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', 'P93RUU11P7 (Inotuzumab Ozogamicin)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Allogeneic HCT', '*B-cell ALL', '*Ph-positive ALL', '*RR ALL', '*VOD']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: The L02 hepatocytes were cultured in vitro treated with 0-90 mumol/L Cd for 24 h, and the methylthiazolyldiphenyltetrazoliumbromide assay was used to detect the cell viability. The colony formation assay, flow cytometry, comet assay, 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, MitoTracker Red CMXRos and 10-N-nonyl-acridine-orange, mitochondrial membrane potential detection kit(JC-1) and adenosine triphosphate(ATP) assay kits and Western Blot were used to investigate cell growth and proliferation, cell apoptosis, DNA damage, ROS levels, mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial mass, ATP content and related proteins after the cells exposed to 0, 20, 40 mumol/L Cd for 24 h. The cells were pretreated with vitamin C before adding Cd exposure, and ROS levels, mitochondrial function, cell apoptosis, DNA damage and proteins were measured. RESULTS: The cell viability was significantly inhibited with the increase of Cd concentration and treatment time. The cells were treated with Cd for 24 h for further study according to the result of MTT assay. Compared with control group, the colony formation rate were 8. 23% and 6. 17% respectively in 20 and 40 mumol/L Cd treatment and the apoptosis rate were 15. 85% and 26. 26%, respectively. We also found that the B cell lymphoma/leukemia(Bcl-2) gene protein was significantly reduced, while the levels of Bcl-2 associated X protein(Bax) and cleaved cysteine aspastic acid-specific protease 3(cleaved-caspase-3) were increased in a dose-dependent manner. Cd treatment also induced DNA damage and accumulation of intracellular ROS, accompanied by a mitochondrial morphological change, significant decrease in Deltapsim, mitochondrial mass, ATP content, mitochondrial cytochrome C(cyt c) and an increase in cytoplasmic cyt c expression(P&lt;0. 05). In addition, pretreatment with antioxidant vitamin C not only significantly increased cyt c, mitochondrial mass, ATP content and mitochondrial cyt c, but also reduced the expression of cytoplasmic cyt c(P&lt;0. 05), cell apoptosis and DNA damage induced by Cd. CONCLUSION: Cd exposure could induce ROS accumulation in L02 hepatocytes, which can lead to mitochondrial damage, and ultimately lead to cell apoptosis and DNA damage.","['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['L02 hepatocytes', 'cadmium', 'cell apoptosis', 'mitochondrial damage', 'reactive oxidative species']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of mitochondrial apoptosis is tightly controlled by members of B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family proteins via protein-protein interactions. Altering the balance between anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins leads to apoptosis evasion and extended survival of malignant cells. The pro-survival BCL-2 proteins: B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (BCL-2/BCL2), myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1/MCL1) and B-cell lymphoma-extra large (BCL-XL/BCL2L1) are frequently (over)expressed in B-NHL, which plays a crucial role in lymphoma pathogenesis, disease progression, and drug resistance. The efforts to develop inhibitors of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins have been underway for several decades and molecules targeting anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins are in various stages of clinical testing. Venetoclax is a highly specific BCL-2 inhibitor, which has been approved by the US Food and Drug Agency (FDA) for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and is in advanced clinical testing in other types of B-NHL.

Epub 2020 Apr 14.,"The release of calcium ions (Ca(2+)) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and related store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) regulate maturation of normal megakaryocytes. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) provides an additional mechanism for Ca(2+) influx in megakaryocytic cells, but its role remains unclear. We created a model of NMDAR hypofunction in Meg-01 cells using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout of the GRIN1 gene, which encodes an obligate, GluN1 subunit of the NMDAR. We found that compared with unmodified Meg-01 cells, Meg-01-GRIN1 (-/-) cells underwent atypical differentiation biased toward erythropoiesis, associated with increased basal ER stress and cell death. Resting cytoplasmic Ca(2+) levels were higher in Meg-01-GRIN1 (-/-) cells, but ER Ca(2+) release and SOCE were lower after activation. Lysosome-related organelles accumulated including immature dense granules that may have contributed an alternative source of intracellular Ca(2+). Microarray analysis revealed that Meg-01-GRIN1 (-/-) cells had deregulated expression of transcripts involved in Ca(2+) metabolism, together with a shift in the pattern of hematopoietic transcription factors toward erythropoiesis. In keeping with the observed pro-cell death phenotype induced by GRIN1 deletion, memantine (NMDAR inhibitor) increased cytotoxic effects of cytarabine in unmodified Meg-01 cells. In conclusion, NMDARs comprise an integral component of the Ca(2+) regulatory network in Meg-01 cells that help balance ER stress and megakaryocytic-erythroid differentiation. We also provide the first evidence that megakaryocytic NMDARs regulate biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles, including dense granules. Our results argue that intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis may be more important for normal megakaryocytic and erythroid differentiation than currently recognized; thus, modulation may offer therapeutic opportunities.","['0 (Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",PMC7286128,,,,['Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Epub 2020 Apr 14.,"Heparanase (HPSE) is an endo-beta-D-glucuronidase that cleaves heparan sulfate and hence participates in remodeling of the extracellular matrix, leading to release of cytokines that are immobilized by binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), and consequently activating signaling pathways. This function of HPSE is correlated to its expression level that is normally very low in majority of the tissues. Exceptionally, human platelets express high level of HPSE, suggesting a unique physiological role in this cell. Using K562 cell line, we found a progressive increase of HPSE during the megakaryocytic differentiation. Analysis of a series of megakaryocytic differentiation-related heparin-binding proteins (HBPs) in the cell culture medium revealed an exclusive positive correlation between the level of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and HPSE expression. IL-6 modulated megakaryocytic differentiation through activation of STAT3. Further, we demonstrated that overexpression of HPSE potentiates megakaryocytic differentiation, whereas elimination of HPSE led to a delayed differentiation. This function of HPSE is associated with its activity, as overexpression of inactive HPSE had no effect on IL-6 production and megakaryocytic differentiation. The role of HPSE is further supported by the observation in an umbilical cord blood CD34+ cells megakaryocytic differentiation model. Our data propose a novel role for HPSE in platelets production by a HPSE/IL-6/STAT3 positive feedback loop that specifically regulates megakaryocytes maturation.","['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '9050-30-0 (Heparitin Sulfate)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (heparanase)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,"['Swedish Research Council/2018-02503', 'Swedish Cancer Foundation/CAN2018/541']",['Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Epub 2020 Apr 14.,"BACKGROUND: Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) advanced leukemias, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in myeloid blast phase (MBP), have poor outcomes. Venetoclax has shown synergism with BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in preclinical studies. However, clinical activity of venetoclax and TKI-based regimens is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on patients with Ph+ AML (n = 7) and CML-MBP (n = 9) who received venetoclax combined with TKI-based regimens at our institution. RESULTS: Median patient age was 42 years, and the median number of prior therapy cycles was 5 (range 2-8). Nine patients received decitabine-based, and 7 received intensive chemotherapy-based regimens. Ten patients (63%) received ponatinib. The overall response rate (ORR) in 15 evaluable patients was 60% (1 complete remission [CR], 6 CR with incomplete hematologic recovery [CRi], 1 morphologic leukemia-free state, and 1 partial response). The ORR was 43% in Ph+ AML and 75% in CML-MBP. The median overall survival (OS) for all patients was 3.6 months, for AML OS was 2.0 months, and for CML-MBP OS was 10.9 months. The median relapse-free survival for AML and CML-MBP was 3.6 and 3.9 months, respectively. Compared to nonresponders, patients achieving CR/CRi had higher baseline Ph+ metaphases and BCR-ABL1 PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy of venetoclax with TKI-based regimens shows encouraging activity in very heavily pretreated, advanced Ph+ leukemias, particularly CML-MBP.","['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",PMC7839068,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*BCR/ABL', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Decitabine', '*Myeloid blast phase', '*Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute myeloid leukemia', '*Ponatinib', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitors', '*Venetoclax']",['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['(c) 2020 S.

Epub 2020 Apr 11.,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death due to its early recurrence and widespread metastatic potential. Accumulating studies have reported that dysregulation of circadian rhythms-associated regulators is implicated in the recurrence and metastasis of NSCLC. Therefore, identification of metastasis-associated circadian rhythm genes is clinically necessary. Here we report that the circadian gene hepatic leukemia factor (HLF), which was dramatically reduced in early-relapsed NSCLC tissues, was significantly correlated with early progression and distant metastasis in NSCLC patients. Upregulating HLF inhibited, while silencing HLF promoted lung colonization, as well as metastasis of NSCLC cells to bone, liver and brain in vivo. Importantly, downexpression of HLF promoted anaerobic metabolism to support anchorage-independent growth of NSCLC cells under low nutritional condition by activating NF-kappaB/p65 signaling through disrupting translocation of PPARalpha and PPARgamma. Further investigations revealed that both genetic deletion and methylation contribute to downexpression of HLF in NSCLC tissues. In conclusion, our results shed light on a plausible mechanism by which HLF inhibits distant metastasis in NSCLC, suggesting that HLF may serve as a novel target for clinical intervention in NSCLC.","['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (HLF protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Circadian rhythms regulator', '*Distant metastasis', '*Hepatic leukemia factor (HLF)', '*NF-kappaB pathway', '*NSCLC', '*PPARalpha', '*PPARgamma']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2020 Apr 11.,"In spite of impressive results in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic B cell leukemia (B-ALL) with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, the clinical outcome of some hematological cancers like follicular lymphoma (FL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has not been very promising likely due to immunosuppressive networks within tumor microenvironment. Hypoxia in the microenvironment of hematological malignancies and consequently generation of adenosine molecule is appeared to be correlated with immunosuppression, tumor progression, and relapse. Herein, we hypothesized that whether pharmacological targeting of adenosine 2a receptor (A2aR) can enhance antitumor activity of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in vitro. Prior to functional assays, A2aR expression was assessed in CAR-expressing T cells. Our results showed that A2aR was not only up-regulated in the fully human anti-CD19 CAR T cells (hereafter referred to as huCAR19 T cells) but also was further overexpressed following re-stimulation with target cells. Although pharmacological inhibition of A2aR could significantly increase proliferation capacity and cytokine production of huCAR19 T cells following treatment with an adenosine analog, cytotoxic activity of huCAR19 T cells was not significantly improved. Considering A2aR overexpression in huCAR19 T cells in the tumor microenvironment, our results indicated that pharmacological targeting of A2aR could not only improve huCAR19 T cells functionality in a hostile tumor microenvironment but also could have a therapeutic advantage, and sought to assess the possibility in a pre-clinical setting.","['0 (ADORA2A protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptor, Adenosine A2A)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*A2aR', '*Adenosine', '*Chimeric antigen receptor T cells', '*Tumor microenvironment']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 European Federation of Immunological Societies.

The development of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib allows patients with CML to experience near-normal life expectancy. Specific point mutations that decrease drug binding affinity can produce TKI resistance, and second- and third-generation TKIs largely mitigate this problem. Some patients develop TKI resistance without known resistance mutations, with significant heterogeneity in the underlying mechanism, but this is relatively uncommon, with the majority of patients with chronic phase CML achieving long-term disease control. In contrast, responses to TKI treatment are short lived in advanced phases of the disease or in BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with relapse driven by both BCR-ABL1 kinase-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Additionally, the frontline CML treatment with second-generation TKIs produces deeper molecular responses, driving disease burden below the detection limit for a greater number of patients. For patients with deep molecular responses, up to half have been able to discontinue therapy. Current efforts are focused on identifying therapeutic strategies to drive deeper molecular responses, enabling more patients to attempt TKI discontinuation.","['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",PMC7722523,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL', '*CML', '*targeted therapy', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitor']","['K08 CA245224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 TR002370/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA065823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2020 May 4.,"INTRODUCTION: In several studies, the chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy tisagenlecleucel demonstrated encouraging rates of remission and lasting survival benefits in pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We assessed the cost-effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel (list price: 320 000 EUR) among these patients when compared to clofarabine monotherapy (Clo-M), clofarabine combination therapy (Clo-C), and blinatumomab (Blina) from both a healthcare and a societal perspective. We also assessed future medical and future non-medical consumption costs. METHODS: A three-state partitioned survival model was used to simulate a cohort of pediatric patients (12 years of age) through different disease states until the end of life (lifetime horizon). Relevant outcomes were life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), healthcare costs, societal costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Uncertainty was explored through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses as well as through several scenario analyzes. RESULTS: Total discounted costs for tisagenlecleucel were 552 679 EUR from a societal perspective, which was much higher than the total discounted costs from a healthcare perspective (ie, 409 563 EUR). Total discounted societal costs for the comparator regimens ranged between 160 803 EUR for Clo-M and 267 259 EUR for Blina. Highest QALYs were estimated for tisagenlecleucel (11.26), followed by Blina (2.25), Clo-C (1.70) and Clo-M (0.74). Discounted societal ICERs of tisagenlecleucel ranged between 31 682 EUR/QALY for Blina and 37 531 EUR/QALY for Clo-C and were considered cost-effective with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 80 000 EUR/QALY. None of the scenarios exceeded this threshold, and more than 98% of the iterations in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis were cost-effective. DISCUSSION: At the current price and WTP threshold, tisagenlecleucel is cost-effective from both a healthcare and a societal perspective. Nevertheless, long-term effectiveness data are needed to validate the several assumptions that were necessary for this model.","['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', 'Q6C9WHR03O (tisagenlecleucel)']",PMC7497258,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR-T', 'cost-effectiveness', 'pediatric ALL', 'tisagenlecleucel']",['Unrestricted grant/Novartis Pharma BV'],"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Epub 2019 Nov 18.,"Schiff bases are versatile organic compounds which are widely used and synthesized by condensation reaction of different amino compound with aldehydes or ketones known as imine. Schiff base ligands are considered as privileged ligands as they are simply synthesized by condensation. They show broad range of application in medicine, pharmacy, coordination chemistry, biological activities, industries, food packages, dyes, and polymer and also used as an O2 detector. Semicarbazone is an imine derivative which is derived from condensation of semicarbazide and suitable aldehyde and ketone. Imine ligand-containing transition metal complexes such as copper, zinc, and cadmium have shown to be excellent precursors for synthesis of metal or metal chalcogenide nanoparticles. In recent years, the researchers have attracted enormous attention toward Schiff bases, semicarbazones, thiosemicarbazones, and their metal complexes owing to numerous applications in pharmacology such as antiviral, antifungal, antimicrobial, antimalarial, antituberculosis, anticancer, anti-HIV, catalytic application in oxidation of organic compounds, and nanotechnology. In this review, we summarize the synthesis, structural, biological, and catalytic application of Schiff bases as well as their metal complexes.",,PMC7110249,['NOTNLM'],"['2,6-DAPBPTSC, 2,6-diacetylpyridine bis-4-phenyl-3-thiosemicarbazone', '35-DTBP, 3,5-di-tert-butylphenol', '3CLpro, 3C-like protease', 'ATNR, Amine terminated liquid natural rubber', 'ATT, 2-acetylthiophene thiosemicarbazone', 'BBPT, Biacetyl bis(4-phenyl-3-thiosemicarbazone)', 'BBTSC, Benzyloxybenzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone', 'BCG, Bacillus calmette-guerine', 'BDT, Benzyldithiosemicarbazone', 'BGPT, Bipyridyl glyoxal bis(4-phenyl-3-thiosemicarbazone)', 'BMTS, Biacetyl monothiosemicarbazone', 'Biological/biomedical activities', 'Bipy, 2,2-bipyridine', 'CT DNA, Calf thymus deoxyribonucleic acid', 'DAPY, 2,3-diamino-pyridine', 'DTBP, 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol', ""DTBQ, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4,4'-benzoquinone"", 'EAC, Enrichlish Ascitices Cells', 'HEK-293, Human Embryonic Kidney cells', 'HL-60, Human leukemia-60 cell line', 'HeLa, immortal cell lines', 'HepG2, Hepatic cellular carcinoma cells (Human liver cancer cell line)', 'IgG, Immunoglobin G', 'K B HCT-8, Human colon cancer cell line', ""M-IBDET, N-methylisatin-beta-4',4'-diethylthiosemicarbazone"", 'MCF-7, Michigan Cancer Foundation-7', 'MCF7 cells, Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (breast cancer cell line)', 'MHV, Mouse hepatitis virus', 'MLV, Moloney leukemia virus', 'MSOPD, N,N-bis(3-methylsalicylidene)-ortho-phenylenediamine', 'Metal complexes', 'NQSC, Naphthoquinone semicarbazone', 'NQTS, ortho-Naphthoquinone thiosemicarbazone', 'OLED, Organic light emitting diode', 'PAS, p-amino salicylic acid', 'PPTS, Picolinealdehyde-4-phenyl-3-thiosemicarbazone', 'Phen, 1,10-phenanthroline', 'SARS CoV, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus', 'SARS, Severe acute respiratory syndrome', 'SB-HAG, Schiff bases of hydroxyamino guanidines', 'SK-MEL-30, Human Melanoma Cell Line', 'SK-OV-3 cells, Ovarian cancer cell line', 'SSB-HAG, salicylaldehyde Schiff bases of HAG', 'Schiff base', 'Semicarbazone', 'TCIDw, Tissue culture Infective Dose', ""TTBDQ, 3,5,3',5'-tetra-tert-butyl-4,4'-diphenoquinone"", 'VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus', 'scCO2, Super-critical carbon dioxide']",,['(c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2014 Mar 1.,"Background: Since the early 1990s, three consecutive pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) trials have been performed in Austria (AML-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) 93, AML-BFM 98, and AML-BFM 2004) in close cooperation with the international BFM study center. Herein, we review the pertinent patient characteristics, therapy, and outcome data. Patients and methods: From January 1993 to April 2013, 249 children and adolescents (193 protocol patients) diagnosed with AML were enrolled in the three BFM studies. Patients were mainly treated in one of five pediatric hematology/oncology centers distributed over Austria. Results: Many characteristics and outcome parameters were not statistically different between the three trials. Almost similar proportions of patients were stratified into two risk groups: standard risk (SR) (approximately 37 % overall) and high-risk (HR) (61 %). MLL rearrangements were found in 23 % of patients overall as the most frequent genetic aberration subtype. Complete remission (CR) was achieved by 84-95 % of patients. The most important type of event was leukemic relapse (5-year cumulative incidence 40 +/- 8 %, 21 +/- 5 %, and 39 +/- 6 %; p = 0.058), with a trend to a higher rate specifically in SR patients of study AML-BFM 2004 compared with AML-BFM 98. Importantly, the frequency of death from causes other than relapse sequelae declined over the years (AML-BFM 93: 5/42 12 %, AML-BFM 98: 5/57 9 %, and AML-BFM 2004: 5/94 5 %). Altogether, event-free survival at 5 years varied insignificantly (48 +/- 8 %, 61 +/- 7 %, and 50 +/- 6 %; p = 0.406). Nevertheless, survival (pSU) apparently improved from BFM 93 to subsequent studies, both overall (57 +/- 8 %, 75 +/- 6 %, and 62 +/- 6 %; p = 0.046) and regarding the HR group (5-year-probability of survival (pSU) 40 +/- 10 %, 66 +/- 8 %, and 52 +/- 8 %; p = 0.039). Conclusion: Treatment of pediatric AML in Austria renders survival rates in the range of international best practice. However, unambiguous statistical comparison of treatment periods is eventually hampered by small numbers and inequalities of recruitment. Hence, only internationally collaborative trials will allow developing treatment further to achieve higher cure rates with fewer events.",,PMC7102234,['NOTNLM'],"['Austria', 'BFM', 'MLL', 'Outcome', 'Pediatric AML', 'Prognosis']",,['(c) Springer-Verlag Wien 2014.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TLR10, the only remaining orphan receptor with an unknown ligand, has been poorly studied in tumors, and its functional and clinical relevance are unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyzed TLR10 expression data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) by established computational approaches (UALCAN, GEPIA, CGGA, and TIMER) and confirmed them by immunohistochemistry analysis. RESULTS Bioinformatics analysis showed that TLR10 was most highly expressed in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBC), acute myeloid leukemia (LAML), and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients. A data-mining study also revealed that TLR10 levels were positively correlated with WHO grade in glioma, and patients with high TLR10 levels showed shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) times than patients with low TLR10 levels. TISIDB and TIMER data showed that TLR10 expression was significantly positively correlated with immune infiltrates, especially infiltrating levels of B cells. Importantly, immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that TLR10 expression was a potential biomarker for distinguishing CNS-DLBC (also known as primary central nervous system lymphoma, PCNSL) from GBM. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, these results suggest that TLR10 could serve as a promising theranostic target for patients with glioma and is a potential biomarker for distinguishing PCNSL from GBM.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (TLR10 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 10)']",PMC7174897,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2021 Mar 1.,"Analysis and design of steady states representing cell types, such as cell death or unregulated growth, are of significant interest in modeling genetic regulatory networks. In this article, the steady-state design of large-dimensional Boolean networks (BNs) is studied via model reduction and pinning control. Compared with existing literature, the pinning control design in this article is based on the original node's connection, but not on the state-transition matrix of BNs. Hence, the computational complexity is dramatically reduced in this article from O(2(n)x2(n)) to O(2x2(r)) , where n is the number of nodes in the large-dimensional BN and is the largest number of in-neighbors of the reduced BN. Finally, the proposed method is well demonstrated by a T-LGL survival signaling network with 18 nodes and a model of survival signaling in large granular lymphocyte leukemia with 29 nodes. Just as shown in the simulations, the model reduction method reduces 99.98% redundant states for the network with 18 nodes, and 99.99% redundant states for the network with 29 nodes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 14.,"PURPOSE: Patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia who experience relapse after or are resistant to CD19-targeted immunotherapies have limited treatment options. Targeting CD22, an alternative B-cell antigen, represents an alternate strategy. We report outcomes on the largest patient cohort treated with CD22 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a single-center, phase I, 3 + 3 dose-escalation trial with a large expansion cohort that tested CD22-targeted CAR T cells for children and young adults with relapsed/refractory CD22(+) malignancies. Primary objectives were to assess the safety, toxicity, and feasibility. Secondary objectives included efficacy, CD22 CAR T-cell persistence, and cytokine profiling. RESULTS: Fifty-eight participants were infused; 51 (87.9%) after prior CD19-targeted therapy. Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 50 participants (86.2%) and was grade 1-2 in 45 (90%). Symptoms of neurotoxicity were minimal and transient. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like manifestations were seen in 19/58 (32.8%) of subjects, prompting utilization of anakinra. CD4/CD8 T-cell selection of the apheresis product improved CAR T-cell manufacturing feasibility as well as heightened inflammatory toxicities, leading to dose de-escalation. The complete remission rate was 70%. The median overall survival was 13.4 months (95% CI, 7.7 to 20.3 months). Among those who achieved a complete response, the median relapse-free survival was 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.1 to 6.5 months). Thirteen participants proceeded to stem-cell transplantation. CONCLUSION: In the largest experience of CD22 CAR T-cells to our knowledge, we provide novel information on the impact of manufacturing changes on clinical outcomes and report on unique CD22 CAR T-cell toxicities and toxicity mitigation strategies.

STAT3 has emerged as a potential target in resistant AML, but inhibiting STAT3 function has proven challenging. This paper describes synthetic studies and biological assays for a naphthalene sulfonamide inhibitor class of molecules that inhibit G-CSF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in cellulo and induce apoptosis in AML cells. We describe two different approaches to inhibitor design: first, variation of substituents on the naphthalene sulfonamide core allows improvements in anti-STAT activity and creates a more thorough understanding of anti-STAT SAR. Second, a novel approach involving hybrid sulfonamide-rhodium(ii) conjugates tests our ability to use cooperative organic-inorganic binding for drug development, and to use SAR studies to inform metal conjugate design. Both approaches have produced compounds with improved binding potency. In vivo and in cellulo experiments further demonstrate that these approaches can also lead to improved activity in living cells, and that compound 3aa slows disease progression in a xenograft model of AML.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '2166IN72UN (naphthalene)']",PMC7286531,,,"['F31 CA180696/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA170625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS1587916'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 14.,"We aimed to evaluate the determinants of survival in myelofibrosis patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) and to describe factors predicting the main post-HCT complications. This retrospective study by the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation included 2916 myelofibrosis patients who underwent first allo-HCT from an HLA-identical sibling or unrelated donor between 2000 and 2016. After a median follow-up of 4.7 years from transplant, projected median survival of the series was 5.3 years. Factors independently associated with increased mortality were age >/= 60 years and Karnofsky Performance Status <90% at transplant, and occurrence of graft failure, grades III-IV acute graft-vs.-host disease (aGVHD), and disease progression/relapse during follow-up. The opposing effects of chronic graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) on non-relapse mortality and relapse incidence resulted in a neutral influence on survival. Graft failure increased in unrelated donor recipients and decreased with myeloablative conditioning (MAC) and negative donor/recipient cytomegalovirus serostatus. Risk of grades III-IV aGVHD was higher with unrelated donors and decreased with MAC. Relapse incidence tended to be higher in patients with intermediate-2/high-risk DIPSS categories and to decrease in CALR-mutated patients. Acute and chronic GVHD reduced the subsequent risk of relapse. This information has potential implications for patient counseling and clinical decision-making.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 14.,"SERIES EDITORS' NOTE: The beauty of science is that all the important things are unpredictable. Freeman Dyson In the typescript which follows, Moodie and Krakow tackle the topical issue of precision medicine and statistical methods for estimating adaptive treatment strategies. This may be the most difficult typescript in our series so far for non-statisticians to understand. It even has equations! But please bear with the authors and give it a chance. One needs not to understand the equations to get the thrust of the strategy.Precision medicine as we discuss elsewhere, is misnamed. In statistics and mathematics precision refers to getting the same answer again and again. It does not mean getting the correct answer, the term for which is accuracy, not precision. However, precision is the current buzz word so there's no point trying to get this straight. When we think about precision we need to consider two elements, reproducibility and replicability. Reproducibility means you give me your data and computer code and I come to the same conclusion you did. Replicability is another matter. I try to replicate your experiment and hopefully reach the same conclusion. In medicine, replicability is obviously more important than reproducibility but things which cannot be reproduced are unlikely to be replicated.As the authors discuss, one can think about precision medicine as one does a family vacation. A best vacation depends on several co-variates: where you live, your prior travel experiences, advice from family and friends, online reviews, Wikitravel, cost, your travel budget, if you have kids and many other co-variates. Consequently, there is unlikely to be a best vacation for everyone. Yours might be a week at the Ritz Carlton Cancun with dinner at Careyes and ours, a week at the Pfister Hotel in Milwaukee with dinner at Mader's German Restaurant (bring simvastatin). Similarly, it is unlikely there is a best therapy of acute myeloid leukemia, a best donor, a best conditioning regimen, a best posttransplant immune suppressive regimen etc. and certainly no best combination of these co-variates for your patient.The question Moodie and Krakow tackle is how we can determine the best therapy or combination of therapies for someone receiving a haematopoietic cell transplant. Although the default answer is typically: randomized clinical trials are the gold standard, these inform us of the outcome of a cohort of subjects, not individuals. In many instances, although a new therapy may be shown to be better than an old one in a controlled randomized trial the benefit is not uniformly distributed. Some subjects in the experimental cohort may do worse with the new therapy compared with controls, others better. The question is who are the winners and losers? We cannot do a controlled randomized trial of one person. Moodie and Krakow discuss statistical tools to help us sort this out.Again, please do not be put off by the equations; forgetaboutit. The overriding message is not so complex, and important. We are always standing by on twitter @BMTStats to help. But don't confuse us with Match.com.

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) has been identified as an oncogene in various malignancies including AML. However, the role and mechanisms of UCA1 in AML tumorigenesis were incompletely understood. Hence, this study aims to investigate whether UCA1 regulates AML progression by miR-296-3p/Myc axis. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to analyze the interaction between miR-296-3p and UCA1 or Myc. The results showed that UCA1 knockdown inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in AML cells (U937 and HL60). Mechanistically, UCA1 acted as a sponge of miR-296-3p by binding to miR-296-3p. Myc, a target of miR-296-3p, was positively regulated by UCA1. Functional assay showed that the anti-AML effect of UCA1 knockdown could be abrogated by miR-296-3p inhibition and Myc overexpression. Moreover, UCA1 knockdown inhibited AML cell tumorigenesis in vivo, which was associated with regulation of miR-296-3p and Myc expression. In conclusion, UCA1 modulates AML progression by regulating miR-296-3p/Myc axis.","['0 (MIRN296 microRNA, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (UCA1 RNA, human)']",PMC7469675,['NOTNLM'],"['*Myc', '*Urothelial carcinoma-associated 1', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*miR-296-3p']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 14.,"Introduction: Isolated myeloid sarcoma (MS) is characterized by extramedullary immature myeloid cell infiltration without bone marrow involvement. The diagnosis of isolated MS is sometimes difficult in cases without expression of typical immunohistochemical markers, such as CD64, MPO or lysozyme.Clinical presentation: We report a case of isolated MS involving the mediastinum, with negative staining of MPO and lysozyme, which was misdiagnosed for 20 months. A comprehensive analysis in our institution showed MS with a characteristic staining pattern positive for CD34, CD117 and CD33, but negative for MPO, lysozyme, CD3 and CD79a. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) targeting 112 acute myeloid leukemia (AML)- and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)-associated genes confirmed the existence of an ASXL1 p.R693X mutation with a frequency of 13.17% of total cells. The patient acquired sustainable remission under the alternative treatment of intermediate-dose cytarabine and decitabine.Discussion and conclusion: The ASXL1 p.R693X mutation, a truncated mutation, has been widely reported to be associated with poor prognosis in myeloid malignance. We report the role of this mutation and recommend the utilization of NGS to discover more profound pathobiological information with limited samples, facilitate the diagnosis, and further clarify the uncertainties of prognosis and treatment in more isolated MS patients.","['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*ASXL1 mutation', '*decitabine', '*isolated myeloid sarcoma', '*mediastinum', '*next generation sequencing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 13.,"PURPOSE: To assess the impact of maintenance therapy and the additional impact of dexamethasone treatment on cancer-related fatigue and sleep-wake rhythms in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients and to determine the association between these outcomes. METHODS: A national cohort of pediatric ALL patients (>/= 2 years) was included (+/- 1 year post-diagnosis). Patients receiving dexamethasone were assessed twice (assessment with and without dexamethasone). Actigraphy assessments were used to calculate sleep-wake outcomes with nonparametric methods. Cancer-related fatigue was assessed with the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale. Sleep-wake rhythms and cancer-related fatigue were compared between patients participating in the assessment without dexamethasone and healthy children (linear regression) and between assessments with and without dexamethasone (mixed models). Using linear regression, associations between sleep-wake outcomes and cancer-related fatigue were determined during assessments with and without dexamethasone. RESULTS: Responses were collected for 125 patients (113 assessments with and 81 without dexamethasone). The sleep-wake rhythm was less stable (p = 0.03) and less robust (p = 0.01), with lower physical activity levels (p < 0.001) and higher cancer-related fatigue levels (p < 0.001) in ALL patients compared to healthy children. Physical activity was lower (p = 0.001) and cancer-related fatigue more severe (p </= 0.001) during assessments with dexamethasone compared to without dexamethasone. Sleep-wake outcomes were significantly associated with cancer-related fatigue during periods without dexamethasone, but not during periods with dexamethasone. CONCLUSION: Sleep-wake rhythms are disturbed, physical activity levels lower, and cancer-related fatigue levels higher during maintenance therapy.

All patients received oral cedazuridine/decitabine in subsequent cycles. Cedazuridine and decitabine were given initially as separate capsules in a dose-confirmation stage and then as a single fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet. Primary end points: mean decitabine systemic exposure (geometric least-squares mean [LSM]) of oral/IV 5-day area under curve from time 0 to last measurable concentration (AUClast), percentage long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) DNA demethylation for oral cedazuridine/decitabine vs IV decitabine, and clinical response. Eighty patients were randomized and treated. Oral/IV ratios of geometric LSM 5-day AUClast (80% confidence interval) were 93.5% (82.1-106.5) and 97.6% (80.5-118.3) for the dose-confirmation and FDC stages, respectively.

Pericytes preserve vascular homeostasis. To our knowledge, the potential roles of microRNAs in sepsis-induced pericyte dysfunction have not been explored. METHODS: We determined lung pericyte expression of miR-145a in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis. Mouse lung pericytes were isolated and transfected with a miR-145a mimic, followed by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We measured inflammatory cytokine levels. To assess the functions of miR-145a in vivo, we generated a pericyte-specific miR-145a-knockout mouse and determined sepsis-induced organ injury, lung and renal vascular leakage, and mouse survival rates. We used RNA sequencing and Western blotting to analyze the signaling pathways regulated by miR-145a. RESULTS: CLP led to decreased miR-145a expression in lung pericytes. The miR-145a mimic inhibited LPS-induced increases in cytokines. In CLP-induced sepsis, pericytes lacking miR-145a exhibited increased lung and kidney vascular leakage and reduced survival rates. We found that miR-145a could suppress LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation. In addition, we confirmed that the transcription factor Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (Fli-1) is a target of miR-145a and that Fli-1 activates NF-kappaB signaling. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that pericyte miR-145a mediates sepsis-associated microvascular dysfunction, potentially by means of Fli-1-mediated modulation of NF-kappaB signaling.","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (MIRN145 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",PMC7430167,['NOTNLM'],"['*Fli-1', '*NF-kappaB', '*miR-145a', '*pericytes', '*sepsis']","['R01 GM130653/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM113995/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 HL135263/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'TL1 TR001451/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001450/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), pharmacological doses of retinoic acid (RA) induce differentiation of APL cells, triggering degradation of the PML-RAR oncogene. APL cells are resistant to LSD1 inhibition or knockout, but targeting LSD1 sensitizes them to physiological doses of RA without altering of PML-RAR levels, and extends survival of leukemic mice upon RA treatment. The combination of RA with LSD1 inhibition (or knockout) is also effective in other non-APL, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Nonenzymatic activities of LSD1 are essential to block differentiation, while RA with targeting of LSD1 releases a differentiation gene expression program, not strictly dependent on changes in histone H3K4 methylation. Integration of proteomic/epigenomic/mutational studies showed that LSD1 inhibitors alter the recruitment of LSD1-containing complexes to chromatin, inhibiting the interaction between LSD1 and the transcription factor GFI1.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PML-RARa bcr1 fusion protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (KDM1A protein, human)']",PMC7141832,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

Heat shock proteins (HSPs) provide protein signatures/biomarkers for GBM that afford potential as targets for developing anti-GBM drugs. In GBM, elevated expression of hypoxia inducible factors under the influence of Ets family proteins significantly promotes the expression of HSPs. RNAseq analysis identified HSPB1 as a prominent upregulated HSP in GBM and in radiation resistant/temozolomide resistant (radio/TMZR) GBM. Here, we established friend leukemia integration 1 (Fli-1), a member of Ets family to be playing a transcriptional regulatory role on the HSPB1 gene. Fli-1 binds to nucleotide residues GGAA at binding sites 3, 6 and 7 in the 5-kb upstream region of HSPB1. Fli-1 has been linked to oncogenic transformation with upregulation in radio/TMZR GBM. Overexpression of Fli-1 in GBM promotes resistance, whereas Fli-1 knockdown in radio/TMZR GBM cells suppresses resistance. We identify the underlying molecular mechanisms of Fli-1-mediated regulation of HSPB1 that drive extracellular matrix remodeling and epithelial to mesenchymal transition in radio/TMZR GBM cells.

The autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A or down-regulation of the key autophagy genes Atg5 and Atg7 reversed the FLT3 degradation induced by ATO.

Epub 2020 Apr 13.,"Bats are reservoirs of emerging viruses that are highly pathogenic to other mammals, including humans. Despite the diversity and abundance of bat viruses, to date they have not been shown to harbor exogenous retroviruses. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a group of koala retrovirus-related (KoRV-related) gammaretroviruses in Australian and Asian bats. These include the Hervey pteropid gammaretrovirus (HPG), identified in the scat of the Australian black flying fox (Pteropus alecto), which is the first reproduction-competent retrovirus found in bats. HPG is a close relative of KoRV and the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV), with virion morphology and Mn(2+)-dependent virion-associated reverse transcriptase activity typical of a gammaretrovirus. In vitro, HPG is capable of infecting bat and human cells, but not mouse cells, and displays a similar pattern of cell tropism as KoRV-A and GALV. Population studies reveal the presence of HPG and KoRV-related sequences in several locations across northeast Australia, as well as serologic evidence for HPG in multiple pteropid bat species, while phylogenetic analysis places these bat viruses as the basal group within the KoRV-related retroviruses. Taken together, these results reveal bats to be important reservoirs of exogenous KoRV-related gammaretroviruses.",,PMC7196810,['NOTNLM'],"['*GALV', '*KoRV', '*bats', '*retroviruses', '*viruses']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 the Author(s).

Exposure to CDs may occur during drug preparation and mixing, during drug administration, during transport, and cleaning spills and waste disposal. Healthcare workers who prepare or administer antineoplastic drugs, or who work in areas where these drugs are used, can be exposed to these agents. This also affects the public around the exposed area if appropriate disposal system is not known. Several studies reported increased risks of leukemia and breast cancer among nurses handling CDs and not following safety guidelines. Because of the absence of studies in Ethiopia, the current study was conducted to determine the knowledge level of cytotoxic drug handling and associated factors among health professionals in the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. METHODS: The institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted from June to August 2019. Epi info 7.1 was used for data entry and then exported into SPSS version 20 for computing, recording, and statistical analysis. Logistic regression was used to explain the relationship with independent variables. RESULTS: Four hundred and twelve health professionals participated in the study with 53.4% males. The participants' mean age was 29.9 (+/- 5.43) years ranging from 20-60. Two hundred and twenty-three (54.1%) health professionals heard about cytotoxic drugs, and 52.7% (95% UI 47.8-57.8%) had good knowledge of cytotoxic drug handling. Being male sex (AOR = 1.84, 95% CI (1.13-3.00)), age of 29-31 (AOR = 1.99, 95% CI (1.03-3.84)), hearing information about cytotoxic drug handling (AOR = 2.53, 95% CI (1.43-4.47)), ever attended training on cytotoxic drug handling (AOR = 3.15, 95% CI (1.13-8.79)), ever taking courses related to cytotoxic drugs (AOR = 2.03, 95% CI (1.15-3.59)), and good practice (AOR = 3.24, 95% CI (1.95-5.37)) were significantly associated with knowledge towards cytotoxic drug handling. It is therefore imperative to train health professionals and to incorporate CDs handling related course contents while revising curricula to raise the knowledge of health professionals about proper cytotoxic drug handling. CONCLUSION: Above half of the study participants scored higher than the median of the cytotoxic drug handling knowledge questions. Sex, age, information about cytotoxic drug handling, training, taking courses related to cytotoxic drugs, and good practice were significantly associated with knowledge towards cytotoxic drugs handling.",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],PMC7155262,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytotoxic drugs', 'Health professional', 'Knowledge']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 8.,"Petrochemical complexes and oil refineries are well known sources of a wide range of environmental pollutants. Consequently, the potential harmful health effects of living near these facilities is a topic of concern among the population living in the neighborhood. Anyhow, the number of studies carried out on this issue is rather limited and, in some cases, results are even slightly contradictory. The present Review was aimed at assessing whether living in the vicinity of petrochemical industries and oil refineries is associated with a higher incidence of cancer and cancer mortality. In this sense, up to 23 investigations were found in PubMed and Scopus databases. According to the type of cancer, leukemia and other hematological malignancies were reported as the main types of cancer for populations living in the neighborhood of petrochemical industries. This was concluded based on studies performed in Taiwan, Spain, United Kingdom, Italy and Nigeria. In contrast, no association was found in 4 different investigations conducted in Sweden, Finland and USA with the same purpose. Other scientific studies reported a high incidence of lung and bladder cancer in Taiwan, Italy and USA, as well as an excess mortality of bone, brain, liver, pleural, larynx and pancreas cancers in individuals living near petrochemical complexes from Taiwan, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom and USA. Thus, human exposure to certain carcinogenic pollutants emitted from petrochemical industries might increase the incidence of some cancers and cancer mortality. Anyway, since the limited number of investigations conducted until now, further studies are required in order to corroborate -in a more generalized way-this conclusion.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Air', '*Cancer', '*Chemical pollutants', '*Human exposure', '*Petrochemical industries']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2020 Apr 10.,"HTLV-1, the first human oncogenic retrovirus, is a type C retrovirus that belongs to the Deltaretrovirus genus. The HTLV-1 genome has 8.5 kbp length, and consists of major genes such as gag, pol, pro, env, and pX region. This retrovirus is considered as one of the most deadly infectious agent for peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The infection of HTLV-1 can lead to dangerous complications, such as infective dermatitis (ID), uveitis, arthritis, lymphadenitis, arthropathies, Sjogren's Syndrome (SS), and particularly HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) or Adult T-Cell Leukemia Lymphoma (ATLL). At the moment, Zidovudine (AZT) plus IFN-alpha is the only treatment available for HTLV-1 infections. Based on scientific studies, alongside the therapeutic regimens, intrinsic mechanisms also play a determinant role in reducing the signs of disease. Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) signaling pathway, one of the most important checkpoints, has recently received interest, such as the development of a novel generation of anti-tumors. In the present study, we discuss the role of PD-1 signaling pathway in HTLV-1 infection as well as its application as a novel approach for treatment of HTLV-1 infections.","['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD223 antigen)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (HAVCR2 protein, human)', '0 (Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (TIGIT protein, human)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['HTLV-1', 'IFN-gamma', 'Leukemia', 'PD-1 receptor', 'Zidovudine']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2020 Apr 10.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant barriers to timely donor evaluation, cell collection, and graft transport for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT). To ensure availability of donor cells on the scheduled date of infusion, many sites now collect cryopreserved grafts before the start of pretransplantation conditioning. Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (ptCY) is an increasingly used approach for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, but the impact of graft cryopreservation on the outcomes of allo-HCT using ptCY is not known. Using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database, we compared the outcomes of HCT using cryopreserved versus fresh grafts in patients undergoing HCT for hematologic malignancy with ptCY. We analyzed 274 patients with hematologic malignancy undergoing allo-HCT between 2013 and 2018 with cryopreserved grafts and ptCY. Eighteen patients received bone marrow grafts and 256 received peripheral blood stem cell grafts. These patients were matched for age, graft type, disease risk index (DRI), and propensity score with 1080 patients who underwent allo-HCT with fresh grafts. The propensity score, which is an assessment of the likelihood of receiving a fresh graft versus a cryopreserved graft, was calculated using logistic regression to account for the following: disease histology, Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), HCT Comorbidity Index, conditioning regimen intensity, donor type, and recipient race. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse/progression and disease-free survival (DFS). Because of multiple comparisons, only P values <.01 were considered statistically significant. The 2 cohorts (cryopreserved and fresh) were similar in terms of patient age, KPS, diagnosis, DRI, HCT-CI, donor/graft source, and conditioning intensity. One-year probabilities of OS were 71.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 68.3% to 73.8%) with fresh grafts and 70.3% (95% CI, 64.6% to 75.7%) with cryopreserved grafts (P = .81). Corresponding probabilities of OS at 2 years were 60.6% (95% CI, 57.3% to 63.8%) and 58.7% (95% CI, 51.9% to 65.4%) (P = .62). In matched-pair regression analysis, graft cryopreservation was not associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] for cryopreserved versus fresh, 1.05; 95% CI, .86 to 1.29; P = .60). Similarly, rates of neutrophil recovery (HR, .91; 95% CI, .80 to 1.02; P = .12), platelet recovery (HR, .88; 95% CI, .78 to 1.00; P = .05), grade III-IV acute GVHD (HR, .78; 95% CI, .50 to 1.22; P = .27), NRM (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, .86 to 1.55; P = .32) and relapse/progression (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, .97 to 1.50; P = .09) were similar with cryopreserved grafts versus fresh grafts. There were somewhat lower rates of chronic GVHD (HR, 78; 95% CI, .61 to .99; P = .04) and DFS (HR for treatment failure, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.29; P = .04) with graft cryopreservation that were of marginal statistical significance after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Overall, our data indicate that graft cryopreservation does not significantly delay hematopoietic recovery, increase the risk of acute GVHD or NRM, or decrease OS after allo-HCT using ptCY.",['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],PMC7194895,['NOTNLM'],"['*Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*COVID-19', '*Cryopreservation', '*ptCY']","['U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2020 Apr 10.,"All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is an anti-cancer differentiation therapy agent effective for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) but not acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in general. Using the HL-60 human non-APL AML model where ATRA causes nuclear enrichment of c-Raf that drives differentiation and G1/G0 cell cycle arrest, we now observe that c-Raf in the nucleus showed novel interactions with several prominent regulators of the cell cycle and cell differentiation. One is cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2). ATRA treatment caused c-Raf to dissociate from Cdk2. This was associated with enhanced binding of Cdk2 with retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha). Consistent with this novel Raf/CDK2/RARalpha axis contributing to differentiation, CD38 expression per cell, which is transcriptionally regulated by a retinoic acid response element (RARE), is enhanced. The RB tumor suppressor, a fundamental regulator of G1 cell cycle progression or arrest, was also targeted by c-Raf in the nucleus. RB and specifically the S608 phosphorylated form (pS608RB) complexed with c-Raf. ATRA treatment induced S608RB-hypophosphorylation associated with G1/G0 cell cycle arrest and release of c-Raf from RB. We also found that nuclear c-Raf interacted with SMARCD1, a pioneering component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. ATRA treatment diminished the amount of this protein bound to c-Raf.

Although detailed information on many aspects of these cell models is available, comprehensive proteomic data are lacking. This is a critical knowledge gap, as proteins are effectors of most biologic processes. To address this critical unmet need, proteomes of the murine cell lines Friend erythroleukemia (MEL), GATA1 erythroid (G1ER), and embryonic stem cell-derived erythroid progenitor (MEDEP) and proteomes of cultured murine marrow-derived erythroblasts at different stages of terminal erythroid differentiation were analyzed. The proteomes of MEDEP cells and primary murine erythroid cells were most similar, whereas those of MEL and G1ER cells were more distantly related. We demonstrated that the overall cellular content of histones does not decrease during terminal differentiation, despite strong chromatin condensation. Comparison of murine and human proteomes throughout terminal erythroid differentiation revealed that many noted transcriptomic changes were significantly dampened at the proteome level, especially at the end of the terminal differentiation process. Analysis of the early events associated with induction of terminal differentiation in MEDEP cells revealed divergent alterations in associated transcriptomes and proteomes. These proteomic data are powerful and valuable tools for the study of fundamental mechanisms of normal and disordered erythropoiesis and will be of broad interest to a wide range of investigators for making the appropriate choice of various cell lines to study inherited and acquired diseases of the erythrocyte.",,PMC7160260,,,"['P01 DK032094/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001863/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Small-molecule inhibition of FLT3 represents an attractive therapeutic strategy for this subtype of AML, although resistance from secondary FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD) mutations is an emerging clinical problem. CCT241736 is an orally bioavailable, selective, and potent dual inhibitor of FLT3 and Aurora kinases. FLT3-ITD+ cells with secondary FLT3-TKD mutations have high in vitro relative resistance to the FLT3 inhibitors quizartinib and sorafenib, but not to CCT241736. The mechanism of action of CCT241736 results in significant in vivo efficacy, with inhibition of tumor growth observed in efficacy studies in FLT3-ITD and FLT3-ITD-TKD human tumor xenograft models. The efficacy of CCT241736 was also confirmed in primary samples from AML patients, including those with quizartinib-resistant disease, which induces apoptosis through inhibition of both FLT3 and Aurora kinases. The unique combination of CCT241736 properties based on robust potency, dual selectivity, and significant in vivo activity indicate that CCT241736 is a bona fide clinical drug candidate for FLT3-ITD and TKD AML patients with resistance to current drugs.","['0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)']",PMC7160287,,,"['C309/A8274/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'C309/A11566/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'C1178/A10294/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, there are no international consensus guidelines regarding the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis for OIs, and in particular PJP, in CLL patients treated with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi's). We evaluated the frequency of PJP in CLL patients at our institution who were treated with BTKi's, and assessed the impact of prophylaxis on reducing the risk of PJP. We identified 217 patients treated with BTKi's, consisting of 3 cohorts: 143 patients on either BTKi monotherapy with ibrutinib or acalabrutinib, 17 patients receiving ibrutinib combination therapy with umbralisib as part of a clinical trial, and 57 patients receiving ibrutinib in combination with standard chemotherapy, also as part of a clinical trial. Forty-one percent of patients on BTKi monotherapy received prophylaxis, which was given at the discretion of the treating physician. The prevalence of PJP in all patients not on prophylaxis was 3.4% (3 of 87), and, specifically in BTKi-monotherapy patients not on prophylaxis, the PJP prevalence was 2.4% (2 of 85). PJP prophylaxis was effective, as there were no cases of PJP in patients on prophylaxis (0 of 130). The relatively low prevalence of PJP in our study population suggests that routine prophylaxis may not be indicated in CLL patients on BTKi therapy.",['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],PMC7160295,,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 13.,"On June 28, 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Vyxeos, intended for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Vyxeos was designated as an orphan medicinal product on January 11, 2012. The applicant for this medicinal product was Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited. Vyxeos is a liposomal formulation of a fixed combination of daunorubicin and cytarabine, antineoplastic agents that inhibit topoisomerase II activity and also cause DNA damage. The strength of Vyxeos is 5 units/mL, where 1 unit equals 1.0 mg cytarabine plus 0.44 mg daunorubicin. The marketing authorization holder Jazz Pharmaceuticals had found that this was an optimal ratio for the efficacy of the product. Study CLTR0310-301, a phase III, multicenter, randomized, trial of Vyxeos (daunorubicin-cytarabine) liposome injection versus standard 3+7 daunorubicin and cytarabine in patients aged 60-75 years with untreated high-risk (secondary) AML, showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups in overall survival (OS) with a median OS of 9.56 months in the daunorubicin-cytarabine arm compared with 5.95 months for standard chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.90; one-sided p = .003). The most common side effects were hypersensitivity including rash, febrile neutropenia, edema, diarrhea/colitis, mucositis, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, cough, headache, chills, arrhythmia, pyrexia, sleep disorders, and hypotension. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Vyxeos has demonstrated a clinically significant improvement in overall survival compared with the standard of care 7+3 in the proposed population of patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with myelodysplasia-related changes and therapy-related AML. This is remarkable given the very poor prognosis of these patients and their unmet medical need. Secondary endpoints support the primary outcome, in particular an increased rate of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which is potentially the only curative treatment in AML.","['0 (CPX-351)', '0 (Liposomes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",PMC7485353,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes', '*European Medicines Agency', '*Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia', '*Vyxeos (cytarabine and daunorubicin)']",,['(c) AlphaMed Press 2020.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found significant downmodulation of CD10, CD38, CD58, CD81 and upmodulation of CD19, CD45 in leukemic cells. Downmodulation of CD34 was observed but was not statistically significant. Expression of CD20 and CD22 remained stable in most of the cases. MRD-positive cases showed loss of diagnostic LAIP and some showed gain of new LAIP compared to baseline.

Epub 2020 Apr 13.,"BACKGROUND: In the United States, the incidence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has steadily increased over the last decade; in 2019, it was estimated that AML would affect 21,450 new patients and lead to 10,920 deaths. Detailed real-world cost estimates and comparisons of key AML treatment episodes, such as in high-intensity chemotherapy (HIC), low-intensity chemotherapy (LIC), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and relapsed/refractory (R/R), are scarce in the commercially insured U.S. POPULATION: OBJECTIVE: To examine health resource utilization (HRU), clinical burden, and direct health care costs across various AML treatment episodes in a large sample of commercially insured U.S. PATIENTS: METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted. Patients with newly diagnosed AML were followed to identify the key active treatment episodes across the course of their disease. Data were obtained from 2 sources: IQVIA's Real-World Data (RWD) Adjudicated Claims Database - U.S. (formerly known as PharMetrics Plus), which comprises adjudicated claims for more than 150 million unique enrollees across the United States, and IQVIA Charge Detail Master Hospital Database, which has detailed data regarding services received in an inpatient setting. Calculation of all-cause HRU was based on physician office visits, nonphysician office visits, emergency department visits, inpatient visits, and outpatient pharmacy utilization. Calculation of all-cause health care costs was based on total allowed costs and reported by the following cost components: physician office visits, nonphysician office visits, emergency department visits, inpatient visits, and outpatient pharmacy utilization. Symptom and toxicity events were estimated via proxies such as diagnosis codes, procedures, and treatments administered. RESULTS: The final study sample consisted of 1,542 HIC-induction (HIC-I), 591 HIC-consolidation (HIC-C), 628 LIC, 1,000 patients with HSCT, and 707 patients with R/R AML. Total mean episode costs were highest in R/R episodes ($439,104), followed by HSCT ($329,621), HIC-I ($198,657), HIC-C ($73,428), and LIC ($53,081) episodes. Across all treatment episodes, hospitalization was the largest contributor to cost with mean hospitalization costs ranging from $308,978 in the R/R setting to $49,580 for patients receiving LIC; of these, costs related to intensive care unit admission were a noteworthy contributor. In patients with R/R AML and HSCT, expenditures related to pharmacy utilization averaged $24,640 and $12,203, respectively, and expenditures related to physician office visits averaged $10,926 and $6,090, respectively; these expenditures were much lower across other episodes. Across all categories of symptom and toxicity events, cardiovascular events was the only category of event that was a significant predictor of higher cost across all episodes. Symptom and toxicity events commonly associated with AML were associated with significantly increased costs, especially in R/R episodes. CONCLUSIONS: This resource utilization and direct health care cost analysis highlights the substantial economic burden associated with key AML treatment episodes in the United States, specifically during HIC-I, HSCT, and R/R episodes.

This study was to describe the temporal trend in the survival of lymphoma in an academic center in China. METHODS: A total of 3840 consecutive patients with lymphoma diagnosed between 1996 and 2015 were reviewed. Eighty patients were excluded, and finally, 3760 patients were analyzed in this study. The cohort was divided into four groups according to calendar periods at diagnosis: 1996-2000, 2001-2005, 2006-2010, and 2010-2015. The overall survival (OS) rates among the four groups were compared. RESULTS: The 5- and 10-year OS for the whole cohort were 62% and 52%, respectively. The 5-year OS of patient with classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), mature B-cell lymphoma (BCL), and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) were 79%, 63%, and 50%, respectively. Among mature BCL, the 5-year OS was highest in follicular lymphoma (77.8%), followed by Burkitt lymphoma (76.5%), marginal zone lymphoma (74.1%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (61.5%), small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (55.1%), and mantle cell lymphoma (44.3%). Among PTCL, the 5-year OS was highest in ALK+anaplastic large cell lymphoma (79.0%), followed by ALK-anaplastic large cell lymphoma (63.1%), natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (57.7%), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (34.9%, and peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (27.6%). Significant improvement in the survival of lymphoma was observed, with the 5-year OS increasing from 48% in 1996-2000 to 65% in 2011-2015 (P < .001).

Epub 2020 Apr 13.,"It has been reported that microRNA-23b (miR-23b) plays a role in multiple cancers, while its impact on lung cancer has not been comprehensively known. Our study explored the probable impacts of miR-23b on lung cancer cells. Expression of miR-23b was assessed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. After miR-23b mimic, inhibitor, and their own control were transfected into A549 cells, cell viability, migration, invasion, apoptosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were investigated through different experimental methods. The targeting contact between miR-23b and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) was investigated applying dual-luciferase activity assay. In addition, the modulatory impacts of miR-23b on the splicing variants of Mcl-1 (Mcl-1S and Mcl-1L) were explored. MiR-23b was highly expressed in lung cancer cells compared with normal lung cells. Increased expression of miR-23b promoted A549 cell viability, migration, invasion, and EMT. However, miR-23b silencing produced the opposite results. Mcl-1 has been proven to be a specialized target of miR-23b. Compared with the reduction of Mcl-1S induced by miR-23b overexpression, Mcl-1L showed negligible interaction with miR-23b. Moreover, the antitumor activities of miR-23b silencing were alleviated by Mcl-1S silencing. The blockage of Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription protein (JAK/STAT) and Wnt/beta-catenin induced by miR-23b silencing was reversed by Mcl-1S silencing. MiR-23b might be an up-and-coming biomarker of lung cancer. In addition, miR-23b was involved in the tumor-promoting effects and the mobilization of JAK/STAT and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways through the reduction of Mcl-1S.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN23b microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Mcl-1', 'NSCLC', 'miR-23b']",,"['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study is the first to evaluate the quality of BM-MSCs obtained from young and elderly healthy volunteers (KNT cells). The KNT cells had normal karyotypes and were positive for MSC markers (CD90, CD73, CD105). When cultured under appropriate conditions, they showed adipogenic or osteogenic potential. Hence, the anti-neoplastic effects of secretory factors [supernatant or extracellular vesicles (EV)] from KNT cells were verified using several neoplastic cells (three multiple myeloma, three myeloid leukemia, and three lymphoma cell lines). The conditioned medium (CM), but not EV, of KNT cells derived from young healthy donors significantly inhibited myeloma and lymphoma cell proliferation, but enhanced myeloid leukemia proliferation. Anti-angiogenesis effect of CM and EV derived from young KNT against hematologic neoplasia-induced angiogenesis was evident and more prominent in CM than in EV but not evident in elderly KNT-derived EV. These findings indicate that the anti-tumor effect of KNT cells depends on the types of hematologic neoplasia, with elements existing in the supernatant and not in EVs. Therefore, BM-MSC may produce soluble factors that affect cell proliferation of neoplasia, causing cell-to-cell communication. The anti-angiogenesis effect of KNT cells depends on the age of BM-MSC donors.",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],PMC7324432,['NOTNLM'],"['Angiogenesis', 'Bone marrow stromal cells', 'Conditioned medium', 'Donor age', 'Growth inhibitory effect']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are limited matched sibling donors (MSDs), and alternative donors (ADs) are the main source for allo-HSCT. Thus, we evaluated the clinical efficacy of AD peripheral allo-HSCT for treating high-risk R/R childhood acute leukemia. Methods: We assessed 111 children who underwent allo-HSCT at the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University between October 2006 and July 2019. The patients were divided in the MSD and AD groups, and their clinical characteristics, complications, and survival rates were compared. Results: The cumulative incidences of Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus infections were significantly higher in the AD than in the MSD group (P < 0.001); however, the recurrence and mortality rates were significantly higher in the MSD than in the AD group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the 5-year disease-free (DFS) (65.2% vs. 43.3%, P = 0.033) and overall survival (OS) rates (71.6% vs. 53.8%, P = 0.053) were significantly higher in the AD than in the MSD group. In the AD group, the grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), donor-recipient ABO compatibility, conditioning regimen, and CMV infection affected the 5-year OS. The grade II-IV aGVHD also affected the 5-year DFS; however, only the donor-recipient ABO compatibility affected the 5-year DFS. The donor MSD (HR: 2.035, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.057-3.920, P = 0.034) and the grade II-IV aGVHD (HR: 2.914, 95% CI 1.261-6.736, P = 0.012) affected the 5-year DFS of childhood acute leukemia after allo-HSCT, and the grade II-IV aGVHD (HR: 3.016, 95% CI 1.217-7.473, P = 0.017) affected the 5-year OS. Moreover, the donor source (HR: 2.836, 95% CI 1.179-6.823, P = 0.020) and grade II-IV aGVHD (HR: 3.731, 95% CI 1.332-10.454, P = 0.012) were independent predictors of the 5-year DFS, while the latter (HR: 3.524, 95% CI 1.310-10.988, P = 0.030) was an independent predictor of the 5-year OS.

However, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is also known to be able to cause graft-versus-host disease, which can cause considerable morbidity and even mortality in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Therefore, to elicit leukemia-specific immune responses without alloimmune reaction, the possibilities of active immunotherapy methods such as leukemia vaccines have been studied for decades. Among various types of leukemia vaccines, whole leukemia cell vaccines are known to be able to induce immune responses against multiple unknown antigens without the need for adoptive transfer of dendritic cells. In this review, we will discuss the past progress of whole leukemia cell vaccines, with a focus on strategies to enhance their immunogenicity. We will also present the future directions of whole leukemia cell vaccines along with addressing newly emerging concepts, such as immunogenic cell death and necroptosis. We will not discuss in detail other factors that can reduce the therapeutic efficacy of whole leukemia cell vaccines such as various immunosuppressive mechanisms of leukemia.",['0 (Cancer Vaccines)'],,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 The Author(s).

Epub 2020 Mar 7.,"BACKGROUND: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous disorder with coexistence of multiple clones. The mortality rate in children with ALL has reduced to 15% to 20% in developed countries. However, it continues to be high in India (25%-35%), which may be attributed to ethnic variation and differences in disease biology. The treatment and outcome in ALL are dependent on risk stratification, which is derived from prognostic factors like leukocyte count, age at diagnosis, immunophenotypic subtypes and, most importantly, cytogenetic alterations. Chromosomal rearrangements are important initiating events in leukemogenesis. Approximately, 75% of children with ALL harbor a recurring chromosomal alteration detectable by karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization, or other molecular techniques. The present study was planned to compare the prevalence of various cytogenetic alterations with western. literature and to see the association of these cytogenetic alterations with other prognostic factors as well as survival outcome. METHODS: We enrolled, 117 children of 1 to 14 years of age with newly diagnosed B-cell ALL from August 2014 to Mar 2016 prospectively. Patients were monitored for response to prednisolone, postinduction complete morphological remission minimal residual disease assessment, and were followed for a minimum 2 years. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We observed that poor-risk cytogenetic alterations were more prevalent, whereas good-risk cytogenetic alterations were less frequent in our patient cohort as compared with western studies. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that event-free survival is significantly less in those with poor-risk cytogenetics. We have also highlighted nonrecurrent alterations observed in our study group.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Event free survival', '*Hematological malignancy', '*Integrated cytogenetics', '*Molecular genetics', '*Survival outcome']",,['Copyright (c) 2019.

Epub 2020 Apr 11.,"INTRODUCTION: Acute promyelocytic leukemia is an oncologic emergency. The limited cases reported in the literature have led to poor understanding of the safety of management of acute promyelocytic leukemia during pregnancy. CASE REPORT: Herein is an acute promyelocytic leukemia case of a 22-year-old young pregnant woman who had various social problems. The patient was diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia in her the second trimester of her first pregnancy.Management and outcome: She was treated with all-trans-retinoic acid with idarubicin and successfully delivered a healthy baby. She completed induction with idarubicin but defaulted her all-trans-retinoic acid, 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate maintenance. She relapsed after one year and was salvaged with all-trans-retinoic acid high dose cytarabine and arsenic trioxide. She went into remission and had autologous stem cells collected and was planned for an autologous stem cell transplant but she defaulted. She relapsed when she was pregnant with her second baby during her third trimester (29+weeks) 10 months later. Salvage chemotherapy with arsenic trioxide, all-trans-retinoic acid and idarubicin was given. Patient underwent an emergency lower segment caesarian section at 31 weeks of pregnancy due to abnormal fetal cardiotocography. A healthy baby was delivered. DISCUSSION: This drug regimen is controversial during pregnancy owing to the teratogenic effects and fatal retinoic acid syndrome especially in early gestation. In this case, patient was started the induction therapy of all-trans-retinoic acid treatment at her second trimester during her first pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Our lady demonstrated the possibility of using all-trans-retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide and chemotherapy during second and third trimester with successful pregnancy outcomes.","['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['APL', 'all-trans-retinoic acid', 'arsenic trioxide', 'chemotherapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 14.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Compared with Western countries, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) rarely occurs in Asia and has different clinical characteristics. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics, treatment outcomes, and prognostic significance of Korean patients with CLL. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 90 patients with CLL who had received chemotherapy at 6 centers in Korea between 2000 and 2012. RESULTS: Compared with Western patients with CLL, Korean patients with CLL express lambda (42.0%) and atypical markers such as CD22 and FMC7 (76.7% and 40.0%, respectively) more frequently. First-line chemotherapy regimens included chlorambucil (n = 43), fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) (n = 20), fludarabine (n = 13), rituximab-FC (n = 4). The remaining patients were treated with other various regimens (n = 10). The 5-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 79.3% and 28.1%, respectively. Multivariate analyses showed that hyperleukocytosis (>/= 100 x 103/muL), extranodal involvement, and the Binet C stage were significant negative prognostic factors for OS (hazard ratio [HR] 4.75, p = 0.039; HR 21.6, p = 0.002; and HR 4.35, p = 0.034, respectively). Cytogenetic abnormalities including complex karyotypes (>/= 3), del(11q), and del(17) had a significantly adverse impact on both OS and PFS (p < 0.001 and p = 0.010, respectively). CONCLUSION: Initial hyperleukocytosis, extranodal involvement, complex karyotype, del(17) and del(11q) need to be considered in the risk stratification system for CLL.","['4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)']",PMC7820637,['NOTNLM'],"['*Korean', '*Leukemia, lymphocytic, chronic, B-cell', '*Prognosis', '*Treatment outcome']","['2017R1C1B5015107/National Research Foundation of Korea/International', 'Ministry of Education, Science and Technology/International']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 May 7.,"Next-generation sequencing identified about 60 genes recurrently mutated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We examined the additive prognostic value of the total number of recurrently mutated CLL genes (i.e., tumor mutational load [TML]) or the individually mutated genes beyond the CLL international prognostic index (CLL-IPI) in newly diagnosed CLL and high-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (HC MBL). We sequenced 59 genes among 557 individuals (112 HC MBL/445 CLL) in a multi-stage design, to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for time-to-first treatment (TTT), adjusted for CLL-IPI and sex. TML was associated with shorter TTT in the discovery and validation cohorts, with a combined estimate of continuous HR = 1.27 (CI:1.17-1.39, P = 2.6 x 10(-8) ; c-statistic = 0.76). When stratified by CLL-IPI, the association of TML with TTT was stronger and validated within low/intermediate risk (combined HR = 1.54, CI:1.37-1.72, P = 7.0 x 10(-14) ). Overall, 80% of low/intermediate CLL-IPI cases with two or more mutated genes progressed to require therapy within 5 years, compared to 24% among those without mutations. TML was also associated with shorter TTT in the HC MBL cohort (HR = 1.53, CI:1.12-2.07, P = .007; c-statistic = 0.71). TML is a strong prognostic factor for TTT independent of CLL-IPI, especially among low/intermediate CLL-IPI risk, and a better predictor than any single gene.

Epub 2020 Apr 28.,"We report on 18 patients with myeloid neoplasms and associated tyrosine kinase (TK) fusion genes on treatment with the TK inhibitors (TKI) ruxolitinib (PCM1-JAK2, n = 8; BCR-JAK2, n = 1) and imatinib, nilotinib or dasatinib (ETV6-ABL1, n = 9). On ruxolitinib (median 24 months, range 2-36 months), a complete hematologic response (CHR) and complete cytogenetic response (CCR) was achieved by five of nine and two of nine patients, respectively. However, ruxolitinib was stopped in eight of nine patients because of primary resistance (n = 3), progression (n = 3) or planned allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo SCT, n = 2). At a median of 36 months (range 4-78 months) from diagnosis, five of nine patients are alive: four of six patients after allo SCT and one patient who remains on ruxolitinib. In ETV6-ABL1 positive patients, a durable CHR was achieved by four of nine patients (imatinib with one of five, nilotinib with two of three, dasatinib with one of one). Because of inadequate efficacy (lack of hematological and/or cytogenetic/molecular response), six of nine patients (imatinib, n = 5; nilotinib, n = 1) were switched to nilotinib or dasatinib. At a median of 23 months (range 3-60 months) from diagnosis, five of nine patients are in CCR or complete molecular response (nilotinib, n = 2; dasatinib, n = 2; allo SCT, n = 1) while two of nine patients have died.

The primary endpoint was major molecular response (MMR) at Month 12 in the modified as-treated population (Philadelphia chromosome-positive [Ph+] patients with e13a2/e14a2 transcripts). Sixty Japanese patients with CP CML were treated with bosutinib; median age was 55 years (range 20-83), 60.0% were males, and all were Ph+ and had e13a2/e14a2 transcripts. After median follow-up of 16.6 months (range 11.1-21.9), 41 (68.3%) patients remained on bosutinib. The MMR rate at Month 12 was 55.0% (2-sided 90% confidence interval: 44.4-65.6). There were no on-treatment transformations to accelerated/blast phase, and no patient died on treatment or within 28 days of the last bosutinib dose. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhea (86.7%), increased alanine aminotransferase (55.0%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (46.7%). The primary objective of this phase 2 study was met, and there were no new safety signals for bosutinib.

BCR-ABL is a highly specific tumor antigen in CML and provides an attractive opportunity for vaccination therapy. Exogenous antigens must be presented on MHC class I molecules-via a process termed cross-presentation-to activate specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte response. The relative efficiency of cross-presentation is determined in part by the ability of dendritic cells (DCs) to internalize and present antigens. Here, we present a novel tool that uses cytoplasmic transduction peptide (CTP) to facilitate the internalization of antigens by DCs in an endocytosis-independent manner, which greatly enhances the efficiency of antigen presentation, thereby inducing stronger cytotoxic activity to ensure the elimination of CML cells. The data suggest that CTP-fused CML-specific peptides can be applied in vaccination therapies for CML patients.","['0 (Peptides)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Antigen presentation', '*BCR-ABL', '*CTL Response', '*Cytoplasmic transduction peptide', '*DC Vaccine']",,['Copyright (c) 2020.

Epub 2020 Mar 13.,"BACKGROUND: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children characterized by the overproduction and accumulation of immature lymphoid cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. The BMI-1 is an important component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex-1 (PRC1). It is an important molecule for the self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The BMI-1 expression is generally high in HSCs and decreases after cell differentiation. The BMI-1 is required for the maintenance of normal and cancer stem cells and has been reported as an oncogene in various tumors. The NANOG is a homeodomain transcription factor responsible for maintaining the stem cell compartment at the blastocyst stage of developing embryos. The NANOG gene has been proven to be transcribed in CD34+ cells and different leukemic cells. METHODS: The ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) of 30 pediatric ALL patients (16 B-ALL and 14 T-ALL) and 14 healthy controls. The Bmi-1 and NANOG expression levels were determined using the quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: Compared to normal controls, patients with ALL exhibited upregulated levels of Bmi-1 (p=0.03). Patients who overexpressed Bmi-1 and NANOG displayed a significantly worse survival than low-expressing patients (hazard ratio (HR) 5.74, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.48-22, p=0.012 and HR 3.8, 95% CI:1.009-14.3, p=0.048, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data suggest that the Bmi-1 and NANOG might serve as a novel survival predictor in ALL patients. Our observation also suggests that the Bmi-1 and NANOG could serve as new therapeutic targets for treatment of pediatric ALL.",,PMC8211619,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'BMI-1', 'NANOG', 'qRT-PCR']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

The heme exporter Feline Leukemia Virus sub-group C Receptor 1a (FLVCR1a), an integral membrane protein with twelve transmembrane helices, is a key player in the maintenance of cellular heme homeostasis. It was first identified as the host receptor for the Feline Leukemia Virus sub-group C (FeLV-C), a retrovirus causing hematological abnormalities in cats and other felines. Mutations in the Flvcr1 were later identified in human patients affected by Posterior Column Ataxia and Retinitis Pigmentosa (PCARP) and Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathies (HSANs). Despite being an essential component in heme balance, currently there is a lack in the understanding of its function at the molecular level, including the effect of disease-causing mutations on protein function and structure. Therefore, there is a need for protocols to achieve efficient recombinant production yielding milligram amounts of highly pure protein to be used for biochemical and structural studies. Here, we report the first FLVCR1a reliable protocol suitable for both antibody generation and structural characterisation.","['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Flvcr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*FLVCR1', '*Feline leukemia virus', '*Heme transport', '*Membrane protein', '*Negative stain']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Chemoresistance is quite common in refractory or relapsed T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), which leads to dismal chances of recovery. In this study, MBZ was found to suppress the proliferation and reduce the viability of T-ALL cell line, CCRF-CEM, and its chemoresistant derivative, CEM/C1, at nanomolar concentrations. The inhibitive effects were found to be dose-dependent and not to be affected by the chemoresistance of CEM/C1 cells. Cell cycle arrest, caspase 3/7 activation and tubulin disruption were found in the MBZ-treated T-ALL cells. Notch1 signaling, which is often aberrantly activated in T-ALL cells, was showed to be suppressed by MBZ treatments. MBZ administration in murine T-ALL models also suppressed the growth of CEM/C1 cells, indicating that MBZ may be developed as a therapeutic agent for chemoresistant T-ALLs.

In four patients, the most abundant clones differed between sites, including three in which the dominant medullary clones were minimally detectable in the blood.

In this research, we carried on to investigate the influence of EGCG on FLT3 promoter activity and FLT3 transcription. Methods The effect of EGCG on the mRNA expression of flt3 and flt3-promoter activity was evaluated using semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR and luciferase reporter assay. The gene expression profiling analysis was done for detecting the effect of EGCG on flt3-transcription factors. Then, the protein level of C-MyB was obsvered using western blot analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that EGCG reduced the transcription level of FLT3 by suppressing its promoter activity. By doing gene expression profile analysis in MOLM-13 cells established from acute monocytic leukemia patient with two mutations within FLT3 EXON 14 in a time-dependent manner, we found that the expression of mRNA of FLT3 was first observed to downregulate at 6 h together with the decreasing of Homeobox A9 (HOXA9) transcription factor after EGCG treatment. The changing of C/EBPalpha expression was found at 8 h. Interestingly, the reducing mRNA of c-Myb by EGCG was observed at 4 h, earlier than FLT3 was downregulated. There was no change in Meis Homeobox 1 (Meis1) by EGCG. We also found the protein level c-Myb was inhibited by EGCG in MOLM-13 and MOLM-14 cells after treating these cells with 60microM of EGCG for 8 h. CONCLUSION: This data indicated the involvement of transcription factors in controlling the expression of FLT3 by EGCG.","['0 (Tea)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main objective of this study was to investigate the anticancer properties of piperine and curcumin against HL60 leukemia cells and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Antiproliferative effects were assessed by WST-1 cell viability assay. Cell apoptotic effects were studied by DAPI staining assay. Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) assay was used to assess apoptosis. Electron microscopy was used for detection of autophagy and flow cytometry for cell cycle analysis, while transwell migration assay was used to study the effects on cell migration and invasion. Protein expression was estimated by western blot. RESULTS: The results showed that both piperine and curcumin inhibited significantly the growth of the HL60 cells and exhibited an IC50 of 25 and 30 microM respectively. Further, it was observed that the anticancer effects of piperine and curcumin were due to the induction of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis which was also associated with enhancement of the Bax expression. Transmission electron microscopy also showed that both curcumin and piperine induced autophagy in the HL-60 leukemia cells. Flow cytometry showed that piperine and curcumin also caused arrest of the HL-60 cells at the S-phase of the cell cycle. Finally wound healing and transwell assays showed that piperine and curcumin suppressed the migration and invasive potential of the HL60 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The present study reveals that piperine and curcumin exhibit significant antitumor activity in human leukemia HL60 cells via multiple mechanisms and may prove promising in the development of systemic therapy for leukemia.","['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzodioxoles)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Polyunsaturated Alkamides)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'U71XL721QK (piperine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['J BUON. 2021 May-Jun;26(3):1181.

In this paper, we explore its role when estimating the potential effects of magnetic fields (MF) on leukemia using data from the California Power Line Study (CAPS). In this context, dwelling type could be a risk factor, a proxy for other risk factors, a cause of MF exposure, a confounder, an effect-measure modifier, or some combination. METHODS: We obtained information on type of dwelling at birth on over 2,000 subjects. Using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression, we assessed whether dwelling type was a risk factor for childhood leukemia, which covariates and MF exposures were associated with dwelling type, and whether dwelling type was a potential confounder or an effect-measure modifier in the MF-leukemia relationship under the assumption of no-uncontrolled confounding. RESULTS: A majority of children lived in single-family homes or duplexes (70%). Dwelling type was associated with race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status but not with childhood leukemia risk, after other adjustments, and did not alter the MF-leukemia relationship upon adjustment as a potential confounder. Stratification revealed potential effect-measure modification by dwelling type on the multiplicative scale. CONCLUSION: Dwelling type does not appear to play a significant role in the MF-leukemia relationship in the CAPS dataset as a leukemia risk factor or confounder. Future research should explore the role of dwelling as an effect-measure modifier of the MF-leukemia association.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood leukemia', 'Electromagnetic fields', 'Power lines', 'Proximity', 'Residence']","['P2C HD041022/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', '10007993/Electric Power Research Institute']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The national comprehensive cancer network data suggest that t-AL cases are diagnosed at increasing rates in breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapeutic agents targeting topoisomerase II. Two cases of BRCA1-mutated ovarian and breast carcinoma who developed therapy-related APL and ALL, respectively, following topoisomerase II-directed therapy were characterized. Genomic characterization of therapy-related acute promyelocytic leukemia (t-APL) revealed a unique RARA intron 2 breakpoint (Chr17: 40347487) at 3'-end of RARA corroborating breakpoint clustering in t-APL following topoisomerase II inhibition. Both cases of this series harbored germline BRCA1 mutations. The germline BRCA1 mutation in patient with t-APL was detected in exon 8 (HGVS nucleotide: c.512dupT). This mutation in t-APL is extremely rare. Interestingly, t-ALL patient in this series had a BRCA1 mutation (HGVS nucleotide: c.68_69delAG; BIC designation: 187delAG) identical to a previously reported case after the treatment of same primary disease.

Epub 2020 Apr 10.,"The 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone, is a master regulator of the ER stress. A number of studies revealed that high levels of GRP78 protein in cancer cells confer multidrug resistance (MDR) to therapeutic treatment. Therefore, drug candidate that reduces GRP78 may represent a novel approach to eliminate MDR cancer cells. Our earlier studies showed that a set of 4H-chromene derivatives induced selective cytotoxicity in MDR cancer cells. In the present study, we elucidated its selective mechanism in four MDR cancer cell lines with one lead candidate (CXL146). Cytotoxicity results confirmed the selective cytotoxicity of CXL146 toward the MDR cancer cell lines. We noted significant overexpression of GRP78 in all four MDR cell lines compared with the parental cell lines. Unexpectedly, CXL146 treatment rapidly and dose-dependently reduced GRP78 protein in MDR cancer cell lines. Using human leukemia (HL) 60/mitoxantrone (MX) 2 cell line as the model, we demonstrated that CXL146 treatment activated the unfolded protein response (UPR); as evidenced by the activation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha, protein kinase R-like ER kinase, and activating transcription factor 6. CXL146-induced UPR activation led to a series of downstream events, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation, which contributed to CXL146-induced apoptosis. Targeted reduction in GRP78 resulted in reduced sensitivity of HL60/MX2 toward CXL146. Long-term sublethal CXL146 exposure also led to reduction in GRP78 in HL60/MX2. These data collectively support GRP78 as the target of CXL146 in MDR treatment. Interestingly, HL60/MX2 upon long-term sublethal CXL146 exposure regained sensitivity to mitoxantrone treatment. Therefore, further exploration of CXL146 as a novel therapy in treating MDR cancer cells is warranted. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Multidrug resistance is one major challenge to cancer treatment. This study provides evidence that cancer cells overexpress 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) as a mechanism to acquire resistance to standard cancer therapies. A chromene-based small molecule, CXL146, selectively eliminates cancer cells with GRP78 overexpression via activating unfolded protein response-mediated apoptosis. Further characterization indicates that CXL146 and standard therapies complementarily target different populations of cancer cells, supporting the potential of CXL146 to overcome multidrug resistance in cancer treatment.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (CXL146)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",PMC7237868,,,['R01 CA163864/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Copyright (c) 2020 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']",,,,['Mol Pharmacol. 2020 Aug;98(2):182.

The mechanism regarding how EGFR signaling regulates myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) protein stability and ubiquitination remains undefined. METHODS: MTS assay was used for natural product library screening. The effect of formononetin (Formo) on NSCLC cells was determined by MTS assay and soft agar assay. Molecular modeling was performed to analyze the potential different binding modes between Formo and EGFR WT or mutants. Mcl-1 protein level and the inhibitory effect of Formo on EGFR signaling were examined by immunoblot, in vitro kinase assay, in vitro pulldown and ATP competition assays, co-immunoprecipitation assay, ubiquitination analysis, in vivo xenograft model, and immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Formo was identified as an EGFR inhibitor by a 98 commercially available natural product screening. Formo suppresses WT and mutant EGFR kinases activity in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Molecular modeling indicates that Formo docks into the ATP-binding pocket of both WT and mutant EGFR. Formo inhibits EGFR-Akt signaling, which in turn activates GSK3beta and promotes Mcl-1 phosphorylation in NSCLC cells. Treatment with Formo enhances the interaction between Mcl-1 and SCF(Fbw7), which eventually promotes Mcl-1 ubiquitination and degradation. Depletion of either GSK3beta or SCF(Fbw7) compromised Formo-induced Mcl-1 downregulation. Finally, Formo inhibits the in vivo tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of promoting ubiquitination-dependent Mcl-1 turnover might be an alternative strategy to enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of EGFR-TKI.","['0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phytoestrogens)', '295DQC67BJ (formononetin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",PMC7146989,['NOTNLM'],"['Epidermal growth factor receptor', 'Formononetin', 'Mcl-1', 'Non-small cell lung cancer', 'Ubiquitination']","['81904262/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81972837/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2018JJ3787/Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province', '2018JJ2604/Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province', '2019JJ50682/Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While studies using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) have suggested that Abi1 plays a critical role in Bcr-Abl-induced leukemogenesis, the mechanism involved is not clear. METHODS: In this study, we knocked out Abi1 expression in p185(Bcr-Abl)-transformed hematopoietic cells using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing technology. The effects of Abi1 deficiency on actin cytoskeleton remodeling, the Bcr-Abl signaling, IL-3 independent growth, and SDF-induced chemotaxis in these cells were examined by various in vitro assays. The leukemogenic activity of these cells was evaluated by a syngeneic mouse transplantation model. RESULTS: We show here that Abi1 deficiency reduced the IL3-independent growth and SDF-1alpha-mediated chemotaxis in p185(Bcr-Abl)-transformed hematopoietic cells and inhibited Bcr-Abl-induced abnormal actin remodeling. Depletion of Abi1 also impaired the Bcr-Abl signaling to the ERK and PI3 kinase/Akt pathways. Remarkably, the p185(Bcr-Abl)-transformed cells with Abi1 deficiency lost their ability to develop leukemia in syngeneic mice. Even though these cells developed drug tolerance in vitro after prolonged selection with imatinib as their parental cells, the imatinib-tolerant cells remain incapable of leukemogenesis in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Together, this study highlights an essential role of Abi1 in Bcr-Abl-induced leukemogenesis and provides a model system for dissecting the Abi1 signaling in Bcr-Abl-positive leukemia.","['0 (Abi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Bcr protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",PMC7147029,['NOTNLM'],"['*Abi1', '*Actin cytoskeleton', '*Bcr-Abl-positive B-ALL', '*Drug resistance', '*Leukemogenesis']","['R15 CA191476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA187303/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a variety of tumors, ERalpha activation has proliferative effects, while ERbeta targeting results in cell senescence or death. Aberrant ER expression and hypermethylation have been characterized in AML, making ER targeting in this disease of great interest.

In 5% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the t(1,19) chromosomal translocation specifically targets the E2A gene and produces an oncogenic E2A-PBX1 fusion protein. Although previous studies have shown the oncogenic functions of E2A-PBX1 in cell and animal models, the E2A-PBX1-enforced cistrome, the E2A-PBX1 interactome, and related mechanisms underlying leukemogenesis remain unclear. Here, by unbiased genomic profiling approaches, we identify the direct target sites of E2A-PBX1 in t(1,19)-positive pre-B ALL cells and show that, compared with normal E2A, E2A-PBX1 preferentially binds to a subset of gene loci cobound by RUNX1 and gene-activating machineries (p300, MED1, and H3K27 acetylation). Using biochemical analyses, we further document a direct interaction of E2A-PBX1, through a region spanning the PBX1 homeodomain, with RUNX1. Our results also show that E2A-PBX1 binding to gene enhancers is dependent on the RUNX1 interaction but not the DNA-binding activity harbored within the PBX1 homeodomain of E2A-PBX1. Transcriptome analyses and cell transformation assays further establish a significant RUNX1 requirement for E2A-PBX1-mediated target gene activation and leukemogenesis. Notably, the RUNX1 locus itself is also directly activated by E2A-PBX1, indicating a multilayered interplay between E2A-PBX1 and RUNX1. Collectively, our study provides the first unbiased profiling of the E2A-PBX1 cistrome in pre-B ALL cells and reveals a previously unappreciated pathway in which E2A-PBX1 acts in concert with RUNX1 to enforce transcriptome alterations for the development of pre-B ALL.","['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Mediator Complex)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)']",PMC7332894,,,"['R01 CA163086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA178765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['Blood. 2020 Jul 2;136(1):3-4.

Epub 2020 Apr 7.,"The short telomere syndromes are considered the most common premature aging disorders. Although studies in genetically modified cells and animal models have suggested telomere dysfunction may promote genome instability, only a minority of humans with inherited loss-of-function mutations in telomerase and related genes develop cancer. Solid tumors are overall rare, and the vast majority of cancers are bone marrow-derived with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) comprising three-quarter of cases. In contrast to young short telomere syndrome patients who develop aplastic anemia, MDS and AML are usually diagnosed in adults who have milder short telomere defects. Here, we dissect the mechanisms by which these two bone marrow failure states, aplastic anemia and MDS-AML, evolve in the setting of varying degrees of telomere shortening. We discuss the implications of these observations for patient care as well as for understanding the genetics and biology of age-related myeloid clonal evolution.","['EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",PMC8122241,,,"['R01 CA225027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL119476/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007525/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

It has become progressively apparent that the current antimicrobial focus has shortcomings that result from disruption of the commensal microbial communities of the gut. These effects, collectively known as dysbiosis, have been increasingly associated worldwide with growing complications such as Clostridioides difficile infection, systemic infections, and antibiotic resistance. A revision of the current practice is overdue. Several innovative concepts have been proposed and tested in animal models and humans, with the overarching goal of preventing damage to the microbiota and facilitating its recovery.

Epub 2020 Apr 10.,"PURPOSE: Asparaginase (ASNase) is an important component of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment, but is often discontinued because of toxicity. Erwinia chrysanthemi ASNase (Erwinia) substitution was approved in 2011 for allergic reactions. Erwinia has, however, been intermittently unavailable because of drug supply issues. The impact of Erwinia substitution or complete ASNase discontinuation is unknown. METHODS: Patients aged 1-30.99 years in frontline Children's Oncology Group trials for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia between 2004 and 2011 (National Cancer Institute [NCI] standard risk [SR]: AALL0331; NCI high risk: AALL0232) were included. The number of prescribed pegaspargase (PEG-ASNase) doses varied by trial and strata. Maintenance therapy did not contain ASNase. Landmark analyses at maintenance compared disease-free survival (DFS) among those receiving all prescribed PEG-ASNase doses versus switching to Erwinia but receiving all doses versus not receiving all ASNase doses. RESULTS: We included 5,195 AALL0331 and 3,001 AALL0232 patients. The cumulative incidence of PEG-ASNase discontinuation was 12.2% +/- 4.6% in AALL0331 and 25.4% +/- 0.8% in AALL0232. In multivariable analyses, NCI high-risk patients not receiving all prescribed ASNase doses had inferior DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.9; P = .002) compared with those receiving all prescribed PEG-ASNase doses. Patients with Erwinia substitution who completed subsequent courses were not at increased risk (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.6; P = .69). NCI SR patients who discontinued ASNase were not at elevated risk (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.6; P = .23), except when restricted to those with slow early response, who were prescribed more ASNase because of therapy intensification (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.7; P = .03). CONCLUSION: Discontinuation of ASNase doses is associated with inferior DFS in higher-risk patients. Our results illustrate the severe consequences of Erwinia shortages.","['3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",PMC7280050,,,"['U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233324/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, heparanase displays a unique versatility in degrading heparan sulfate chains of several proteoglycans expressed in all mammalian cells. This endo-beta-D-glucuronidase is overexpressed in cancer, inflammation, diabetes, atherosclerosis, nephropathies and other pathologies. Starting from known low- or non-anticoagulant heparins, the search for heparanase inhibitors evolved focusing on structure-activity relationship studies and taking advantage of new chemical-physical analytical methods which have allowed characterization and sequencing of polysaccharide chains. New methods to screen heparanase inhibitors and to evaluate their mechanism of action and in vivo activity in experimental models prompted their development. New non-anticoagulant heparin derivatives endowed with anti-heparanase activity are reported.

Epub 2020 Apr 9.,"Thiosemicarbazones (TSCs) and their metal complexes exhibit pronounced and selective cytotoxic potential against a broad span of cancers. Here, we assessed the anti-cancer activity of a water-soluble copper(II) complex of thiosemicarbazone (Cu-TSC) against two cancer cell lines of human leukemia. Our analysis revealed that Cu-TSC treatment results in a time and dose-dependent growth inhibition in K562 and KG1a cells while sparing normal human fibroblast (HFF2) cells. The IC50 values for the Cu-TSC treatment were measured to be 21.7 +/- 1.5 microM and 50.25 +/- 2.5 microM for K562 and KG1a cells, respectively. Cell cycle analysis indicated that Cu-TSC induces the accumulation of cells in the sub-G1 fraction as well as the reversible arrest in G0/G1 and G2/M phases in K562 and KG1a cells, respectively. Furthermore, the occurrence of apoptosis as the prime mode of cell death was verified through apoptotic body formation, phosphatidylserine externalization, and caspase-3 activation. Additionally, the real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed that Cu-TSC triggers apoptosis in both cell lines via the upregulation of caspases-8, -9, and the changing of Bax/Bcl2 ratio. Finally, flow cytometric analysis confirmed that Cu-TSC treatment causes the enhancement of reactive oxygen species formation in both K562 and KG1a cells. Altogether, these findings suggest that Cu-TSC is a promising inducer of apoptosis in leukemia cells and carries potential as an anti-cancer compound.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Thiosemicarbazones)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '127913-88-6 (copper-thiosemicarbazone complex)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Caspase', '*Copper', '*Leukemia', '*Reactive oxygen species', '*Thiosemicarbazone']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In lymphocytes p66SHC exploits both its adaptor and its reactive oxygen species (ROS)-elevating function to antagonize mitogenic and survival signaling and promote apoptosis. As a result, p66SHC deficiency leads to the abnormal expansion of peripheral T and B cells and lupus-like autoimmunity. Additionally, a defect in p66SHC expression is a hallmark of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, where it contributes to the accumulation of long-lived neoplastic cells. We have recently provided evidence that p66SHC exerts a further layer of control on B cell homeostasis by acting as a new mitochondrial LC3-II receptor to promote the autophagic demise of dysfunctional mitochondria.

Based on the type of laser, LPLT could potentially trigger cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in different cell lines. Methods: In this study, MTT assay was used to monitor the effect of low and high laser intensities on the viability of normal and cancer lymphocytes. The protein levels of Ki-67 (a proliferation marker) and Caspase-3 (an apoptosis factor) were measured in human peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and the B-lymphoblastic cell line (Nalm-6) using flow cytometry after being-exposed to 630-nm LPLT at low (2, 4, 6, and 10 J/cm(2) ) and high (15, 30, 60, and 120 J/cm(2)) energy densities in a continuous mode for 48 and 72 hours. Results: By using higher energy densities, 60 and 120 J/cm(2) , a significant decrease was shown in the viability of Nalm-6 cells, which reached 6.6 and 10.1% after 48 hours compared to the control cells (P<0.05). Notably, Cell exposure to doses 30, 60, and 120 J/cm(2) yielded 7.5, 12.9, and 21.6 cell viability reduction after 72 hours. The collected data showed that the high-intensity parameters of LPLT (15 to 120 J/cm(2)) promoted significant apoptotic changes in the exposed cells coincided with the activation of Caspase-3 compared to the none-treated control cells (P<0.05). The data further showed the stimulation of the Ki-67 factor both in primary PBMCs and the lymphoblastic cell line treated with LPLT at energy densities of 4 and 6 J/cm(2) (P<0.05), indicating enhanced cell proliferation. Similar to Nalm-6 cells, primary PBMCs showed apoptosis after 48 hours of being exposed to doses 60, and 120 J/cm(2) , indicated by increased Caspase-3 levels (P<0.05). As expected, the Nalm-6 cells were resistant to cytotoxic effects of laser irradiation in the first 48 hours (P>0.05) compared to normal PBMCs. The exposure of Nalm-6 cells to low-intensity laser intensities increased a proliferation rate compared to the PBMCs treated with the same doses. Conclusion: We showed the potency of LPLT in the induction of apoptosis and proliferation in human primary PBMCs and Nalm-6 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner after 72 hours.",,PMC7118511,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Leukemia', 'Low-power Laser therapy', 'Peripheral blood mononuclear cells', 'Proliferation']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 J Lasers Med Sci.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a 38-year-old previously healthy man who presented with acute on chronic lower back pain, gait instability, urinary retention, and severe thrombocytopenia. Radiologic examination revealed two soft tissue masses of the thoracic spine associated with compression fractures causing spinal canal narrowing and cord compression. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of ALL. Immediate initiation of high-dose corticosteroids and systemic chemotherapy resolved the patient's symptoms without radiation therapy or surgical intervention. After two courses of chemotherapy, the patient achieved complete remission in the bone marrow. Rapid administration of chemotherapy alone in this case resulted in a complete resolution of SCC.

The pathophysiology of the disease associates with cytogenetic abnormalities, gene mutations and aberrant gene expressions. At the molecular level, the disease manifests as changes in both epigenetic and genetic signatures. At the clinical level, two aspects of AML should be taken into account. First, the molecular changes occurring in the disease are important prognostic and predictive markers of AML. Second, use of novel therapies targeting these molecular changes. Currently, cytogenetic abnormalities and molecular alterations are the common biomarkers for the prognosis and choice of treatment for AML. Finding a panel of multiple biomarkers is a crucial diagnostic step for patient classification and serves as a prerequisite for individualized treatment strategies. Furthermore, the most important way of identifying relevant targets for new treatment approaches is defining specific patterns or a spectrum of driver gene mutations occurring in AML. Then, an algorithm can be established by the use of several biomarkers, to be used for personalized medicine.

Chemokine-receptor axes are defined as factors involved in AML pathogenesis and prognosis. The chemokine receptor CXCR4 along with its ligand, CXCL12 fit in important players that are actively involved in the cross-talk between leukemia cells and bone marrow microenvironment. Therefore, according to the above introductory comments, in this review article, we have focused on delineating some parts played by CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in various aspects of AML malignancy. Targeting both leukemic and stromal cell interaction is nowadays accepted as a wide and attractive strategy for improving the outcome of treatment in AML in a non-cell autonomous manner. This strategy might be employed in a wide variety of AML patients regardless of their causative mutations. In addition to several potential targets involved in the disruption of malignant leukemic cells from their specific protective niches, compounds which interfere with CXCL12/CXCR4 axis have also been explored in multiple early-phase established clinical trials. Moreover, extensive research programs are exploring novel leading mechanisms for leukemia-stromal interactions that appear to find out novel therapeutic targets within the near future.",,PMC7102884,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CXCL12', 'CXCR4', 'SDF-1alpha', 'chemokine axis']",,['(c) 2020 Yazdani et al.'],,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If no direct sensitivity of the identified pathogen to the initially prescribed antibiotic regimen was confirmed, it was defined as inappropriate initial antibiotic treatment (IIAT). Results: A total of 247 patients with FN were proven to be infected with Gram-negative bacteria, and 200 were diagnosed with acute leukemia. The most commonly detected bacteria were Escherichia coli (40%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (20%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%). In sum, 176 patients were classified as IIAT.

We performed a European multicenter (n=6) evaluation of three amplicon-based NGS assays targeting 11 genes recurrently mutated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Each assay was assessed by two centers using 48 pre-characterized chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples; libraries were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq instrument and bioinformatics analyses were centralized. Across all centers the median percentage of target reads >/=100x ranged from 94.2- 99.8%. In order to rule out assay-specific technical variability, we first assessed variant calling at the individual assay level i.e., pairwise analysis of variants detected amongst partner centers. After filtering for variants present in the paired normal sample and removal of PCR/sequencing artefacts, the panels achieved 96.2% (Multiplicom), 97.7% (TruSeq) and 90% (HaloPlex) concordance at a variant allele frequency (VAF) >0.5%. Reproducibility was assessed by looking at the inter-laboratory variation in detecting mutations and 107 of 115 (93% concordance) mutations were detected by all six centers, while the remaining eight variants (7%) were undetected by a single center.

We sought to investigate low-frequency mutations further by using a high-sensitivity assay containing unique molecular identifiers, which confirmed the presence of several minor subclonal mutations.

Epub 2020 Apr 9.,"P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) is a dimeric, mucin-like, 120-kDa glycoprotein that binds to P-, E-, and L-selectins. PSGL-1 is expressed primarily on the surface of lymphoid and myeloid cells and is up-regulated during inflammation to mediate leukocyte tethering and rolling on the surface of endothelium for migration into inflamed tissues. Although it has been reported that PSGL-1 expression inhibits HIV-1 replication, the mechanism of PSGL-1-mediated anti-HIV activity remains to be elucidated. Here we report that PSGL-1 in virions blocks the infectivity of HIV-1 particles by preventing the binding of particles to target cells. This inhibitory activity is independent of the viral glycoprotein present on the virus particle; the binding of particles bearing the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein or vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein or even lacking a viral glycoprotein is impaired by PSGL-1. Mapping studies show that the extracellular N-terminal domain of PSGL-1 is necessary for its anti-HIV-1 activity, and that the PSGL-1 cytoplasmic tail contributes to inhibition. In addition, we demonstrate that the PSGL-1-related monomeric E-selectin-binding glycoprotein CD43 also effectively blocks HIV-1 infectivity. HIV-1 infection, or expression of either Vpu or Nef, down-regulates PSGL-1 from the cell surface; expression of Vpu appears to be primarily responsible for enabling the virus to partially escape PSGL-1-mediated restriction. Finally, we show that PSGL-1 inhibits the infectivity of other viruses, such as murine leukemia virus and influenza A virus. These findings demonstrate that PSGL-1 is a broad-spectrum antiviral host factor with a unique mechanism of action.","['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (P-selectin ligand protein)']",PMC7196789,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD43', '*HIV-1', '*Nef', '*PSGL-1', '*Vpu']","['R01 AI093998/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI145753/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",['Copyright (c) 2020 the Author(s).

Despite gradual clinical improvement, the patient's HAGMA persisted, and no cause was identified on urine testing or renal ultrasound. As the patient was on long-term dicloxacillin for infective endocarditis prophylaxis and regular paracetamol, pyroglutamic acidosis (PGA) (5-oxoproline acidosis) was considered.

Epub 2020 Apr 6.,"Approximately one third of patients diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) are above the age of sixty. It is important to ensure older adults receive optimal diagnosis and management since this subtype of acute myeloid leukemia - given appropriate treatment - is highly curable with lower risk of adverse events compared to other types of leukemia. Historically, older age has been a risk factor for early death and poorer overall survival. However, prospects have changed with the introduction of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO). APL is curable in the majority of patients regardless of age, and the threshold of fitness that makes ATRA/ATO therapy possible is likely to be lower than for cytotoxic chemotherapy. APL frequently presents as a medical emergency and rapid diagnosis and intervention - typically involving referral to a specialist centre - is a major determinant of outcome. After diagnosis, management of APL in older adults presents particular challenges. Geriatric assessment, including evaluation of frailty, comorbidities and polypharmacy can assist in providing optimal supportive care for older adults during remission induction and may help individualize therapy in the post-remission phase. Here, we review the available evidence, highlighting areas of consensus, gaps in evidence and opportunities for research to enhance diagnosis, management and survivorship for older patients.","['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute promyelocytic leukemia', '*Age', '*All-trans retinoic acid', '*Arsenic trioxide', '*Geriatric', '*Geriatric assessment', '*Older', '*Treatment']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Our objectives were: 1) to examine ratings of fatigue in survivors of paediatric brain tumours (BT) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) compared to healthy controls, 2) to examine the relationship between symptoms of depression and cognitive fatigue, and 3) to evaluate parent-child concordance in ratings of cognitive fatigue. METHODS: Survivors of BT (n = 30), survivors of ALL (n = 30), and healthy controls (n = 60) aged 8-18 years completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Multidimensional Fatigue Scale and the Beck Youth Inventories. Associations between cognitive fatigue, diagnosis and depression were assessed with general linear modelling. Group differences were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Parent-child concordance was investigated with internal consistency reliability. RESULTS: Cognitive fatigue was prevalent in 70% of survivors of BT survivors and in 30% of survivors of ALL. Diagnosis was the main predictor of cognitive fatigue (p < .001, etap(2) = 0.178), followed by depression (p = .010, etap(2) = 0.080). Survivors of BT reported significantly more fatigue than healthy controls on all fatigue subscales. While they also expressed more symptoms of depression, we found no evidence for an interaction effect. Parent-child concordance was moderate to good among survivors, but poor for controls. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of BT and ALL suffer from cognitive fatigue, with survivors of BT expressing more problems. Cognitive fatigue and depression should be assessed in survivors of childhood cancer using both self-rated and proxy-rated measures, and appropriate interventions offered.",,PMC7146960,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'Brain tumour', 'Cognitive fatigue', 'Depression']","['KF 2017-0012/Barncancerfonden', '2017/Jonasfonden']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we decided to combine two nanoparticles Fe3O4 and ZnO to fabricate a new anti-cancer nanocomposite. Noteworthy, hydroxylated carbon nanotube (CNT) was used to increase the water-solubility of the compound, improving its uptake by malignant cells. This study was designed to evaluate the anticancer property as well as the molecular mechanisms of ZnO/CNT@Fe3O4 nanocomposite cytotoxicity in CML-derived K562 cells. Our results outlined that ZnO/CNT@Fe3O4 decreased the proliferative capacity of K562 cells through induction of G1 arrest and induced apoptosis probably via ROS-dependent upregulation of FOXO3a and SIRT1. The results of qRT-PCR analysis also demonstrated that while ZnO/CNT@Fe3O4 significantly increased the expression of pro-apoptotic genes in K562 cells, it had no significant inhibitory effect on the expression levels of anti-apoptotic target genes of NF-kappaB; proposing an attenuating role of NF-kappaB signalling pathway in K562 cell response to ZnO/CNT@Fe3O4. Synergistic experiment showed that ZnO/CNT@Fe3O4 could enhance the cytotoxic effects of imatinib on K562 cells.

Despite similarities in chronic inflammation and oncogene signaling, major differences in disease course exist. Although BCR-ABL has robust transformation potential, JAK2 V617F-positive polycythemia vera (PV) is characterized by a long and stable latent phase. These differences reflect increased genomic instability of BCR-ABL-positive CML, compared to genome-stable PV with rare cytogenetic abnormalities. Recent studies have implicated BCR-ABL in the development of a ""mutator"" phenotype fueled by high oxidative damage, deficiencies of DNA repair, and defective ATR-Chk1-dependent genome surveillance, providing a fertile ground for variants compromising the ATM-Chk2-p53 axis protecting chronic phase CML from blast crisis. Conversely, PV cells possess multiple JAK2 V617F-dependent protective mechanisms, which ameliorate replication stress, inflammation-mediated oxidative stress and stress-activated protein kinase signaling, all through up-regulation of RECQL5 helicase, reactive oxygen species buffering system, and DUSP1 actions. These attenuators of genome instability then protect myeloproliferative progenitors from DNA damage and create a barrier preventing cellular stress-associated myelofibrosis. Therefore, a better understanding of BCR-ABL and JAK2 V617F roles in the DNA damage response and disease pathophysiology can help to identify potential dependencies exploitable for therapeutic interventions.",,PMC7226398,['NOTNLM'],"['ATM-Chk2 pathway', 'DNA damage response', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'polycythemia vera']","['17-05988S/Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky', 'IGA_LF_2019_006/Internal Grant Agency of Palacky University', '-/Danish Cancer Society', '-/Swedish Research Council', 'LM2018126/Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports and European Regional', 'Development Fund (ERDF)', 'CZ.1.05/2.1.00/19.0395 and CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0109/OP VaVpI']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Novel biomarkers discovered over the past 20 years have revolutionized the way clinicians approach prognostication and treatment especially in the chemotherapy-free era. Herein, we review the best established prognostic and predictive biomarkers in the setting of chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) and novel targeted therapy. We propose that TP53 disruption (defined as either TP53 mutation or chromosome 17p deletion), unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene status (UM IGHV), NOTCH1 mutation, and CD49d expression are the strongest prognosticators of disease progression and overall survival in the field of novel biomarkers including recurrent gene mutations. We also highlight the predictive role of TP53 disruption, UM IGHV, and NOTCH1 mutation in the setting of CIT and TP53 disruption and CD49d expression in the setting of novel targeted therapy employing B-cell receptor (BCR) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2) inhibition.

Epub 2020 Apr 6.,"BACKGROUND: Overriding the differentiation blockage in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most successful mode-of-action in leukemia therapy - now curing the vast majority of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-based regimens. Similar approaches in other leukemia subtypes, such as IDH1/2-mutated AML, are under active investigation. We herein present successful release of the differentiation blockage upon treatment with the natural (-)-Delta(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol isomer dronabinol in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Cellular maturation and differentiation were followed in two patients employing whole genome methylation profiling, proteome analyses, NGS deep sequencing and multispectral imaging flow cytometry. For functional studies lentiviral OGT knock-down in vitro and ex vivo cell models were created to evaluate proliferative, apoptotic and differentiating effects of OGT in acute leukemia. FINDINGS: In here, we provide molecular evidence that dronbinol is capable to override the differentiation blockage of acute leukemia blasts at the state of the leukemia-initiating clone. We further identify the O-linked beta-N-acetyl glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) to be crucial in this process. OGT is a master regulator enzyme adding O-GlcNAc to serine or threonine residues in a multitude of target proteins. Aberrant O-GlcNAc modification is implicated in pathologies of metabolic, neurodegenerative and autoimme diseases as well as cancers. We provide evidence that dronabinol induces transcription of OGT via epigenetic hypomethylation of the transcription start site (TSS). A lentiviral OGT-knock out approach proves the central role of OGT exerting antileukemic efficacy via a dual-mechanism of action: High concentrations of dronabinol result in induction of apoptosis, whereas lower concentrations drive cellular maturation. Most intriguingly, overriding of the differentiation blockage of acute leukemia blasts is validated in vivo following two patients treated with dronabinol. INTERPRETATION: In conclusion, we provide evidence for overcoming the differentiation blockage in acute leukemia in subentities beyond promyelocytic and IDH1/2-mutated leukemia and thereby identify O-GlcNAcylation as a novel (drugable) field for future leukemia research.

Epub 2020 Mar 17.,"Traditional cytogenetic testing methodologies, including conventional chromosome analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), are invaluable for the detection or recurrent genetic abnormalities in various hematologic malignancies. However, technological advances, including a novel next-generation sequencing technique termed mate-pair sequencing (MPseq), continue to revolutionize the field of cytogenetics by enabling the characterization of structural variants at a significantly higher resolution compared to traditional methodologies. To illustrate the power of MPseq, we present a 27-year-old male diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia in myeloid blast crisis with multiple chromosomal abnormalities observed in all 20 metaphases from a peripheral blood specimen, including t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) and t(4;11)(q12;p15). Suspicious of a novel NUP98/PDGFRA fusion [t(4;11)(q12;p15)], break-apart FISH probe sets for the PDGFRA (4q12) and NUP98 (11p15.4) gene regions were performed and were both positive in approximately 86% of 200 interphase nuclei. However, subsequent MPseq testing revealed breakpoints located within the NUP98 gene and within an intergenic region (4q12) located between the CHIC2 and PDGFRA genes, indicating this 4;11 translocation does not result in the predicted NUP98/PDGFRA gene fusion as inferred from FISH and conventional chromosome results. This case demonstrates the clinical utility of MPseq, particularly for characterizing novel gene fusion events which may ultimately identify a false-positive FISH result.","['0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nup98 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', '*Conventional chromosome analysis', '*Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)', '*Mate-pair sequencing (MPseq)']",,['Copyright (c) 2020.

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of telmisartan itself and other sartans in combination with imatinib against K562-resistant cells. The findings were directly used to further optimize the lead structure. Telmisartan and candesartan cilexetil represented the most effective sartans, thus the influence of carboxyl/methyl carboxylate groups at positions 7 (compounds 6, 7) or 4 (compounds 12-14) at the benzimidazole core was studied. Additionally, according to the results of a former structure-activity study, telmisartan was transformed to the related amide (1). Telmisartan amide 1, as well as the esters 6 and 12 markedly sensitized the resistant CML cells to imatinib treatment. Correlation with their potency to activate PPARgamma is not given. Candesartan cilexetil, telmisartan and 1 showed the profile of partial agonists at PPARgamma with EC50 values of 4.2, 4.3 and 9.1 muM, respectively, while 6 and 12 caused only marginal intrinsic activation at 10 muM (Amax = 22% and 13%). However, the repression of the STAT5 phosphorylation relates with the possibility to sensitize K562-resistant CML cells to imatinib treatment.

Epub 2020 Mar 6.,"FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) is expressed on acute leukemia cells and is implicated in the survival, proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells in most acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Despite recent achievements in the development of FLT3-targeted small-molecule drugs, there are still unmet medical needs related to kinase selectivity and the progression of some mutant forms of FLT3. Herein, we describe the discovery of novel orally available type 1 FLT3 inhibitors from structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies for the optimization of indirubin derivatives with biological and pharmacokinetic profiles as potential therapeutic agents for AML. The SAR exploration provided important structural insights into the key substituents for potent inhibitory activities of FLT3 and in MV4-11 cells. The profile of the most optimized inhibitor (36) showed IC50 values of 0.87 and 0.32 nM against FLT3 and FLT3/D835Y, respectively, along with potent inhibition against MV4-11 and FLT3/D835Y expressed MOLM14 cells with a GI50 value of 1.0 and 1.87 nM, respectively. With the high oral bioavailability of 42.6%, compound 36 displayed significant in vivo antitumor activity by oral administration of 20 mg/kg once daily dosing schedule for 21 days in a mouse xenograft model. The molecular docking study of 36 in the homology model of the DFG-in conformation of FLT3 resulted in a reasonable binding mode in type 1 kinases similar to the reported type 1 FLT3 inhibitors Crenolanib and Gilteritinib.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Oximes)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', ""0 (indirubin-3'-monoxime)"", 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Epub 2020 Apr 6.,"AIMS: To reduce the dose of arsenic used against human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and to sensitize cells to drug treatment, we combined arsenic/interferon-alpha (As/IFN-alpha) with thymoquinone (TQ) in HTLV-I positive (HuT-102 and C91) and HTLV-1 negative (CEM and Jurkat) cell lines. MAIN METHODS: Cells were treated with TQ, As/IFN-alpha and combinations. Trypan blue and flow cytometry were used to investigate viability and cell cycle effects. Annexin-V staining, rhodamine assay and western blotting were used to determine apoptosis induction and changes in protein expression. Efficacy of single drugs and combinations were tested in adult T-cell leukemia (HuT-102) mouse xenograft model. KEY FINDINGS: TQ/As/IFN-alpha led to a more pronounced and synergistic time-dependent inhibitory effect on HTLV-I positive cells in comparison to As/IFN-alpha. While As/IFN-alpha combination was not effective against CEM or Jurkat cells, the triple combination TQ/As/IFN-alpha sensitized these two cell lines and led to a pronounced time-dependent inhibition of cell viability. TQ/As/IFN-alpha significantly induced apoptosis in all four cell lines and disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential. Apoptosis was confirmed by the cleavage of caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), downregulation of Bcl-2 and XIAP and upregulation of Bax. TQ alone or in combination activated p53 in HTLV-1 positive cell lines. Strikingly, TQ/As/IFN-alpha resulted in a pronounced significant decrease in tumor volume in HuT-102 xenograft mouse model, as compared to separate treatments or double combination therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest a strong potential for TQ to enhance the drug targeting effects of the standard clinical drugs As and IFN-alpha against CD4+ malignant T-cells.","['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)', 'O60IE26NUF (thymoquinone)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Combination therapy', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Targeted therapy', 'Xenograft']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2020 Apr 7.,"INTRODUCTION: Surgical procedure is the treatment of choice in early stage I lung adenocarcinoma. However, a considerable number of patients experience recurrence within the first 2 years after complete resection. Suitable prognostic biomarkers that identify patients at high risk of recurrence (who may probably benefit from adjuvant treatment) are still not available. This study aimed at identifying methylation markers for early recurrence that may become important tools for the development of new treatment modalities. METHODS: Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling was performed on 30 stage I lung adenocarcinomas, comparing 14 patients with early metastatic recurrence with 16 patients with a long-term relapse-free survival period using methylated-CpG-immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput next-generation sequencing. The differentially methylated regions between the two subgroups were validated for their prognostic value in two independent cohorts using the MassCLEAVE assay, a high-resolution quantitative methylation analysis. RESULTS: Unsupervised clustering of patients in the discovery cohort on the basis of differentially methylated regions identified patients with shorter relapse-free survival (hazard ratio: 2.23; 95% confidence interval: 0.66-7.53; p = 0.03). In two validation cohorts, promoter hypermethylation of the long noncoding RNA PLUT was significantly associated with shorter relapse-free survival (hazard ratio: 0.54; 95% confidence interval: 0.31-0.93; p < 0.026) and could be reported as an independent prognostic factor in the multivariate Cox regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Promoter hypermethylation of the long noncoding RNA PLUT is predictive in patients with early stage I adenocarcinoma at high risk for early recurrence. Further studies are needed to validate its role in carcinogenesis and its use as a biomarker to facilitate patient selection and risk stratification.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*IncRNA', '*Lung adenocarcinoma', '*Methylation profiling', '*PLUT', '*Prognostic marker']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2020 Apr 20.,"The impact of ruxolitinib therapy on evolution to blast phase (BP) in patients with myelofibrosis (MF) is still uncertain. In 589 MF patients treated with ruxolitinib, we investigated incidence and risk factors for BP and we described outcome according to disease characteristics and treatment strategy. After a median follow-up from ruxolitinib start of 3 years (range 0.1-7.6), 65 (11%) patients transformed to BP during (93.8%) or after treatment. BP incidence rate was 3.7 per 100 patient-years, comparably in primary and secondary MF (PMF/SMF) but significantly lower in intermediate-1 risk patients (2.3 vs 5.6 per 100 patient-years in intermediate-2/high-risk patients, P < .001). In PMF and SMF cohorts, previous interferon therapy seemed to correlate with a lower probability of BP (HR 0.13, P = .001 and HR 0.22, P = .02, respectively). In SMF, also platelet count <150 x 10(9) /l (HR 2.4, P = .03) and peripheral blasts >/=3% (HR 3.3, P = .004) were significantly associated with higher risk of BP.

The signaling mechanisms activating T cells and provoking tumor cell killing also trigger cytokine secretion and macrophage activation, leading to cytokine release syndrome (CRS). CRS is a serious side effect of CAR-T cells, and proinflammatory interleukin-6 (IL-6) is central to its pathogenesis. To endow T cells with anti-CRS activity, we designed a nonsignaling membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (mbaIL6) constituted by a single chain variable fragment derived from an anti-IL-6 antibody linked to a transmembrane anchoring peptide. We found that mbaIL6 expressed on the surface of T cells could rapidly remove IL-6 from the culture supernatant. IL-6 removal was proportional to the number of mbaIL6+ cells, increased with T-cell proliferation, and neutralized IL-6 signaling and function. A construct encoding for mbaIL6 and an anti-CD19-41BB-CD3zeta CAR allowed simultaneous expression of both receptors. T cells with mbaIL6 and CAR neutralized macrophage-derived IL-6 while exerting powerful antitumor activity. Cytotoxicity and proliferation were identical to those of cells expressing CAR alone in vitro, and CAR-T cells were effective in xenograft models regardless of mbaIL6 expression. Levels of human IL-6 in mice, however, were greatly reduced if T cells expressed both receptors instead of CAR alone. Thus, CAR-T cells with on-board capacity to extinguish IL-6 represent a new approach to prevent CRS and suppress its severity without affecting the antitumor potential of CAR-T cells.","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",PMC7160280,,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Connect CLL Registry, a United States-based multicenter prospective observational cohort study, enrolled 1494 patients between 2010 and 2014 from predominantly community-based settings.

With a median follow-up of 46.6 months (range, 0-63.0 months), median overall survival (OS) was not reached in LOT1, 63.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 46.0-63.0 months) in LOT2, and 38.0 months (95% CI, 33.0-47.0 months) in LOT>/=3. Bendamustine and rituximab (BR; 33.5%); fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR; 21.4%); and rituximab monotherapy (18.5%) were the most common regimens across LOTs. Median event-free survival (EFS) was similar in patients treated with BR (59.0 months) and FCR (55.0 months) in LOT1; median OS was not reached. In multivariable analysis, BR or FCR vs other treatments in LOT1 was associated with improved EFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.60; P < .0001) and OS (0.67; P = .0162). Using the Kaplan-Meier product limit, ibrutinib vs other treatments improved OS in LOT2 (HR, 0.279; P = .009), LOT3 (0.441; P = .011), and LOT>/=4 (0.578; P = .043). Prognostic modeling of death at 2 years postenrollment identified 3 risk groups: low (mortality rate, 6.2%), medium (14.5%), and high (27.4%). The most frequent adverse events across LOTs were pneumonia (11.6%) and febrile neutropenia (6.2%). These data suggest that advantages of LOT1 FCR over BR seen in clinical trials may not translate to community practice, whereas receiving novel LOT2 agents improved outcomes.

Epub 2020 Apr 9.,"Leukemia is one of the major diseases causing cancer-related deaths in the young population, and its cure rate is unsatisfying with side effects on patients. Fluorouracil (5-FU) is currently used as an anticancer drug for leukemia patients. Casticin, a natural polymethoxyflavone, exerts anticancer activity against many human cancer cell lines in vitro, but no other reports show 5-FU combined with casticin increased the mouse leukemia cell apoptosis in vitro. Herein, the antileukemia activity of 5-FU combined with casticin in WEHI-3 mouse leukemia cells was investigated in vitro. Treatment of two-drug combination had a higher decrease in cell viability and a higher increase in apoptotic cell death, the level of DNA condensation, and the length of comet tail than that of 5-FU or casticin treatment alone in WEHI-3 cells. In addition, the two-drug combination has a greater production rate of reactive oxygen species but a lower level of Ca(2+) release and mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim ) than that of 5-FU alone. Combined drugs also induced higher caspase-3 and caspase-8 activities than that of casticin alone and higher caspase-9 activity than that of 5-FU or casticin alone at 48 hours treatment. Furthermore, 5-FU combined with casticin has a higher expression of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD [Cu/Zn]) and lower catalase than that of 5-FU or casticin treatment alone. The combined treatment has higher levels of Bax, Endo G, and cytochrome C of proapoptotic proteins than that of casticin alone and induced lower levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and BCL-X of antiapoptotic proteins than that of 5-FU or casticin only. Furthermore, the combined treatment had a higher expression of cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) than that of casticin only. Based on these findings, we may suggest that 5-FU combined with casticin treatment increased apoptotic cell death in WEHI-3 mouse leukemia cells that may undergo mitochondria and caspases signaling pathways in vitro.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '753GT729OU (casticin)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['5-FU', 'apoptosis', 'caspases', 'casticin', 'mitochonfria', 'mouse leukemia WEHI-3 cells']","['CMU107-ASIA-17/China Medical University, Taiwan', 'Experiments and data analysis were performed in part through the use of the', 'Medical Research Core Facilities Center, Office of Research & Development at', 'China medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'RD/ORD VA/United States', 'China Medical University', 'RD/ORD VA/United States']","['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to evaluate the expression level of MUC4 and explore its prognostic value in newly diagnosed adult patients with AML. Methods: Bone marrow from 70 AML patients and 26 healthy donors was obtained. MUC4 levels were quantified by quantitative real-time PCR. Routine blood indices were measured by standard techniques. Results: Bone marrow MUC4 expression levels were significantly elevated in AML patients compared to controls at median (range) 2.77 (0.7-16.6) and 1.14 (0.5-1.99) respectively (p = 0.005). Moreover, lower MUC4 expression was strongly associated with persistent remission (p = 0.001) while higher MUC4 levels were associated with worse overall as well as disease-free survival (p = 0.011 and p = 0.006, respectively). Thus, its level may act as an indicator of disease progression. High MUC4 expression was identified as an independent prognostic predictor for both overall survival and disease-free survival.

Epub 2020 Apr 8.,"Interleukin (IL)-12, IL-18, and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) can induce Th1-inflammatory responses in favor of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) manifestation. In this study, the gene expression and plasma levels of these cytokines were evaluated. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 20 HAM/TSP patients, 21 asymptomatic carriers (ACs), and 21 healthy subjects (HSs) were assessed for the expression of IL-18, IL-12, and IFN-gamma, using qRT-PCR. The plasma level of IL-18 and IFN-gamma were measured by an ELISA method. The mean of HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) in the HAM/TSPs was 1846.59 +/- 273.25 and higher than ACs at 719.58 +/- 150.72 (p = 0.001). The IL-12 was considerably expressed only in nine ACs, five HAM/TSPs, and all HSs. Furthermore, the gene expression and plasma levels of IL-18 were lower in the HTLV-1-positive group than the control group (p = 0.001 and 0.012, respectively); however, there was no significant difference between the ACs and HAM/TSPs. The IFN-gamma level was higher in the HTLV-1-positive group (p < 0.001) than HSs. Although there were no correlation between plasma levels of IL-18 and IFN-gamma with PVL in the ACs, a positive correlation was observed between plasma IL-18 levels and PVL (r = 0.654, p = 0.002). The highest levels of IFN-gamma were observed in the HAM/TSPs which has a significant correlation with HTLV-1-HBZ (r = 0.387, p = 0.05) but not with Tax. However, no significant correlation was found between PVL and proinflammatory pattern. Apart from the IFN-gamma as a lymphokine, as a host factor, and HTLV-1-HBZ, as a viral agent, the other proinflammatory monokines or HTLV-1 factors are among the less-effective agents in the maintenance of HAM/TSP.","['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (IFNG protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-18)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*HBZ', '*HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP)', '*Human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)', '*IFN-gamma', '*IL-12', '*IL-18']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients had been classified as unfit to receive anthracycline-based chemotherapy due to high-risk factors for early death. Twenty-five patients with APL receiving ATO/ATRA between 2007 and 2018 were divided into 3 groups as follows: elderly patients (age >/= 70 years) with poor performance status (32%); patients with severe active infections at diagnosis (56%); and patients with multiple significant comorbidities (24%) who were unfit for conventional chemotherapy, regardless of age. Induction therapy comprised 0.15 mg/kg/day ATO combined with 45 mg/m(2)/day ATRA until patients attained complete remission (CR). Notably, only one patient (4.0%) died of septic shock 2 days after the ATO treatment had been initiated. The remaining 24 patients attained CR despite their serious and desperate conditions at diagnosis. In total, 44%, 28%, and 32% of the patients experienced neutropenia (grade 3 or 4), thrombocytopenia, and hepatopathy, respectively. Twenty-three of the 24 patients in CR proceeded to consolidation therapy and attained complete molecular remission with favorable overall survival (90.7%).

To investigate the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating drug resistance and leukemic stem cell (LSC) fate, we performed global transcriptome profiling in treatment-naive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) stem/progenitor cells and identified that miR-185 levels anticipate their response to ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). miR-185 functions as a tumor suppressor: its restored expression impaired survival of drug-resistant cells, sensitized them to TKIs in vitro, and markedly eliminated long-term repopulating LSCs and infiltrating blast cells, conferring a survival advantage in preclinical xenotransplantation models. Integrative analysis with mRNA profiles uncovered PAK6 as a crucial target of miR-185, and pharmacological inhibition of PAK6 perturbed the RAS/MAPK pathway and mitochondrial activity, sensitizing therapy-resistant cells to TKIs. Thus, miR-185 presents as a potential predictive biomarker, and dual targeting of miR-185-mediated PAK6 activity and BCR-ABL1 may provide a valuable strategy for overcoming drug resistance in patients.","['0 (MIRN185 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PAK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (p21-Activated Kinases)']",PMC7485576,,,['427201/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada'],['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: We retrospectively compared HCT outcomes from 62 HIDs, 36 partially-matched unrelated donors (PUDs), and 55 matched unrelated donors (MUDs) in patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome using the same graft source of peripheral blood and a reduced intensity conditioning of busulfan, fludarabine, and ATG. Results: The estimates of 3-yr disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were not significantly different among the MUD, HID, and PUD groups, at 46%, ""41%, and 36%"" for the DFS rate (P=0.844), and 55%, 45%, and 45% for the OS rate (P=0.802), respectively.

CDKN2B plays an important role in the regulation of hematopoietic progenitor cells and DNMT3A mutation is associated with CDKN2B promoter methylation. We analyzed the characteristics of DNMT3A mutations including their clinical significance in AML and their influence on promoter methylation and CDKN2B expression. Methods: A total of 142 adults, recently diagnosed with de novo AML, were enrolled in the study. Mutations in DNMT3A, CEBPA, and NPM1 were analyzed by bidirectional Sanger sequencing. We evaluated CDKN2B promoter methylation and expression using pyrosequencing and RT-qPCR. Results: We identified DNMT3A mutations in 19.7% (N=28) of enrolled patients with AML, which increased to 29.5% when analysis was restricted to cytogenetically normal-AML. Mutations were located on exons from 8-23, and the majority, including R882, were found to be present on exon 23. We also identified a novel frameshift mutation, c.1590delC, in AML with biallelic mutation of CEBPA. There was no significant difference in CDKN2B promoter methylation according to the presence or type of DNMT3A mutations. CDKN2B expression inversely correlated with CDKN2B promoter methylation and was significantly higher in AML with R882H mutation in DNMT3A. We demonstrated that DNMT3A mutation was associated with poor AML outcomes, especially in cytogenetically normal-AML. The DNMT3A mutation remained as the independent unfavorable prognostic factor after multivariate analysis. Conclusion: We characterized DNMT3A mutations in AML and revealed the association between the DNMT3A mutation and CDKN2B expression and clinical outcome.",,PMC7106122,['NOTNLM'],"['CDKN2B', 'DNMT3A', 'Methylation', 'R882H']",,['(c) 2020 Korean Society of Hematology.'],,"[""Authors' Disclosures of Potential Conflicts of Interest: No potential conflicts"", 'of interest relevant to this article were reported.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past few decades, significant progresses had led to the findings of new therapeutic approaches and the better understanding of the molecular complexity of this hematologic malignancy. Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) play a key role in the initiation, progression, regression, and drug resistance of different types of leukemia. The cellular and molecular characteristics of LSCs and their mechanism in the development of leukemia had not yet been specified. Therefore, determining their cellular and molecular characteristics and creating new approaches for targeted therapy of LSCs is crucial for the future of leukemia research. For this reason, the recognition of surface maker targets on the cell surface of LSCs has attracted much attention. CD33 has been detected on blasts in most AML patients, making them an interesting target for AML therapy. Genetic engineering of T cells with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T cell therapy) is a novel therapeutic strategy. It extends the range of antigens available for use in adoptive T-cell immunotherapy. This review will focus on CAR-T cell approaches as well as monoclonal antibody (mAB)-based therapy, the two antibody-based therapies utilized in AML treatment.",,PMC7106116,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloblastic leukemia', 'CAR-T cell', 'CAR-T cell immunotherapy', 'CD33+ leukemic stem cells', 'Cancer stem cells', 'mAB-based therapy']",,['(c) 2020 Korean Society of Hematology.'],,"[""Authors' Disclosures of Potential Conflicts of Interest: No potential conflicts"", 'of interest relevant to this article were reported.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNMT3A is of particular relevance to hematopoietic differentiation, because DNMT3A mutations are strongly related to hematopoietic malignancies. Additionally, DNMT3A deficiency has been reported to increase the hematopoietic stem cell pool by limiting their differentiation. Our previous study demonstrated that complete loss of DNMT3A resulted in anemia, while DNMT3A haploinsufficiency caused an elevated population of erythrocytes in the content of oncogenic KRAS. Since erythropoiesis is tightly regulated via the erythropoietin (EPO)-mediated RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway, the question arises whether DNMT3A cooperates with RAS signaling to modulate erythropoiesis. Human leukemia cell lines were used, with differentiation capabilities towards megakaryocyte and erythroid lineages. Overexpression of DNMT3A was found to enhance erythrocytic differentiation of K562 cells, while DNMT3A knockdown suppressed differentiation. Furthermore, higher DNMT3A expression was detected in late-stage mouse erythroblasts along with the DNMT3A translocation to the nucleus. Further studies demonstrated that both ERK1/2-DNMT3A interaction and serine-255 phosphorylation in DNMT3A led to DNMT3A translocation into the nucleus, and modulated erythrocytic differentiation. Our results not only explore the critical role of DNMT3A in erythropoiesis, but also provide a new insight into ERK1/2-DNMT3A interaction in the hematopoietic system.",,PMC7137067,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methyltransferase', 'DNMT3A', 'ERK1/2', 'Erythropoiesis']",,['AJTR Copyright (c) 2020.'],,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 8.,"A growing body of evidence suggests that macrophage immune checkpoint molecules are potential targets in the era of cancer immunotherapy. Here we showed that extracellular adenosine, an abundant metabolite in the tumor microenvironment, critically impedes the therapeutic efficacy of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against B-cell lymphoma. Using a syngeneic B-cell lymphoma model, we showed that host deficiency of adenosine 2A receptor (A2AR), but not A2BR, remarkably improved lymphoma control by anti-CD20 mAb therapy. Conditional deletion of A2AR in myeloid cells, and to a lesser extent in NK cells, augmented therapeutic efficacy of anti-CD20 mAb. Indeed, adenosine signaling impaired antibody-mediated cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) by macrophages and limited the generation of anti-lymphoma CD8(+) T cells. Pharmacological inhibition of A2AR overcame the adenosine-mediated negative regulation of ADCP by rituximab in a xeno-transplanted lymphoma model. Moreover, aberrant overexpression of CD39, an apical ecto-enzyme for adenosine generation, showed a negative impact on prognosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, as well as on preclinical efficacy of rituximab. Together, adenosine acts as a ""don't eat me signal"", and may be a potential target to harness anti-lymphoma immunity.","['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'EC 3.6.1.5 (Apyrase)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An increased repertoire of diagnostic imaging and histological techniques are becoming mainstream and promise to aid early diagnosis. Better risk stratification, via biomarkers and cytogenetics, has improved multidisciplinary treatment decisions.

Genetic and chemical inhibition of NLN impaired oxidative metabolism and disrupted the formation of respiratory chain supercomplexes (RCS). Furthermore, NLN interacted with the known RCS regulator, LETM1, and inhibition of NLN disrupted LETM1 complex formation.

RNA-seq data of AML samples were accessed from the TCGA database and then analyzed in the Wilcox test. AML survival-related genes were selected and an 8-gene signature-based risk score model was in turn constructed (including TET3, S100A4, BATF, CLEC11A, PTP4A3, SPATS2L, SDHA, and ATOX1 8 feature genes) using the multivariate Cox regression analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed on the 8 genes in the training set (p = 2.826e - 11) and the test set (p = 2.213e - 2), and there was a remarkable difference in survival between the high and low-risk samples. Meanwhile, ROC analysis was conducted and revealed the relative higher accuracy of the risk score model applied in both the training set (1-year AUC = 0.864; 3-year AUC = 0.85) and test set (1-year AUC = 0.685; 3-year AUC = 0.678). Our study helps to extend our knowledge of the potential methods for AML prognosis.HighlightsA prognostic 8-gene (including TET3, CLEC11A, ATOX1, S100A4, BATF, PTP4A3, SPATS2L and SDHA 8) signature for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was identified and validated.The influence of the expression of single gene in the model on the survival risk of AML patients was confirmed and the risk rate of 8 single-gene was compared.","['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTP4A3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*TCGA', '*gene signature', '*mRNA signal', '*prognosis prediction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, we found previously that P-gp-positive sublines of L1210 murine leukemia cells (R and T) but not parental P-gp-negative parental cells (S) are resistant to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressor tunicamycin (an N-glycosylation inhibitor). Here, we elucidated the mechanism of tunicamycin resistance in P-gp-positive cells. We found that tunicamycin at a sublethal concentration of 0.1 microM induced retention of the cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle only in the P-gp negative variant of L1210 cells. P-gp-positive L1210 cell variants had higher expression of the ER stress chaperone GRP78/BiP compared to that of P-gp-negative cells, in which tunicamycin induced larger upregulation of CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein). Transfection of the sensitive P-gp-negative cells with plasmids containing GRP78/BiP antagonized tunicamycin-induced CHOP expression and reduced tunicamycin-induced arrest of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Taken together, these data suggest that the resistance of P-gp-positive cells to tunicamycin is due to increased levels of GRP78/BiP, which is overexpressed in both resistant variants of L1210 cells.","['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)']",PMC7226765,['NOTNLM'],"['*CHOP', '*GRP78/BiP', '*multidrug resistance', '*p-glycoprotein', '*tunicamycin-induced ER stress']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms by which ATF4 couples metabolic stresses to specific transcriptional outputs remain unknown. Using functional genomics, we identified transcription factors that regulate the responses to distinct amino acid deprivation conditions. While ATF4 is universally required under amino acid starvation, our screens yielded a transcription factor, Zinc Finger and BTB domain-containing protein 1 (ZBTB1), as uniquely essential under asparagine deprivation. ZBTB1 knockout cells are unable to synthesize asparagine due to reduced expression of asparagine synthetase (ASNS), the enzyme responsible for asparagine synthesis. Mechanistically, ZBTB1 binds to the ASNS promoter and promotes ASNS transcription. Finally, loss of ZBTB1 sensitizes therapy-resistant T cell leukemia cells to L-asparaginase, a chemotherapeutic that depletes serum asparagine. Our work reveals a critical regulator of the nutrient stress response that may be of therapeutic value.","['0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (ZBTB1 protein, human)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 6.3.1.1 (Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase)']",PMC7219601,['NOTNLM'],"['*ATF4', '*CRISPR', '*asparaginase', '*cancer metabolism', '*genetic screen', '*leukemia', '*transcription']","['R01 CA178765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 CA247199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA163086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DP2 CA228042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007739/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 CA247026/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2020 Apr 8.,"BACKGROUND: We analyzed expression profiles of immune checkpoint receptors on T cell subsets and ligands on leukemic blasts in patients with B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). METHODS: Total 149 bone marrow (BM) samples obtained from 65 B-ALL patients with four different clinical status (41 at diagnosis, 54 in complete remission [CR], 34 in persistence, and 20 in relapse), and 32 BM control samples were prospectively enrolled. Expression of immune checkpoint receptor (programmed cell death protein-1 [PD-1]) on T cell subsets and ligands (PD-L1, PD-L2) on leukemic blasts was evaluated by flow cytometry, and was compared between patient subgroups. RESULTS: Relapsed patients demonstrated highest PD-1 expression proportion and intensity on CD3(+) CD4(+) T cells with statistical significance when compared to patients in persistence/CR/BM controls (p = .027/<.001/<.001 and .012/.001/<.001, respectively). Newly diagnosed patients showed significantly lower PD-1 expression proportion on CD3(+) CD4(+) T cells than relapsed patients (p < .001), but their intensity was not significantly different. Relapsed patients showed significantly higher PD-1 expression proportion and intensity on CD3(+) CD8(+) T cells than patients in CR/BM controls (p = .022/.045 and .049/.005, respectively), but PD-1 expression status on them were not significantly different between relapsed and newly diagnosed patients. PD-L1/L2 expression on leukemic blasts was not significantly different between patient subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: In BM aspirates from B-ALL patients, PD-1 expression on T-cell subsets is increased at diagnosis, and to a greater extent, at relapse. These data suggest the potential usefulness of PD-1 blockade in the treatment of B-ALL, particularly at relapse.","['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (PDCD1LG2 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 2 Protein)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-lymphoblastic leukemia', '*T cell subsets', '*flow cytometry', '*immune checkpoint PD-1']",,['(c) 2020 International Clinical Cytometry Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML is caused by reactivation of the JC virus. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 79-year-old man with a history of chronic B-cell lymphatic leukaemia (B-CLL) presented at our hospital with a neurological deficit of the left side of his body. He was initially diagnosed with a right-hemisphere stroke. Two months later he returned with progressive paresis and on an MRI of the brain we saw an increase in abnormalities of the white matter. On suspicion of PML we conducted PCR for JC virus on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which was negative. Histopathological investigations of a brain biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of PML, four months after he first presented. CONCLUSION: PML is a rare cause of sub-acute neurological symptoms. PML can be difficult to diagnose as a PCR of CSF for JC virus in the early stages of PML can give a false negative result. If PML is suspected, histological investigation of a brain biopsy is necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Progressieve multifocale leuko-encefalopathie.,,,,,,,,,,

10.1182/blood.2019003453.,"Most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are diagnosed with early-stage disease and managed with active surveillance. The individual course of patients with early-stage CLL is heterogeneous, and their probability of needing treatment is hardly anticipated at diagnosis. We aimed at developing an international prognostic score to predict time to first treatment (TTFT) in patients with CLL with early, asymptomatic disease (International Prognostic Score for Early-stage CLL [IPS-E]). Individual patient data from 11 international cohorts of patients with early-stage CLL (n = 4933) were analyzed to build and validate the prognostic score. Three covariates were consistently and independently correlated with TTFT: unmutated immunoglobulin heavy variable gene (IGHV), absolute lymphocyte count higher than 15 x 109/L, and presence of palpable lymph nodes. The IPS-E was the sum of the covariates (1 point each), and separated low-risk (score 0), intermediate-risk (score 1), and high-risk (score 2-3) patients showing a distinct TTFT. The score accuracy was validated in 9 cohorts staged by the Binet system and 1 cohort staged by the Rai system. The C-index was 0.74 in the training series and 0.70 in the aggregate of validation series. By meta-analysis of the training and validation cohorts, the 5-year cumulative risk for treatment start was 8.4%, 28.4%, and 61.2% among low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk patients, respectively. The IPS-E is a simple and robust prognostic model that predicts the likelihood of treatment requirement in patients with early-stage CLL. The IPS-E can be useful in clinical management and in the design of early intervention clinical trials.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['Blood. 2020 May 21;135(21):1820-1821.

The extent to which host characteristics, including pigmentary phenotype and UV radiation exposure, contribute is unknown. Objective: To identify and validate independent risk factors for keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT, including those associated with the transplant and the host. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study analyzed a consecutive sample of alloHCT recipients from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2014, at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota (n = 872) and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio (n = 147). Participants from the Mayo Clinic were randomly allocated (2:1) into discovery (n = 581) and validation (n = 291) cohorts. Time to first keratinocyte carcinoma and information about transplant- and host-associated risk factors were extracted. A multivariate keratinocyte carcinoma risk model was created using a stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression model with P </= .05 for entry that incorporated all covariates that were individually statistically significant at alpha = 0.05 in the discovery cohort. The risk model was first internally validated using the Mayo Clinic validation cohort and then externally validated using the independent cohort of alloHCT recipients at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. Data were analyzed from March 13, 2018, to June 12, 2019. Exposures: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was time to development of the first cutaneous keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT; secondary outcome, time to development of the first individual basal and/or squamous cell carcinoma after alloHCT. Results: Of the 872 alloHCT recipients identified in the Mayo Clinic cohort (520 men [59.6%]; mean [SD] age, 48.3 [12.6] years), 95 (10.9%) developed keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT during 5349 person-years of follow-up. Of the 147 alloHCT recipients in the exernal validation cohort (86 men [58.5%]; mean [SD] age, 47.9 [17.5] years), 18 (12.2%) developed keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT in 880 person-years of follow up. Risk factors independently associated with keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT included age (hazard ratio [HR] per 10 years, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.21-2.42), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (HR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.20-5.09), clinically photodamaged skin (HR, 3.47; 95% CI, 1.87-6.41), and history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (HR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.41-5.91). Harrell concordance statistics were 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72-0.90) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.74-0.98) for internal and external validation of the keratinocyte carcinoma risk model, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found validated independent risk factors for keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT that are enriched with host- compared with transplant-associated risk factors. These findings highlight the importance of assessing host-associated risk factors for keratinocyte carcinoma in patients eligible for alloHCT. Future studies should examine whether keratinocyte carcinoma risk stratification before alloHCT may inform long-term surveillance strategies.",,PMC7142796,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the interpretation of the results is laborious and operator dependent. Furthermore, the obtained results exhibit inter- and intravariations among specialists. Therefore, it is important to develop a more objective and automated analysis system. Several deep learning models have been developed and applied in medical image analysis but not in the field of hematological histology, especially for bone marrow smear applications. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a deep learning model (BMSNet) for assisting hematologists in the interpretation of bone marrow smears for faster diagnosis and disease monitoring. METHODS: From January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018, 122 bone marrow smears were photographed and divided into a development cohort (N=42), a validation cohort (N=70), and a competition cohort (N=10). The development cohort included 17,319 annotated cells from 291 high-resolution photos. In total, 20 photos were taken for each patient in the validation cohort and the competition cohort. This study included eight annotation categories: erythroid, blasts, myeloid, lymphoid, plasma cells, monocyte, megakaryocyte, and unable to identify. BMSNet is a convolutional neural network with the YOLO v3 architecture, which detects and classifies single cells in a single model. Six visiting staff members participated in a human-machine competition, and the results from the FCM were regarded as the ground truth. RESULTS: In the development cohort, according to 6-fold cross-validation, the average precision of the bounding box prediction without consideration of the classification is 67.4%. After removing the bounding box prediction error, the precision and recall of BMSNet were similar to those of the hematologists in most categories. In detecting more than 5% of blasts in the validation cohort, the area under the curve (AUC) of BMSNet (0.948) was higher than the AUC of the hematologists (0.929) but lower than the AUC of the pathologists (0.985). In detecting more than 20% of blasts, the AUCs of the hematologists (0.981) and pathologists (0.980) were similar and were higher than the AUC of BMSNet (0.942). Further analysis showed that the performance difference could be attributed to the myelodysplastic syndrome cases. In the competition cohort, the mean value of the correlations between BMSNet and FCM was 0.960, and the mean values of the correlations between the visiting staff and FCM ranged between 0.952 and 0.990. CONCLUSIONS: Our deep learning model can assist hematologists in interpreting bone marrow smears by facilitating and accelerating the detection of hematopoietic cells. However, a detailed morphological interpretation still requires trained hematologists.",,PMC7177428,['NOTNLM'],"['artificial intelligence', 'bone marrow examination', 'deep learning', 'leukemia', 'myelodysplastic syndrome']",,"['(c)Yi-Ying Wu, Tzu-Chuan Huang, Ren-Hua Ye, Wen-Hui Fang, Shiue-Wei Lai,', 'Ping-Ying Chang, Wei-Nung Liu, Tai-Yu Kuo, Cho-Hao Lee, Wen-Chiuan Tsai, Chin', 'Lin.

Epub 2020 Apr 27.,"Introduction: The field of immunotherapy has witnessed considerable progress over the last two decades. Beginning with the ability to conceptualize CAR T cell therapy as immunotherapeutic approach, to effortlessly genetically modifying T cells, we have now reached the stage of mass production for clinical needs, all within less than quarter of a century.Areas covered: CAR T cell therapy has been tremendously successful in acute leukemia patients, specifically even in relapsed/refractory disease states. However, similar success is yet to be realized in other malignancies. This review article covers the challenges encountered with the current CD19-targeted CARs, as well as specific obstacles faced by adoptive therapy in solid tumors. It also discusses various strategies to counteract these problems.Expert opinion: CD19-directed trials in the past decade have exposed vulnerabilities in the current CAR T cell design, particularly concerning safety aspects, antigen escape, and T cell persistence. Building on these lessons and factoring in the unique challenges associated with immunotherapy in solid tumors will help generate CARs designed for future trials. Also, research related to the production of allogeneic CAR T cell products will boost the patient reach of this unique technology and possibly reduce financial burden.",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR', '*CAR T cells', '*Chimeric antigen therapy', '*immunotherapy', '*next steps in adoptive immunotherapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 21.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is curative for bone marrow failure in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA), but the presence of a malignant transformation is associated with a poor prognosis and the management of these patients is still challenging. We analyzed outcome of 74 FA patients with a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 35), acute leukemia (n = 35) or with cytogenetic abnormalities (n = 4), who underwent allo-HSCT from 1999 to 2016 in EBMT network. Type of diagnosis, pre-HSCT cytoreductive therapies and related toxicities, disease status pre-HSCT, donor type, and conditioning regimen were considered as main variables potentially influencing outcome. The 5-year OS and EFS were 42% (30-53%) and 39% (27-51%), respectively. Patients transplanted in CR showed better OS compared with those transplanted in presence of an active malignant disease (OS:71%[48-95] vs 37% [24-50],P = .04), while none of the other variables considered had an impact. Twenty-two patients received pre-HSCT cytoreduction and 9/22 showed a grade 3-4 toxicity, without any lethal event or negative influence on survival after HSCT(OS:toxicity pre-HSCT 48% [20-75%] vs no-toxicity 51% [25-78%],P = .98). The cumulative incidence of day-100 grade II-IV a-GvHD and of 5-year c-GvHD were 38% (26-50%) and 40% (28-52%). Non-relapse-related mortality and incidence of relapse at 5-years were 40% (29-52%) and 21% (11-30%) respectively, without any significant impact of the tested variables. Causes of death were transplant-related events in most patients (34 out of the 42 deaths, 81%). This analysis confirms the poor outcome of transformed FA patients and identifies the importance of achieving CR pre-HSCT, suggesting that, in a newly diagnosed transformed FA patient, a cytoreductive approach pre-HSCT should be considered if a donor have been secured.",,,,,,"['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,"['Severe Aplastic Anemia and Chronic Malignancies Working Parties of European Blood', 'and Marrow Transplantation group']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bromodomains and extra-terminal (BET) protein inhibitors, such as JQ1 and ARV-825, are promising cancer therapeutic agents that can be used by targeting c-Myc. A recent work reported that JQ1 effectively attenuates ALL in vitro by suppressing cell proliferation and accelerating apoptosis. The purpose of this research was to probe into the potential mechanism of how JQ1 inhibits ALL cell proliferation in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cell viability of ALL cells were measured by CTG after treatment by JQ1. Cell cycle analysis was done by EdU and PI staining. Cell apoptosis was assessed by Annexin V/PI staining. Glycolysis was detected using Seahorse and LC-MS kits. The expression of glycolytic rate-limiting enzymes was assessed by RNA-seq, qRT-PCR, and Western blot. RESULTS JQ1 suppressed cell proliferation by arresting the cell cycle and inducing the apoptosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia cells. JQ1 inhibited cell proliferation of B-ALL cells by restraining glycolysis. Conversely, the cell cycle block of B-ALL cells induced by JQ1 was partially abolished after pretreatment with 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), an inhibitor of glycolysis. Furthermore, JQ1 restrained the glycolysis of B-ALL cell lines by remarkably downregulating the rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis, such as hexokinase 2, phosphofructokinase, and lactate dehydrogenase A. Moreover, the cell cycle arrest was reversed in B-ALL cells with overexpressed c-Myc treated by JQ1, which is involved in the enhancement of glycolysis. CONCLUSIONS The BET inhibitor JQ1 suppresses the proliferation of ALL by inhibiting c-Myc-mediated glycolysis, thus providing a new strategy for the treatment of ALL.","['0 ((+)-JQ1 compound)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (bromodomain and extra-terminal domain protein, human)']",PMC7165247,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2020 Apr 7.,"CD73 is a membrane-bound enzyme that catalyzes the extracellular conversion of adenosine monophosphate to adenosine. Adenosine is thought to play a role in promoting tumor growth and survival together with suppressing the host immune responses, which contribute to the multistep process of tumorigenesis. Here, we studied the expression of this antigen in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The expression of CD73 was analyzed by multiparametric flow cytometry on normal and pathological B-cells from peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from 71 patients with CLL. Pathological B-cells expressed significantly lower levels of CD73 than normal B-cells (p<0.01). Patients with splenomegaly showed a higher expression of CD73 on pathological B-cells than patients without splenomegaly (p<0.05). The expression of CD73 also correlated with beta-2-microglobulin levels (p<0.05). Clinically, patients with higher levels of CD73 versus those with lower expression presented with shorter overall survival (median OS of 65 vs. 113 months, p<0.05). Our data indicate that CD73 may play a role in CLL pathophysiology, is correlated with poor clinical and biological prognostic factors and may be of potential value as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'EC 3.1.3.5 (NT5E protein, human)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the aim was to study erlotinib efflux by ABCG2 wild-type (wt) and ABCG2 polymorphic variants in the K562 cell line. The chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cell line, neither expressing EGFR nor ABCG2, was transduced with vectors containing the ABCG2 wt, the SNPs: 34 G > A and 421 C > A, or with empty vector (K562/ve). ABCG2-expressing cells were enriched using magnetic sorting and the expression was verified using flow cytometry. Intracellular erlotinib concentrations were analyzed by LC-MS/MS after incubation with 1 micromol/L erlotinib for 60 minutes. All recombinant cell lines were confirmed carriers of the vector and expressed ABCG2. Differences in intracellular erlotinib concentrations were observed between K562/ve and K562 ABCG2 wt and between K562/ve and K562 ABCG2 34G > A (both P </= .001, one-way ANOVA with Tukey HSD post hoc test), indicating that the cell lines carrying ABCG2 wt and ABCG2 34G > A actively transports erlotinib out of the cells. The ABCG2 34G > A cell line had a higher transport capacity compared with ABCG2 wt after adjusting for ABCG2 expression (P = .024, t test). No differences were observed between K562/ve and K562 ABCG2 421 C > A.

Epub 2020 Apr 7.,"Several genetic and molecular markers are general predictors of outcome in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but only few are predictive of outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Novel markers are needed to improve treatment decisions regarding HSCT. CD105 (endoglin) is a type I transmembrane protein capable of activating endothelial cells. Moreover, CD105 mediates stem cell properties of hematopoietic stem cells and enables repopulation within the bone marrow. Expression of CD105 on vessels of solid tumors and on AML blasts is correlated with poor prognosis. We recently demonstrated that CD105 expression is an independent predictor of overall survival in AML. However, its role in patients receiving intensive treatment with consecutive allogenic transplantation has not been assessed. Using flow cytometry, we analyzed primary samples of 41 patients who underwent HSCT. Using the previously defined SFI cut-off of 5.2, we identified differences in CD105 expression regarding FAB classification and NCCN risk score. Moreover, we detected differences regarding transplant indication and WHO classification with regards to CD105 surface levels.

Epub 2020 Apr 7.,"OBJECTIVES: Currently, lncRNA plays an important role in the occurrence and development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), including SNHG5. However, the role and mechanism of SNHG5 in AML remains unclear. In this study, we explored the regulatory mechanism of SNHG5 in the development of AML. METHODS AND RESULTS: QRT-PCR was used to investigate the expression of SNHG5, miR-489-3p, and SOX. The proliferation and apoptosis of AML cells were analyzed by cell transfection, cell counting kit-8 (CCK8), and flow cytometric analysis. Moreover, the expression analysis of marker proteins was detected by western blot. Through luciferase activity assay, RNA pull-down, and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP), we proved that SNHG5 could bind miR-489-3p and SOX4 which might be the target gene of miR-489-3p. RESULTS: We first found that SNHG5 was up-regulated in both AML patient bone marrow samples and various AML cell lines. Second, we found that knockdown of SNHG5 inhibited proliferation of AML cells and promoted apoptosis. It was found that SNHG5 could bind miR-489-3p, and the relative expression of SNHG5 was negatively correlated with miR-489-3p. Further results suggested that SOX4 might be the target gene of miR-489-3p. Finally, our experimental data indicated that knockdown of SNHG5 could reduce the tumor volume and down-regulated SOX4 levels in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that SNHG5 affected the expression of SOX4 through binding miR-489-3p to regulate proliferation and apoptosis of AML, which might act as a prospective prognostic biological marker and a promising therapeutic target for AML.","['0 (MIRN489 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (SOX4 protein, human)', '0 (SOXC Transcription Factors)', '0 (long non-coding RNA SNHG5, human)']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Apoptosis', 'LncRNA', 'SHNG5', 'SOX4', 'miR-489-3p']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Poland from 2005 to 2018. Methods: All 41 patients diagnosed with APL in Poland during the analysis period were eligible for the study. In period I (2005-2015), 33 patients were treated with chemotherapy and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and in period II (2015-2018), 3 patients (high risk) received induction chemotherapy with ATRA and arsenic trioxide (ATO), and 5 patients (standard risk) received ATRA and ATO without chemotherapy. Results: Probability of 5-years overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) was 0.819 +/- 0.069, 0.831 +/- 0.063, and 0.961 +/- 0.037, respectively, in the whole cohort. Four (11%) early deaths were observed. One patient died of severe infection in the course of disease progression. Relapse occurred in one patient, who died finally because of disease progression. All events occurred in the patients from period I. Variant APL was identified in one patient (successfully treated with chemotherapy with ATRA) and complex translocation in one patient (the only patient with relapse). Additional chromosomal aberrations were found in 26% of patients and FLT3-ITD mutation was detected in 44% of patients; none of those changes influenced clinical outcome. Conclusion: Treatment outcome in the analyzed group is similar to the results reported by other study groups. The main cause of death was coagulation disorders in the early stage of disease.

Accurate biomarkers are needed to improve prognostic assessment. Glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 1 (GOT1) is essential for cell proliferation and apoptosis by regulating cell's metabolic dependency on glucose. It is unclear whether the expression level of GOT1 has clinical implications in AML. Therefore, we analyzed the data of 155 AML patients with GOT1 expression information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Among them, 84 patients were treated with chemotherapy alone, while 71 received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). In both treatment groups, high GOT1 expression was associated with shorter event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) (all P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis identified several independent risk factors for both EFS and OS in the chemotherapy-only group, including high GOT1 expression, age >/=60 years, white blood cell count >/=15 x 10(9)/L, bone marrow blasts >/=70%, and DNMT3A, RUNX1 or TP53 mutations (all P < 0.05); but in the allo-HSCT group, the only independent risk factor for survival was high GOT1 expression (P < 0.05 for both EFS and OS). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that the genes related to GOT1 expression were mainly concentrated in ""hematopoietic cell lineage"" and ""leukocyte transendothelial migration"" signaling pathways. Collectively, GOT1 expression may be a useful prognostic indicator in AML, especially in patients who have undergone allo-HSCT.",,PMC7105742,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'chemotherapy', 'glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 1', 'prognosis']",,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Cheng, Dai, Zeng, Liu, Cui, Qian, Si, Huang, Pang, Ye, Shi and', 'Fu.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of ABL/Src family kinases is found in ~10% of Ph-like ALL, which can be therapeutically targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. LYN is a member of the ABL/Src-tyrosine kinase family. Somatic LYN rearrangements are found in 5 cases of hematopoietic malignancies so far, although none of them were treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Case presentation: A 6-year-old boy with relapsed B-ALL had no response to reinduction chemotherapy. He was then treated with the ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib and achieved complete remission within 2 weeks. Haploidentical allogenic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) was subsequently performed and maintenance therapy with dasatinib initiated 8 weeks post-transplantation. He has been in minimal residual disease negative remission for 10 months after allo-HSCT. Result: His bone marrow karyotype showed a balanced translocation between chromosomes 8 and 17, leading to a NCOR1-LYN fusion gene confirmed with sequencing.

This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the EORTC-Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL17 [phase III]) module, a newly developed assessment on CLL patients' HRQoL, among Chinese CLL patients. METHODS: The Chinese CLL17, comprised of three subscales (symptom burden [SB], physical condition [PC] and worries/fears [WF]), was provided by the developer team through EORTC. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted to collect data. The classical traditional theory (CTT) and the item response theory (IRT) were used to evaluate the psychometric properties of CLL17. Internal consistency reliability was determined by the Cronbach's alpha and item-total correlation. Dimensionality was verified through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Convergent validity was also assessed. The generalized partial credit model was used for the IRT. The difficulty, discrimination, item fit, and differential item functioning (DIF) were calculated to assess the instrument's psychometric properties. RESULTS: In all, 318 patients, aged between 26 and 82 years, completed the questionnaire. A good level of internal reliability was achieved (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92). The item-total correlation coefficient ranged from 0.46 to 0.72. There was a mid-to-high correlation between CLL17 and domains of EQ-5D and QLQ-C30. The IRT model showed a satisfactory homogeneity, item fit and good discrimination of items, except for item 4, 6 and 16 (< 1.0). low information provided by item 16 and 17. SB and PC provided more information with theta > 0, whereas WF provided more information with theta < 0. Item 17 perform inconsistently for respondents from different age groups (DIF).

However, biological functions and the underlying molecular mechanism of circRNAs in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain largely unclear so far. METHODS: Here, we investigated the expression pattern of circRNAs in four pairs of TNBC tissues and paracancerous normal tissues using RNA-sequencing. The expression and prognostic significance of circSEPT9 were evaluated with qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization in two TNBC cohorts. The survival curves were drawn by the Kaplan-Meier method, and statistical significance was estimated with the log-rank test. A series of in vitro and in vivo functional experiments were executed to investigate the role of circSEPT9 in the carcinogenesis and development of TNBC. Mechanistically, we explored the potential regulatory effects of E2F1 and EIF4A3 on biogenesis of circSEPT9 with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. Furthermore, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), luciferase reporter and biotin-coupled RNA pull-down assays were implemented to verify the relationship between the circSEPT9 and miR-637 in TNBC. RESULTS: Increased expression of circSEPT9 was found in TNBC tissues, which was positively correlated with advanced clinical stage and poor prognosis. Knockdown of circSEPT9 significantly suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells, induced apoptosis and autophagy in TNBC cells as well as inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Whereas up-regulation of circSEPT9 exerted opposite effects. Further mechanism research demonstrated that circSEPT9 could regulate the expression of Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) via sponging miR-637 and activate LIF/Stat3 signaling pathway involved in progression of TNBC. More importantly, we discovered that E2F1 and EIF4A3 might promote the biogenesis of circSEPT9. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal that the circSEPT9 mediated by E2F1 and EIF4A3 facilitates the carcinogenesis and development of triple-negative breast cancer through circSEPT9/miR-637/LIF axis. Therefore, circSEPT9 could be used as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutical target for TNBC.","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Circular)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4A)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (EIF4A3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SEPTIN9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Septins)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",PMC7137343,['NOTNLM'],"['*E2F1', '*EIF4A3', '*Triple-negative breast cancer', '*circSEPT9', '*miR-637']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
