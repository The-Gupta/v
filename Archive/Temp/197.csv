The diagnosis without central nervous system (CNS) involvement was confirmed on admission, and chemotherapy was initiated according to the Children Cancer Group (CCG) 1882 protocol for high-risk-group leukemia. During neutropenia amphotericin B (AMB) (1 mg/kg of body weight/day) was initiated for presumed fungal infection when a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed multiple nodular densities. After 3 weeks of AMB therapy, a follow-up chest CT revealed progression of the pulmonary nodules. The patient subsequently suffered a seizure, and a CT scan of the brain was consistent with infarction or hemorrhage. Because of progression of pulmonary lesions while receiving AMB, antifungal therapy was changed to liposomal AMB (LAMB) (6 mg/kg/day). Despite 26 days of LAMB, the patient continued to have intermittent fever, and CT and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated findings consistent with a brain abscess. Aspiration of brain abscess was performed and the Gomori methenamine silver stain was positive for hyphal elements. Culture of this material grew Acrophialophora fusispora. Lung biopsy showed necrotizing fungal pneumonia with negative culture. The dosage of LAMB was increased, and itraconazole (ITRA) was added; subsequently LAMB was discontinued and therapy was continued with ITRA alone. The patient demonstrated clinical and radiological improvement. In vitro, the isolate was susceptible to low concentrations of AMB and ITRA. A. fusispora is a thermotolerant, fast-growing fungus with neurotropic potential. We report the first case of human infection involving the CNS. Acrophialophora resembles Paecilomyces but differs in having colonies that become dark and in the development of phialides along the sides or at the tips of echinulate brown conidiophores. Conidia are borne in long chains and are smooth or ornamented with fine-to-coarse echinulations, sometimes in spiral bands. The taxonomy of the genus Acrophialophora is reviewed, and Acrophialophora nainiana and Acrophialophora levis are considered as synonyms of A. fusispora.","['Al-Mohsen, I Z', 'Sutton, D A', 'Sigler, L', 'Almodovar, E', 'Mahgoub, N', 'Frayha, H', 'Al-Hajjar, S', 'Rinaldi, M G', 'Walsh, T J']","['Al-Mohsen IZ', 'Sutton DA', 'Sigler L', 'Almodovar E', 'Mahgoub N', 'Frayha H', 'Al-Hajjar S', 'Rinaldi MG', 'Walsh TJ']","['King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. imohsen@kfshrc.edu.sa']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,IM,"['Brain Abscess/*microbiology/pathology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Mitosporic Fungi/*classification/drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*microbiology/pathology']",PMC87638,2000/12/02 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/02 11:00'],"['2000/12/02 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/02 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JCM.38.12.4569-4576.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 2000 Dec;38(12):4569-76. doi: 10.1128/JCM.38.12.4569-4576.2000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An HTLV-I infection is associated with adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL) and with tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP). Antibody tests from 5.5 million European blood donors have shown that the HTLV prevalence is low, ranging from 0 to 0.02%. This paper examines costs and effects associated with the intervention of testing all new blood donors for HTLV. METHODS: A mathematical model was used to calculate the number of cases prevented by the intervention. For a given prevalence of HTLV in the blood donor population, the model calculates the number of recipients infected by transfusion, and the number of partners and offspring that will in turn be infected. The model then calculates the number of subjects with disease due to HTLV-I infection and the number of deaths from disease. From these numbers the measures of cost and effect are calculated. RESULTS: Testing all new blood donors for HTLV is calculated to cost US$ 9.2 million per life saved, or US$ 420,000 per quality adjusted life year gained by the intervention, when the HTLV prevalence among donors is 1 per 100,000. When the prevalence among donors is 10 per 100,000 the intervention will cost US$ 0.9 million per life saved, or US$ 41,000 per quality adjusted life year gained. The same analysis shows that testing blood donors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) saves money when the HIV prevalence among donors is above 0.7 per 100,000. CONCLUSION: For Norway, studies suggest a willingness to pay to save a statistical life of approximately US$ 1.2 million. The costs fall under this value when the number of infected persons is > or = 8 per 100,000 donors. The results are uncertain because of the uncertainty in HTLV infection and disease parameters.","['Stigum, H', 'Magnus, P', 'Samdal, H H', 'Nord, E']","['Stigum H', 'Magnus P', 'Samdal HH', 'Nord E']","['Department of Population Health Sciences, National Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway.

These procedures involved site-specific triazolation or N-methylimidazolation at position C(4), followed by hydroxylamination and deblocking with MeOH-NH(3). Nucleosides 5a,b,d-h were selectively converted to the corresponding 5'-monophosphates 6a,b,d-h with the aid of the wheat shoot phosphotransferase system. Conformation of each nucleoside in D(2)O solution, deduced from (1)H NMR spectra and confirmed by molecular mechanics calculations, showed the pentose ring to exist predominantly in the conformation S (C-2'-endo) and the N(4)-OH group as the cis rotamer. Cell growth inhibition was studied with two L5178Y murine leukemia cell lines, parental and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FdUrd)-resistant, the latter 70-fold less sensitive toward FdUrd than the former. With FdUrd-resistant L5178Y cells, 5-fluoro-N(4)-hydroxy-2'-deoxycytidine (5e) caused almost 3-fold stronger growth inhibition than FdUrd; 5e was only some 3-fold weaker growth inhibitor of the resistant cells than of the parental cells. Thymidylate synthase inhibition was studied with two forms of the enzyme differing in sensitivities toward 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate (FdUMP), isolated from parental and FdUrd-resistant L1210 cell lines. All N(4)-hydroxy-dCMP (6a,b,d-h) and dUMP analogues studied were competitive vs dUMP inhibitors of the enzyme. Analogues 6b,d-h and 5-hydroxymethyl-dUMP, similar to N(4)-hydroxy-dCMP (6a) and FdUMP, were also N(5), N(10)-methylenetetrahydrofolate-dependent, hence mechanism-based, slow-binding inhibitors. 5-Chloro-dUMP, 5-bromo-dUMP, and 5-iodo-dUMP, similar to dTMP, did not cause a time-dependent inactivation of the enzyme. Instead, they behaved as classic inhibitors of tritium release from [5-(3)H]dUMP. 5-Bromo-dUMP and 5-iodo-dUMP showed substrate activity independent of N(5), N(10)-methylenetetrahydrofolate in the thymidylate synthase-catalyzed dehalogenation reaction. The =N-OH substituent of the pyrimidine C(4) prevented the enzyme-catalyzed release from the C(5) of Br(-) and I(-) (the same shown previously for H(+)). While FdUMP and 6a showed a higher affinity and greater inactivation power with the parental cell than FdUrd-resistant cell enzyme, an opposite relationship could be seen with 5-hydroxymethyl-dUMP.","['Felczak, K', 'Miazga, A', 'Poznanski, J', 'Bretner, M', 'Kulikowski, T', 'Dzik, J M', 'Golos, B', 'Zielinski, Z', 'Ciesla, J', 'Rode, W']","['Felczak K', 'Miazga A', 'Poznanski J', 'Bretner M', 'Kulikowski T', 'Dzik JM', 'Golos B', 'Zielinski Z', 'Ciesla J', 'Rode W']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences, 5a Pawinskiego Street, 02-106 Warszawa, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/chemistry', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine Monophosphate/analogs & derivatives/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Idoxuridine/chemistry', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/12/02 00:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2000/12/02 00:00'],"['2000/12/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/02 00:00 [entrez]']","['jm000975u [pii]', '10.1021/jm000975u [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 2000 Nov 30;43(24):4647-56. doi: 10.1021/jm000975u.,"[""0 (5-fluoro-N(4)-hydroxy-2'-deoxycytidine)"", '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '1032-65-1 (Deoxycytidine Monophosphate)', '114333-22-1 (N(4)-hydroxy-5-fluorodeoxycytidine monophosphate)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'LGP81V5245 (Idoxuridine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We used flow cytometry to estimate cellular hypoxia and proliferation based on in vivo pulse-labelling with a mixture of 2-nitroimidazole linked to theophylline (NITP) and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). The leukaemic cells were identified with the RM124 antibody. In rats inoculated with leukaemic cells the fraction of RM124+ cells was significantly increased from day 20 onwards in the spleen and from day 27 in the bone marrow and liver, reaching a level of 65-87% in these organs at day 32. At day 32, the NITP+ fraction of RM124+ cells had increased significantly in the bone marrow and spleen to 88% and 90%, respectively. The corresponding fractions of NITP+ normal cells reached 63% and 65%, respectively. From day 13 to day 32, the DNA-synthesizing (BrdUrd+) fraction of RM124+ cells in the bone marrow decreased significantly from 52% to 25%, and of normal cells from about 20% to 6%. In the bone marrow and spleen at day 27 and 32, the S-phase and G2/M-phase fractions according to DNA content were higher for the NITP+ than for the NITP- cells. This could partly be explained by an impaired cell cycle progression due to hypoxia. Nevertheless, we found indications of leukaemic cells that were simultaneously labelled with NITP and BrdUrd, in the bone marrow and spleen. These latter findings suggest that in contrast to normal cells some of the leukaemic cells can proliferate even during hypoxia, and this subpopulation may consequently renew and expand the leukaemic cell load.","['Jensen, P O', 'Mortensen, B T', 'Hodgkiss, R J', 'Iversen, P O', 'Christensen, I J', 'Helledie, N', 'Larsen, J K']","['Jensen PO', 'Mortensen BT', 'Hodgkiss RJ', 'Iversen PO', 'Christensen IJ', 'Helledie N', 'Larsen JK']","['Department L, Finsen Center, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Oxygen/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC6496496,2000/12/02 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/02 11:00'],"['2000/12/02 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/02 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2184.2000.00183.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2000 Dec;33(6):381-95. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2184.2000.00183.x.,['S88TT14065 (Oxygen)'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a retrospective analysis of the long-term clinical outcome. There were 52 males and 30 females with a median age of 32 years (range 18-59 years). Prior to transplantation, 36 patients were in complete remission (CR), 34 in partial remission (PR), and 12 had refractory disease after salvage therapy.

The current study defines the incidence and the risk factors for the occurrence of TTP in 131 consecutive leukemic children who were transplanted between January 1994 and December 1997 at four Italian pediatric centers. Patients with ALL (101), AML (21), MDS (9), underwent an HLA-identical sibling BMT (82) or an HLA-identical unrelated BMT (49), receiving a conditioning regimen consisting of high-dose chemotherapy in 24 patients and of F-TBI combined with high-dose chemotherapy in 107 patients. The diagnosis of TTP was retrospectively evaluated on the basis of parallel criteria. TTP treatment varied according to the protocol of each treatment center. Twenty-eight of 131 patients (21.4%) developed TTP at a median of 46 days (range 21-80) after BMT. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the risk of TTP was higher in patients who underwent unrelated BMT (P value = 0.02). Acute GVHD, stage of disease at BMT, conditioning with TBI, gender, age, did not appear to be associated with the occurrence of TTP. As to the outcome, TTP resolved in 19 patients while in nine it was the principal cause of death (32.1%). In patients with TTP, LDH peak value was the only statistically significant factor (P = 0.001) related to severe TTP. In conclusion, our experience demonstrates that leukemic children undergoing BMT, especially from an unrelated donor, should be carefully assessed for TTP which appears to be a severe and relatively common transplant-related complication when strict diagnostic criteria are applied.","['Uderzo, C', 'Fumagalli, M', 'De Lorenzo, P', 'Busca, A', 'Vassallo, E', 'Bonanomi, S', 'Lanino, E', 'Dini, G', 'Varotto, S', 'Messina, C', 'Miniero, R', 'Valsecchi, M G', 'Balduzzi, A']","['Uderzo C', 'Fumagalli M', 'De Lorenzo P', 'Busca A', 'Vassallo E', 'Bonanomi S', 'Lanino E', 'Dini G', 'Varotto S', 'Messina C', 'Miniero R', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Balduzzi A']","['Clinica Pediatrica Ospedale S Gerardo di Monza, Universita degli Studi di Milano Bicocca, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Fibrinolytic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia/complications/*therapy', 'Male', 'Plasma', 'Plasmapheresis', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Polydeoxyribonucleotides/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Purpura, Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic/blood/epidemiology/*etiology/therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/12/02 11:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2000/12/02 11:00'],"['2000/12/02 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/02 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702648 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000 Nov;26(9):1005-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702648.,"['0 (Fibrinolytic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Polydeoxyribonucleotides)', '438HCF2X0M (defibrotide)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",,,40,,,,,,,,,

These two alkaloids, which only differ by the respective orientation of their indole and quinoline rings, display potent cytotoxic activities against tumour cells and present antibacterial and antiparasitic properties. Our previous molecular studies indicated that these two natural products intercalate into DNA and interfere with the catalytic activity of human topoisomerase II. Here we have extended the study of their mechanism of action at the cellular level. Murine and human leukemia cells were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the drugs and their effects on the cell cycle were measured by flow cytometry. Cryptolepine, and to a lesser extent neocryptolepine, provoke a massive accumulation of P388 murine leukemia cells in the G2/M phase. With HL-60 human leukemia cells, the treatment with cryptolepine leads to the appearance of a hypo-diploid DNA content peak (sub-G1) characteristic of the apoptotic cell population. With both P388 and HL-60 cells, cryptolepine proved about four times more toxic than its isomer. But the use of the HL-60/MX2 cell line resistant to the anticancer drug mitoxantrone suggests that topoisomerase II may not represent the essential cellular target for the alkaloids, which are both only two times less toxic to the resistant HL-60/MX2 cells compared to the parental cells. The capacity of the drugs to induce apoptosis of HL-60 human leukemia cells was examined by complementary biochemical techniques. Western blotting analysis revealed that cryptolepine, but not neocryptolepine, induces cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase but both alkaloids induce the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. The cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase observed with cryptolepine correlates with the appearance of a marked sub-G1 peak in the cell cycle experiments. The proteolytic activity of Asp-Glu-Val-Asp- or Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-caspases was found to be enhanced much more strongly with cryptolepine than with its isomer, as expected from their different cytotoxic potential. Despite the activation of the caspase cascade, we did not detect internucleosomal cleavage of DNA in the HL-60 cells treated with the alkaloids. Altogether, the results shed light on the mechanism of action of these two plant alkaloids.","['Dassonneville, L', 'Lansiaux, A', 'Wattelet, A', 'Wattez, N', 'Mahieu, C', 'Van Miert, S', 'Pieters, L', 'Bailly, C']","['Dassonneville L', 'Lansiaux A', 'Wattelet A', 'Wattez N', 'Mahieu C', 'Van Miert S', 'Pieters L', 'Bailly C']","['INSERM U-524 and Laboratoire de Pharmacologie Antitumorale du Centre Oscar Lambret, IRCL, Place de Verdun, 59045, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indole Alkaloids', '*Indoles', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Mitoxantrone/pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', '*Quinolines']",,2000/12/02 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/12/02 11:00'],"['2000/12/02 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/02 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(00)00805-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-2999(00)00805-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2000 Dec 1;409(1):9-18. doi: 10.1016/s0014-2999(00)00805-0.,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Indole Alkaloids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (neocryptolepine)', '480-26-2 (cryptolepine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Discrete values are used to provide an easily interpretable description of differential expression. Binning cutoffs for each sample type are chosen automatically, depending on the desired false-positive rate for the predictions of differential expression. Confidence levels are derived for the statement that changes in observed levels represent true changes in expression. We have a novel method for calculating this confidence, which gives better results than the standard methods. Our method reflects the broader change of focus in the field from studying a few genes with many replicates to studying many (possibly thousands) of genes simultaneously, but with relatively few replicates. Our approach differs from standard methods in that it exploits the fact that there are many genes on the arrays. These are used to estimate for each sample type an appropriate distribution that is employed to control the false-positive rate of the predictions made. Satisfactory results can be obtained using this method with as few as two replicates. RESULTS: The method is illustrated through applications to macroarray and microarray datasets. The first is an erythroid development dataset that we have generated using nylon filter arrays. Clones for genes whose expression is known in these cells were assigned expression patterns which are in accordance with what was expected and which are not picked up by the standards methods. Moreover, genes differentially expressed between normal and leukemic cells were identified. These included genes whose expression was altered upon induction of the leukemic cells to differentiate. The second application is to the microarray data by Alizadeh et al. (2000). Our results are in accordance with their major findings and offer confidence measures for the predictions made. They also provide new insights for further analysis.","['Manduchi, E', 'Grant, G R', 'McKenzie, S E', 'Overton, G C', 'Surrey, S', 'Stoeckert, C J Jr']","['Manduchi E', 'Grant GR', 'McKenzie SE', 'Overton GC', 'Surrey S', 'Stoeckert CJ Jr']","['Center for Bioinformatics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. manduchi@pcbi.upenn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,IM,"['Algorithms', '*Databases, Factual', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Nylons', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/12/01 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/01 11:00'],"['2000/12/01 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/01 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/bioinformatics/16.8.685 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2000 Aug;16(8):685-98. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/16.8.685.,['0 (Nylons)'],,,,"['N01 CN 95037/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-RR-04026/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The i.p. application of Cu/Zn SOD, isolated from the fungal strain Humicola lutea (HLSOD) (2 injections before and 5 injections after tumor transplantation) induced the mean survival time of the animals as well as a temporally stimulating action on the macrophage and PMNs phagocyting indices. In the present work, the superoxide production of peritoneal macrophages and PMNs during 30 days of tumor progression was followed. Effects of the application of HLSOD in an optimal protective dose on the superoxide production in peritoneal macrophages and blood PMNs were examined. The spontaneous and phorbol-myristate acetate (PMA)-inducible O2- production in both types of phagocytes was 4-5-fold increased in tumor-bearing hamsters (TBH), as compared to the controls, at day 14 after tumor transplantation (the day of tumor appearance in transplanted animals). Furthermore, O2- production was also similar to the control values for the following days of observation.

The nicked form of beta(2)GPI (N-beta(2)GPI ) which was cleaved by plasmin in vitro at Lys 317-Thr 318 in domain V, showed reduced affinity for the negatively charged phospholipids, especially cardiolipin (CL). Recently, the N-beta(2)GPI was detected in the plasma of patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome (DIC) by an immunological method. In the present study, we prepared monoclonal antibodies for the nicked form, and demonstrated that the concentrations of this form of beta(2)GPI, which were analyzed by a sandwich ELISA using two specially prepared monoclonal antibodies, were significantly increased in the plasma of patients with leukemia (n = 51, mean +/- SD: 162.0 +/- 118.3 ng/ml) and with lupus anticoagulant (LA) (n =40, mean +/- SD: 3,041.5 +/- 16,579.7 ng/ml), compared to the normals (n = 33, mean +/- SD: 1.04 +/- 1.54 ng/ml). We found a significant correlation between the concentrations of N-beta(2)GPI and those of typical molecular markers for a fibrinolytic state such as plasmin-alpha(2) plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC) and D-dimer in patients with leukemia, but not in patients with LA. These results suggested that the generation of N-beta(2)GPI was caused by plasmin in the patients with leukemia, and by unknown proteases in the patients with LA. In the patients with LA, the levels of N-beta(2)GPI tended to be higher in those without thrombosis than in those with thrombosis.","['Itoh, Y', 'Inuzuka, K', 'Kohno, I', 'Wada, H', 'Shiku, H', 'Ohkura, N', 'Kato, H']","['Itoh Y', 'Inuzuka K', 'Kohno I', 'Wada H', 'Shiku H', 'Ohkura N', 'Kato H']","['Narita R&D Center, Iatron Laboratories Inc., Mito, Takomachi, Katori-Gun, Chiba 289-2247, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Chromatography, Affinity/methods', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Glycoproteins/*blood/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Lupus Coagulation Inhibitor/*blood', 'beta 2-Glycoprotein I']",,2000/12/01 11:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2000/12/01 11:00'],"['2000/12/01 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/01 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022829 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem. 2000 Dec;128(6):1017-24. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022829.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Lupus Coagulation Inhibitor)', '0 (beta 2-Glycoprotein I)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine the involvement of DcR3 in the immune evasions of virus-associated lymphoma, we analyzed the amplification and expression of DcR3, using dot blot and in situ hybridization (ISH), in 45 cases, which included 17 cases with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoma (seven pyothorax-associated B-cell lymphomas (PAL); ten natural killer lymphoma (NKL)), seven cases with adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma (ATLL), 13 Hodgkin's disease (eight EBV-associated cases; five non-EBV-associated cases), and eight control cases (three reactive lymphadenopathy; five non-EBV-associated-B-cell lymphoma). EBV-associated PAL and NKL exhibited DcR3 amplification and expression in lymphoma cells. ATLL also showed DcR3 expression and amplification. The cases with DcR3 amplification showed DcR3 expression; however, the expression was confined in the neoplastic cells, but not in the reactive cells. In Hodgkin's disease (HD), DcR3 was expressed only in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg giant (H-RS) cells. However, DcR3 was not expressed or amplified in reactive lymphadenopathy. Non-EBV-associated B-cell lymphoma also rarely expressed DcR3, and showed no amplification except in two cases, in which rare expression was present. Our results suggest that EBV and HTLV-I probably use DcR3 to escape from the immune system during lymphomagenesis, or virus-infected lymphoma cells with DcR3 expression might be selected in the multistep tumorigenesis.","['Ohshima, K', 'Haraoka, S', 'Sugihara, M', 'Suzumiya, J', 'Kawasaki, C', 'Kanda, M', 'Kikuchi, M']","['Ohshima K', 'Haraoka S', 'Sugihara M', 'Suzumiya J', 'Kawasaki C', 'Kanda M', 'Kikuchi M']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Nanakuma 7-45-1, Jonan-ku, 814-0180, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology/virology', 'Child', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genotype', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/methods', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 6b']",,2000/12/01 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/12/01 11:00'],"['2000/12/01 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/12/01 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(00)00567-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(00)00567-x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2000 Nov 10;160(1):89-97. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(00)00567-x.,"['0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 6b)', '0 (TNFRSF6B protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Incubation of HL-60 with garlic or onion oil (20 microg/ml) caused a marked suppression of HL-60 proliferation; the suppression was almost identical with those obtained by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) used as positive controls. These oils induced the generation of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)-reducing activity, and about 20% of the HL-60 cells became NBT positive.

The transcriptional coactivator properties of CBP are utilized by at least 25 different transcription factors representing nearly all known classes of DNA binding proteins. Once bound to their target genes, these transcription factors are believed to tether CBP to the promoter, leading to activated transcription. CBP functions to stimulate transcription through direct recruitment of the general transcription machinery as well as acetylation of both histone and transcription factor substrates. Recent observations indicate that a critical dosage of CBP is required for normal development and tumor suppression, and that perturbations in CBP concentrations may disrupt cellular homeostasis. Furthermore, there is accumulating evidence that CBP deregulation plays a direct role in hematopoietic malignancies. However, the molecular events linking CBP deregulation and malignant transformation are unclear. Further insight into the function of CBP, and its role as a tumor suppressor, can be gained through recent studies of the human T-cell leukemia virus, type I (HTLV-I) Tax oncoprotein. Tax is known to utilize CBP to stimulate transcription from the viral promoter. However, recent data suggest that as a consequence of the Tax-CBP interaction, many cellular transcription factor pathways may be deregulated. Tax disruption of CBP function may play a key role in transformation of the HTLV-I-infected cell. Thus, Tax derailment of CBP may lend important information about the tumor suppressor properties of CBP and serve as a model for the role of CBP in hematopoietic malignancies.","['Van Orden, K', 'Nyborg, J K']","['Van Orden K', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523-1870, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Gene Expr,Gene expression,9200651,IM,"['Animals', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",PMC5964958,2000/11/30 11:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2000/11/30 11:00'],"['2000/11/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/30 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/000000001783992678 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Expr. 2000;9(1-2):29-36. doi: 10.3727/000000001783992678.,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,90,,,,,,,,,

Human K562 chronic myeloid leukemia and SUP B-15 Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines were used as positive controls for p210 and p190 BCR-ABL mRNAs, respectively. HL60 cell line was used as a negative control. After the leukemia cells were fixed and permeabilized, without extracting nucleic acids, the mRNAs were reverse transcribed to cDNAs, and the cDNAs were amplified by multiplex polymerase chain reaction with fluorescent primers specific for p190 and p210 BCR-ABL mRNAs. After transfer onto glass slides by cytospin, the amplified cells were detected by fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence microscopy after propidium iodide or 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindone counterstaining showed that the positive K562 cells exhibited a yellow-green fluorescent cytoplasm around a red nucleus, and that the positive SUP B-15 cells exhibited an orange cytoplasm around a blue nucleus. Only the red or blue nucleus was visible in respective negative HL60 cells. The specificity of amplification was confirmed by the absence of a signal when control experiments were performed either with RNase digestion of mRNA or without reverse transcriptase/Taq polymerase. We conclude that the multiplex in-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method is capable of simultaneously detecting and differentiating the p210 and p190 BCR-ABL mRNAs of chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, and that it may be useful in quantitatively monitoring the minimal residual disease during therapy.","['Suh, S P', 'Kee, S J', 'Lim, W H', 'Song, J W', 'Lee, S K', 'Kim, J P', 'Shin, J H', 'Ryang, D W']","['Suh SP', 'Kee SJ', 'Lim WH', 'Song JW', 'Lee SK', 'Kim JP', 'Shin JH', 'Ryang DW']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Chonnam National University Medical School, Kwangju, Korea. spsuh@chonnam.ac.kr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Clin Chem Lab Med,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,9806306,IM,"['DNA Primers', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/11/30 11:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2000/11/30 11:00'],"['2000/11/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/30 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1515/CCLM.2000.138 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Chem Lab Med. 2000 Sep;38(9):939-44. doi: 10.1515/CCLM.2000.138.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Correlation with tumor progression.,77-88,"Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and production are associated with advanced-stage tumor and contribute to tumor progression, invasion and metastases. The current study was designed to determine the expression and production of MMP-2 (gelatinase A) and MMP-9 (gelatinase B) by human lymphoid tumor cells. Changes in expression and production were also investigated during tumor progression of multiple myeloma and mycosis fungoides. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that lymphoblastic leukemia B cells (SB cell line), multiple myeloma (MM) cells (U266 cell line) and lymphoblastic leukemia T cells (CEM and Jurkat cell lines) express constitutively the mRNA for MMP-2 and/or MMP-9. We demonstrated by gelatin-zymography of cell culture medium that both enzymes were secreted in their cleaved (activated) form. In situ hybridization of bone marrow plasma cells and gelatin-zymography of the medium showed that patients with active MM (diagnosis, relapse, leukemic progression) express higher levels of MMP-2 mRNA and protein than patients with non-active MM (complete/objective response, plateau) and with monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance (MGUS). MMP-9 expression and secretion was similar in all patient groups. In patients with mycosis fungoides (MF), the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNAs was significantly upregulated with advancing stage, in terms of lesions both positive for one of two mRNAs and with the greatest intensity of expression. Besides MF cells, the MMP-2 and/or MMP-9 mRNAs were expressed by some stromal cell populations (microvascular endothelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages), suggesting that these cells cooperate in the process of tumor invasion. Our studies identify MMPs as an important class of proteinases involved in the extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation by human lymphoid tumors, and suggest that MMPs inhibitors may lead to important new treatment for their control.","['Vacca, A', 'Ribatti, D', 'Ria, R', 'Pellegrino, A', 'Bruno, M', 'Merchionne, F', 'Dammacco, F']","['Vacca A', 'Ribatti D', 'Ria R', 'Pellegrino A', 'Bruno M', 'Merchionne F', 'Dammacco F']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, University of Bari Medical School, Italy. avacca@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Dev Immunol,Developmental immunology,9200624,IM,"['Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*enzymology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/*enzymology', 'Mycosis Fungoides/enzymology', 'Plasma Cells/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",PMC2276050,2000/11/30 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/11/30 11:00'],"['2000/11/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/30 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1155/2000/74372 [doi]'],ppublish,Dev Immunol. 2000;7(2-4):77-88. doi: 10.1155/2000/74372.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

RANTES, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, IL-8, GRO-alpha and lymphotactin did not augment the development of motile forms including the size and appearance of the pseudopodia activity of the T-leukemia cell lines. The T-cell lines migrated spontaneously on/to fibronectin in a Boyden chamber assay system. Chemokines augmented the migration of the T-leukemia cell lines on fibronectin in the Boyden system in a chemotactic fashion with peak responses at 10 to 50 ng/ml. Thus, the production of chemokines is defective in neoplastic T-lymphocytes.

We investigated the cytokine responsiveness of long-term expanded CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones and the effects of exogenous cytokines on anti-CD3-stimulated polyclonal T cell responses. After mitogenic activation in the presence of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blasts, most CD4+ and CD8+ clones proliferated in response to interleukin-2 (IL-2). Although a majority of the IL-2-responsive clones could also proliferate in the presence of exogenous IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-15, only IL-15 responses were equal to or exceeded the corresponding IL-2 responses. Exogenous cytokines were also added during T cell activation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) + accessory leukemia cells derived from different AML patients, and all the cytokines then had divergent effects that depended on both differences between clones and differences between AML patients. However, for most of these T cell clone/AML blast combinations, IL-2 and IL-15 caused enhanced T cell proliferation. IL-2 and IL-15 also enhanced anti-CD3-stimulated polyclonal responses of nonexpanded T cells derived from cytopenic patients, whereas other cytokines had only minor effects. Our results demonstrate that cytokine-responsive T cells remain in the circulation during chemotherapy-induced cytopenia, and combination therapy including intensive chemotherapy and T cell-targeting cytokine therapy should, therefore, be possible in AML.","['Bruserud, O', 'Ulvestad, E']","['Bruserud O', 'Ulvestad E']","['Division for Hematology and Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,IM,"['Clone Cells/immunology', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology']",,2000/11/30 11:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2000/11/30 11:00'],"['2000/11/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/30 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/10799900050198381 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000 Nov;20(11):947-54. doi: 10.1089/10799900050198381.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms involved in these cytokine alterations are unknown but likely include modulation of regulatory cytokines or the interaction between the antigen-presenting cell (APC) and T lymphocyte or both. The CD28/B7 costimulation pathway has been reported to modulate the type 1/type 2 cytokine balance and may contribute to the GC-associated cytokine alterations. Therefore, we sought to determine the effect of dexamethasone (Dex) on the expression and function of the human CD28/B7 costimulatory pathway and whether these alterations contribute to the Dex-induced type 1/type 2 cytokine alterations. Dex inhibited the expression of both CD80 and CD86 on THP-1 cells, a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line, as determined by flow cytometry. Dex also inhibited the expression of CD28 and CTLA-4 on phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated CD3+ T lymphocytes, which was attenuated by the addition of interleukin-12 (IL-12). Lastly, activation of CD28 with anti-CD28 antibody attenuated the Dex-induced decrease in interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production by anti-CD3 antibody-stimulated PBMC. These data suggest that Dex induces a modulation of the CD28/B7 costimulatory pathway that contributes to the shift in the type 1/type 2 cytokine balance toward a predominant type 2 cytokine response.","['Agarwal, S K', 'Marshall, G D Jr']","['Agarwal SK', 'Marshall GD Jr']","['Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, The University of Texas-Houston Medical School, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,IM,"['Abatacept', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/metabolism', 'B7-1 Antigen/metabolism/*physiology', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'CD28 Antigens/metabolism/*physiology', 'CTLA-4 Antigen', 'Cell Line', 'Dexamethasone/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Glucocorticoids/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Immunoconjugates', 'Interferon-gamma/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-12/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Th1 Cells/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Th2 Cells/drug effects/immunology/metabolism']",,2000/11/30 11:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2000/11/30 11:00'],"['2000/11/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/30 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/10799900050198363 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000 Nov;20(11):927-34. doi: 10.1089/10799900050198363.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '7D0YB67S97 (Abatacept)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Deletion of the deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), results in a drug resistance phenotype to these analogs. An interesting gene therapy strategy to confer drug resistance to cytosine nucleoside analogs would be to specifically inactivate the dCK in normal hematopoietic stem cell. In this study, we designed hammerhead ribozymes that can specifically cut and downregulate the murine dCK mRNA. Three different ribozymes were identified and shown to cleave in vitro the dCK RNA. After introduction of ribozyme cDNA into murine L1210 leukemic cells by retroviral transfer, two of the ribozymes showed some capacity in reducing dCK activity. However, analysis of transduced L1210 clones showed that the significant reduction in the dCK mRNA was not sufficient to confer drug resistance to cytosine arabinoside. Nevertheless, these results provide a new avenue of modulating the dCK enzyme activity and with improved modifications may have the potential for use in gene therapy to confer drug resistance to deoxycytidine analogs.","['Beausejour, C M', 'Tremblay, G', 'Momparler, R L']","['Beausejour CM', 'Tremblay G', 'Momparler RL']","[""Centre de recherche de l'hopital Ste-Justine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytarabine/*toxicity', 'DNA Primers', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense', 'RNA, Catalytic/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/11/30 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/30 11:00'],"['2000/11/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/30 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bbrc.2000.3865 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(00)93865-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2000 Nov 30;278(3):569-75. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2000.3865.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,

However, there is only a limited amount of data available on the expression in human normal and tumorous pituitary tissue. In this study we investigated the expression of members of the IL-6 family of cytokines and their receptors in normal human pituitaries as well as pituitary adenomas using the RT-PCR technique. Eighteen pituitary adenoma biopsies removed in transsphenoidal surgery (six corticotrophic adenomas, four nonfunctioning adenomas, four somatotrophinomas, four prolactinomas) and six normal anterior pituitaries were examined for the expression of IL-6 receptor (-R), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), LIF-R, IL-11, IL-11-R, oncostatin M (OSM), OSM-R, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), CNTF-R and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1). All pituitaries and pituitary adenomas expressed OSM transcripts, whereas no expression of CT-1 was found. The expression of all other cytokines (LIF, IL-11, CNTF) and receptors (IL-6-R, LIF-R, IL-11-R, OSM-R, CNTF-R) was found in different patterns in the adenoma subtypes and normal pituitaries. However, we did not detect expression of LIF-, IL-11-, IL-6-R and CNTF-R in prolactinomas, of CNTF in normal pituitaries and of OSM-R in ACTH-secreting adenomas. In conclusion, our study provides further evidence for a role of the members of the IL-6 family of cytokines in pituitary function.","['Hanisch, A', 'Dieterich, K D', 'Dietzmann, K', 'Ludecke, K', 'Buchfelder, M', 'Fahlbusch, R', 'Lehnert, H']","['Hanisch A', 'Dieterich KD', 'Dietzmann K', 'Ludecke K', 'Buchfelder M', 'Fahlbusch R', 'Lehnert H']","['Department of Endocrinology, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,IM,"['Adenoma/*immunology/pathology/surgery', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/genetics', 'Cytokines/*genetics', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/genetics', 'Pituitary Gland/*immunology', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology/surgery', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/genetics', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', 'Reference Values']",,2000/11/30 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/30 11:00'],"['2000/11/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/30 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jcem.85.11.7122 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2000 Nov;85(11):4411-4. doi: 10.1210/jcem.85.11.7122.,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",,,,,,"['GENBANK/M27288', 'GENBANK/M57765', 'GENBANK/M73238', 'GENBANK/U32324', 'GENBANK/U43030', 'GENBANK/U60805', 'GENBANK/X13967', 'GENBANK/X58298', 'GENBANK/X60542', 'GENBANK/X61615']",,,,,,

Because growth is regulated by the GH-insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system, which may be altered in catabolic states, we studied serum IGF-I, free IGF-I, IGF-II, the IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP-1 to -3), and total and free acid-labile subunit (ALS) levels in 26 prepubertal children with ALL at diagnosis (n = 26) and 6 (n = 21), 12 (n = 21), 18 (n = 21), 24 (n = 20), 30 (n = 16), and 36 months (n = 16) after beginning treatment to investigate the effects of disease and therapy on this system and its relationship with growth in these patients. Intensive chemotherapy compromised growth, with a catch-up period beginning when maintenance therapy began and increased growth after stopping therapy. Weight increased 6 months after chemotherapy withdrawal, whereas the body mass index was increased both at 6 months after diagnosis and 6 months after therapy suppression. Serum IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-3, and total and free ALS levels were significantly decreased at diagnosis. Normalization of IGF-II and IGFBP-3 occurred 6 months after diagnosis, and normalization of IGF-I and total and free ALS occurred 1 yr after terminating therapy. IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 levels were significantly increased at diagnosis and decreased after stopping therapy. Free IGF-I was elevated throughout the study. IGF and IGFBP-3 levels showed a close relationship to growth velocity at the end of chemotherapy, with this correlation remaining until at least 1 yr after therapy withdrawal. In conclusion, intensive chemotherapy compromises linear growth in prepubertal ALL patients, and this phenomenon is associated with alterations in the IGF system. However, when therapy is reduced or stopped, catch-up growth occurs, but various parameters of the GH-IGF axis remain impaired. This suggests the need for a longer period of follow-up to assess the long-term risks of therapy and disease on this system.","['Arguelles, B', 'Barrios, V', 'Pozo, J', 'Munoz, M T', 'Argente, J']","['Arguelles B', 'Barrios V', 'Pozo J', 'Munoz MT', 'Argente J']","['Universidad Autonoma, Department of Pediatrics, Hospital Universitario Nino Jesus, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,IM,"['Body Height', '*Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Growth/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 1/blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2/blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins/*blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*metabolism', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/*metabolism', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*physiopathology', 'Protein Subunits', 'Reference Values', 'Time Factors']",,2000/11/30 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/30 11:00'],"['2000/11/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/30 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jcem.85.11.6943 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2000 Nov;85(11):4087-92. doi: 10.1210/jcem.85.11.6943.,"['0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Fes autophosphorylation and transforming activity are highly restrained after ectopic expression in fibroblasts, indicating tight negative regulation of Fes kinase activity in vivo. Here we investigated the regulatory role of the Fes Src homology 2 (SH2) domain by producing a series of chimeric constructs in which the Fes SH2 domain was replaced with those of the transforming oncogenes v-Fps and v-Src or by the NH2-terminal SH2 domain of the Ras GTPase-activating protein. Wild-type and chimeric Fes proteins readily underwent tyrosine autophosphorylation in vitro and produced identical cyanogen bromide phosphopeptide cleavage patterns, indicating that the SH2 substitutions did not influence overall kinase activity or autophosphorylation site selection. However, metabolic labeling of Rat-2 fibroblasts expressing each construct showed that only the Fes/Src SH2 chimera was active in vivo. Consistent with this result, the Fes/Src SH2 domain chimera exhibited potent transforming activity in fibroblasts and enhanced differentiation-inducing activity in K-562 myeloid leukemia cells. In addition, the Fes/Src SH2 chimera exhibited constitutive localization to focal adhesions in Rat-2 fibroblasts and induced the attachment and spreading of TF-1 myeloid cells. These data demonstrate a central role for the SH2 domain in the regulation of Fes kinase activity and biological function in vivo.","['Rogers, J A', 'Cheng, H Y', 'Smithgall, T E']","['Rogers JA', 'Cheng HY', 'Smithgall TE']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania 15261, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Focal Adhesions/chemistry/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-onc/chemistry/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src)/chemistry/genetics', 'Paxillin', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Transport', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'ras GTPase-Activating Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'src Homology Domains/*genetics']",,2000/11/30 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/11/30 11:00'],"['2000/11/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/30 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 2000 Nov;11(11):581-92.,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-onc)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (PXN protein, human)', '0 (Paxillin)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pxn protein, rat)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (ras GTPase-Activating Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FES protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fes)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (v-fps oncogene protein, Fujinami sarcoma virus)']",,,,['CA 58667/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

This was achieved by secondary data analyses from the Regional Study of Care for the Dying, a retrospective interview survey of deaths in 1990 in 20 nationally representative health districts. Interviews were obtained for 2,074/2,915 (71%) of randomly selected cancer deaths; 574 (27.8%) were reported to have received care from a Macmillan nurse, hospice home-care nurse, or other community specialist palliative care nurse. Using logistic regression analysis 10 factors were found to predict independently CSPC use. Being dependent with dressing/undressing, needing help at night, having constipation, experiencing vomiting/nausea, being mentally confused, having breast cancer and being under the age of 75 years increased the likelihood of receiving CSPC. Having a lymphoma, leukaemia or myeloma, a brain tumour and being dependent on others for help with self-care for more than 1 year decreased the likelihood. The use of CSPC nurses to provide expertise in symptom control and to support families of dependent patients is consistent with the aims of palliative care, and therefore appears appropriate. Further research is, however, needed to investigate the apparent age bias in access to these services, and to ensure that CSPC services are provided on the basis of need, irrespective of patient age.","['Addington-Hall, J', 'Altmann, D']","['Addington-Hall J', 'Altmann D']","[""Department of Palliative Care and Policy, Guy's, King's and St Thomas' School of Medicine/St Christopher's Hospice, London, England.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Adv Nurs,Journal of advanced nursing,7609811,IM,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Community Health Nursing/*standards', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility/standards', 'Health Services Research', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Needs Assessment', 'Neoplasms/mortality/*nursing', 'Nurse Clinicians/*standards/*statistics & numerical data', 'Nursing Evaluation Research', 'Oncology Nursing/*standards', 'Palliative Care/*statistics & numerical data', '*Patient Selection', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Terminal Care/*standards/*statistics & numerical data', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",,2000/11/30 00:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2000/11/30 00:00'],"['2000/11/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['jan1543 [pii]'],ppublish,J Adv Nurs. 2000 Oct;32(4):799-806.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is important in risk assessment in general, however, to attempt to incorporate as much biological information into the risk models as possible. We illustrate this by presenting a biologically-based linear-quadratic-exponential (LQE) incidence rate model for radiation-induced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The model consists of a linear-quadratic dose-response for the induction of BCR-ABL, a waiting time distribution between BCR-ABL formation and detection of CML, and an exponential cell-killing term that multiplies both the background and induced incidence rates. Using data exclusive of the A-bomb survivor cohort, Bayesian priors are defined for each of the nine parameters in this LQE model. The priors are based on chromosomal translocations in lymphocytes, hematopoietic stem cell survival experiments, CML waiting times in women irradiated for benign disease, the background CML incidence rate in the U.S. population, and genomic DNA target sizes of BCR and ABL. Fixing three of the LQE model parameters to the means of their priors, maximum likelihood estimates of the remaining six parameters were obtained using A-bomb survivor incidence data for Hiroshima males. The likelihood estimates and the corresponding six prior distributions, both approximated as multivariate normal, were then used to form Bayesian posteriors for the six parameters not fixed. With these posteriors the LQE model yields Qgamma*=0.0042 Gy(-1) where Qgamma* is the upper 95% confidence bound of the lifetime CML risk per person-gray in the limit of low doses of gamma-rays. This value is slightly less than Qgamma*=0.0049 Gy(-1) obtained from likelihood estimates of the LQE parameters, and substantially less than Qgamma*=0.0158 Gy(-1) obtained for a simple statistical model linear in dose for kermas less than 4 Gy.","['Radivoyevitch, T', 'Hoel, D G']","['Radivoyevitch T', 'Hoel DG']","['Department of Biometry and Epidemiology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425, USA. radivot@musc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Cell Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Genes, abl/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Models, Statistical', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', '*Radiation', '*Risk Assessment', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2000/11/30 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/11/30 11:00'],"['2000/11/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/30 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004110000055 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2000 Sep;39(3):153-9. doi: 10.1007/s004110000055.,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, while the plasma creatinine determination by the kinetic Jaffe method was negatively influenced by the hyperbilirubinemia, the ultrafiltrate creatinine was not. This report is the first to document the lack of bilirubin clearance during hemodiafiltration and its impact on the calculation of sieving coefficient based on creatinine.

Examination of four other human monoclonal anti-PR3 antibodies shows a number of negatively charged residues within their CDR3 regions. Mapping of segments of linear PR3-epitopes reacting with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) demonstrated a preliminary estimate of structures contributing to antigenic determinants.

TEL is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors and contains the pointed protein interaction (PNT) domain and an ETS DNA binding domain (DBD). By contrast to other chimeric proteins that contain TEL's PNT domain, such as TEL-platelet-derived growth factor beta receptor in t(5;12)(q33;p13), MN1-TEL contains the DBD of TEL. The N-terminal MN1 moiety is rich in proline residues and contains two polyglutamine stretches, suggesting that MN1-TEL may act as a deregulated transcription factor. We now show that MN1-TEL type I, unlike TEL and MN1, transforms NIH 3T3 cells. The transforming potential depends on both N-terminal MN1 sequences and a functional TEL DBD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MN1 has transcription activity and that MN1-TEL acts as a chimeric transcription factor on the Moloney sarcoma virus long terminal repeat and a synthetic promoter containing TEL binding sites. The transactivating capacity of MN1-TEL depended on both the DBD of TEL and sequences in MN1.

The catalytic beta subunits (Lmp2 and Lmp7) and the regulatory subunits (PA28alpha and PA28beta) were expressed at equally high levels in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), freshly isolated B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells and normal CD23(-) B lymphocytes. Lmp2 and Lmp7 were selectively down-regulated in germinal center cell-derived Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HD) cell lines. There was a direct correlation between the expression of Lmp2/7 and the chymotrypsin and trypsin-like activities in proteasomes purified from LCLs, BLs and CLL cells, whereas 5 HD cell lines expressing B or T-cell markers exhibited a variable pattern of subunit expression and enzymatic activity. Poor hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrates by proteasomes from BL cells correlated with a distinct pattern of cleavage of a reference 50mer peptide, production of different sets of degradation products and significantly reduced recovery of a known cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) target epitope. The enzymatic activity of proteasomes from normal CD23(-) ""resting"" B lymphocytes resembled that of BL cells in spite of high Lmp2/7 expression. This pattern was not reversed by treatment with the B-cell mitogen, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The results suggest that different stages of B-cell activation/differentiation are associated with distinct profiles of IFN-gamma-regulated subunit composition and enzymatic activity of the proteasome.

These data demonstrate that the DNA interaction properties of the antitumor-active mixed Z are very similar to those of transplatin, thus suggesting that clinical inactivity of transplatin could not depend upon its peculiar DNA binding mode.","['Leng, M', 'Locker, D', 'Giraud-Panis, M J', 'Schwartz, A', 'Intini, F P', 'Natile, G', 'Pisano, C', 'Boccarelli, A', 'Giordano, D', 'Coluccia, M']","['Leng M', 'Locker D', 'Giraud-Panis MJ', 'Schwartz A', 'Intini FP', 'Natile G', 'Pisano C', 'Boccarelli A', 'Giordano D', 'Coluccia M']","['Centre de Biophysique Moleculaire, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Orleans, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/metabolism', 'DNA/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Adducts/drug effects', 'DNA Footprinting', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes/metabolism', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'High Mobility Group Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oligonucleotides/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Thiourea/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/11/28 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/28 11:00'],"['2000/11/28 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/28 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1124/mol.58.6.1525 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2000 Dec;58(6):1525-35. doi: 10.1124/mol.58.6.1525.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (High Mobility Group Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '14913-33-8 (transplatin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)', 'GYV9AM2QAG (Thiourea)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Most often seen in patients with leukemia and other malignant conditions, generalized BMN has also been observed in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), where it is almost certainly a consequence of blood vessel occlusion. Activation of the clotting system seems to play a role in this clinical setting. Systemic fat embolism and acute multi-organ failure syndrome can also complicate BMN in patients with SCD. We describe here 3 cases of BMN associated with SCD. Each patient exhibited an unusually severe vaso-occlusive crisis accompanied by persistent fever, a high level of serum lactate dehydrogenase, leukoerythroblastosis, and large numbers of nucleated red cells. Despite such suggestive clinical features, diagnosis of BMN still requires a bone marrow biopsy. Particularly in patients with SCD, the early institution of transfusion therapy can be life-saving. The ominous prognosis ascribed to generalized BMN seems to reflect the poor outcome of such underlying conditions as leukemia; however, the prognosis of generalized BMN is not so poor in association with SCD and other nonmalignant states.","['Ataga, K I', 'Orringer, E P']","['Ataga KI', 'Orringer EP']","['Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599-7305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Am J Med Sci,The American journal of the medical sciences,0370506,IM,"['Adult', 'African Americans', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell/blood/*complications/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Blood Coagulation', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Erythrocyte Count', 'Female', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Necrosis', 'Prognosis']",,2000/11/28 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/28 11:00'],"['2000/11/28 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/28 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9629(15)34929-6 [pii]', '10.1097/00000441-200011000-00009 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med Sci. 2000 Nov;320(5):342-7. doi: 10.1097/00000441-200011000-00009.,['EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)'],,,32,"['HL28391/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00046/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Preclinically, flavopiridol is a potent inhibitor of CDKs 1, 2 and 4 in cell-free assays (IC(50)in the region of 100 nM) and tumour cell growth in vitro (typical IC(50)in the region of 100 nM). The drug showed in vivo antitumour activity (using iv., ip. or oral dosing) against a variety of human tumour xenografts, especially when administered on a regular daily, rather than weekly, schedule and most notably against prostate carcinoma, head and neck cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukaemia. The major toxicities observed in rodents were on the bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract. Pharmacokinetics were linear with dose and with a bi-exponential decline both in rodents and man. Oral bioavailability in rodents is in the region of 20%. Glucuronidation appears to be the major route of metabolism. Single-agent clinical trials have mainly used a 72 h continuous infusion schedule. Dose-limiting toxicities were diarrhoea and hypotension. Plasma concentrations in excess of those required for in vitro enzyme or cell growth inhibition are achievable. While there has been some evidence of single-agent antitumour activity (partial responses in a patient with renal cancer and another with gastric cancer), ongoing combination studies, especially with paclitaxel, where preclinical synergistic antitumour effects are observed, are promising. Doubt as to whether CDKs are the sole target responsible for the drug's antitumour effects have been raised by preclinical observations of apoptosis of non-cycling cells, effects on endothelial cells and non-CDK proteins, such as aldehyde dehydrogenase and glycogen phosphorylase, potent effects on PTEFb and transcription and its ability to directly interact with DNA.","['Kelland, L R']",['Kelland LR'],"['CRC Centre for Cancer Therapeutics, The Institute of Cancer Research, 15 Cotswold Road, Sutton, Surrey SM2 5NG, UK. lloyd@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",,2000/11/28 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/28 11:00'],"['2000/11/28 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/28 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1517/13543784.9.12.2903 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2000 Dec;9(12):2903-11. doi: 10.1517/13543784.9.12.2903.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,49,,,,,,,,,

Beside common biochemical events, we previously showed that a 62-kDa protein associated with PLCgamma-1 and p21RasGAP was specifically tyrosine phosphorylated after CD2 stimulation in Jurkat T cells. We demonstrated here that it was identical to p62Dok, a docking protein highly phosphorylated in human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and in murine abl-transformed B cells. Mainly, we showed that p62Dok tyrosine phosphorylation was strengthened by the functional interplay between CD3 and CD2. Primary stimulation of Jurkat cells via CD3 suppressed most of the subsequent CD2-dependent phosphorylation events, except p62Dok tyrosine phosphorylation, which was on the contrary strongly increased. Kinetic studies indicated that a short treatment with anti-CD3 was sufficient to amplify the CD2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p62Dok. By contrast, CD2-induced PLCgamma-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and calcium response progressively diminished. Finally, enhanced amounts of tyrosine phosphorylated p62Dok were recruited to p21RasGAP and PLCgamma-1 after CD2 stimulation in CD3-activated cells. CD3 stimulation is known to enhance CD2 avidity for its ligand and to induce the binding of the CD2AP protein to the CD2 cytoplasmic tail. Our results suggest that the CD3-TCR complex rapidly primes the CD2 pathway to activate one of its specific components, p62Dok.","['Harriague, J', 'Debre, P', 'Bismuth, G', 'Hubert, P']","['Harriague J', 'Debre P', 'Bismuth G', 'Hubert P']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie Cellulaire, CNRS UMR 7627, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['CD2 Antigens/*immunology', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Phosphoproteins/*immunology/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', '*RNA-Binding Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/immunology/metabolism']",,2000/11/28 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/28 11:00'],"['2000/11/28 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/28 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1521-4141(200011)30:11<3319::AID-IMMU3319>3.0.CO;2-1 [pii]', '10.1002/1521-4141(200011)30:11<3319::AID-IMMU3319>3.0.CO;2-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2000 Nov;30(11):3319-28. doi: 10.1002/1521-4141(200011)30:11<3319::AID-IMMU3319>3.0.CO;2-1.,"['0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DOK1 protein, human)', '0 (GAP-associated protein p62)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we used fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from both types of ATL patients to identify molecules that may contribute to the difference between acute and chronic ATL. Isolated mRNAs expressed differentially between the two types of ATL include a T-cell differentiation antigen (MAL), a lymphoid-specific member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family (EBI-1 / CCR7), a novel human homologue to a subunit (MNLL) of the bovine ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex, and a human fibrinogen-like protein (hpT49).

Vaccines prepared from chaperone-rich fractions are capable of providing protective immunity in mice subsequently challenged intravenously with the same A20 B cell leukemia cells. This protection is at least equal to that provided by purified, tumor-derived heat-shock protein 70, which was the best chaperone immunogen in our hands against this aggressive murine leukemia model. Dosage escalation studies, however, revealed that increasing vaccine dosages actually abrogated the protective effects. The physical nature of the enriched chaperones indicates that they are associated in complexes, which may have implications for their function. FS-IEF is relatively simple, rapid, and efficient, thus making combined multi-chaperone therapy feasible.","['Graner, M', 'Raymond, A', 'Akporiaye, E', 'Katsanis, E']","['Graner M', 'Raymond A', 'Akporiaye E', 'Katsanis E']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Steele Memorial Children's Research Center, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724-5073, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cancer Vaccines/*isolation & purification/therapeutic use', 'Chromatography', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Isoelectric Focusing/*methods', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism/prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Chaperones/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Protein Binding', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/11/25 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/25 11:00'],"['2000/11/25 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/25 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002620000138 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2000 Nov;49(9):476-84. doi: 10.1007/s002620000138.,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of these molecules differ from all other triphenylethylene based antiestrogens by a different spatial location of the aminoalkyl side chain. The binding affinity of the most representative molecules (8, 9, 19, 20, 21, 23 and 25), including analogues 8 and 21 without the side chain, for the estrogen receptor alpha (ER) was determined. The ability of these molecules to induce the progesterone receptor was also studied. Antiproliferative activity was evaluated on MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, while intrinsic cytotoxic/cytostatic properties resulting from interaction with other targets than ER were assayed on L1210 murine leukemia cells. Introduction of an aminoalkylamino side chain at carbon 2 confers strong cytotoxic properties to diphenylquinolines 9 and 10 as well as pure antiestrogenic activities. However, cytotoxicity is so high with respect to antiestrogenicity that the latter was clearly observable only in one case (9b). The structure of compound 9b was determined by X-ray crystallography. Molecular modeling of its docking within the hormone-binding domain of the receptor was subsequently undertaken. According to our results, the design of molecules with the side chain bound to the ethylene part of the triphenyl ethylene skeleton might generate compounds of potential pharmacological interest.","['Croisy-Delcey, M', 'Croisy, A', 'Carrez, D', 'Huel, C', 'Chiaroni, A', 'Ducrot, P', 'Bisagni, E', 'Jin, L', 'Leclercq, G']","['Croisy-Delcey M', 'Croisy A', 'Carrez D', 'Huel C', 'Chiaroni A', 'Ducrot P', 'Bisagni E', 'Jin L', 'Leclercq G']","['UAMR 176 CNRS lnstitut Curie-Recherche, Laboratoire Raymond Latarjet, Centre Universitaire, Orsay, France. martine.croisy@curie.u-psud.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', '*Drug Design', 'Estrogen Receptor Modulators/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Quinolines/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism', 'Receptors, Progesterone/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/11/25 11:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2000/11/25 11:00'],"['2000/11/25 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/25 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0968-0896(00)00194-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0968-0896(00)00194-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2000 Nov;8(11):2629-41. doi: 10.1016/s0968-0896(00)00194-2.,"['0 (Estrogen Receptor Modulators)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We observed that both dFdC and 2-CdA used separately inhibited the growth of colonies formed by normal and CML CFU-GM cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the combined therapy with dFdC and 2-CdA caused statistically significant inhibition of the colony growth in both normal and CML CFU-GM cultures. In addition, the inhibition of CML CFU-GM colony formation was greater and statistically significant in the case of the combined therapy using higher concentrations of these drugs as compared with inhibition of the growth of normal CFU-GM colonies. These observations were the basis for the evaluation of the interaction type between dFdC and 2-CdA.

To address possible mechanisms of gene regulation, we compared gene expression between hEpoR cDNA-transduced ES (ES-hEpoR) cells and parental ES cells during in vitro differentiation induced by withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and cultured in the absence of Epo using differential display reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (DDRT-PCR). A total of 48 differentially expressed cDNA fragments were found; 12 were sequenced and five were confirmed by Northern blot analysis to be up- or down-regulated in ES-hEpoR cells during differentiation compared to parental ES cells. In a GenBank search of the five putatively regulated cDNA fragments, two fragments shared high sequence homology to two known genes: the Surf-6 gene and the gene for calcyclin binding protein. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that 2.5-kb and 0.3-kb transcripts of the Surf-6 gene were expressed in undifferentiated ES-hEpoR and parental ES cells at a low level, but this expression was enhanced from day 2 to 14 of differentiation after withdrawal of LIF and culture in the presence of Epo. Furthermore, the enhanced expression of these two transcripts was also noticed in EML-C1 cells, a murine multipotential hematopoietic cell line that has erythroid differentiation potential in response to Epo. In summary, our results demonstrate that Surf-6 gene expression is regulated during differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in response to Epo, suggesting a possible role for Surf-6 gene in erythropoiesis.","['Xia, Z B', 'Dai, M S', 'Magoulas, C', 'Broxmeyer, H E', 'Lu, L']","['Xia ZB', 'Dai MS', 'Magoulas C', 'Broxmeyer HE', 'Lu L']","['Department of Microbiology/Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5254, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Hematother Stem Cell Res,Journal of hematotherapy & stem cell research,100892915,IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/cytology/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology']",,2000/11/25 11:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2000/11/25 11:00'],"['2000/11/25 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/25 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/15258160050196696 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother Stem Cell Res. 2000 Oct;9(5):651-8. doi: 10.1089/15258160050196696.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (SURF6 protein, human)', '0 (Surf6 protein, mouse)']",,,,"['R01 DK 53674/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL 56416/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Fifty-five adult patients, median age 34 years (range 17-55 years), with acute or chronic leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were transplanted in first complete remission (CR1)/first chronic phase (CP1) (early disease) (n = 21) or in advanced (CR2/CP2, no remission) disease (n = 34) from an unrelated marrow donor.

Estimates of the 3-year overall survival and day 100 transplant-related mortality were 30% and 53% respectively. A recipient age < 34 years at transplant, an intertransplant time interval > or = 80 d and a positive recipient cytomegalovirus serology were predictors of a better outcome. The use of cyclosporin A (CsA) after second transplant had a dramatic impact on outcome, the best results being observed with CsA alone. The day 40 probability of neutrophil recovery was 73%. The use of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) was associated with a higher and faster neutrophil recovery. Other factors associated with neutrophil recovery were an intertransplant time interval > or = 80 d and a positive recipient cytomegalovirus serology. Therefore, second early allogeneic transplantation for graft failure is an effective treatment, especially if patients can receive CsA for graft-versus-host disease prevention and are retransplanted more than 80 d from first transplant.","['Guardiola, P', 'Kuentz, M', 'Garban, F', 'Blaise, D', 'Reiffers, J', 'Attal, M', 'Buzyn, A', 'Lioure, B', 'Bordigoni, P', 'Fegueux, N', 'Tanguy, M L', 'Vernant, J P', 'Gluckman, E', 'Socie, G']","['Guardiola P', 'Kuentz M', 'Garban F', 'Blaise D', 'Reiffers J', 'Attal M', 'Buzyn A', 'Lioure B', 'Bordigoni P', 'Fegueux N', 'Tanguy ML', 'Vernant JP', 'Gluckman E', 'Socie G']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/surgery', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Rejection/*surgery', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Reoperation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/11/25 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/25 11:00'],"['2000/11/25 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/25 11:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2306 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02306.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Oct;111(1):292-302. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02306.x.,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Conversely, only 5.1 and 6.3 cases per year have been reported in the periods 1981-90 and 1991-96, respectively, from the other centres in the world. Half of the cases have been observed in the USA. In Europe, most of the cases have been observed in France and Italy.

Deregulation of cell cycle genes plays a significant role in oncogenesis and there is considerable evidence suggesting that Cdk inhibitors (Ckis) function as tumour suppressors. We and others have recently demonstrated low expression of Cki p27 in very aggressive neoplasms and high-grade lymphomas. To investigate whether HCL cases express normal p27 protein, as in other low-grade lymphomas with a low proliferation index, 58 cases of HCL were characterized using a sensitive biotin-streptavidin-immunoperoxidase technique and specific antibodies against p27. All HCL cases showed either no or very weak reactivity, in contrast to other types of low-grade B-cell lymphoma [22 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), 12 cases of gastric marginal B-cell lymphoma (MALT), 16 cases of follicular lymphomas and two cases of splenic marginal zone lymphomas]. To investigate the possible mechanism(s) accounting for the low p27 expression observed in hairy cells, multiple approaches were used. According to these molecular studies, low levels of p2 7 are not as a result of (1) increased ubiquitin-mediated degradation, (2) decreased levels of p27 transcription or (3) p27 somatic mutations and/or allelic loss. These findings suggest that low p27 protein expression in HCL may be achieved through post-transcriptional regulation. Finally, our data demonstrate that p27 expression in HCL does not correlate with either cell cycle progression or proliferation index, suggesting that low levels of p27 in hairy cells may be associated with their unique stage of B-cell differentiation and/or the activation of as yet unknown pathways.","['Chilosi, M', 'Chiarle, R', 'Lestani, M', 'Menestrina, F', 'Montagna, L', 'Ambrosetti, A', 'Prolla, G', 'Pizzolo, G', 'Doglioni, C', 'Piva, R', 'Pagano, M', 'Inghirami, G']","['Chilosi M', 'Chiarle R', 'Lestani M', 'Menestrina F', 'Montagna L', 'Ambrosetti A', 'Prolla G', 'Pizzolo G', 'Doglioni C', 'Piva R', 'Pagano M', 'Inghirami G']","['Institute of Anatomic Pathology, University of Verona, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/*chemistry', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/*chemistry', 'Microfilament Proteins/*analysis/genetics', '*Muscle Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spleen/*chemistry']",,2000/11/25 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/25 11:00'],"['2000/11/25 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/25 11:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2210 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02210.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Oct;111(1):263-71. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02210.x.,"['0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Tagln protein, mouse)']",,,,"['CA14462/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA76584/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

Karyotypic analysis revealed clonal and non-clonal telomeric associations, accompanied by clonal cytogenetic abnormalities and also in isolation. The p53 mutation, which occurred at the invariant base pair -2 of the splice acceptor site in intron 7 resulted in the abolition of correct splicing of exon 7 to exon 8. Multiple aberrant splice products were characterized, all of which differed from wildtype in the DNA binding domain. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated that the clone retained two copies of the p53 gene and wild-type p53 transcript was detected on cloning of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) product, indicating that one wild-type allele remained. However, a plasmid clone with correct splicing at the exon 7/8 boundary, but with a 21 bp deletion in exon 8, was also found at low frequency. This finding indicates clonal evolution, resulting in complete loss of wild-type p53. The intronic point mutation was not present in DNA extracted from cervical tissue indicating that it was a leukaemic phenomenon. This is the first case of an intronic point mutation to be reported in CLL. This mutation led to chaotic p53 expression and, interestingly, occurred in a case showing telomeric associations, a rare phenomenon in B-CLL.","['Bromidge, T', 'Lowe, C', 'Prentice, A', 'Johnson, S']","['Bromidge T', 'Lowe C', 'Prentice A', 'Johnson S']","['Leukaemia Research Unit, Taunton and Somerset Hospital, UK. teresa.bromidge@tauntonsom-tr.swest.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/complications/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Female', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', '*Introns', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*genetics', 'Lip Neoplasms/complications/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/genetics', '*Point Mutation', '*RNA Splice Sites', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomere', 'Trisomy', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/complications/genetics']",,2000/11/25 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/25 11:00'],"['2000/11/25 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/25 11:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2335 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02335.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Oct;111(1):223-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02335.x.,['0 (RNA Splice Sites)'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This study suggests that bax is a useful prognostic indicator in AML and may assist with therapeutic decision-making for patients in the standard risk category.","['Ong, Y L', 'McMullin, M F', 'Bailie, K E', 'Lappin, T R', 'Jones, F G', 'Irvine, A E']","['Ong YL', 'McMullin MF', 'Bailie KE', 'Lappin TR', 'Jones FG', 'Irvine AE']","[""Haematology Research Laboratory, Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast City Hospital, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Treatment Outcome', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2000/11/25 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/25 11:00'],"['2000/11/25 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/25 11:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2315 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02315.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Oct;111(1):182-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02315.x.,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In cases without splenomegaly, this lesion was found in 13 of 21 animals (61.9%) whereas, in cases with splenomegaly, 31 of 239 were positive for this lesion (13.0%). Thus, left auricular thrombus may be an important macroscopic diagnostic criteria of hematopoietic neoplasms, especially when splenomegaly is absent. Furthermore, this lesion tended to arise in aged animals despite the presence of splenomegaly.

Mechanisms underlying cell death in ALS are likely to be important in more common but more complex disorders. Riluzole, the only drug launched for treatment ALS is currently undergoing industrial trials for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington disease, stroke and head injury. Other compounds in Phase III testing for ALS (mecamserin, xaliproden, gabapentin) are also in trials for other neurodegenerative disorders. Mechanisms of action of these advanced compounds are limited to glutamate antagonism, direct or indirect growth factor activity, as well as GABA agonism and interaction with calcium channels. A broader range of mechanisms is represented by compounds in Phase I trials: glutamate antagonism (dextramethorphan/p450 inhibitor; talampanel), growth factors (leukemia inhibiting factor; IL-1 receptor; encapsulated cells secreting CNTF) and antioxidants (TR500, a glutathione-repleting agent; recombinant superoxide dismutase; procysteine.) An even broader range of mechanisms is being explored in preclinical discovery programs. Recognition of the difficulties associated with delivery of protein therapeutics to the CNS has led to development of small molecules interacting either with neurotrophin receptors or with downstream intracellular signalling pathways. Other novel drug targets include caspaces, protein kinases and other molecules influencing apoptosis. High-throughput screens of large libraries of small molecules yield lead compounds that are subsequently optimized by chemists, screened for toxicity, and validated before a candidate is selected for clinical trials. The net is cast wide in early discovery efforts, only about 1% of which result in useful drugs at the end of a decade-long process. Successful discovery and development of novel drugs will increasingly depend on collaborative efforts between the academy and industry.","['Hurko, O', 'Walsh, F S']","['Hurko O', 'Walsh FS']","['Neuroscience Research, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, New Frontiers Science Park North H25/124, Third Avenue, Harlow, Essex CM19 5AW, UK.

Both the alpha- and betaherpesvirus subfamilies disrupt ND10 upon infection by dispersing and/or destroying ND10-associated proteins. We studied the effect of the gammaherpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) on ND10 and its spatial distribution in the nucleus of cells during latency and lytic reactivation. In latently infected Burkitt's lymphoma, lymphoblastoid, and D98/HR1 cells, ND10 were intact, as judged by immunofluorescence localization of PML, Sp100, NDP55, and Daxx. Fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed no association between viral episomes and ND10 during latency, implying that the maintenance replication of EBV, which depends on host cell proliferation, occurs independent of ND10. As in mitosis, the EBV genomes were attached to interphase chromosomes, suggesting that they are unable to move freely within the interchromosomal space and thus unable to associate with the interchromosomally located ND10 or other nuclear domains. Upon lytic activation, ND10 became dispersed in cells expressing lytic proteins. Redistribution of ND10 proteins occurred sequentially at different stages of the lytic cycle, with Sp100, Daxx, and NDP55 dispersed before and PML dispersed after the onset of lytic replication. ND10 remnants were retained until the early stages of lytic replication, and replicating EBV genomes were frequently found beside this nuclear domain; the number of replication domains was usually lower than the average latent virus frequency. Thus, latency does not require or induce interaction of EBV with ND10 for transcription and replication, whereas lytic replication triggers dispersion of ND10 proteins and occurs in close association with PML aggregates. The required movement of chromosome-attached latent EBV episomes to ND10 after reactivation from latency might include physical release of the chromosome-bound episomes. Only episomes contacting ND10 after such a release might be able to begin lytic replication.","['Bell, P', 'Lieberman, P M', 'Maul, G G']","['Bell P', 'Lieberman PM', 'Maul GG']","['The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Virus Latency', '*Virus Replication']",PMC112463,2000/11/23 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/23 11:00'],"['2000/11/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/23 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.24.11800-11810.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Dec;74(24):11800-10. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.24.11800-11810.2000.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,,,"['AI41136/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM054687/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA010815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM54687-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI041136/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM57599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI041136/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

We have determined whether and how the cytoplasmic domains of oncoretrovirus glycoproteins modulate their intracellular trafficking, by using chimeric proteins that combined the alpha-chain of the interleukin-2 receptor with the glycoprotein cytoplasmic domains of five oncoretroviruses: human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), bovine leukemia virus (BLV), murine leukemia virus (MuLV), and Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV). All of these proteins were synthesized and matured in the same way as a control protein with no retrovirus cytoplasmic domain. However, the amounts of all chimeric proteins at the cell surface were smaller than that of the control protein. The protein appearing at and leaving the cell surface and endocytosis were measured in stable transfectants expressing the chimera. We identified two groups of proteins which followed distinct intracellular pathways. Group 1 included chimeric proteins that reached the cell surface normally but were rapidly endocytosed afterwards. This group included the chimeric proteins with HTLV-1, RSV, and BLV cytoplasmic domains. Group 2 included chimeric proteins that were not detected at the cell surface, despite normal intracellular concentrations, and were accumulated in the Golgi complex. This group included the chimeric proteins with MuLV and MPMV cytoplasmic domains. Finally, we verified that the MuLV envelope glycoproteins behaved in the same way as the corresponding chimeras. These results indicate that retroviruses have evolved two distinct mechanisms to ensure a similar biological feature: low concentrations of their glycoproteins at the cell surface.","['Grange, M P', 'Blot, V', 'Delamarre, L', 'Bouchaert, I', 'Rocca, A', 'Dautry-Varsat, A', 'Dokhelar, M C']","['Grange MP', 'Blot V', 'Delamarre L', 'Bouchaert I', 'Rocca A', 'Dautry-Varsat A', 'Dokhelar MC']","['INSERM U332, Institut Cochin de Genetique Moleculaire, 75014 Paris, France. grange@cochin.inserm.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Membrane/virology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC112456,2000/11/23 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/23 11:00'],"['2000/11/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/23 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.24.11734-11743.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Dec;74(24):11734-43. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.24.11734-11743.2000.,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The initiation of RSV Gag translation has been reported to be 5' cap dependent and controlled by three short open reading frames located in the 380-nucleotide leader upstream of the Gag start codon. Translation of RSV Gag would thus differ from that prevailing in other retroviruses such as murine leukemia virus, reticuloendotheliosis virus type A, and simian immunodeficiency virus, in which an internal ribosome entry segment (IRES) in the 5' end of the genomic RNA directs efficient Gag expression despite stable 5' secondary structures. This prompted us to investigate whether RSV Gag translation might be controlled by an IRES-dependent mechanism. The results show that the 5' leaders of RSV and v-Src RNA exhibit IRES properties, since these viral elements can promote efficient translation of monocistronic RNAs in conditions inhibiting 5' cap-dependent translation. When inserted between two cistrons in a canonical bicistronic construct, both the RSV and v-Src leaders promote expression of the 3' cistron. A genetic analysis of the RSV leader allowed the identification of two nonoverlapping 5' and 3' leader domains with IRES activity. In addition, the v-Src leader was found to contain unique 3' sequences promoting an efficient reinitiation of translation. Taken together, these data lead us to propose a new model for RSV translation.","['Deffaud, C', 'Darlix, J L']","['Deffaud C', 'Darlix JL']","['LaboRetro, Unite de Virologie Humaine, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, 69364 Lyon Cedex 07, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/*physiology', 'Gene Products, gag/*physiology', 'Genome, Viral', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Viral/*physiology', 'Ribosomes/physiology', 'Sarcoma, Avian/*virology', '*Virus Replication']",PMC112439,2000/11/23 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/23 11:00'],"['2000/11/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/23 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.24.11581-11588.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Dec;74(24):11581-8. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.24.11581-11588.2000.,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The relationship between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) unspliced transcripts used as mRNA for viral protein synthesis and as virion precursor RNA (vpRNA) for encapsidation remains an important question. We developed a biochemical assay to evaluate the hypothesis that prior utilization as mRNA template for protein synthesis is necessary to generate vpRNA. HIV-1-infected T cells were treated with translation inhibitors under conditions that maintain virus production. Immunoprecipitation of newly synthesized HIV-1 Gag protein revealed that de novo translation is not necessary to sustain assembly, release, or processing of Gag structural protein. Both newly synthesized protein and steady-state Gag are competent for assembly, and the extracellular accumulation of Gag is proportional to the intracellular abundance of Gag. As early as 2 h after transcription, newly synthesized RNA is detectable in cell-free virions and encapsidation is sustained upon inhibition of host cell translation. Results of both [(3)H]uridine incorporation assays and HIV-1-specific RNase protection assays (RPAs) indicate that translation inhibition reduces the absolute amounts of both cytoplasmic and virion-associated RNA. Evaluation of encapsidation efficiency by RPA revealed that the cytoplasmic availability of vpRNA is increased, indicating that HIV-1 unspliced mRNA can be rerouted to function as vpRNA. Our data contrast with results from the HIV-2 and murine leukemia virus systems and indicate that HIV-1 unspliced RNA constitutes a single functional pool that can function interchangeably as mRNA and as vpRNA.","['Butsch, M', 'Boris-Lawrie, K']","['Butsch M', 'Boris-Lawrie K']","['Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210-1093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['HIV Infections/*virology', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Viral/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Virion/*physiology', 'Virus Replication']",PMC112433,2000/11/23 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/23 11:00'],"['2000/11/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/23 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.24.11531-11537.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Dec;74(24):11531-7. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.24.11531-11537.2000.,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,,"['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29AI40851/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The existence of a linkage between HLA and Hodgkin lymphoma, another B-cell disorder, coupled with the fact that CLL is frequently associated with autoimmune disease, led to the question of whether the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region is involved in familial cases of CLL. To examine this proposition, 5 microsatellite markers on chromosome 6p21.3 were typed in 28 families with CLL, 4 families with CLL in association with other lymphoproliferative disorders, and 1 family with splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes. There was no evidence of linkage in these families to chromosome 6p21.3. The best estimates of the proportions of sibling pairs with CLL that share 0, 1, or 2 MHC haplotypes were not significantly different from the null expectation.

After induction, the level of MRD that was best associated with treatment outcome was 4.5 x 10(-4) residual leukemic cells. However, the outcome in patients with at least 4.5 x 10(-4) cells (n = 26) was not significantly different from that in patients with fewer leukemic cells (n = 30); there were 15 (58%) relapses in the first group and 12 (40%) relapses in the second. After consolidation, the most predictive MRD cutoff value was 3.5 x 10(-4) cells: 22 patients had an MRD level of 3.5 x 10(-4) cells or higher and 17 (77%) of these patients had relapse, compared with 5 of 29 patients (17%) with lower MRD levels (P <.001). An MRD level of 3.5 x 10(-4) cells or higher after consolidation was significantly correlated with poor or intermediate-risk cytogenetic findings, a multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) phenotype, short duration of overall survival, and short duration of relapse-free survival (P =.014,.031,.00022, and.00014, respectively). In multivariate analysis, this MRD status was significantly associated with a high frequency of relapse (P <.001) and a short duration of overall (P =.025) and relapse-free survival (P =.007). ASCT did not alter the prognostic effect of high MRD levels after consolidation: the relapse rate after transplantation was 70%. Thus, we found that an MRD level of 3.5 x 10(-4) cells or higher at the end of consolidation strongly predicts relapse and is significantly associated with an MDR1 phenotype and intermediate or unfavorable cytogenetic findings.

This effect is due to the ability of the ETO portion of the protein to recruit co-repressors to promoters of AML-1 target genes. The t(11;17)(q21;q23)-associated acute promyelocytic leukemia creates the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger PLZFt/RAR alpha fusion protein and, in a similar manner, inhibits RAR alpha target gene expression and myeloid differentiation. PLZF is expressed in hematopoietic progenitors and functions as a growth suppressor by repressing cyclin A2 and other targets. ETO is a corepressor for PLZF and potentiates transcriptional repression by linking PLZF to a histone deacetylase-containing complex. In transiently transfected cells and in a cell line derived from a patient with t(8;21) leukemia, PLZF and AML-1/ETO formed a tight complex. In transient assays, AML-1/ETO blocked transcriptional repression by PLZF, even at substoichiometric levels relative to PLZF. This effect was dependent on the presence of the ETO zinc finger domain, which recruits corepressors, and could not be rescued by overexpression of co-repressors that normally enhance PLZF repression. AML-1/ETO also excluded PLZF from the nuclear matrix and reduced its ability to bind to its cognate DNA-binding site. Finally, ETO interacted with PLZF/RAR alpha and enhanced its ability to repress through the RARE. These data show a link in the transcriptional pathways of M2 and M3 leukemia.

Pro-apoptotic (Bax/Bad) versus anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2/Bcl-X) Bcl-2-related protein ratios were increased in RA/RARS compared with NBM (2.57 [1.93-9.42] versus 1.89 [0.65-4.1]; P =.06), whereas disease progression was associated with significantly reduced ratios (1.16 [0.06-3.32]; P <.0001) due primarily to increased Bcl-2 expression. Apoptosis and Bax/Bad:Bcl-2/Bcl-X ratio were inversely correlated with both International Prognostic Scoring System score and cytogenetic risk group; highest levels observed in patients with low score and/or good risk cytogenetics. There was a trend toward an association between Bcl-2-related protein expression and apoptosis (P =.07). This study indicates that MDS progression arises through multiple hits that alter levels of CD34(+) cell apoptosis and proliferation. Early disease is associated with excessive apoptosis and elevated ratio of apoptosis to proliferation. Increased proliferative rates are observed in RAEB, whereas leukemic transformation arises through inhibition of apoptosis rather than excessive cell growth. Although disease progression is accompanied by a fall in pro-apoptotic versus anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-related protein ratios, heterogeneity in patterns of protein expression indicates that factors additional to Bcl-2 family members play a role in the deregulated apoptosis in MDS.

In this study, immunoblotting was used to examine levels of apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and procaspases-2, -3, -7, -8, and -9 in bone marrow samples (at least 80% leukemia) harvested before chemotherapy from adults with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML, 42 patients) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, 18 patients). Levels of each of these polypeptides varied over a more than 10-fold range between specimens. In AML samples, expression of procaspase-2 correlated with levels of Apaf-1 (R(s) = 0.52, P <.02), procaspase-3 (R(s) = 0.56, P <.006) and procaspase-8 (R(s) = 0.64, P <.002). In ALL samples, expression of procaspases-7 and -9 was highly correlated (R(s) = 0.90, P <.003). Levels of these polypeptides did not correlate with prognostic factors or response to induction chemotherapy. In further studies, 16 paired samples (13 AML, 3 ALL), the first harvested before induction therapy and the second harvested at the time of leukemia regrowth, were also examined. There were no systematic alterations in levels of Apaf-1 or procaspases at relapse compared with diagnosis. These results indicate that levels of initiator caspases vary widely among different leukemia specimens but cast doubt on the hypothesis that this variation is a major determinant of drug sensitivity for acute leukemia in the clinical setting.

Apoptosis resistance of BCR/ABL-expressing cells may depend on enhanced expression of anti-apoptotic proteins as well as reduced expression and/or inactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins. Compared to myeloid precursor 32Dcl3 cells expressing wild type BCR/ABL, cells expressing a BCR/ABL mutant lacking amino acids 176-426 in the BCR domain (p185 delta BCR) are susceptible to apoptosis induced by interleukin-3 (IL-3) deprivation. These cells exhibited the hypophosphorylated apoptotic BAD and markedly reduced levels of Bcl-2. Upon ectopic expression of Bcl-2, these cells showed no changes in BAD phosphorylation, but they became apoptosis-resistant and proliferated in the absence of IL-3, albeit more slowly than cells expressing wild type BCR/ABL. Moreover, the p185 delta BCR/Bcl-2 double transfectants were leukemogenic when injected into immunodeficient mice, but Bcl-2 expression did not restore the leukemia-inducing effects of p185 delta BCR to the levels of wild type BCR/ABL. Leukemic cells recovered from the spleen of mice injected with p185 delta BCR/Bcl-2 cells did not show rearrangements in the Bcl-2 genomic locus, but they exhibited enhanced proliferation in culture and induced a rapidly fatal disease process when inoculated in secondary recipient mice. Together, these data support the importance of anti-apoptotic pathways for BCR/ABL-dependent leukemogenesis and suggest that Bcl-2 expression promotes secondary changes leading to a more aggressive tumor phenotype.

They are associated with a poor prognosis of the disease. In this study, we characterized the oncogenic potential and signaling properties of Flt3 mutations. We constructed chimeric molecules that consisted of the murine Flt3 backbone and a 510-base pair human Flt3 fragment, which contained either 4 different ITD mutants or the wild-type coding sequence. Flt3 isoforms containing ITD mutations (Flt3-ITD) induced factor-independent growth and resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis in 32D cells. Cells containing Flt3-ITD, but not those containing wild-type Flt3 (Flt3-WT), formed colonies in methylcellulose. Injection of 32D/Flt3-ITD induced rapid development of a leukemia-type disease in syngeneic mice. Flt3-ITD mutations exhibited constitutive autophosphorylation of the immature form of the Flt3 receptor. Analysis of the involved signal transduction pathways revealed that Flt3-ITD only slightly activated the MAP kinases Erk1 and 2 and the protein kinase B (Akt) in the absence of ligand and retained ligand-induced activation of these enzymes. However, Flt3-ITD led to strong factor-independent activation of STAT5. The relative importance of the STAT5 and Ras pathways for ITD-induced colony formation was assessed by transfection of dominant negative (dn) forms of these proteins: transfection of dnSTAT5 inhibited colony formation by 50%. Despite its weak constitutive activation by Flt3-ITD, dnRas also strongly inhibited Flt3-ITD-mediated colony formation. Taken together, Flt3-ITD mutations induce factor-independent growth and leukemogenesis of 32D cells that are mediated by the Ras and STAT5 pathways.

Susceptibility of these acute leukemia cell types, which are known to lack p53(wt) function, did not appear to correlate with the levels of the apoptosis-signaling death receptors (DRs) of Apo-2L, ie, DR4 and DR5; decoy receptors (DcR1 and 2); FLAME-1 (cFLIP); or proteins in the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAP) family. Apo-2L-induced apoptosis was associated with the processing of caspase-8, Bid, and the cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c as well as the processing of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Apo-2L-induced apoptosis was significantly inhibited in HL-60 cells that overexpressed Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L). Cotreatment with either a caspase-8 or a caspase-9 inhibitor suppressed Apo-2L-induced apoptosis. Treatment of human leukemic cells with etoposide, Ara-C, or doxorubicin increased DR5 but not DR4, Fas, DcR1, DcR2, Fas ligand, or Apo-2L levels. Importantly, sequential treatment of HL-60 cells with etoposide, Ara-C, or doxorubicin followed by Apo-2L induced significantly more apoptosis than treatment with Apo-2L, etoposide, doxorubicin, or Ara-C alone, or cotreatment with Apo-2L and the antileukemic drugs, or treatment with the reverse sequence of Apo-2L followed by one of the antileukemic drugs. These findings indicate that treatment with etoposide, Ara-C, or doxorubicin up-regulates DR5 levels in a p53-independent manner and sensitizes human acute leukemia cells to Apo-2L-induced apoptosis.

Previously, the authors found that the frequency of cyclin A1 overexpression is especially high in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). In this study, the authors investigated the mechanism of cyclin A1 overexpression in APL cells and showed that the APL-associated aberrant fusion proteins (PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha [PML-RAR alpha] or PLZF-RAR alpha) caused the increased levels of cyclin A1 in these cells. The ectopic expression of either PML-RAR alpha or PLZF-RAR alpha in U937 cells, a non-APL myeloid cell line, led to a dramatic increase of cyclin A1 messenger RNA and protein. This elevation of cyclin A1 was reversed by treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in cells expressing PML-RAR alpha but not PLZF-RAR alpha. ATRA also greatly reduced the high levels of cyclin A1 in the APL cell lines NB4 and UF-1. No effect of ATRA on cyclin A1 levels was found in the ATRA-resistant NB4-R2 cells. Further studies using ligands selective for various retinoic acid receptors suggested that cyclin A1 expression is negatively regulated by activated RAR alpha. Reporter assays showed that PML-RAR alpha led to activation of the cyclin A1 promoter. Addition of ATRA inhibited PML-RAR alpha-induced cyclin A1 promoter activity. Taken together, our data suggest that PML-RAR alpha and PLZF-RAR alpha cause the high-level expression of cyclin A1 seen in acute promyelocytic leukemia.

To identify potential mechanisms of leukemogenesis by MLL-ELL, its transcriptional and oncogenic properties were investigated. Fusion with MLL preserves the transcriptional elongation activity of ELL but relocalizes it from a diffuse nuclear distribution to the nuclear bodies characteristic of MLL. Using a serial replating assay, it was demonstrated that the MLL-ELL chimeric protein is capable of immortalizing clonogenic myeloid progenitors in vitro after its retroviral transduction into primary murine hematopoietic cells. However, a structure-function analysis indicates that the elongation domain is not essential for myeloid transformation because mutants lacking elongation activity retain a potent ability to immortalize myeloid progenitors. Rather, the highly conserved carboxyl terminal R4 domain is both a necessary and a sufficient contribution from ELL for the immortalizing activity associated with MLL-ELL. The R4 domain demonstrates potent transcriptional activation properties and is required for transactivation of a HoxA7 promoter by MLL-ELL in a transient transcriptional assay. These data indicate that neoplastic transformation by the MLL-ELL fusion protein is likely to result from aberrant transcriptional activation of MLL target genes. Thus, in spite of the extensive diversity of MLL fusion partners, these data, in conjunction with previous studies of MLL-ENL, suggest that conversion of MLL to a constitutive transcriptional activator may be a general model for its oncogenic conversion in myeloid leukemias.

The study explored whether HDACIs could induce the expression of costimulatory/adhesion molecules on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, thereby effectively inducing tumor immunity. The expression of CD80, CD86, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, HLA-ABC, and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was tested in human AML cell lines after the addition of HDACI, sodium butyrate (SB). Generally, increased expression of CD86 was observed by SB treatment in a majority of cell lines, and ICAM-1 was expressed in fewer cell lines. Essentially the same results were obtained using other HDACIs such as FR901228, trichostatin A, and trapoxin A. Quantitation of transcripts of CD86 accompanied with RNA synthesis inhibition assay and nuclear run-on assay revealed that SB up-regulates the CD86 expression transcriptionally. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that HDACI treatment caused remarkable acetylation on histone H3 and H4 at CD86 promoter chromatin in vivo. In 30 clinical AML samples, CD86 expression was significantly increased (P <.001) by SB treatment, and the expression of HLA-DR and ICAM-1 was moderately increased (P <.05) by SB treatment. Finally, the allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction (allo-MLR) against HL60 cells pretreated with SB was enhanced 4-fold compared with allo-MLR obtained with non-treated HL60 cells. These results suggest that the immunotherapeutic use of HDACIs may become a novel tool for treatment of AML.

KitYF719 fails to recruit PI3-kinase after stimulation with SLF, whereas KitYF728 fails to stimulate PLC-gamma phosphorylation or mobilize Ca(++). Both single mutants responded mitogenically to soluble SLF (sSLF) in a manner indistinguishable from wild type (WT), although sSLF failed to stimulate or promote the survival of cells expressing the double mutant. In contrast, although cells expressing WT or YF719 were mitogenically stimulated by membrane-bound SLF (mSLF), stimulation of cells expressing KitYF728 was impaired. Similarly, cells expressing WT or YF719 receptors were stimulated by plate-bound anti-Kit antibodies, whereas cells expressing the YF728 receptor were not stimulated. Neomycin sulfate, a PLC antagonist, inhibited cells expressing YF719 receptors stimulated by sSLF. Neomycin also inhibited cells expressing the WT receptor that were stimulated by mSLF or immobilized anti-Kit antibodies but did not inhibit stimulation of cells expressing WT or YF719 receptors by sSLF. 32D cells expressing KitWT, KitYF719, or KitYF728 were injected into mice and the presence of cells was evaluated by colony assays 6 to 7 weeks later. Although both KitWT and KitYF719 expressing cells could be recovered from the spleen and bone marrow, recovery of KitYF728 cells from these organs was severely reduced. These results indicate that Kit tyrosine 728 is of particular importance for mitogenic stimulation by mSLF or immobilized ligand and is required for full maintenance of cells in vivo, likely through activation of PLC-gamma.

An international working group of experienced clinicians involved in the management of patients with MDS reviewed currently used response definitions and developed a uniform set of guidelines for future clinical trials in MDS. The MDS differ from many other hematologic malignancies in their chronicity and the morbidity and mortality caused by chronic cytopenias, often without disease progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Whereas response rates may be an important endpoint for phase 2 studies of new agents and may assist regulatory agencies in their evaluation and approval processes, an important goal of clinical trials in MDS should be to prolong patient survival. Therefore, these response criteria reflected 2 sets of goals in MDS: altering the natural history of the disease and alleviating disease-related complications with improved quality of life. It is anticipated that the recommendations presented will require modification as more is learned about the molecular biology and genetics of these disorders. Until then, it is hoped these guidelines will serve to improve communication among investigators and to ensure comparability among clinical trials.

Hypothalamic LIF gene expression was increased up to 5 days after CFA, and up to 24 h after turpentine. LIF induction was concordant with elevated plasma ACTH and corticosterone levels and pituitary POMC messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. Pituitary levels of LIF-inducible signaling inhibitor (SOCS 3) mRNA were stimulated 3-fold after CFA and turpentine treatment. In contrast, in LIF knockout mice (LIFKO) pituitary POMC mRNA levels and plasma ACTH and corticosterone responses to both inflammatory challenges were markedly lower than in wild-type (WT) animals.

Splenotomy, the first standard treatment, increases peripheral blood counts but half of the patients require a later systemic therapy because of progressive cytopenia. On the other hand, it has been shown that splenotomy performed after achieving complete remission with interferon alpha or purine analogues contributed to spleen infiltration with hairy cells [37, 38]. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In our study we analysed results of treatment of 44 patients with hairy cell leukaemia who were followed-up for 8 years. Patients were treated with three treatment modalities, mostly successively. Splenotomy++ was performed in 34 patients as a first line therapy (Group I); interferon alpha in 24 patients; in 10 patients as a first line therapy without splenotomy (Group II) and in 14 patients as a second line therapy after splenotomy (Group III). Deoxycoformycin was given to 5 patients as a third line therapy. RESULTS: Our results showed that 20 patients (59 percent) treated only with splenotomy were in haematological remission (Group I). The analysis of prognostic variables demonstrated that at diagnosis patients from Group I, treated only with splenotomy, had at diagnosis higher levels of haemoglobin and thrombocyte counts and a lesser degree of bone marrow (b.m.) infiltration with hairy cells (HCs) than they were found in the other two groups of patients (median Hb = 11.3 g/dL, Plt = 133 x 10(9)/L, HCs in b.m. = 77%). Group II had median Hb = 8.6 g/dl, Plt = 72 x 10(9)/L, HCs in b.m. = 88%, and Group III had median Hb = 9.2 10(9)/L, Plt = 61 x 10(9)/L and HCs in b.m = 90%. Survival curves (Kaplan-Meier method) and Log Rank Statistics showed a significant difference in survival-time (Figure 4) among patients groups (p = 0.0427). Group I had median survival of 270 months; Group II 80 months; and Group III 140 months. Our results demonstrated that different prognostic risk groups existed among hairy cell leukaemia patients and could be identified on the basis of Hb level, Plt count and percent of infiltration of hairy cells into bone marrow. At diagnosis the low risk group of patients (Table 1) had levels of haemoglobin more than 11.3 g/dL; platelet counts more than 72 x 10(9)/L; percent of bone marrow infiltration with hairy cells less than 70%, and expression of lambda type of light chains on leukaemic cells. This group of patients was treated only with splenotomy without systemic therapy. In high risk group of patients the levels of haemoglobin were lower than 8.6 g/dL; platelet counts lower than 60 x 10(9)/L; percent of bone marrow infiltration with hairy cells more than 90% and expression of kappa type of light chains on leukaemic cells. The survival of this group of patients, in spite of initial treatment with systemic therapy with interferon alpha, was shorter. Results of treatment with interferon alpha (Group II and Group III) have demonstrated that the duration of remission in patients who were initially splenectomized and later treated with interferon alpha, was longer (median 31 months) than in patients who were treated with interferon alpha without splenotomy (median duration of remission = 13 months) (Table 3). Results of treatment with deoxycoformycin (Table 4) showed that 3/5 of patients achieved complete remission and 2/5 patients achieved partial remission. Four patients were initially splenectomised and att five patients were treated with interferon alpha before deoxycoformycin. CONCLUSION: On the basis of our results, splenotomy can be recommended as the first-line therapy for low risk patients with hairy cell leukaemia; interferon alpha should be the first-line therapy in high risk patients, and the second-line therapy in l","['Gotic, M', 'Rolovic, Z', 'Radosevic, N', 'Draguljac, N', 'Jovanovic, V', 'Bogdanovic, A', 'Boskovic, D']","['Gotic M', 'Rolovic Z', 'Radosevic N', 'Draguljac N', 'Jovanovic V', 'Bogdanovic A', 'Boskovic D']","['Institute of Haematology, Clinical Centre of Serbia, Belgrade.']",['srp'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pentostatin/*therapeutic use', '*Splenectomy']",,2000/11/23 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/23 11:00'],"['2000/11/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/23 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 2000 Jul-Aug;128(7-8):262-70.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)']",,"Rezultati lecenja bolesnika s leukemijom vlasastih celija primenom splenektomije, alfa-interferona i deoksikoformicina.",,,,,,,,,,

However, no single marker is specific for hairy cell leukaemia. Two-color-flow cytometry can aid in the diagnosis by showing coexpression of CD11c, HC2 or CD25 with pan B cell markers. Recently, Matutes E. et al. [17] proposed a scoring system of immunophenotypic markers, which could be used to evaluate the diagnosis of hairy cell leukaemia. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to: a) confirm previous observations of immunophenotypic characteristics of hairy cell leukaemia; b) identify antibody combinations of two-color immunofluorescence staining that are most useful in the diagnosis of hairy cell leukaemia; c) examine the value of a scoring system of immunophenotypic markers in the diagnosis of hairy cell leukaemia. METHODS: We analyzed peripheral blood of 46 patients with hairy cell leukaemia using indirect immunofluorescence flow cytometry (EPICS-Coulter) with an extended panel of monoclonal antibodies: CD19, CD2O, CD22, CD24, CD10, HLA-DR, CD11c, CD25, HC2, Slg, kappa and lambda light chains. The diagnosis of hairy cell leukaemia in all patients was made using conventional criteria based on cell morphology, TRAP cytochemistry and bone marrow histology. One fourth of patients were also analyzed using two-color flow cytometry with three antibody combinations as follows: CD19 + CD11c, CD19 + CD25 and CD19 + HC2. RESULTS: Our results showed that hairy cells of our patients had a uniform and unique immunophenotype with expression of the following markers: CD19, CD22, CD2O, CD11c and HLA-DR in 100% of patients, CD24 in 93%, CD25 in 88%, Slg in 82%, HC2 in 67%, CD1O in 50%, kappa light chains in 38% and lambda light chains in 35% of patients (Table 1). The level of detectable circulating hairy cells varied widely, from 2% to 93% of total lymphocytes, and 12 patients (26%) with less than 5% of detectable hairy cells were excluded from analysis. Two-color cytometry showed that antibody combination CD19 + CD11c was coexpressed in 100% of patients, CD19 + CD25 in 78% of patients and CD19 + HC2 in 57% of patients (Table 2). Only patients with 5% or more double colored hairy cells for one antibody combination, were included in the analysis. On the basis of our results of in immunophenotyping of hairy cell leukaemia patients and results of other authors (17), we made our scoring system which considers the reactivity with the following markers: CD19, CD11c, CD25 and HC2. Each marker gives 1 point if positive and 0 point if negative. Score 4 had 83% of patients, score 3 had 14% of patients, score 2 had 3% of patients and no patient had score 1 or 0 (Table 3). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that immunophenotyping with a selective panel of monoclonal antibodies could significantly increase the accuracy in diagnosis of hairy cell leukaemia. Two-color flow cytometry with antibody combination CD19 + CD11c showed coexpression of hairy cells in 100% of our patients. The scoring system for hairy cell leukaemia used in our patients showed that high scores 3 and 4 had 97% of patients.","['Gotic, M', 'Kraguljac, N', 'RolovicZ', 'Radosevic, N', 'Boskovic, D']","['Gotic M', 'Kraguljac N', 'RolovicZ', 'Radosevic N', 'Boskovic D']","['Institute of Haematology, Clinical Centre of Serbia, Belgrade.']",['srp'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Srp Arh Celok Lek,Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,0027440,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*diagnosis/immunology']",,2000/11/23 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/23 11:00'],"['2000/11/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/23 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Srp Arh Celok Lek. 2000 May-Jun;128(5-6):157-64.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",,Znacaj imunofenotipizacije leukemijskih celija za dijagnostiku leukemije vlasastih (hairy) celija.,,,,,,,,,,

This fusion protein causes a myeloproliferative disease in 100% of animals, but only 15-20% of the animals develop acute leukemia after a long latency period (6-13 months). PML-RARalpha is therefore necessary, but not sufficient, for APL development. The coexpression of a reciprocal form of the fusion, RARalpha-PML, increased the likelihood of APL development (55-60%), but did not shorten latency. Together, these results suggested that additional genetic events are required for the development of APL. We therefore evaluated the splenic tumor cells from 18 transgenic mice with APL for evidence of secondary genetic events, by using spectral karyotyping analysis. Interstitial or terminal deletions of the distal region of one copy of chromosome 2 [del(2)] were found in 1/5 tumors expressing PML-RARalpha, but in 11/13 tumors expressing both PML-RARalpha and RARalpha-PML (P < 0.05). Leukemic cells that contained a deletion on chromosome 2 often contained additional chromosomal gains (especially of 15), chromosomal losses (especially of 11 or X/Y), or were tetraploid (P </= 0.001). These changes did not commonly occur in nontransgenic littermates, nor in aged transgenic mice that did not develop APL. These results suggest that expression of RARalpha-PML increases the likelihood of chromosome 2 deletions in APL cells. Deletion 2 appears to predispose APL cells to further chromosomal instability, which may lead to the acquisition of additional changes that provide an advantage to the transformed cells.","['Zimonjic, D B', 'Pollock, J L', 'Westervelt, P', 'Popescu, N C', 'Ley, T J']","['Zimonjic DB', 'Pollock JL', 'Westervelt P', 'Popescu NC', 'Ley TJ']","['Molecular Cytogenetics Section, Laboratory of Experimental Carcinogenesis, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', '*Chromosome Aberrations/genetics', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosome Mapping', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics']",PMC27220,2000/11/23 11:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2000/11/23 11:00'],"['2000/11/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/23 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.97.24.13306 [doi]', '97/24/13306 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Nov 21;97(24):13306-11. doi: 10.1073/pnas.97.24.13306.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",,,,"['K08 HL003991/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49712/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL07088/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007088/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'KO8 HL03991/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

METHODS: The observed mortality of this inception cohort with recently diagnosed RA, was analysed in relation to the expected mortality, calculated with the aid of life tables of the general population of the Netherlands (matched for age and sex). Functional capacity was measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire. Prognostic factors for mortality were analysed multivariately by the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Between January 1985 and April 1997, 622 patients entered the study, and were included in the analysis of mortality. The death rate in the first 10 years of the disease was not significantly different from that of the general population. Fifty five patients from the study group died (16% up to 10 years of follow up). The most commonly reported causes of death were of cardiovascular and respiratory origin. The other causes of death could be classified into cancer, sepsis, amyloidosis, leukaemia, renal insufficiency of unknown cause, perforation of the oesophagus, probably related to the treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and pancytopenia during aurothioglucose treatment. Functional capacity improved significantly during the first six years compared with the value at start. Statistically significant predictors for death were age at the start and male sex. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with earlier studies performed, no excess mortality in the first 10 years of an inception cohort of patients with RA was seen. In addition, the functional capacity was relatively constant during the first six years after an initial improvement from baseline. Age at start and male sex were the only statistically significant predictors for death.","['Kroot, E J', 'van Leeuwen, M A', 'van Rijswijk, M H', 'Prevoo, M L', ""Van 't Hof, M A"", 'van De Putte, L B', 'van Riel, P L']","['Kroot EJ', 'van Leeuwen MA', 'van Rijswijk MH', 'Prevoo ML', ""Van 't Hof MA"", 'van De Putte LB', 'van Riel PL']","['Department of Rheumatology, University Medical Centre Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

Models are generated and evaluated using multidrug-resistance reversal activity values for 609 compounds measured using adriamycin-resistant P388 murine leukemia cells. Structure-based descriptors numerically encode molecular features which are used in model formation. Two types of models are generated: one type to classify compounds as inactive, moderately active, and active (three-class problem) and one type to classify compounds as inactive or active without considering the moderately active class (two-class problem). Two activity distributions are considered, where the separation between inactive and active compounds is different. When the separation between inactive and active classes is small, a model based on nine topological descriptors is developed that produces a classification rate of 83.1% correct for an external prediction set. Larger separation between active and inactive classes raises the prediction set classification rate to 92.0% correct using a model with six topological descriptors. Models are further validated through Monte Carlo experiments in which models are generated after class labels have been scrambled. The classification rates achieved demonstrate that the models developed could serve as a screening mechanism to identify potentially useful MDRR agents from large libraries of compounds.","['Bakken, G A', 'Jurs, P C']","['Bakken GA', 'Jurs PC']","['Department of Chemistry, The Pennsylvania State University, 152 Davey Laboratory, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*classification', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Leukemia P388', 'Linear Models', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Molecular', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/11/23 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/23 11:00'],"['2000/11/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/23 11:00 [entrez]']","['jm000244u [pii]', '10.1021/jm000244u [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 2000 Nov 16;43(23):4534-41. doi: 10.1021/jm000244u.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The 4-chlorophenylhydrazone of mesoxalic acid (CPHM) was found to be an inhibitor of DNA strand transfer reactions catalyzed by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Using a model strand transfer assay system described previously [Davis, W. R., et al. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 14213-14221], the mechanism of CPHM inhibition of DNA strand transfer has been characterized. CPHM was found to target the RNase H activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. DNA polymerase activity was not significantly affected by CPHM; however, it did inhibit the polymerase-independent RNase H activity with an IC(50) of 2.2 microM. In the absence of DNA synthesis, CPHM appears to interfere with the translocation, or repositioning, of RT on the RNA.DNA template duplex, a step required for efficient RNA hydrolysis by RNase H. Enzyme inhibition by CPHM was found to be highly specific for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase; little or no inhibition of DNA strand transfer or DNA polymerase activity was observed with MLV or AMV reverse transcriptase, T7 DNA polymerase, or DNA polymerase I. Examination of additional 4-chlorophenylhydrazones showed that the dicarboxylic acid moiety of CPHM is essential for activity, suggesting its important role for enzyme binding. Consistent with the role of the dicarboxylic acid in inhibitor function, Mg(2+) was found to chelate directly to CPHM with a K(d) of 2.4 mM. Together, these studies suggest that the inhibitor may function by binding to enzyme-bound divalent metal cofactors.","['Davis, W R', 'Tomsho, J', 'Nikam, S', 'Cook, E M', 'Somand, D', 'Peliska, J A']","['Davis WR', 'Tomsho J', 'Nikam S', 'Cook EM', 'Somand D', 'Peliska JA']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-0606, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-HIV Agents/*chemistry', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/enzymology', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA, Viral/*chemistry', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Hydrazones/chemical synthesis/*chemistry', 'Hydrolysis', 'Kinetics', 'Magnesium/chemistry', 'Malonates/chemical synthesis/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/*chemistry', 'Ribonuclease H/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Species Specificity', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Thymine Nucleotides/chemistry']",,2000/11/23 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/23 11:00'],"['2000/11/23 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/23 11:00 [entrez]']","['bi0015764 [pii]', '10.1021/bi0015764 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 2000 Nov 21;39(46):14279-91. doi: 10.1021/bi0015764.,"['0 (4-chlorophenylhydrazone mesoxalic acid)', '0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Hydrazones)', '0 (Malonates)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '0 (Thymine Nucleotides)', '62R514HE48 (mesoxalic acid)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', ""QOP4K539MU (thymidine 5'-triphosphate)""]",,,,"['AI42844/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 07767/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Much less common but more serious causes include primary bone marrow disorders. The normal reaction of bone marrow to infection or inflammation leads to an increase in the number of white blood cells, predominantly polymorphonuclear leukocytes and less mature cell forms (the ""left shift""). Physical stress (e.g., from seizures, anesthesia or overexertion) and emotional stress can also elevate white blood cell counts. Medications commonly associated with leukocytosis include corticosteroids, lithium and beta agonists. Increased eosinophil or basophil counts, resulting from a variety of infections, allergic reactions and other causes, can lead to leukocytosis in some patients. Primary bone marrow disorders should be suspected in patients who present with extremely elevated white blood cell counts or concurrent abnormalities in red blood cell or platelet counts. Weight loss, bleeding or bruising, liver, spleen or lymph node enlargement, and immunosuppression also increase suspicion for a marrow disorder. The most common bone marrow disorders can be grouped into acute leukemias, chronic leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders. Patients with an acute leukemia are more likely to be ill at presentation, whereas those with a chronic leukemia are often diagnosed incidentally because of abnormal blood cell counts. White blood cell counts above 100,000 per mm3 (100 x 10(9) per L) represent a medical emergency because of the risk of brain infarction and hemorrhage.","['Abramson, N', 'Melton, B']","['Abramson N', 'Melton B']","['Baptist Regional Cancer Institute, Jacksonville, Florida 32207, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Am Fam Physician,American family physician,1272646,IM,"['Bone Marrow Diseases/complications', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/complications', 'Infections/complications', 'Inflammation/complications', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytosis/blood/*diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Stress, Psychological/complications']",,2000/11/22 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/22 11:00'],"['2000/11/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/22 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am Fam Physician. 2000 Nov 1;62(9):2053-60.,,,,11,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, the study confirms earlier findings of increased risk for ANLL and aplastic anemia among benzene-exposed workers, provides the first substantial evidence that MDS is linked to benzene exposure, and provides evidence that benzene increases risk for ANLL/MDS at lower levels of exposure than had previously been demonstrated. Currently we are evaluating the potential for extending the follow-up of workers included in this study. A new study would include expanded data collection for cases of hematopoietic malignancy and related disorders and for an appropriate control series.","['Hayes, R B', 'Yin, S', 'Rothman, N', 'Dosemeci, M', 'Li, G', 'Travis, L T', 'Smith, M T', 'Linet, M S']","['Hayes RB', 'Yin S', 'Rothman N', 'Dosemeci M', 'Li G', 'Travis LT', 'Smith MT', 'Linet MS']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, U.S. National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA. hayesr@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Toxicol Environ Health A,Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

A course of pulse-dose methylprednisolone was given, followed by prednisolone. The neurological deficits were improved to the degree of full recovery. The inflammatory myelopathy together with a plaque in the cerebral hemisphere, moderately delayed p-100 latency of VEP and elevation of myelin basic protein of the spinal fluid, is difficult to distinguish from that of multiple sclerosis. Although the precise mechanism of GVHD-myelopathy is not known, it is likely that the donor myelin-reactive T-lymphocytes were non-specifically activated with GVHD reaction and directed to a central nervous system. Tacrolimus might have precipitated the focal immune reaction by way of cytotoxic effects on brain capillaries. The ""GVHD-myelopathy"" presented here may thus be akin to multiple sclerosis in its immune mechanism.","['Saito, N', 'Tanaka, T', 'Matsuda, S', 'Inoue, M', 'Yamamoto, T']","['Saito N', 'Tanaka T', 'Matsuda S', 'Inoue M', 'Yamamoto T']","['Department of Neurology, Ohta Nishinouchi Hospital.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Shinkeigaku,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,0417466,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Demyelinating Diseases/*etiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Male', 'Myelitis/*etiology', 'Postoperative Complications']",,2000/11/22 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/11/22 11:00'],"['2000/11/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/22 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Shinkeigaku. 2000 Jun;40(6):556-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effector cell protease receptor-1 (EPR-1) gene is oriented in the opposite direction on the same DNA double strand. Thus, the Survivin and EPR-1 (Survivin/EPR-1) genes exist in a head-to-head configuration. It is not clear whether mutual expression of the Survivin/EPR-1 genes occurs in both normal cells and cancer cells. Here, we investigated the mutual expression of the Survivin/EPR-1 genes in 12 normal peripheral blood (PB) specimens, seven normal bone marrow (BM) specimens, five lymph node (LN) specimens, and seven leukemic cell lines, and 27 patients with malignant lymphoma (ML), four with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), three with acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), and four with chronic myelocytic leukemia in blastic crisis (CML-BC). Using Northern blot analysis, small amounts of EPR-1 mRNA were detected in normal PB, normal BM and LN specimens, but no Survivin mRNA was detected. However, Survivin mRNA was detected in two of the 12 normal PB, six of the seven normal BM and one of the five LN specimens using reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Expression of both the Survivin and EPR-1 genes was detected in six of the seven cell line samples by Northern blot, and in all of them by RT-PCR. Mutual expression of the Survivin and EPR-1 genes was detected in three of the four CML-BC samples, 15 of the 27 ML samples, two of the four ALL samples, and all three AML samples using the RT-PCR method. No EPR-1 expression with or without Survivin expression was clearly detected in eight of the nine diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLB) specimens, two of the six follicular center lymphoma specimens, one of the four specimens of nodular sclerosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma, two of the four ALL specimens or one of the four CML-BC specimens. The data presented here show that disrupted expression of the Survivin/EPR-1 genes occurred in many kinds of hematologically malignant cells.

Between July 1997 and June 1998, 24 patients with relapsed or refractory AML entered the study. All but one patient had normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at baseline. Performance status according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria was less than two in all cases. All patients have been previously treated by mitoxantrone or anthracyclines. Four cohort of ten patients were scheduled with the following doses: (1) mitoxantrone 36 mg/m2 on day 1; (2) mitoxantrone 45 mg/m2 on day 1; (3) mitoxantrone 60 mg/m2 on day 1; (4) mitoxantrone 75 mg/m2 on day 1 in combination with cytarabine 500 mg/m2 per day (days 1-3, and days 8-10), and etoposide 200 mg/m2 per day (days 8-10). All patients received the full doses of the three drugs. The limiting toxicity was defined as WHO grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity and for impairment of cardiac function by Alexander's criteria (moderate or severe toxicity). The occurrence of limiting toxicity in at least three patients from the same dose level determined the MDT. No limiting toxicity was observed in mitoxantrone dose level 1. Two limiting toxicities were observed in mitoxantrone dose level 2 (one mucositis, one moderate cardiac toxicity), and three limiting toxicities in mitoxantrone dose level 3 (1 high transaminase levels, two moderate cardiac toxicities) ending the assay. Overall, 16 patients (67%) achieved complete remission (CR). One drug-addict patient died from cerebral hemorrhage due to severe aspergillosis and was not considered as a limiting toxicity. After EMA chemotherapy, 13 patients received subsequent chemotherapy courses involving anthracyclines or their derivatives. Six patients underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. No late toxicity occurred. The median survival of the entire cohort was 41.4 weeks. We conclude that (i) EMA chemotherapy using a single injection of mitoxantrone is effective in the treatment of refractory or relapsing AML; (ii) the recommended phase II dose of mitoxantrone is 45 mg/m2 administered over 30 min as a single dose in combination with cytarabine and etoposide.","['Thomas, X', 'Cambier, N', 'Taksin, A L', 'Reman, O', 'Vekhoff, A', 'Pautas, C', 'Leblond, V', 'Soler-Michel, P', 'Ecstein-Fraisse, E', 'Archimbaud, E']","['Thomas X', 'Cambier N', 'Taksin AL', 'Reman O', 'Vekhoff A', 'Pautas C', 'Leblond V', 'Soler-Michel P', 'Ecstein-Fraisse E', 'Archimbaud E']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France. xavier.thomas@chu-lyon.fr""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Patient Selection', 'Recurrence', 'Ventricular Function, Left']",,2000/11/22 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/22 11:00'],"['2000/11/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/22 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(00)00075-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00075-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2000 Nov;24(11):957-63. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00075-8.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",['Leuk Res. 2001 Mar;25(3):217-9.

Bone marrow samples from 14 patients with t(8;21)-positive AML were sequentially examined. The corrected AML1-MTG8 expression level at diagnosis varied in the range from 0.4 to 2.7 (median, 1.5) among the patients.

GGO strongly induced the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK/SAPK) within 2 h in U937 and K562 cells, while neither ERK nor p38 was activated to any considerable extent during GGO-induced apoptosis. Transient expression of a constitutively active mutant form of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1), deltaMEKK1, or of deltaMEKK1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) in K562 cells activated JNK, but not a caspase-3-like protease, and was insufficient to induce cell death but rendered cells susceptible to GGO-induced cell death. Stable expressions of deltaMEKK1-GFP in U937 cells gave similar results. In contrast to VP-16-induced apoptosis, GGO-induced activation of JNK was almost completely inhibited by benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-DEVD) and by benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-CH2OC[O]-2,6,-dichlorobenzene (Z-Asp), indicating that the JNK-activation step is located downstream of the caspase signaling pathway in GGO-induced apoptosis. Moreover, apoptosis induced by GGO was significantly inhibited in two lines of cells with a dominant-negative deletion mutation in c-Jun, indicating a requirement for JNK signaling. In addition, unlike the effects on other inducers of apoptosis, the activation of JNK and of the caspase-3-like protease by GGO was significantly delayed by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), suggesting that the site of inhibition by TPA might be located upstream of the protease and JNK in the GGO-induced apoptotic signaling pathway.","['Masuda, Y', 'Nakaya, M', 'Aiuchi, T', 'Hashimoto, S', 'Nakajo, S', 'Nakaya, K']","['Masuda Y', 'Nakaya M', 'Aiuchi T', 'Hashimoto S', 'Nakajo S', 'Nakaya K']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'K562 Cells', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', '*MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects/physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Mutagenesis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells']",,2000/11/22 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/22 11:00'],"['2000/11/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/22 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(00)00066-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00066-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2000 Nov;24(11):937-50. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00066-7.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'AIA02AJA3A (geranylgeraniol)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, differentiation of K562 cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, modeling aspects of megakaryopoiesis, was partially inhibited by the persistent expression of both the murine + / + and - / - WT1 isoforms. This finding suggests that WT1 plays a role in the regulation of hematopoietic differentiation and is consistent with an oncogenic role for WT1 in leukemogenesis.","['Carrington, D', 'Algar, E']","['Carrington D', 'Algar E']","[""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*toxicity', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*toxicity', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'WT1 Proteins']",,2000/11/22 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/22 11:00'],"['2000/11/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/22 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(00)00064-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00064-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2000 Nov;24(11):927-36. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00064-3.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Its regulatory subunit, Ku autoantigen, binds to DNA and recruits the catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). We show here a new role of DNA-PK in the development of multidrug resistance (MDR). The Ku-DNA binding activity, the levels of Ku70/Ku80 and DNA-PKcs in MDR variants, CEM/VLB(10-2), CEM/VLB(55-8) and CEM/VLB100 were higher than those in their parental drug-sensitive CEM cells in a drug resistance-dependent fashion. Also, CEM/VLB100 cells showed about 3-fold increase of DNA-PK enzyme activity as compared with CEM cells. Similar results were observed in another MDR cell line, FM3A/M mouse mammary carcinoma cells. Moreover, we observed that CEM/VLB100 cells were about 11-fold sensitive to wortmannin, which inhibits DNA-PK, compared with the CEM cells, and sensitized the MDR cells when combined with either bleomycin or vincristine, but have a little effect on CEM cells. Wortmannin was shown to inhibit DNA-PK and Ku-DNA binding activity in CEM/VLB100 cells dose dependently but had a little or no effect on their parental cells. Our results suggested that enhanced expression of DNA-PK participates in the development of MDR, and the use of DNA-PK inhibitors such as wortmannin is likely to improve the effectiveness of anticancer drugs and thus could partially overcome drug resistance in MDR cells, through its ability to inhibit Ku/DNA-PK activity.","['Kim, S H', 'Um, J H', 'Dong-Won, B', 'Kwon, B H', 'Kim, D W', 'Chung, B S', 'Kang, C D']","['Kim SH', 'Um JH', 'Dong-Won B', 'Kwon BH', 'Kim DW', 'Chung BS', 'Kang CD']","['Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, Pusan National University, South Korea. ksh7738@hyowon.pusan.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Androstadienes/*pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Bleomycin/toxicity', 'Cell Line', '*DNA Helicases', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ku Autoantigen', 'Leukemia', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/toxicity', 'Wortmannin']",,2000/11/22 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/22 11:00'],"['2000/11/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/22 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212600000618 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00061-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2000 Nov;24(11):917-25. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00061-8.,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PRKDC protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (XRCC5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Xrcc6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Xrcc6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Xrcc6 protein, rat)', 'EC 4.2.99.- (Ku Autoantigen)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The first LL cell lines, Burkitt's lymphoma-derived lines, were established in 1963. Since then, more than 1000 cell lines have been described, although not all of them in full detail. The major advantages of continuous cell lines is the unlimited supply and worldwide availability of identical cell material, and the infinite viable storability in liquid nitrogen. LL cell lines are characterized generally by monoclonal origin and differentiation arrest, sustained proliferation in vitro under preservation of most cellular features, and specific genetic alterations. The most practical classification of LL cell lines assigns them to one of the physiologically occurring cell lineages, based on their immunophenotype, genotype and functional features. Truly malignant cell lines must be discerned from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized normal cells, using various distinguishing parameters. However, the picture is not quite so straightforward, as some types of LL cell lines are indeed EBV+, and some EBV+ normal cell lines carry also genetic aberrations and may mimic malignancy-associated features. Apart from EBV and human T-cell leukemia virus in some lines, the majority of wild-type LL cell lines are virus-negative. The efficiency of cell line establishment is rather low and the deliberate establishment of new LL cell lines remains by and large an unpredictable random process. Difficulties in establishing continuous cell lines may be caused by the inappropriate selection of nutrients and growth factors for these cells. Clearly, a generally suitable microenvironment for hematopoietic cells, either malignant or normal, cannot yet be created in vitro. The characterization and publication of new LL cell lines should provide important and informative core data, attesting to their scientific significance. Large percentages of LL cell lines are contaminated with mycoplasma (about 30%) or are cross-contaminated with other cell lines (about 15-20%). Solutions to these problems are sensitive detection, effective elimination and rigorous prevention of mycoplasma infection, and proper, regular authentication of cell lines. The underlying cause, however, appears to be negligent cell culture practice. The willingness of investigators to make their LL cell lines available to others is all too often limited. There is a need in the scientific community for clean and authenticated high-quality LL cell lines to which every scientist has access. These are offered by various institutionalized public cell line banks. It has been argued that LL cell lines are genetically unstable (both cytogenetically and molecular genetically). For instance, cell lines are supposed to acquire numerical and structural chromosomal alterations and various types of mutations (e.g. point mutations) in vitro. We present evidence that while nearly 100% of all LL cell lines indeed carry genetic alterations, these alterations appear to be stable rather than unstable. As an example of the practical utility of LL cell lines, the recent advances in studies of classical and molecular cytogenetics, which in large part were made possible by cell lines, are highlighted. A list of the most useful, robust and publicly available reference cell lines that may be used for a variety of experimental purposes is proposed. Clearly, by opening new avenues for investigation, studies of LL cell lines have provided seminal insights into the biology of hematopoietic neoplasia. Over a period of nearly four decades, these initially rather exotic cell cultures, known only to a few specialists, have become ubiquitous powerful research tools that are available to every investigator.","['Drexler, H G', 'Matsuo, A Y', 'MacLeod, R A']","['Drexler HG', 'Matsuo AY', 'MacLeod RA']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany. hdr@dsmz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/genetics/pathology', '*Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Models, Biological', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/11/22 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/22 11:00'],"['2000/11/22 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/22 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212600000709 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00070-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2000 Nov;24(11):881-911. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00070-9.,,,,142,,,,,,,,,

This phenotype is determined in part by cytokines that influence T cell differentiation. In transplantable tumor models such as P1.HTR, tumors grow progressively despite expression of defined tumor Ags. We hypothesized that this failure to reject may be due to poor generation of a type 1 phenotype, through a dominant influence of the type 2-promoting cytokines IL-4 and/or IL-13. This hypothesis was tested by implanting P1.HTR tumors into mice deficient in Stat6. In contrast to progressive growth of P1.HTR tumors in wild-type mice, and aggressive growth even of IL-12-transfected P1.HTR in Stat1(-/-) mice, P1.HTR was spontaneously rejected by Stat6(-/-) mice. Rejection was accompanied by augmented tumor-specific IFN-gamma production and CTL activity.

Since HOXB4 plays a key role in regulating the balance between hematopoietic stem cell renewal and differentiation, we studied the molecular regulation of HOXB4 expression in human hematopoietic stem cells. HOXB4 expression in K562 cells is regulated at the level of transcription, and transient transfection defines primary HOXB4 regulatory sequences within a 99-bp 5' promoter. Culture of highly purified human CD34(+) bone marrow cells in thrombopoietin/Flt-3 ligand/stem cell factor induced HOXB4 3-10-fold, whereas culture in granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, only increased HOXB4/luciferase expression 20-50%. Mutations within the HOXB4 promoter identified a potential E box binding site (HOX response element [HXRE]-2) as the most critical regulatory sequence, and yeast one hybrid assays evaluating bone marrow and K562 libraries for HXRE-2 interaction identified upstream stimulating factor (USF)-2 and micropthalmia transcription factor (MITF). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay with K562 extracts confirmed that these proteins, along with USF-1, bind to the HOXB4 promoter in vitro. Cotransfection assays in both K562 and CD34(+) cells showed that USF-1 and USF-2, but not MITF, induce the HOXB4 promoter in response to signals stimulating stem cell self-renewal, through activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Thus hematopoietic expression of the human HOXB4 gene is regulated by the binding of USF-1 and USF-2, and this process may be favored by cytokines promoting stem cell self-renewal versus differentiation.","['Giannola, D M', 'Shlomchik, W D', 'Jegathesan, M', 'Liebowitz, D', 'Abrams, C S', 'Kadesch, T', 'Dancis, A', 'Emerson, S G']","['Giannola DM', 'Shlomchik WD', 'Jegathesan M', 'Liebowitz D', 'Abrams CS', 'Kadesch T', 'Dancis A', 'Emerson SG']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Genomic Library', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Upstream Stimulatory Factors', 'ras Proteins']",PMC2193192,2000/11/21 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/21 11:00'],"['2000/11/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/21 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.192.10.1479 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 2000 Nov 20;192(10):1479-90. doi: 10.1084/jem.192.10.1479.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HOXB4 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (USF1 protein, human)', '0 (Upstream Stimulatory Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,,,,,['GENBANK/AF307160'],,,,,,

The genetically engineered Campath-1H has been utilized in the treatment of lymphomas and lymphoid leukemias with impressive results. T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphomas appear to be particularly good targets for this agent. Campath-1H may be administered intravenously or subcutaneously. Infectious complications are the most significant side effect associated with its usage, with fevers, chills, nausea, and vomiting most common. Antibiotic prophylaxis has made the infectious morbidity associated with Campath-1H more manageable. The efficacy demonstrated in clinical trials and manageable toxicities make Campath-1H an appealing agent in the treatment of hematologic malignancies.","['Flynn, J M', 'Byrd, J C']","['Flynn JM', 'Byrd JC']","['Department of Medicine, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC 20307, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Mice']",,2000/11/21 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/11/21 11:00'],"['2000/11/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/21 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001622-200011000-00010 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2000 Nov;12(6):574-81. doi: 10.1097/00001622-200011000-00010.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",,,75,['P01 CA81534-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

METHODS: Intracellular expression of type-1 (interferon [IFN]-gamma) and type-2 (interleukin [IL]-4) cytokines and apoptosis-related molecules (Apo2. 7, Bcl-2 protein) was studied by flow cytometry in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), myeloma (U-266), monocytic (THP-1), and T-leukemia cells (MOLT-4) in response to toxins, which act on different intracellular targets (actinomycin D, cycloheximide, the mistletoe lectins [ML]-1 and ML-3, brefeldin A, staurosporine). RESULTS: The apoptosis-inducing toxins stimulated intracellular IL-4 expression mainly in PBMC with high expression of the mitochondrial apoptosis marker, Apo2.7, but with decreased level of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein. Up-regulation of IL-4 coincided with a significant down-regulation of IFN-gamma in CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells. The inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation, oligomycin, and the caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk, abolished IL-4 expression and DNA fragmentation in the PBMC. Also in the myeloma, monocytic, and T-leukemia cells, IL-4 was mainly observed in the Apo2.7(+) apoptotic cells in response to the toxins. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the different apoptotic toxins activate a common pathway in which IL-4 production plays a yet unknown intracellular role further downstream during apoptosis.","['Stein, G M', 'Pfuller, U', 'Schietzel, M', 'Bussing, A']","['Stein GM', 'Pfuller U', 'Schietzel M', 'Bussing A']","['Krebsforschung Herdecke, Department of Applied Immunology, University Witten/Herdecke, Communal Hospital, Herdecke, Germany. stein.g@debitel.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Brefeldin A/pharmacology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation/drug effects', '*Plant Preparations', '*Plant Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Toxins, Biological/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/11/21 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/21 11:00'],"['2000/11/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/21 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0320(20001201)41:4<261::AID-CYTO4>3.0.CO;2-S [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0320(20001201)41:4<261::aid-cyto4>3.0.co;2-s [doi]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 2000 Dec 1;41(4):261-70. doi: 10.1002/1097-0320(20001201)41:4<261::aid-cyto4>3.0.co;2-s.,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Plant Preparations)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2)', '0 (Toxins, Biological)', '0 (ribosome inactivating protein, Viscum)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

Other tumours being suspected are non-lymphoblastic acute leukaemia and astrocytoma. In head and neck cancer, carcinogenicity was observed for regular (i.e. more than once a day for years) cannabis smokers. Moreover, cannabis increases the risk of head and neck cancer in a dose-response manner for frequency and duration of use. Interaction was observed with cigarette smoking and alcohol use. Delta9-THC seems to have a specific carcinogenic effect different from that of the pyrolysis products. Epidemiological studies are needed as soon as possible to provide data on the European and French situation.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirteen postpubertal males were studied (Tanner stage V), 9 with ALL and 4 with HD, who had received polychemotherapy during the pre-puberal period. The control group was composed of 13 male volunteers of similar ages and with complete pubertal development. Testicular size, spermiogram, serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) before and after stimulus with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), and serum testosterone levels were determined. The germinal epithelium was believed to be damaged when at least one of the following criteria was present: 1) oligospermia/azoospermia, 2) increase in serum FSH levels before or after GnRH, or 3) reduction in testicular volume. Lesions in Leydig's cells were thought to exist when serum testosterone levels were reduced or when serum LH levels, before or after stimulus, increased. RESULTS: Patients with HD presented clear alterations in germinal function and, to a lesser degree, in the function of Leydig's cells. Significant differences compared with the control group (p < 0.001) were found in peak FSH (19.7 +/- 18 vs 4.8 +/- 1.8 microUI/mL), peak LH (49.2 +/- 31 vs 33.4 +/- 10.0 microUI/mL), serum testosterone (4.1 +/- 0.6 vs 5.9 +/- 0.3 ng/mL) and testicular volume (16.6 +/- 2.8 vs 22.5 +/- 2.4 mL). Of the four patients with HD, three presented azoospermia and one oligospermia. No significant differences in any of the clinical or biochemical parameters studied were found in patients surviving ALL compared with the control group, but two of the nine patients studied presented oligospermia. CONCLUSIONS: The chemotherapy protocols used in the treatment of HD and ALL produced a high incidence of germinal cell damage and subclinical alterations in the Leydig's cell function in males with HD. In patients with ALL, the germinal line was only mildly affected. Prepubertal state does not protect the testes from the harmful effects of chemotherapy.","['Soriano Guillen , L', 'Munoz Calvo , M T', 'Pozo Roman , J', 'Contra Gomez , T', 'Buno Soto , M', 'Argente Oliver , J']","['Soriano Guillen L', 'Munoz Calvo MT', 'Pozo Roman J', 'Contra Gomez T', 'Buno Soto M', 'Argente Oliver J']",['Secciones de Endocrinologia y Oncologia Pediatricas.

Some N-phenylphthalimide or N-phenylhomophthalimide derivative showed potent protease inhibitory activity in an assay system using human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, Molt-4, with alanin-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (ala-AMC) as a substrate. Especially, 2-(2,6-diethylphenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-1,3-dione (PIQ-22) (3) was found to be the most potent inhibitor and further it showed potent tumor-cell invasion inhibitory activity that is more effective than potent peptide aminopeptidase inhibitors such as bestatin (1) or actinonin (2). For the further investigation of this novel protease inhibitory activity, we have carried out the structural development of PIQ-22 (3) and it is assumed that tautomerism of imidobenzoylketone in cyclic imide structure may be related to the inhibitory activity. The requirement for the activity of electron donating groups such as NH2 or OH to the condensed phenyl ring in phthalimide inhibitors also supports this possibility. The target aminopeptidase of PIQ-22 was identified as puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA), by N-terminal amino acid sequencing, and by comparison with chromatographic behavior and substrate-selectivity, and so on. Lineweaver-Burk plot showed that PSA is inhibited by PIQ-22 (3) in a noncompetitive manner while puromycin (83) and bestatin (1) inhibit PSA competitively.","['Takahashi, H', 'Komoda, M', 'Kakuta, H', 'Hashimoto, Y']","['Takahashi H', 'Komoda M', 'Kakuta H', 'Hashimoto Y']","['Institute of Molecular and Cellular Bioscience, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Japan,Yakugaku Zasshi,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,0413613,IM,"['Aminopeptidases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Humans', '*Imides', '*Isoquinolines/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Phthalimides', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,2000/11/18 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/11/18 11:00'],"['2000/11/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/18 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/yakushi1947.120.10_909 [doi]'],ppublish,Yakugaku Zasshi. 2000 Oct;120(10):909-21. doi: 10.1248/yakushi1947.120.10_909.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imides)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (N-(2,6-diethylphenyl)homophthalimide)', '0 (Phthalimides)', '520-03-6 (N-phenylphthalimide)', 'EC 3.4.11.- (Aminopeptidases)']",,,25,,,,,,,,,

RTF is expressed in vivo on the surface of individuals with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and on activated T lymphocytes of HIV infected individuals as determined by their coexpression with CD38 and HLA-DR. The unique expression patterns of this protein in vivo lead us to investigate its expression in vitro. The activation of human PBMCs through the TCR, using anti-CD3 antibody and PMA, upregulated cell surface expression of RTF from 2. 3% to 91.2% (mean channel fluorescence [MCF] increased threefold). The activation of Jurkat T cells through the TCR upregulated surface expression of RTF from 8.3% (MCF-1.3) to 58.7% (MCF-13.1). The Jurkat T-cell line was used as a model system to explore RTF's role in cellular activation. Using the Jurkat T-cell model, we found anti-RTF antibody induces apoptosis. The addition of anti-RTF antibody increased annexin V binding by threefold compared with the IgG1 kappa isotype control antibody (p < 0.00002) and activated caspase 3.

As a first step toward this goal, we constructed self-inactivating derivatives of the HIV-1-based transfer vector pHR' containing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene as reporter and the Woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE). GFP expression was driven by a variety of strong viral and cellular promoters, including the murine stem cell virus (MSCV) long terminal repeat (LTR), a Gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) LTR, the human elongation factor 1alpha (EF1alpha) promoter, the composite CAG promoter (consisting of the CMV immediate early enhancer and the chicken beta-actin promoter), and the human phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK) promoter. In contrast to results obtained in human embryonic kidney 293T cells and fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells, in which the CMV promoter expressed GFP at the highest levels, significantly higher levels of GFP expression (3- to 5-fold) were achieved with the MSCV LTR, the EF1alpha promoter, and the CAG promoter in the human HSPC line KG1a. Removal of the WPRE indicated that it stimulated GFP expression from all of the vectors in KG1a cells (up to 3-fold), although it only marginally improved the performance of the intron-containing EF1alpha and CAG promoters (<1.5-fold stimulation). The vectors using the MSCV LTR, the GALV LTR, and the PGK promoter were the most efficient at transducing primary human CD34+ cord blood progenitors under the conditions employed. High-level GFP expression in the NOD/SCID xenograft model was demonstrated with the pHR' derivative bearing the MSCV LTR. These new lentiviral vector backbones provide a basis for the rational design of improved delivery vehicles for human HSPC gene transfer applications.","['Ramezani, A', 'Hawley, T S', 'Hawley, R G']","['Ramezani A', 'Hawley TS', 'Hawley RG']","['Hematopoiesis Department, American Red Cross, Rockville, Maryland 20855, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Fetal Blood/metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents/metabolism', 'Lentivirus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/11/18 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/18 11:00'],"['2000/11/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/18 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/mthe.2000.0190 [doi]', 'S1525-0016(00)90190-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2000 Nov;2(5):458-69. doi: 10.1006/mthe.2000.0190.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

During apoptosis, Bcl-2 was cleaved into a shortened fragment (Bcl-2/Delta34) by a caspase-3-like protease in human Mo7e megakaryocytic leukemia cells deprived of exogenous rhGM-CSF. Results from cell fractionation and immunoblot analyses indicated that both Bcl-2 and Bcl-2/Delta34 were located exclusively on the mitochondria of Mo7e cells. Treatment of isolated mitochondria with recombinant caspase-3 induced the same cleavage of Bcl-2 in vitro and caused the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the supernatant. The antiapoptotic effect of Bcl-2/Delta34 was investigated using an in vitro protein translation approach. Both Bcl-2/Delta34 and Bax proteins generated in wheat germ extract were readily relocated to the mitochondria isolated from control Mo7e cells. Insertion of Bax, but not Bcl-2/Delta34, into mitochondria triggered a rapid release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that, unlike Bcl-2, the cleaved Bcl-2 fragment was no longer functional for dimerization with either Bcl-2 or Bax. Taken together, these findings showed that the integrity of Bcl-2 is necessary for its function of heterodimerization with Bax, which appears to be one of the mechanisms of antiapoptotic effect of Bcl-2.","['Lin, H', 'Zhang, X M', 'Chen, C', 'Chen, B D']","['Lin H', 'Zhang XM', 'Chen C', 'Chen BD']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2000/11/18 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/18 11:00'],"['2000/11/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/18 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/excr.2000.5036 [doi]', 'S0014-4827(00)95036-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2000 Nov 25;261(1):180-6. doi: 10.1006/excr.2000.5036.,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,['CA 73212/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,

Mast cells derive from the bone marrow and are responsible for the development of allergic and possibly inflammatory reactions. Mast cells are stimulated by immunoglobulin E (IgE) and specific antigen, but also by a number of neuropeptides such as neurotensin (NT), somatostatin or substance P (SP), to secrete numerous pro-inflammatory molecules that include histamine, cytokines and proteolytic enzymes. 2. Chondroitin sulphate, a major constituent of connective tissues and of mast cell secretory granules, had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on rat peritoneal mast cell release of histamine induced by the mast cell secretagogue compound 48/80 (48/80). This inhibition was stronger than that of the clinically available mast cell 'stabilizer' disodium cromoglycate (cromolyn). Inhibition by chondroitin sulphate increased with the length of preincubation and persisted after the drug was washed off, while the effect of cromolyn was limited by rapid tachyphylaxis. 3. Immunologic stimulation of histamine secretion from rat connective tissue mast cells (CTMC) was also inhibited, but this effect was weaker in umbilical cord-derived human mast cells and was absent in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells which are considered homologous to mucosal mast cells (MMC). Oligo- and monosaccharides were not as effective as the polysaccharides. 4. Inhibition, documented by light and electron microscopy, involved a decrease of intracellular calcium ion levels shown by confocal microscopy and image analysis. Autoradiography at the ultrastructural level showed that chondroitin sulphate was mostly associated with plasma and perigranular membranes. 5. Chondroitin sulphate appears to be a potent mast cell inhibitor of allergic and nonimmune stimulation with potential clinical implications.","['Theoharides, T C', 'Patra, P', 'Boucher, W', 'Letourneau, R', 'Kempuraj, D', 'Chiang, G', 'Jeudy, S', 'Hesse, L', 'Athanasiou, A']","['Theoharides TC', 'Patra P', 'Boucher W', 'Letourneau R', 'Kempuraj D', 'Chiang G', 'Jeudy S', 'Hesse L', 'Athanasiou A']","['Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Tufts University School of Medicine, 136 Harrison Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts, MA 02111, USA. theoharis.theoharides@tufts.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Asthmatic Agents/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Chondroitin Sulfates/*pharmacology', 'Connective Tissue/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cromolyn Sodium/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",PMC1572430,2000/11/18 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/11/18 11:00'],"['2000/11/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/18 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjp.0703672 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2000 Nov;131(6):1039-49. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0703672.,"['0 (Anti-Asthmatic Agents)', '9007-28-7 (Chondroitin Sulfates)', 'Q2WXR1I0PK (Cromolyn Sodium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a number of tumors, tumor-derived cell lines and in vitro immortalized cell lines have been described that do not express detectable telomerase activity. These lines utilize a mechanism, termed Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT), to provide telomere maintenance. A subset of the cells in each ALT cell line contain a novel form of the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body (PML NB) in which telomeric DNA and the telomere binding proteins TRF1 and TRF2 co-localize with the PML protein, termed ALT-associated PML bodies (AA-PBs). In contrast, in non-ALT, telomerase-positive cell lines these telomeric proteins and the PML NB occupy distinct and separate subnuclear domains. PML NBs have been implicated in terminal differentiation, growth suppression and apoptosis. The role, if any, of AA-PBs in telomere maintenance or culture viability in telomerase negative cell lines is unclear, but it has been suggested that cells containing these structures are no longer viable and are marked for eventual death. We utilized a series of human ovarian surface epithelium (HOSE) cell lines that use ALT for telomere maintenance to determine if AA-PBs are indeed markers of cells in these cultures that are no longer cycling. We show that AA-PB positive cells incorporate BrdU and thus are able to carry out DNA replication. In addition, AA-PBs are present in mitotic cells and the frequency of cells containing these structures is increased when cultures are enriched for cells in the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle suggesting that the formation of AA-PBs is coordinately regulated with the cell cycle. Finally, we demonstrate that the majority of the AA-PB positive cells in the culture are not destined for immediate apoptosis. Taken together the data argue against AA-PBs marking cells destined for death and, instead, raise the possibility that these structures may be actively involved in telomere maintenance via the ALT pathway.","['Grobelny, J V', 'Godwin, A K', 'Broccoli, D']","['Grobelny JV', 'Godwin AK', 'Broccoli D']","['Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia PA 1911, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Female', 'G2 Phase', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mitosis/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Ovary/cytology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Telomere/*physiology', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2000/11/18 11:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2000/11/18 11:00'],"['2000/11/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/18 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2000 Dec;113 Pt 24:4577-85.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,,,"['N01-CN-95307/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA83638/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA70328/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

CD34+ cells were enriched by clinical-scale magnetic-activated cell separation (MACS) using iron-dextran beads bound to monoclonal anti-CD34 antibody. Grafts contained a median of 9.7 (range 1.7-16.6) x 10(6) CD34+ cells per kilogram of recipient body weight with a purity between 94.5% and 98.3% (median 97.2%). The median number of transfused CD3+ T lymphocytes was 1.0 (range 0.5-8.5) x 10(4)/kg, corresponding to a log10 T lymphocyte depletion between 3.8 and 5.0 (median 4.6). All patients engrafted rapidly with a median duration to neutrophil counts >500/microl of 8 (range 8-19) days and to self-sustaining platelet counts >20,000/microl of 12 (range 9-25) days.

In addition, it has been found in a few GH- and ACTH-producing human pituitary adenomas. The aim of our study was to investigate the presence of LIF in various morphologic types of human pituitary adenomas. Ninety-eight operated pituitary adenomas diagnosed by light microscopy and classified by pituitary hormone immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy were studied. Sixty-eight tumors were functioning and included 15 densely granulated (DG) and 10 sparsely granulated (SG) somatotroph (SM) adenomas, 5 lactotroph (LT), 7 mixed SM-LT and 31 corticotroph (CRT) adenomas. The remaining 30 nonfunctioning tumors included 11 gonadotroph (GON) and 19 null cell (NULL) adenomas. For immunocytochemical demonstration of LIF, a specific polyclonal antiserum was applied on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. The immunohistoscore ranging from 1 to 64 grades was determined by multiplying the immunostaining grade (1-4) by the staining intensity grade (1-4), and by the heterogeneity grade (1-4). Ninety adenomas (92%) were variably immunopositive for LIF. LIF was expressed in 77.5% of CRT, 81.8% of GON, 93.3% of DG-SM, and in all SG-SM, LT, SM-LT and NULL adenomas. LT adenomas showed the highest immunostaining grade, followed by SG-SM, GON, NULL, SM-LT, DG-SM, LT and CRT adenomas. GON adenomas showed the highest immunohistoscore, followed by NULL, DG-SM, SM-LT, SG-SM, LT and CRT adenomas. Nonfunctioning tumors showed a significantly higher immunohistoscore compared to functioning adenomas (p < 0.01). We conclude that LIF expression is frequent in all types of functioning and nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas.","['Kontogeorgos, G', 'Patralexis, H', 'Tran, A', 'Kovacs, K', 'Melmed, S']","['Kontogeorgos G', 'Patralexis H', 'Tran A', 'Kovacs K', 'Melmed S']","['Department of Pathology, G.

Elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-1 observed in the cerebrospinal fluid of HAM-TSP patients suggest that cytokine dysregulation within the CNS is involved in neuropathogenesis. HTLV-1 infection and enhanced expression of TNF-alpha by microglial cells, astrocytes, and macrophages has been hypothesized to lead to the destruction of myelin and oligodendrocytes in the CNS. Although the association of HTLV-2 infection and development of neurological disease is more tenuous, HTLV-2 has also been found to be associated with peripheral neuropathies. To investigate the roles of HTLV Tax(1) and Tax(2) in the induction of cytokine disregulation in these cell types, we are currently developing gene delivery vectors based on human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) capable of stably coexpressing the HTLV-1 or -2 tax and eGFP reporter genes in primary human cells. Transduction frequencies of up to 50%, as assessed by eGFP expression, can be achieved in human monocyte-derived macrophages and in explanted cultures of human microglia. Preliminary data suggest that Tax(1) expression is sufficient to up-regulate the proinflammatory cytokine profile in explanted human microglial cells.

In the present study, we investigate the role of host immunity on HTLV-1 leukemogenesis in vivo by using animal models. At first, we examined the effect of the routes of HTLV-1 transmission on the host anti-HTLV-1 immune responses. When immune competent adult rats were inoculated with HTLV-1-infected cells, the orally infected rats were persistently infected with HTLV-1 without humoral and cellular immune responses against HTLV-1, whereas all intravenously or intraperitoneally inoculated rats showed significant levels of immune responses. Next, we examined in vivo tumorigenicity of HTLV-1-immortalized cells in the absence of T cell immunity, by using athymic F344/N Jcl-rnu/rnu (nu/nu) rats. When inoculated into nu/nu rats, not all but some HTLV-1-immortalized rat cell lines including syngeneic FPM1-V1AX could grow and form T cell lymphoma in vivo.

Where chronic infection results in overt pathology, this is treated largely symptomatically and control of transmission relies on physical and educational constraints. The poor infectious transmission rate of HTLV-1 has long been described but to date has not been exploited in preventative measures to combat the spread of the virus. We undertook to investigate some of the molecular steps involved in HTLV-1 cell-cell fusion, the main mechanism of transmission. We showed that poor transmission may relate in part to an inefficiency in adopting and maintaining a fusion competent conformation of the HTLV-1 envelope TM protein. In cell-cell fusion, this deficiency can be complemented by accessory molecules on both infected and target cells that stabilize the envelope/receptor interaction. In virion-cell fusion, this is less likely, leading to an inefficient interaction and poor infectious transmission by cell-free virus. A discussion of the accessory molecules involved in HTLV-1 fusion is presented. This weak envelope-dependent interaction with target cells in the host can be potently disrupted by peptides that destabilize the TM protein structure and significantly inhibit HTLV-1 fusion. These observations may be useful in the design of therapeutic agents to prevent HTLV-1 transmission.","['Daenke, S', 'Booth, S']","['Daenke S', 'Booth S']","['Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford OX3 9DU, England, UK. susan.daenke@oxford-biologica.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Fusion Regulatory Protein-1', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/*transmission/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Integrins/genetics/metabolism', '*Membrane Fusion', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/*metabolism', 'env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",,2000/11/18 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/11/18 11:00'],"['2000/11/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/18 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/08892220050193227 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2000 Nov 1;16(16):1731-6. doi: 10.1089/08892220050193227.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Fusion Regulatory Protein-1)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (HTLV-I receptor)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (gp21 protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",,,20,,,,,,,,,

The peptide segment corresponding to the region from Asp-197 to Leu-216 (gp46-197), and which serves as a binding site to both HSC70 and PG for syncytium formation, also had cytotoxic effects on target cell MOLT-4. This cytotoxicity was due to necrosis, not apoptosis.

Amino acid alterations between HTLV-1 gp46-197 and HTLV-2 gp46-194 were significant on the hydrophilic face of the amphipathic structure.

These cells occasionally convert to factor independence. The viral oncoprotein Tax acts as an essential growth factor of transformed lymphocytes and stimulates the cell cycle in the G(1) phase. In T cells and fibroblasts Tax enhances the activity of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) CDK4 and CDK6. These kinases, which require binding to cyclin D isotypes for their activity, control the G(1) phase. Coimmunoprecipitation from these cells revealed that Tax associates with cyclin D3/CDK6, suggesting a direct activation of this kinase. The CDK stimulation may account in part for the mitogenic Tax effect, which causes IL-2-dependent T cell growth by Tax. To address the conversion to IL-2-independent proliferation and to identify overexpressed genes, which contribute to the transformed growth, the gene expression patterns of HTLV-1-transformed T cells were compared with that of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Potentially overexpressed cDNAs were cloned, sequenced, and used to determine the RNA expression. Genes found to be up-regulated are involved in signal transduction (STAT5a, cyclin G(1), c-fgr, hPGT) and also glycoprotein synthesis (LDLC, ribophorin). Many of these are also activated during T cell activation and implicated in the regulation of growth and apoptosis. The transcription factor STAT5a, which is involved in IL-2 signaling, was strongly up-regulated only in IL-2-independent cells, thus suggesting that it contributes to factor-independent growth. Thus, the differentially expressed genes could cooperate with the Tax-induced cell cycle stimulation in the maintenance of IL-2-dependent and IL-2-independent growth of HTLV-transformed lymphocytes.","['Haller, K', 'Ruckes, T', 'Schmitt, I', 'Saul, D', 'Derow, E', 'Grassmann, R']","['Haller K', 'Ruckes T', 'Schmitt I', 'Saul D', 'Derow E', 'Grassmann R']","['Institut fur Klinische und Molekulare Virologie, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*metabolism', 'G1 Phase', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology/*virology', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,2000/11/18 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/11/18 11:00'],"['2000/11/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/18 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/08892220050193146 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2000 Nov 1;16(16):1683-8. doi: 10.1089/08892220050193146.,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been associated with rare cases of CD8(+) T lymphoproliferative disorders, and has a controversial role as a pathogen. The loss of p53 function, as a consequence of mutation or inactivation, increases the chances of genetic damage. Indeed, the importance of p53 as a tumor suppressor is evident from the fact that over 60% of all human cancers have a mutant or inactive p53. p53 status has been extensively studied in HTLV-1-infected cell lines. Interestingly, despite the fact that p53 mutations have been found in only a minority of cells, the p53 functions were found to be impaired. We have analyzed the functional activity of the p53 tumor suppressor in cells transformed with HTLV-2 subtypes A and B. As with HTLV-1-infected cells, abundant levels of the p53 protein are detected in HTLV-2 virus-infected cell lines. Using p53 reporter plasmid or induction of p53-responsive genes in response to gamma-irradiation, the p53 was found to be transcriptionally inhibited in HTLV-2-infected cells. Interestingly, although Tax-2A and-2B inactivate p53, the Tax-2A protein appears to inhibit p53 function less efficiently than either Tax-1 or Tax-2B in T cells, but not in fibroblasts.","['Mahieux, R', 'Pise-Masison, C A', 'Nicot, C', 'Green, P', 'Hall, W W', 'Brady, J N']","['Mahieux R', 'Pise-Masison CA', 'Nicot C', 'Green P', 'Hall WW', 'Brady JN']","['Basic Research Laboratory, Bldg. 41, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/virology', 'HTLV-II Infections/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",,2000/11/18 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/11/18 11:00'],"['2000/11/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/18 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/08892220050193137 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2000 Nov 1;16(16):1677-81. doi: 10.1089/08892220050193137.,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 is associated with adult T cell leukemia, a malignancy of mature CD4(+) T cells, and a chronic neurological disorder termed HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HTLV-2 is less pathogenic and has been associated with a few cases of a variant of hairy cell leukemia and neurological disease. Previous studies have indicated that in vivo HTLV-1 has a preferential tropism for CD4(+) T cells, whereas HTLV-2 in vivo tropism is less clear, but appears to favor CD8(+) T cells. The molecular mechanism that determines the cellular tropism of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 has not been precisely determined. However, one study by our group has provided evidence that HTLV-1-enhanced viral transcription in CD4(+) T cells may be responsible for its tropism. In an effort to understand HTLV-2 tropism we tested the ability of HTLV-2 to infect, replicate in, and transform purified CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells in cell culture. After cocultures of purified primary human CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells with an HTLV-2-producer cell line we measured viral transcription by reverse transcription PCR analysis, virus production by p19(gag) ELISA, proviral integration by DNA slot-blot analysis, surface phenotype by FACS analysis, and cellular transformation. We also measured HTLV-2 long terminal repeat-directed transcription in the presence and absence of Tax in purified CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, using transient transfection assays. Our data indicate that CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells are equally susceptible to HTLV-2 infection. We observed no significant difference in viral transcription based on mRNA and virus production in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell cocultures. Although LTR transcription was enhanced 12- to 16-fold in the presence of Tax, there was no significant difference in CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells. Interestingly, we show that HTLV-2 preferentially transforms CD8(+) T cells in culture. Together, our data indicate that, unlike HTLV-1, HTLV-2 cell tropism is not due to inhibition of viral infection and inefficient gene expression in CD4(+) versus CD8(+) T cells, and likely involves unique interactions with viral and CD8(+) T cell-specific proteins.","['Wang, T G', 'Ye, J', 'Lairmore, M D', 'Green, P L']","['Wang TG', 'Ye J', 'Lairmore MD', 'Green PL']","['Center for Retrovirus Research and Department of Veterinary Biosciences, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Virus Replication']",,2000/11/18 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/11/18 11:00'],"['2000/11/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/18 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/08892220050193119 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2000 Nov 1;16(16):1661-8. doi: 10.1089/08892220050193119.,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",,,,['CA77556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Several studies using antisense constructs or antisense oligonucleotides as well as overexpression experiments suggest that B-Myb plays an important role in the transition from G(1) to S phase of the cell cycle and that B-Myb expression is cell cycle regulated. We have previously demonstrated that the human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV1) trans-activator Tax is able to repress transcription from c-myb promoter reporter constructs as well as from the endogenous c-myb promoter in human T cells and that this effect is mediated through inhibition of the c-Myb trans-activating functions. Here we report that both HTLV-1 as well as HTLV-2 Tax proteins inhibit c-Myb trans-activation in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). In addition to c-Myb, B-Myb expression is also markedly downregulated in HTLV-1-transformed cells at both RNA and protein levels. Furthermore, by using a Jurkat T cell line stably transfected with a tax gene driven by a cadmium-inducible promoter (JPX9), we were able to demonstrate that Tax directly represses the endogenous B-myb promoter in T cells. Because c-Myb and B-Myb have been involved in cell cycle progression, our results suggest that Tax, by repressing both c-Myb and B-Myb endogenous promoters, may bypass their requirement for cell cycle progression in HTLV-1-transformed T cells.","['Nicot, C', 'Opavsky, R', 'Mahieux, R', 'Johnson, J M', 'Brady, J N', 'Wolff, L', 'Franchini, G']","['Nicot C', 'Opavsky R', 'Mahieux R', 'Johnson JM', 'Brady JN', 'Wolff L', 'Franchini G']","['Division of Basic Sciences, Basic Research Laboratory, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA. cbeben@helix.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Products, tax/*pharmacology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",,2000/11/18 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/11/18 11:00'],"['2000/11/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/18 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/08892220050193065 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2000 Nov 1;16(16):1629-32. doi: 10.1089/08892220050193065.,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (MYBL2 protein, human)', '0 (Mybl2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously demonstrated that Tax activates expression of the cellular gene, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and that Tax suppresses DNA repair. In this study we tested the ability of previously described Tax mutants to activate PCNA gene expression and their ability to interfere with DNA repair. The results revealed a strong correlation between Tax trans-activation of PCNA gene expression and its ability to inhibit DNA repair via the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. Thus, a consequence of activated PCNA gene expression appears to be reduced DNA repair capacity.

The oncogenic potential of HTLV-1 resides in the 353-aa, 40-kDa viral Tax oncoprotein, a positive regulator of viral gene transcription. A novel member of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of transcription factors, IRF-4, was shown to be constitutively produced in HTLV-1-infected cells. IRF-4 is transiently expressed in anti-CD3 and PMA/ionomycin-stimulated T lymphocytes but not in continuous non-Tax-expressing T cell lines. In transient coexpression assays, HTLV-1 Tax protein induced the 1. 2-kb IRF-4 promoter, indicating that Tax functions as an indirect trans-activator of the IRF-4 gene. Furthermore, IRF-4 levels in HTLV-1-infected cells appear to be proportional to the level of Tax expression, suggesting a role for IRF-4 in T cell transformation. In an effort to further characterize IRF-4 function, we identified a novel interaction between IRF-4 and FKBP52, a 59-kDa member of the immunophilin family with peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity (PPIase). IRF-4-FKBP52 association inhibited the interaction between IRF-4 and its DNA-binding partner PU.1, as well as the trans-activation function of IRF-4/PU.1. FKBP52 association resulted in a structural modification of IRF-4, detectable by immunoblot analysis and by IRF-4 partial proteolysis. These results demonstrate a novel posttranslational mechanism of transcriptional control, mediated through the interaction of an immunophilin with a transcriptional regulator.","['Sharma, S', 'Mamane, Y', 'Grandvaux, N', 'Bartlett, J', 'Petropoulos, L', 'Lin, R', 'Hiscott, J']","['Sharma S', 'Mamane Y', 'Grandvaux N', 'Bartlett J', 'Petropoulos L', 'Lin R', 'Hiscott J']","['Terry Fox Molecular Oncology Group, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, McGill University, Montreal, Canada H3T 1E2.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,IM,"['Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*virology', 'Tacrolimus Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Up-Regulation']",,2000/11/18 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/11/18 11:00'],"['2000/11/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/18 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/08892220050193047 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2000 Nov 1;16(16):1613-22. doi: 10.1089/08892220050193047.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-4)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Tacrolimus Binding Proteins)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (tacrolimus binding protein 4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have examined the ability of Tax to activate transcription through the AP-1-binding site (AP-1 site). A transient transfection study showed that Tax can activate transcription through the AP-1-binding site in a human T cell line, whereas any combination of AP-1 proteins did so much less than Tax, indicating that the activation of the AP-1 site by Tax may require a mechanism other than the induction of AP-1 mRNA. Fresh peripheral blood leukemia cells of all surveyed ATL patients displayed constitutive AP-1 DNA-binding activity, whereas no normal individuals did. However, the HTLV-1 genes, including tax, are not significantly expressed in fresh leukemia cells from ATL patients.

The formation of this complex is believed to promote strong Tax-dependent transcriptional activation of viral gene expression. In this study, we characterize a series of internal CREB deletion mutants with respect to Tax and CBP recruitment and transcriptional activation. We find that, although several of these mutants are unable to support ternary complex formation with Tax and the viral CRE DNA, they are fully competent for cooperation with Tax in CBP recruitment. Unexpectedly, CREB proteins that carry deletions in a carboxyterminal region of the KID domain, while competent for ternary and quaternary complex formation, were defective for Tax trans-activation in vivo. These studies suggest that CREB may serve more than just a ""scaffolding"" role in Tax trans-activation, cooperating directly with Tax (and CBP) to mediate strong transcriptional activation of the provirus.","['Mick, J E', 'Colgin, M A', 'Brauweiler, A', 'Nyborg, J K']","['Mick JE', 'Colgin MA', 'Brauweiler A', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523-1870, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,IM,"['CREB-Binding Protein', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/11/18 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/11/18 11:00'],"['2000/11/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/18 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/08892220050193010 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2000 Nov 1;16(16):1597-601. doi: 10.1089/08892220050193010.,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)']",,,,"['R01 CA055035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA055035-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Tax activates NF-kappaB by stimulating the activity of the I-kappaB kinase (IKK), which in turn leads to phosphorylation and degradation of the NF-kappaB inhibitor I-kappaBalpha. In normal T cells, IKK activation occurs transiently on cellular stimulation through the T cell receptor (TCR) and the CD28 costimulatory molecule. However, this inducible kinase is constitutively activated in Tax-expressing and HTLV-1-infected T cells, which contributes to the deregulated nuclear expression of NF-kappaB. As a genetic approach to dissect the pathways mediating IKK activation by Tax and T cell activation signals, somatic cell mutagenesis was performed to isolate signaling-defective mutant Jurkat T cell lines. One of the mutant cell lines was shown to have a defect in NF-kappaB activation by both T cell mitogens and Tax. Interestingly, this mutant cell line lacks expression of the IKK regulatory protein, IKKgamma. Expression of exogenous IKKgamma in the mutant cells restored NF-kappaB activation, thus confirming the essential role of this regulatory factor in IKK activation by the cellular and viral stimuli. Mechanistic studies have shown that Tax physically interacts with IKKgamma via specific domains, including two homologous leucine zipper motifs present in IKKgamma. The Tax/IKKgamma interaction serves to recruit Tax to the IKK catalytic subunits, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, and this recruitment appears to be an essential mechanism by which Tax stimulates the activity of IKK.","['Sun, S C', 'Harhaj, E W', 'Xiao, G', 'Good, L']","['Sun SC', 'Harhaj EW', 'Xiao G', 'Good L']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033, USA. sxs70@psu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*enzymology/immunology/virology']",,2000/11/18 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/11/18 11:00'],"['2000/11/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/18 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/08892220050193001 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2000 Nov 1;16(16):1591-6. doi: 10.1089/08892220050193001.,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKE protein, human)']",,,41,"['1R01AI45045/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA68471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Using the comet assay in conjunction with bacterial formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG protein), we now provide indirect evidence that the same treatment leads to the induction of 8-oxoguanine, a premutagenic oxidative DNA base modification in V79 and mouse lymphoma (L5178Y) cells. We also demonstrate that HBO efficiently induces mutations in the mouse lymphoma assay (MLA). Exposure of L5178Y cells to HBO (98% O(2); 3bar) for 2h caused a clear mutagenic effect in the MLA, which was further enhanced after a 3h exposure. As this mutagenic effect was solely due to the strong increase of small colony (SC) mutants, we suggest that HBO causes mutations by induction of chromosomal alterations. Molecular characterization of induced SC mutants by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis showed an extensive loss of functional tk sequences similar to the pattern found in spontaneous SC mutants. This finding confirmed that the majority of HBO-induced mutants is actually produced by a clastogenic mechanism. The induction of point mutations as a consequence of induced oxidative DNA base damage seems to be of minor importance.","['Rothfuss, A', 'Merk, O', 'Radermacher, P', 'Speit, G']","['Rothfuss A', 'Merk O', 'Radermacher P', 'Speit G']","['Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Abteilung Humangenetik, D-89070 Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Comet Assay', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus/genetics', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA-Formamidopyrimidine Glycosylase', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis', 'Hyperbaric Oxygenation/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia L5178/enzymology/*genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/genetics', 'Oxygen/*toxicity', 'Point Mutation/*drug effects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics']",,2000/11/18 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/11/18 11:00'],"['2000/11/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/18 11:00 [entrez]']","['S1383571800001236 [pii]', '10.1016/s1383-5718(00)00123-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2000 Nov 20;471(1-2):87-94. doi: 10.1016/s1383-5718(00)00123-6.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Mutagens)', '5614-64-2 (8-hydroxyguanine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.23 (DNA-Formamidopyrimidine Glycosylase)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Of note, the activation of PI-3-kinase correlated with the modulation of the activation of another enzyme, the atypical protein kinase C zeta (aPKC zeta). In particular, the expression of PI-3-kinase was substantially unaffected by DMSO treatment while its phosphorylation and the production of PI3,4,5P3 was strongly increased within 24 h of DMSO. Such a result was paralleled by an evident phosphorylation of a PKC zeta. Treatment of the cells with the two unrelated PI-3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY 294002 impaired the recovery of the number of differentiated cells, therefore indicating that PI-3-kinase might be involved in the induction of erythroid differentiation, possibly engaging a protein kinase C zeta as downstream effector.","['Cataldi, A', 'Di Pietro, R', 'Centurione, L', 'Grilli, A', 'Cutroneo, G', 'Miscia, S']","['Cataldi A', 'Di Pietro R', 'Centurione L', 'Grilli A', 'Cutroneo G', 'Miscia S']","[""Istituto di Morfologia Umana Normale, Facolta di Medicina e Chirurgia, Universita' G.

Among the various integrin-centered signaling pathways discovered so far, we demonstrated that the modulation of the electrical potential of the plasma membrane (V(REST)) is an early integrin-mediated signal, which is related to neurite emission in neuroblastoma cells. This modulation is sustained by the activation of HERG K(+) channels, encoded by the ether-a-go-go-related gene (herg). The involvement of integrin-mediated signaling is being discovered in the hemopoietic system: in particular, osteoclasts are generated as well as induced to differentiate by interaction of osteoclast progenitors with the stromal cells, through the involvement of integrin receptors. We studied the effects of cell interaction with the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin (FN) in a human leukemic preosteoclastic cell line (FLG 29.1 cells), which has been demonstrated to express HERG currents. We report here that FLG 29.1 cells indeed adhere to purified FN through integrin receptors, and that this adhesion induces an osteoclast phenotype in these cells, as evidenced by the appearance of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, as well as by the increased expression of CD51/alpha(v)beta(3) integrin and calcitonin receptor. An early activation of HERG current (I(HERG)), without any increase in herg RNA or modifications of HERG protein was also observed in FN-adhering cells. This activation is apparently sustained by the beta(1) integrin subunit activation, through the involvement of a pertussis-toxin sensitive G(i) protein, and appears to be a determinant signal for the up-regulation of alpha(v)beta(3) integrin, as well as for the increased expression of calcitonin receptor.","['Hofmann, G', 'Bernabei, P A', 'Crociani, O', 'Cherubini, A', 'Guasti, L', 'Pillozzi, S', 'Lastraioli, E', 'Polvani, S', 'Bartolozzi, B', 'Solazzo, V', 'Gragnani, L', 'Defilippi, P', 'Rosati, B', 'Wanke, E', 'Olivotto, M', 'Arcangeli, A']","['Hofmann G', 'Bernabei PA', 'Crociani O', 'Cherubini A', 'Guasti L', 'Pillozzi S', 'Lastraioli E', 'Polvani S', 'Bartolozzi B', 'Solazzo V', 'Gragnani L', 'Defilippi P', 'Rosati B', 'Wanke E', 'Olivotto M', 'Arcangeli A']","['Department of Experimental Pathology and Oncology, University of Firenze, Viale G.

Both this membrane-specific oligonucleotide and an antisense oligonucleotide targeted to sequence common to both membrane and soluble isoforms were found to potently suppress cell surface IL-5Ralpha levels and IL-5-mediated cell survival by inducing apoptosis similar to IL-5 withdrawal.

During mobilization, differences were noted in the peak values of CD34+ cells in peripheral blood (PB) in these two groups (median 28 x 10(6)/L for 10 micrograms/kg/day vs. 61 x 10(6)/L for 20 micrograms/kg/day; p = 0.025). Similar numbers of progenitor cells were harvested for the two concentrations of G-CSF. However, similar CD34+ cell levels in the leukapheresis product were obtained after only the third dose of G-CSF at 20 micrograms/kg/day compared with the fourth dose of G-CSF at 10 micrograms/kg/day (1.7 and 1.2 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg/one patient's blood volume processed, respectively). Of note is the impact of diagnosis on PB CD34+ cell levels. We conclude that, in children, mobilization with G-CSF at 20 micrograms/kg/day could minimize the duration of priming but not reduce the number of leukaphereses. Thus, the impact on outcome, clinical practice, bed utilization, and health economics is uncertain.","['Halle, P', 'Kanold, J', 'Rapatel, C', 'Boiret, N', 'Berger, M', 'Stephan, J L', 'Albuisson, E', 'Tournilhac, O', 'Bonhomme, J', 'Demeocq, F']","['Halle P', 'Kanold J', 'Rapatel C', 'Boiret N', 'Berger M', 'Stephan JL', 'Albuisson E', 'Tournilhac O', 'Bonhomme J', 'Demeocq F']","['Unite Bioclinique de Prelevement et Traitement des Cellules Hematopoietiques, Hotel Dieu, C.H.U.

Although differentiation of murine erythroleukemia F5-5.fl cells is induced by activin, it is not induced by TGF-beta, suggesting that at some point TGF-beta signaling is defective. The aim of this study was to investigate the unresponsiveness of F5-5.fl cells to TGF-beta. DESIGN: mRNA expression of ligands, receptors, and signal mediators for the TGF-beta family was examined in F5-5.fl cells using RT-PCR. RESULTS: Activin induced erythrodifferentiation of F5-5.fl cells in a dose-dependent manner. Neither TGF-beta1 nor bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-4 affected the differentiation of F5-5.fl cells in the presence or absence of activin. Although mRNAs of TGF-betas (TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2 and TGF-beta3) were detected, those of inhibin/activin (alpha-, betaA- and betaB-subunits) and BMPs (BMP-2, BMP-4 and BMP-7) could not be detected in the cells, suggesting that neither activins nor BMPs are produced in F5-5.fl cells. The expression of both type I (ALK-4/ActRIB) and type II (ActRII) receptors for activin was detected in F5-5.fl cells. In contrast, while the expression of type I receptor for TGF-beta (ALK-5/TbetaRI) was detected, that of type II receptor (TbetaRII) was not. The mRNA of all Smads examined was detected in F5-5.fl cells. CONCLUSIONS: A defect in the type II receptor might cause unresponsiveness to TGF-beta in F5-5.fl cells. An erythrodifferentiation assay using F5-5.fl cells would be useful for measuring net activin activity because it would not be necessary to consider endogenous activins and BMPs.","['Machida, H', 'Ogawa, K', 'Funaba, M', 'Mizutani, T', 'Tsujimoto, M']","['Machida H', 'Ogawa K', 'Funaba M', 'Mizutani T', 'Tsujimoto M']","['Laboratory Animal Research Center, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 351-0198 Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Endocrinol,European journal of endocrinology,9423848,IM,"['Activin Receptors, Type I', 'Activin Receptors, Type II', 'Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/11/18 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/18 11:00'],"['2000/11/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/18 11:00 [entrez]']","['1430705 [pii]', '10.1530/eje.0.1430705 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Endocrinol. 2000 Nov;143(5):705-10. doi: 10.1530/eje.0.1430705.,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Activin Receptors, Type I)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Activin Receptors, Type II)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the study of MRD holds a significant potential to understand the biology of relapse and remission and to design new therapies to improve the cure rate of patients. A major goal of these studies is to be able and identify patients at a defined risk of relapse which can lead to risk-adapted therapy approaches. Laboratory assays such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and multicolor flow cytometry are sensitive enough to detect one leukemic cell in up to 104-105 normal cells and have become ideal tools to monitor MRD. Especially PCR has been used extensively.

Our results show that HMF should replace CC for routinely monitoring the remission status in Ph-positive CML patients and that in case of lack or insufficient number of metaphases in the majority of cases IPF is suitable for remission assessment.","['Duba, H C', 'Hilbe, W', 'Mehringer, A', 'Erdel, M', 'Thaler, J', 'Utermann, G']","['Duba HC', 'Hilbe W', 'Mehringer A', 'Erdel M', 'Thaler J', 'Utermann G']","['Institut fur Medizinische Biologie und Humangenetik der Universitat, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria. hans-christoph.duba@uibk.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Examination/*methods', 'Child', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Metaphase', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Remission Induction']",,2000/11/18 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/18 11:00'],"['2000/11/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/18 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.17.6.1245 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2000 Dec;17(6):1245-9. doi: 10.3892/ijo.17.6.1245.,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

TEL is a nuclear phosphoprotein that is widely expressed in all normal tissues. TEL contains a DNA-binding domain at the C terminus and a helix-loop-helix domain (also called a pointed domain) at the N terminus. The pointed domain is necessary for homotypic dimerization and for interaction with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9. Here we show that the interaction with UBC9 leads to modification of TEL by conjugating it to SUMO-1. The SUMO-1-modified TEL localizes to cell-cycle-specific nuclear speckles that we named TEL bodies. We also show that the leukemia-associated fusion protein TEL/AML1 is modified by SUMO-1 and found in the TEL bodies, in a pattern quite different from what we observe and report for AML1. Therefore, SUMO-1 modification of TEL could be a critical signal necessary for normal functioning of the protein. In addition, the modification by SUMO-1 of TEL/AML1 could lead to abnormal localization of the fusion protein, which could have consequences that include contribution to neoplastic transformation.","['Chakrabarti, S R', 'Sood, R', 'Nandi, S', 'Nucifora, G']","['Chakrabarti SR', 'Sood R', 'Nandi S', 'Nucifora G']","['Department of Medicine, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL 60153, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', '*Repressor Proteins', 'SUMO-1 Protein', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitins/*metabolism']",PMC27216,2000/11/15 11:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2000/11/15 11:00'],"['2000/11/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/15 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.240315897 [doi]', '240315897 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Nov 21;97(24):13281-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.240315897.,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ubiquitins)']",,,,"['R01 CA067189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA072675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA67189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA72675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

We determined the prognostic significance of cytogenetically identified breakpoints in 13q12-14 in children with newly diagnosed ALL treated on Children's Cancer Group protocols from 1988 to 1995. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Breakpoints in 13q12-14 were identified in 36 (2%) of the 1,946 cases with accepted cytogenetic data. Outcome analysis used standard life-table methods. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (47%) with an abnormal 13q12-14 were classified, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), as poor risk, and 15 patients (42%) were standard risk; four (11%) were infants less than 12 months of age. Eight cases had balanced rearrangements of 13q12-14, 27 patients had a partial loss of 13q, and one had both a partial gain and a partial loss. The most frequent additional abnormalities among these patients were an abnormal 12p, a del(6q), a del(9p), a 14q11 breakpoint, and an 11q23 breakpoint. Nineteen patients were pseudodiploid, 10 were hyperdiploid, and seven were hypodiploid. Patients with an abnormal 13q12-14 had significantly worse event-free survival than patients lacking such an abnormality, with estimates at 6 years of 61% (SD = 14%) and 74% (SD = 1%), respectively (P =.04; relative risk = 1.74). Overall survival, however, was similar for the two groups (P =.25). The prognostic effect of an abnormal 13q was attenuated in a multivariate analysis adjusted for NCI risk status and ploidy (P =.72). CONCLUSION: Aberrations of 13q12-14 may contribute to leukemogenesis of childhood ALL and confer increased risk of treatment failure but are associated with other poor-risk features.","['Heerema, N A', 'Sather, H N', 'Sensel, M G', 'Lee, M K', 'Hutchinson, R J', 'Nachman, J B', 'Reaman, G H', 'Lange, B J', 'Steinherz, P G', 'Bostrom, B C', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Uckun, F M']","['Heerema NA', 'Sather HN', 'Sensel MG', 'Lee MK', 'Hutchinson RJ', 'Nachman JB', 'Reaman GH', 'Lange BJ', 'Steinherz PG', 'Bostrom BC', 'Gaynon PS', 'Uckun FM']","['Department of Genetics, Parker Hughes Institute, St Paul, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Ploidies', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/11/15 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/15 11:00'],"['2000/11/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/15 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.22.3837 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 Nov 15;18(22):3837-44. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.22.3837.,,,,,"['CA-13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-60437/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Malignant GCTs in children aged 0 to 16 years were excised without major morbidity or otherwise biopsied. Stage I testicular and some ovarian GCTs were resected and monitored with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (""watch-and-wait"" approach). Patients with recurrent stage I disease and all other patients received JEB (etoposide 120 mg/m(2) on days 1 through 3, carboplatin 600 mg/m(2) on day 2, and bleomycin 15 mg/m(2) on day 3). Courses were administered every 3 to 4 weeks until remission, and then two more courses were given. Chemotherapy toxicities were assessed using World Health Organization or Brock grading. RESULTS: Between January 1989 and December 1997, 192 patients were registered. Eight were excluded because either there was no histologic diagnosis (n = 3) or chemotherapy was given off-study (n = 5). The remaining 184 patients had germinoma (n = 20), malignant teratoma (n = 55), embryonal carcinoma (n = 1), yolk sac tumor (n = 107), or choriocarcinoma (n = 1). Forty-seven patients were treated with surgery alone, and 137 patients received JEB. The 5-year survival rate in March 1999 for all 184 patients was 93.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 87.9% to 96.3%); for the 137 JEB-treated patients, it was 90.9% (95% CI, 83.9% to 95.0%), with an event-free survival rate of 87.8% (95% CI, 81.1% to 92.4%). The median follow-up after JEB treatment was 53 months (range, 0 to 109 months); the median number of courses was five (range, three to eight). Site, stage, and AFP level had prognostic significance. Nonfatal hematologic toxicity was common, but deafness and pulmonary and renal toxicities were rare. One child died of a thoracic tumor and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and another died of acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSION: Conservative surgery, a watch-and-wait approach after complete excision, and JEB for those requiring chemotherapy produced high cure rates and few serious complications.","['Mann, J R', 'Raafat, F', 'Robinson, K', 'Imeson, J', 'Gornall, P', 'Sokal, M', 'Gray, E', 'McKeever, P', 'Hale, J', 'Bailey, S', 'Oakhill, A']","['Mann JR', 'Raafat F', 'Robinson K', 'Imeson J', 'Gornall P', 'Sokal M', 'Gray E', 'McKeever P', 'Hale J', 'Bailey S', 'Oakhill A']","[""Oncology Department, Birmingham Children's Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom. jill.mann@bhamchildrens.wmids.nhs.uk""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/blood', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Germinoma/*drug therapy/pathology/surgery', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/surgery', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/surgery', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/metabolism']",,2000/11/15 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/15 11:00'],"['2000/11/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/15 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.22.3809 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 Nov 15;18(22):3809-18. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.22.3809.,"['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'JEB protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumor biopsies from 185 consecutive and homogeneously treated patients with stage III ovarian cancer were examined immunohistochemically for the expression of Bax, Bcl-X(L) and Mcl-1 proteins. Their prognostic relevance was examined in a uni- and multivariate survival analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-six percent of cancer cases expressed Bax, 62% Bcl-X(L), and 53% Mcl-1. The expression of Bax correlated with tumor differentiation (P: =.016) and less residual disease after surgery (P <.0001). In univariate analysis, Bax expression was associated with improved (P =.0004) prognosis and Mcl-1 expression with poorer (P =.011) prognosis. None of the factors studied was of independent prognostic significance by itself, but when Bax and Bcl-2 expression data were considered together, this combined variable was of independent prognostic significance (P =.0115), together with residual disease status (P =.0016), differentiation grade (P =.0014), and the presence of ascites (P =.0122). Patients with a long median survival (104 months) could be discriminated from those with a short one (16 months) by combining the individual patients' expression data for p53, Bax, and Bcl-2 with their residual disease status (P <.00001). None of the factors studied was able to predict response to chemotherapy.

This review will focus on the mechanisms involved in the three main human viral infections causing immunosuppression: measles, human immunodeficiency virus and cytomegalovirus. We will also discuss what has been learned from the extensively studied mouse models of viral-induced immunosuppression: lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and Rauscher leukemia virus.

Multiple drug resistance (MDR) had no effect on the susceptibility of human lymphoma cells to 3-BAABE, since Daudi/MDR(20) and wild-type Daudi cells had a similar susceptibility to the cytotoxic effect of 3-BAABE. The cancericidal effect of 3-BAABE, which was not associated with changes in the cell cycle, was mediated by apoptosis. Thus, cells exposed to 3-BAABE displayed the DNA fragmentation ladder characteristic for apoptosis, associated with a marked increase of the activity of apoptosis effector caspases-3 and -6, which was followed by proteolytic cleavage of DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Exposure of tumor cells to 3-BAABE increased the activity of apical caspase-9, but had no effect on caspase-8. Complete inhibition of 3-BAABE-induced apoptosis was exerted by LEHD-FMK, a caspase-9 inhibitor. DEVD-FMK, a caspase-3 inhibitor, and VEID-FMK, a caspase-6 inhibitor, partially inhibited 3-BAABE-induced apoptosis, whereas exposure to IETD-FMK, a caspase-8 inhibitor, had no effect. The fragmentation and elevated activity of caspase-9 in 3-BAABE-treated cells and the fact that only an inhibitor of caspase-9 abrogated 3-BAABE-induced apoptosis indicate that 3-BAABE is a distinctive compound that elicits apoptosis through a pathway that is limited specifically to activation of apical caspase-9.","['Schlesinger, M', 'Jiang, J D', 'Roboz, J P', 'Denner, L', 'Ling, Y H', 'Holland, J F', 'Bekesi, J G']","['Schlesinger M', 'Jiang JD', 'Roboz JP', 'Denner L', 'Ling YH', 'Holland JF', 'Bekesi JG']","['T.J.

Three distinct components of mistletoe, including beta-galactoside- and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-specific lectin II (60 kDa), polysaccharides, and viscotoxin (5 kDa), induced apoptotic cell death, characterized by DNA ladder pattern fragmentation of U937 cells at 12 hr after treatment. Consistent with apoptosis of the cells, mistletoe extracts markedly increased the phosphotransferase activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) in U937 cells. Among the three components, lectin II was the most potent in inducing apoptosis as well as JNK1 activation of U937 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Catalytic activation of JNK1 induced by mistletoe lectin II was inhibited by the addition of peptide aC-DEVD-CHO, but not by aC-YVAD-CHO.

ATP degraded to ADP, AMP, and adenosine, and the effect of ATP on cell growth was mimicked by these metabolites added to the cultures. The stable analog alpha,beta-methylene ATP, however, had only a weak inhibitory effect on cell growth. Adenine nucleotide-induced growth suppression was reversed by uridine, suggesting the involvement of intracellular pyrimidine starvation secondary to adenosine accumulation. Consistent with this, ATP induced intracellular starvation of pyrimidine nucleotides, and this effect was also prevented by pretreatment of cells with uridine. The order of effectiveness of ATP-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells, unlike that for growth suppression, was ATP > ADP > AMP, and adenosine had no effect. Furthermore, uridine had no effect and the stable analog, alpha,beta-methylene ATP also induced HL-60 cell differentiation, suggesting that differentiation was due to ATP per se. We tested the hypothesis that ATP-induced differentiation arises from activation of adenylyl cyclase by the novel P2Y(11) receptor using the cell-permeable inhibitor of protein kinase A, Rp-CPT-cAMPS (8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Rp isomer). Rp-CPT-cAMPS (1-100 microM) prevented ATP-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells as assessed by fMLP-induced beta-glucuronidase release. However, Rp-CPT-cAMPS did not prevent ATP-induced growth suppression. Taken together, the data indicate that extracellular ATP suppresses HL-60 growth and induces their differentiation by distinct mechanisms. Growth suppression arises from adenosine generation and consequent pyrimidine starvation. Differentiation arises, at least in part, from a distinct mechanism involving the activation of cell surface P2 receptors coupled to cAMP generation and activation of protein kinase A.","['Conigrave, A D', 'van der Weyden, L', 'Holt, L', 'Jiang, L', 'Wilson, P', 'Christopherson, R I', 'Morris, M B']","['Conigrave AD', 'van der Weyden L', 'Holt L', 'Jiang L', 'Wilson P', 'Christopherson RI', 'Morris MB']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia. a.conigrave@biochem.usyd.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Adenosine/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/metabolism', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology', 'Uridine/pharmacology']",,2000/11/15 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/15 11:00'],"['2000/11/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/15 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(00)00465-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00465-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2000 Dec 1;60(11):1585-91. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00465-2.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (P2RY11 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', ""41941-66-6 (8-((4-chlorophenyl)thio)cyclic-3',5'-AMP)"", '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', ""NYX13NT29D (alpha,beta-methyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate)"", 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore the mechanism of HN2-induced apoptosis, we utilized ebselen, a selenoorganic compound with potent antioxidant activity. We examined whether ebselen would inhibit apoptosis in BALB/c mouse spleen lymphocytes and human MOLT-4 leukemia cells treated with HN2 (2.5 microM) in vitro. Non-toxic concentrations (<50 microM) of ebselen were found to prevent HN2-induced apoptosis of murine lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner, as measured by cell viability, hypodiploid DNA formation, and phosphatidylserine externalization. However, ebselen was ineffective at preventing spontaneous apoptosis in these cells, pointing to the selectivity of its action. Furthermore, pretreatment with ebselen at 1-10 microM for 72 hr protected MOLT-4 cells from HN2-induced apoptosis and maintained cell viability and proliferation as monitored by the above-mentioned parameters. This was accompanied by the preservation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and elevated glutathione levels and by a blockage of caspase-3 and -9 activation. In vivo, ebselen also had a marked protective effect against spleen weight loss associated with lymphocyte apoptosis in mice treated by HN2. Therefore, ebselen provides an efficient protection against HN2-induced cell death in normal and tumoral lymphocytes and might prove useful as an antidote against alkylating agents.","['Holl, V', 'Coelho, D', 'Silbernagel, L', 'Keyser, J F', 'Waltzinger, C', 'Dufour, P', 'Bischoff, P L']","['Holl V', 'Coelho D', 'Silbernagel L', 'Keyser JF', 'Waltzinger C', 'Dufour P', 'Bischoff PL']","[""Laboratoire de Cancerologie Experimentale et de Radiobiologie (LCER), Institut de Recherche Contre les Cancers de l'Appareil Digestif (IRCAD), Hopitaux Universitaires, 67091, Strasbourg, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Azoles/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Isoindoles', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Mechlorethamine/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Organoselenium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Spleen/cytology/drug effects']",,2000/11/15 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/15 11:00'],"['2000/11/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/15 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(00)00480-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00480-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2000 Dec 1;60(11):1565-77. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00480-9.,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Azoles)', '0 (Isoindoles)', '0 (Organoselenium Compounds)', '40X2P7DPGH (ebselen)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This study, aimed to define its anticancer efficacy against a series of murine and human tumour models, has provided evidence of major antitumour activity for F 11782. This was demonstrated as a high level of activity against the P388 leukaemia, as reflected by increased survival of 143-457%, when administered i.p., p.o. or i.v. as single or multiple doses, and proved consistently superior to etoposide or camptothecin tested concurrently. Single or multiple i.p. doses of F 11782 also proved highly active against the s.c. grafted B16 melanoma, significantly increasing survival (P < 0.001) and inhibiting tumour growth (T/C of 0.3%), again superior to etoposide tested concurrently. Furthermore, F 11782 inhibited the number of pulmonary metastatic foci of the B16F10 melanoma by 99%. In human tumour xenograft studies, multiple i.p. doses of F 11782 resulted in major inhibitory activity against MX-1 (breast) tumours (T/C of 0.1%), as well as causing definite tumour regressions, whereas none resulted from similar experimental treatments with etoposide. Significant activity was also recorded with F 11782 against the relatively refractory LX-1 (lung) xenografts, with an optimal T/C value of 19%. It was notable that the antitumour activity of F 11782 was consistently demonstrated over a wide range of 2-6 dose levels, providing evidence of its good overall tolerance.

IMPDH activity results from expression of two isoforms. Type I is constitutively expressed and predominates in normal resting cells, while Type II is selectively up-regulated in neoplastic and replicating cells. Inhibitors of IMPDH activity selectively targeting the Type II isoform have great potential as cancer chemotherapeutic agents. For this study, an expression system was developed which yields 35-50 mg of soluble, purified recombinant Type I and II protein from 1 L of bacteria. In addition, three 1,5-diazabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,4-diones were synthesized and shown to act as specific inhibitors of human recombinant Type II IMPDH. The agents are competitive inhibitors with respect to the endogenous substrate IMP and K(i) values range from 5 to 44 microM but were inactive as inhibitors of the Type I isoform at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 500 microM. IC(50) values for recombinant Type II inhibition were determined and compared to IC(50) values obtained from Molt-4 cell extracts of IMPDH. Cytotoxicity assays revealed that the compounds inhibited Molt-4 leukemia growth with ED(50) values of 3.2-7.6 microM. Computational docking studies predict that the compounds bind to IMPDH in the IMP-binding site, although interactions with residues differ from those previously determined to interact with bound IMP. While all residues predicted to interact directly with the bound compounds are conserved in the Type I and Type II isoforms, sequence divergence within a helix adjacent to the active site may contribute to the observed selectivity for the human Type II isoform. These compounds represent the first class of selective IMPDH Type II inhibitors which may serve as lead compounds for the development of isoform-selective cancer chemotherapy.","['Barnes, B J', 'Eakin, A E', 'Izydore, R A', 'Hall, I H']","['Barnes BJ', 'Eakin AE', 'Izydore RA', 'Hall IH']","['Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Natural Products, School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-7360, USA. barnebe@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds/chemical synthesis/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology/genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Guanosine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Isoenzymes/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Pyrazoles/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Recombinant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/11/15 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/15 11:00'],"['2000/11/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/15 11:00 [entrez]']","['bi0004044 [pii]', '10.1021/bi0004044 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 2000 Nov 14;39(45):13641-50. doi: 10.1021/bi0004044.,"['0 (1,5-diazabicyclo(3.1.0)hexane-2,4-dione)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)']",,,,['AI45021/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

The first parameter was obtained by calculating the bcr-abl rearrangement positive cells as determined by fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH). The other value was determined by a quantitative (competitive) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR). To avoid any inaccuracy associated with the variable yield of RNA isolation and reverse transcription, respectively, the amount of chimera mRNA was related to that of abl 2-3 transcript as internal control. The threshold for the sensitivity of the Q-RT-PCR procedure was 16 bcr-abl mRNA molecule/microgram RNA. The lowest relative concentration was represented by detecting 1 bcr-abl mRNA molecule out of 12,600 abl 2-3 transcripts. The analysis of peripheral blood samples of 33 untreated patients indicated that the amount of chimera mRNA changes between 80 and 1,000,000 molecules per microgram RNA and this parameter correlated hardly (r = -44) with the tumour load. Data from blood samples of 48 treated patients indicated that this four order of magnitude difference in the expression persists in that patient population which exhibited on average major cytogenetic and also in those without any cytogenetic response. In the individual patients not only correlated changes of residual tumour mass and chimera expression, but mainly independent changes of these two parameters were observed.","['Vass, J', 'Kereskai, L', 'Pajor, L']","['Vass J', 'Kereskai L', 'Pajor L']","['Pecsi Tudomanyegyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar, Pathologiai Intezet.']",['hun'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Hungary,Orv Hetil,Orvosi hetilap,0376412,IM,"['Chimera', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2000/11/15 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/15 11:00'],"['2000/11/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/15 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Orv Hetil. 2000 Oct 15;141(42):2279-85.,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,Kronikus myeloid leukaemia komplex molekularis monitorizalasa.,,,,,,,,,,

We collected 25 cases of B-LBL, occurring in children and adults, and report the clinical and histologic features. Patients with concurrent precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or a history thereof were excluded. There was no evidence of bone marrow disease at the time of diagnosis in 23 patients; two patients had focal (<5%) involvement. Immunophenotypic analysis was performed in all cases using flow cytometry or immunohistochemical methods. The treatment and survival data available for a subset of patients with B-LBL were compared with those from a series of patients with B-ALL at our institution. The median age was 20 years (range, 5-68 yrs); 22 (88%) patients were younger than 35 years of age. There were 17 males and 8 females. The primary sites of disease were skin (nine cases), bones (five cases), soft tissue (four cases), lymph nodes, (three cases), breast (two cases), stomach and colon (one case), and mediastinum (one case). Clinical stage was stage I in 13 cases, stage II in seven cases, stage III in three cases, and stage IV in two cases. Histologically, each neoplasm was diffuse and composed of small to medium-sized lymphoid cells with blastic nuclear chromatin and a high mitotic rate. All cases were positive for B-cell antigens and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Thirteen (76.4%) of 17 cases analyzed were positive for CD10 and 13 (54.1%) of 24 cases assessed were positive for CD20. Of 14 patients with available survival data, all achieved complete clinical response after combination chemotherapy (13 patients) or surgical excision followed by local irradiation (one patient). Five (35.7%) patients subsequently relapsed, including the patient who had received only irradiation, and four of these patients died after a median survival time of 60 months. None of the patients had leukemia, although one patient developed extensive bone marrow involvement. Nine patients remained in complete remission and were alive at the last follow up (range, 6-144 months). Unlike precursor T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, which commonly involves lymph nodes and the mediastinum, B-LBL usually involves extranodal sites, most often the skin, and rarely presents as a mediastinal mass. With aggressive chemotherapy, patients with precursor B-LBL rarely develop leukemia and appear to have a better prognosis than do patients with B-ALL.","['Lin, P', 'Jones, D', 'Dorfman, D M', 'Medeiros, L J']","['Lin P', 'Jones D', 'Dorfman DM', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/chemistry/genetics/*pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precancerous Conditions/chemistry/genetics/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/chemistry/genetics/*pathology']",,2000/11/15 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/15 11:00'],"['2000/11/15 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/15 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000478-200011000-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2000 Nov;24(11):1480-90. doi: 10.1097/00000478-200011000-00003.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the last few years, identification of tumor-associated antigens (TAA) has prompted the development of different strategies for antitumor vaccination, aimed at inducing specific recognition of TAA in order to elicit a persistent immune memory that may eliminate residual tumor cells and protect recipients from relapses. In this review characterization of TAA, different potential means of vaccination in experimental models and preliminary data from clinical trials in humans have been examined by the Working Group on Hematopoietic Cells. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCES: The method employed for preparing this review was that of informal consensus development. Members of the Working Group met four times and discussed the single points, previously assigned by the chairman, in order to achieve an agreement on different opinions and approve the final manuscript. Some of the authors of the present review have been working in the field of antitumor immunotherapy and have contributed original papers to peer-reviewed journals. In addition, the material examined in the present review includes articles and abstracts published in journals covered by the Science Citation Index and Medline. STATE OF THE ART: The cellular basis of antitumor immune memory consists in the generation and extended persistence of expanded populations of T- and B-lymphocytes that specifically recognize and react against TAA. The efficacy of the memory can be modulated by compounds, called ""adjuvants"", such as certain bacterial products and mineral oils, cytokines, chemokines, by monoclonal antibodies triggering co-stimulatory receptors. Strategies that have been shown in preclinical models to be efficient in protecting from tumor engraftment, or in preventing a tumor rechallenge, include vaccination by means of soluble proteins or peptides, recombinant viruses or bacteria as TAA genes vectors, DNA injection, tumor cells genetically modified to express co-stimulatory molecules and/or cytokines. The use of professional antigen-presenting cells, namely dendritic cells, either pulsed with TAA or transduced with tumor-specific genes, provides a useful alternative for inducing antitumor cytotoxic activity. Some of these approaches have been tested in phase I/II clinical trials in hematologic malignancies, such as lymphoproliferative diseases or chronic myeloid leukemia, and in solid tumors, such as melanoma, colon cancer, prostate cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Different types of vaccines, use of adjuvants, timing of vaccination as well as selection of patients eligible for this procedure are discussed in this review. PERSPECTIVES: Experimental models demonstrate the possibility of curing cancer through the active induction of a specific immune response to TAA. However, while pre-clinical research has identified several possible targets and strategies for tumor vaccination the clinical scenario is far more complex for a number of possible reasons. Since experimental data suggest that vaccination is more likely to be effective on small tumor burden, such as a minimal residual disease after conventional treatments, or tumors at an early stage of disease, better selection of patients will allow more reliable clinical results to be obtained. Moreover, a poor correlation is frequently observed between the ability of TAA to induce a T-cell response in vitro and clinical responses. Controversial findings may also be due to the techniques used for monitoring the immune status. Therefore, the development of reliable assays for efficient monitoring of the state of immunization of cancer patients against TAA is an important goal that will markedly improve the progress of antitumor vaccines.

Seventy-one such cases diagnosed by FNA form the basis of this study. Seventy-one cases of FNAs performed between 1988 and 1998 on extranodal and extramedullary hematopoietic malignancies were reviewed in order to evaluate the usefulness of this technique in diagnosing these entities as well as to assess patterns of relapse. There were 45 male and 26 female patients ranging in age from 29-86 years (mean, 68 years). Sixty-six patients had a previous history of a hematopoietic malignancy. Aspirates from 65 of these patients were consistent with the patient's known primary. One aspirate of a paravertebral mass from a multiple myeloma patient showed extramedullary hematopoiesis. The remaining five aspirates were cases of multiple myeloma that first presented as soft tissue masses. The most common malignancies were lymphoma: 52 cases (73%), 48 large cell lymphomas, four mixed small and large cell lymphoma; followed by multiple myeloma: 12 cases (17%); leukemia: four cases (5.4%); Hodgkin disease: two cases (2.8%); and one case of extramedullary hematopoiesis. The aspirate sites were soft tissue: 23 cases (32%); bone: 17 cases (24%); kidney: 14 cases (20%); liver: 11 cases (15%); lung: three cases (4%); adrenal: two cases (3%); and eye: one case. The interval between primary diagnosis and FNA was 1-36 months (mean, 13 months). In conclusion, 98% of the aspirates were neoplastic in patients with a known history of hematopoietic malignancies. The most common site of involvement was soft tissue in 23 (32%) cases. In five patients with multiple myeloma, the FNA diagnosis prompted a work-up to find the primary site of involvement. FNA is a useful technique in assessing extranodal and extramedullary hematopoietic malignancies.","['Orucevic, A', 'Reddy, V B', 'Selvaggi, S M', 'Green, L', 'Spitz, D J', 'Gattuso, P']","['Orucevic A', 'Reddy VB', 'Selvaggi SM', 'Green L', 'Spitz DJ', 'Gattuso P']","[""Department of Pathology, Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois 60612, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Diagn Cytopathol,Diagnostic cytopathology,8506895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Biopsy, Needle', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis', 'Hematopoiesis, Extramedullary', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis']",,2000/11/14 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/14 11:00'],"['2000/11/14 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/14 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0339(200011)23:5<318::AID-DC6>3.0.CO;2-8 [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0339(200011)23:5<318::aid-dc6>3.0.co;2-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Diagn Cytopathol. 2000 Nov;23(5):318-21. doi: 10.1002/1097-0339(200011)23:5<318::aid-dc6>3.0.co;2-8.,,,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

In HIV infected persons, an exogenous retrovirus adds further complexity to the situation. Therefore, 14 synthetic peptides with sequences derived from conserved regions of various endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and from related exogenous retroviruses were used to search for IgG and IgM antibodies that bind to such antigens in 15 HIV-1 seropositive and 17 seronegative immunosuppressed patients. IgG binding to three peptides, namely, the C-terminal half of murine leukemia virus (MLV) capsid protein, the conserved portion of HERV-H transmembrane protein, and the Pol region of human mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-like (HML3) sequence, was observed in both groups. Binding was, however, more frequent and more firm in HIV-1 positive samples (P<0.0001, Wilcoxon rank sum test). IgM binding to the same peptides showed no significant differentiation between the two groups of patients. Binding to both immunoglobulin isotypes was sometimes variable over time in both groups. No correlation of either IgG or IgM peptide binding with progression to AIDS in HIV-1 infected individuals was observed. Inhibition studies using analogous endogenous and exogenous retroviral peptides, including HIV-1, demonstrated specificity of the IgG antibodies for a narrow range of MLV- and MMTV-like retroviral antigens, and excluded cross-reactivity of antibodies to HIV-1 as a cause of these observations. Thus, unlike IgG, IgM binding to retroviral antigens was ubiquitous. It is suggested that anti-HERV IgM belong to a class of natural antibodies and might serve as primers in the mediation of humoral immune responses to more or less related exogenous retroviruses. Increased IgG binding in HIV-1 infected individuals could result from such priming, or reflect higher HERV antigen expression.","['Lawoko, A', 'Johansson, B', 'Rabinayaran, D', 'Pipkorn, R', 'Blomberg, J']","['Lawoko A', 'Johansson B', 'Rabinayaran D', 'Pipkorn R', 'Blomberg J']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Section of Virology, Uppsala Academic Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden. alex.lawoko@telia.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*immunology', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*immunology', 'HIV Infections/blood/*immunology', 'HIV-1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/*immunology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Retroviridae/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*immunology']",,2000/11/14 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/14 11:00'],"['2000/11/14 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/14 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1096-9071(200012)62:4<435::AID-JMV7>3.0.CO;2-R [pii]', '10.1002/1096-9071(200012)62:4<435::aid-jmv7>3.0.co;2-r [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Virol. 2000 Dec;62(4):435-44. doi: 10.1002/1096-9071(200012)62:4<435::aid-jmv7>3.0.co;2-r.,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

From screens using two different cell types as targets for cellular transformation, a single cDNA encoding a variant of the TrkA protooncogene was isolated. The protein product of this protooncogene, TrkA, is a receptor tyrosine kinase for nerve growth factor. The isolated transforming cDNA encoded a TrkA protein that contains a 75-amino-acid deletion in the extracellular domain of the receptor and was named DeltaTrkA. DeltaTrkA readily transformed fibroblast and epithelial cell lines. The deletion resulted in activation of the tyrosine kinase domain leading to constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein. Expression of DeltaTrkA in cells led to the constitutive activation of intracellular signaling pathways that include Ras, extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Akt. Importantly, DeltaTrkA altered the apoptotic and growth properties of 32D myeloid progenitor cells, suggesting DeltaTrkA may have contributed to the development and/or maintenance of the myeloid leukemia from which it was isolated. Unlike Bcr-Abl, expression of DeltaTrkA did not activate Stat5 in these cells. We have detected expression of DeltaTrkA in the original AML sample by reverse transcriptase PCR and by Western blot analysis. While previous TrkA mutations identified from human tumors involved fusion to other proteins, this report is the initial demonstration that deletions within TrkA may play a role in human cancers. Finally, this report is the first to indicate mutations in TrkA may contribute to leukemogenesis.","['Reuther, G W', 'Lambert, Q T', 'Caligiuri, M A', 'Der, C J']","['Reuther GW', 'Lambert QT', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Der CJ']","['Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-7295, USA. greuther@med.unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Rats', 'Receptor, trkA/*genetics', 'Sequence Deletion']",PMC86471,2000/11/14 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/14 11:00'],"['2000/11/14 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/14 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.20.23.8655-8666.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2000 Dec;20(23):8655-66. doi: 10.1128/MCB.20.23.8655-8666.2000.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkA)']",,,,"['R01 CA042978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63071/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063071/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate whether LIF activates Ca(2+)-dependent signaling molecules, such as calcineurin and calmodulin kinases II and IV (CaMKII and CaMKIV), and, if so, whether these Ca(2+)-mediated signaling events contribute to LIF-mediated cardiac hypertrophy. We first confirmed that LIF increased I(Ca,L) and [Ca(2+)](i) in primary cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Calcineurin, CaMKII, and CaMKIV activities increased at 2 minutes and peaked by 1.6-, 2.2-, and 2.2-fold, respectively, at 15 minutes. Nicardipine or verapamil fully inhibited these activities. Autophosphorylation of CaMKII was also observed to parallel the timing of CaMKII activity, and this phosphorylation was blocked by nicardipine, verapamil, or EGTA. LIF treatment led to a 3-fold increase in nuclear factor of activated T cell-luciferase activity. To confirm that inositol triphosphate (IP(3))-induced Ca(2+) release from sarcoplasmic reticulum was not involved in this process, IP(3) content and phosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma were investigated. LIF did not increase IP(3) content or phosphorylate phospholipase Cgamma. KN62 (an inhibitor of CaMKII and CaMKIV) attenuated c-fos, brain natriuretic peptide, alpha-skeletal actin, and atrial natriuretic peptide expression. KN62 suppressed the LIF-induced increase in [(3)H]phenylalanine uptake and cell size. Cyclosporin A and FK506 slightly attenuated brain natriuretic peptide but did not affect c-fos or atrial natriuretic peptide expression. Cyclosporin A significantly reduced the LIF-induced increase in [(3)H]phenylalanine uptake. These findings indicated that LIF activated CaMKII, CaMKIV, and calcineurin through an increase in I:(Ca,L) and [Ca(2+)](i) and that CaMKII, CaMKIV, and calcineurin are critically involved in LIF-induced cardiac hypertrophy.","['Kato, T', 'Sano, M', 'Miyoshi, S', 'Sato, T', 'Hakuno, D', 'Ishida, H', 'Kinoshita-Nakazawa, H', 'Fukuda, K', 'Ogawa, S']","['Kato T', 'Sano M', 'Miyoshi S', 'Sato T', 'Hakuno D', 'Ishida H', 'Kinoshita-Nakazawa H', 'Fukuda K', 'Ogawa S']","['Cardiopulmonary Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,IM,"['Aniline Compounds', 'Animals', 'Calcineurin/*metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calcium Channels, L-Type/drug effects/metabolism', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 4', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cardiomegaly/chemically induced/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Lymphokines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Myocardium/cytology/metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum/drug effects/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Xanthenes']",,2000/11/14 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/14 11:00'],"['2000/11/14 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/14 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/01.res.87.10.937 [doi]'],ppublish,Circ Res. 2000 Nov 10;87(10):937-45. doi: 10.1161/01.res.87.10.937.,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Calcium Channels, L-Type)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fluo 4)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Xanthenes)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Camk4 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Corneal endothelial cells (CEC) were transfected with an expression vector coding for green fluorescent protein (GFP) and 18 kDa FGF-2. Expression of the fusion protein was determined by immunoblot analysis and the subcellular localization of the fusion protein was examined by immunocytochemical analysis. RESULTS: When the expression of the fusion protein was determined by immunoblot analysis, the expressed fusion protein had a molecular weight of 45 kDa, resulting from the 27 kDa GFP and 18 kDa FGF-2. Following a 90 min exposure of cells to the vector, the expressed 18 kDa FGF-2 was completely translocated to the nucleus within a 24 h incubation. When cells were further incubated for another 24 h, one-half of the fusion protein was retro-transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, largely to the membrane and focal adhesion site, while the other half remained in the nucleus. During a 72 h incubation, the fusion protein was completely translocated to the cytoplasm, where it was diffusely distributed and its staining potential was greatly lost. Transfected cells showed both a slight increase in cell proliferation and a down-regulation in the expression of the high affinity receptors of FGF. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the 18 kDa FGF-2 is directly translocated from its synthetic site to the nucleus. The nuclear 18 kDa FGF-2 is then retro-transported to membrane/focal adhesion sites, after which the molecule may be secreted. When 18 kDa FGF-2 remains in the nucleus, there is a slight stimulatory activity of cell proliferation and a down-regulation of its receptor. These data suggest an intracellular action of 18 kDa FGF-2 through mechanisms independent of the receptor-mediated signaling pathways.","['Choi, J', 'Ko, M K', 'Kay, E P']","['Choi J', 'Ko MK', 'Kay EP']","['Doheny Eye Institute, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Vis,Molecular vision,9605351,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Endothelium, Corneal/*metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Expression', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Molecular Weight', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Transfection']",,2000/11/10 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/10 11:00'],"['2000/11/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/10 11:00 [entrez]']",['v6/a30 [pii]'],epublish,Mol Vis. 2000 Nov 6;6:222-31.,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,,,"['EY03040/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY06431/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,20001106,,,,,

Leukemic cell apoptosis induced by the proteasome inhibitors was dependent on activation of caspase-3 and related caspase family proteases, because caspase-3 inhibitor N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamyl-L-valyl-L-aspartal (Ac-DEVD-cho) and, more effectively, the general caspase-inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-valyl-L-alanyl-L-aspartate fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk) were capable of blocking apoptosis induced by lactacystin, ZLLLal or NLVS. Induction of apoptosis by lactacystin or ZLLLal was accompanied by cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and by accumulation and stabilization of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/Cip and tumor suppressor protein p53. A role of p53 in mediating apoptosis or induction of p21WAF1/Cip1 was ruled out since CCRF-CEM and U937 cells express non-functional mutant p53, and K562 cells lack expression of p53. Viability and hematopoietic outgrowth of human CD34+ progenitor cells treated with lactacystin were slightly reduced, whereas treatment of CD34 + cells with ZLLLal or the cytostatic drugs doxorubicin and gemcitabine resulted in markedly reduced viability and hematopoietic outgrowth. These results demonstrate a basic role of the proteasome in maintaining survival of human leukemic cells, and may define cell-permeable proteasome inhibitors as potently anti-leukemic agents which exhibit a moderate hematopoietic toxicity in vitro.","['Naujokat, C', 'Sezer, O', 'Zinke, H', 'Leclere, A', 'Hauptmann, S', 'Possinger, K']","['Naujokat C', 'Sezer O', 'Zinke H', 'Leclere A', 'Hauptmann S', 'Possinger K']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik mit Schwerpunkt Onkologie und Hamatologie, Universitats-Klinikum Charite, Medizinische Fakultat der Humboldt-Universitat Berlin, Germany. cord.naujokat@urz.uni-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/enzymology/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Mitosis/drug effects', '*Multienzyme Complexes/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",,2000/11/10 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/10 11:00'],"['2000/11/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/10 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1600-0609.2000.065004221.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2000 Oct;65(4):221-36. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2000.065004221.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

It could even bind to a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, when they were differentiated into monocytic cells. On Western blotting, this mAb mainly recognized an approximately 30-kDa band and it was unique because there have been no reports of membrane-associated proteins with a similar molecular mass found in macrophages.

Clonal hematopoiesis was found in all the cases with AML and in 6 of the 9 cases with MDS, but not in the cases with both PRCA and healthy carriers infected with FeLV. In the 2 cases with MDS, it was thought that the same clones of the hematopoietic cells might proliferate before and after the progression of the disease irrespective of the changes of the hematological diagnoses by cytological examination.

This compound showed broad-spectrum anti-proliferative activity against a panel of 14 human cancer cell lines (IC(50) = 0.01-1.6 microM). P-glycoprotein-mediated, multidrug-resistant cells showed cross-resistance to YTA0040 cells, whereas cisplatin-resistant non-small-cell lung-cancer (NSCLC) sublines showed a collateral sensitivity to YTA0040. In transplantable murine tumor models, YTA0040 displayed a broad spectrum and high degree of anti-tumor activity when administered i.p. or p.o. (life span T/C = 135-234%). In P388 murine leukemia cells, YTA0040 caused dose- and time-dependent suppression of nucleic acid and protein synthesis, with protein synthesis being more potently and rapidly inhibited than nucleic acid synthesis. Flow-cytometric analysis revealed that YTA0040 blocked the entry of human NSCLC-derived A549 cells into S phase, leading to arrest in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle. Western blot analysis demonstrated that YTA0040 caused a dose-dependent decrease in the levels of expression of hyperphosphorylated pRb and cyclin A in A549 cells. The level of p53 protein expression was decreased by YTA0040 treatment. A higher concentration of YTA0040 down-regulated the levels of expression of CDK2, CDK4, cyclin D1 and cyclin E.

BCMSUN (previously Leu2, t4, cDNA 1B4) is one of 3 proposed candidate genes isolated from the minimally deleted region. We identified a homolog of BCMSUN, termed BCMSUNL (for BCMSUN-like). Radiation-hybrid mapping with a PCR-amplified fragment and fluorescence in situ hybridization with 2 PAC clones containing coding information for BCMSUNL revealed its localization at 1p22-p31. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization, however, revealed that the BCMSUNL gene locus is not part of the critical deletion region of 1p22 in MCLs. Analysis of DNA sequences derived from the respective PAC clones and available in public databases uncovered an intronless structure of BCMSUNL. Compared to BCMSUN, the new gene lacks exon 2 and shows 90.3% homology on the nucleic acid level. Both genes are expressed in peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy donors as well as B-CLL and MCL tumors, with retention of genetic material at 13q14.3. Therefore, analysis of the candidate tumor-suppressor gene BCMSUN at 13q14.3 must be based on assays that distinguish between the 2 homologous genes.","['Mertens, D', 'Wolf, S', 'Bullinger, L', 'Ohl, S', 'Schaffner, C', 'Dohner, H', 'Stilgenbauer, S', 'Lichter, P']","['Mertens D', 'Wolf S', 'Bullinger L', 'Ohl S', 'Schaffner C', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Lichter P']","['Abteilung ""Organisation komplexer Genome"", Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Exons', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transferases', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2000/11/10 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/10 11:00'],"['2000/11/10 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/10 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0215(20001201)88:5<692::AID-IJC2>3.0.CO;2-3 [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0215(20001201)88:5<692::aid-ijc2>3.0.co;2-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2000 Dec 1;88(5):692-7. doi: 10.1002/1097-0215(20001201)88:5<692::aid-ijc2>3.0.co;2-3.,"['0 (DLEU2 lncRNA, human)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.- (Transferases)']",,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This is a prospective study utilizing three common cranial irradiation techniques. Technique A uses a half-beam, nondivergent radiation field. Technique B has the anterior divergent field edge at the lateral bony canthus. Technique C is similar to B, but with a field collimator angle. Thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) lens dose measurements were obtained in children and phantom with all three techniques. RESULTS: Seventeen children were studied. Lens dose measurements were obtained in 14 children with technique A using MLC and blocks. In 7 of 14 children, dose measurements were obtained with MLC only. One child was treated with technique B and 2 children were treated with C, with MLC +/- blocks. In all 3 techniques, with MLC alone, the lens dose increased by 64%, 119%, and 72%, respectively. Similar results were obtained in phantom. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that independent of irradiation technique, additional custom blocking is required to maximally protect the lens with MLC shaped fields. This is due to the lack of conformity between MLC and the desired field edge at the lateral bony canthus.","['Kalapurakal, J A', 'Sathiaseelan, V', 'Bista, T', 'Marymont, M H']","['Kalapurakal JA', 'Sathiaseelan V', 'Bista T', 'Marymont MH']","['Division of Radiation Oncology, Robert H.

The U937 histiocytic cell line was transduced with this vector, and a clone (VB71) with high-level transgene expression was selected. Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were injected with VB71 cells to evaluate the role of long terminal repeat methylation in transgene silencing in vivo and to see whether 5-azacytidine (5' aza-C) demethylating agent prevented it. We found 5' aza-C maintained gene expression at high level in vitro. In vivo, time to tumor onset was significantly longer in SCID mice receiving the VB71 cells, 5' aza-C, and gcv compared with animals treated with either 5' aza-C or gcv alone. The number of injected tumor cells influences tumor onset time and the efficacy of 5' aza-C and gcv treatment. The standard gcv treatment schedule (10 mg/kg from d + 1 until the onset of tumor) controlled tumor onset better than short-term treatment with high doses.

Tal2 null mutant mice show no obvious defects of hematopoiesis. During embryogenesis, Tal2 expression is restricted to the developing midbrain, dorsal diencephalon, and rostroventral diencephalic/telencephalic boundary, partly along presumptive developing fiber tracts. The null mutant mice are viable at birth but growth become progressively retarded and they do not survive to reproductive age. Tal2-deficient mice show a distinct dysgenesis of the midbrain tectum. Due to loss of superficial gray and optical layers, the superior colliculus is reduced in size and the inferior colliculus is abnormally rounded and protruding. Death is most likely due to progressive hydrocephalus which appears to be caused by obstruction of the foramen of Monro (the connection between the ventricles of the forebrain).

These features of the protease inhibitors might enhance the activity of retinoids. To explore this hypothesis, myeloid leukemia cells were cultured with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) either alone or in combination with the HIV-1 protease inhibitors indinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir. Consistent with the hypothesis, the HIV-1 protease inhibitors enhanced the ability of ATRA to inhibit growth and induce differentiation of HL-60 and NB4 myeloid leukemia cells, as measured by expression of CD11b and CD66b cell surface antigens, as well as reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium. Growth of ATRA-resistant UF-1 cells was also inhibited when cultured with the combination of ATRA and indinavir. Moreover, indinavir enhanced the ability of ATRA to induce expression of the myeloid differentiation-related transcription factor C/EBPepsilon messenger RNA in NB4 cells by 9.5-fold. Taken together, the results show that HIV-1 protease inhibitors enhance the antiproliferative and differentiating effects of ATRA on myeloid leukemia cells. An HIV-1 protease inhibitor might be a useful adjuvant with ATRA for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia and possibly retinoid-resistant cancers.","['Ikezoe, T', 'Daar, E S', 'Hisatake, J', 'Taguchi, H', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Ikezoe T', 'Daar ES', 'Hisatake J', 'Taguchi H', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Infectious Disease, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HIV Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Indinavir/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/metabolism', 'Ritonavir/pharmacology', 'Saquinavir/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48297-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Nov 15;96(10):3553-9.,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HIV Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '5W6YA9PKKH (Indinavir)', 'L3JE09KZ2F (Saquinavir)', 'O3J8G9O825 (Ritonavir)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To explain why deoxyadenosine and its analogs are toxic to a cell that is not undergoing replicative DNA synthesis, several mechanisms have been proposed, including the direct binding of dATP to the pro-apoptotic factor Apaf-1 and the activation of the caspase-9 and -3 pathways. In this study it is shown, by means of several assays on whole cells and isolated mitochondria, that 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (2CdA) and 2-choloro-2'-ara-fluorodeoxyadenosine (CaFdA) disrupt the integrity of mitochondria from primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells. The nucleoside-induced damage leads to the release of the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor. The other adenine deoxynucleosides tested displayed comparable DNA-damaging potency but did not affect mitochondrial function. Interference with mitochondrial integrity, thus, may be a factor in the potent cytotoxic effects of 2CdA and CaFdA toward nondividing lymphocytes.","['Genini, D', 'Adachi, S', 'Chao, Q', 'Rose, D W', 'Carrera, C J', 'Cottam, H B', 'Carson, D A', 'Leoni, L M']","['Genini D', 'Adachi S', 'Chao Q', 'Rose DW', 'Carrera CJ', 'Cottam HB', 'Carson DA', 'Leoni LM']","['Department of Medicine and The Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research on Aging, Whittier Diabetes Program, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arabinonucleosides/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cladribine/pharmacology', 'Clofarabine', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA Damage/*physiology', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/drug effects/metabolism', 'Deoxyadenosines/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Microinjections', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48295-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Nov 15;96(10):3537-43.,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,"['CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM23200/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

FR-beta expression was elevated up to 20-fold by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in KG-1 myeloid leukemia cells in a dose-dependent and reversible manner in the absence of terminal differentiation or cell growth inhibition. ATRA also increased FR-beta expression in vitro in myeloid leukemia cells from patient marrow. FR-beta was not up-regulated in KG-1 cells treated with phorbol ester, dexamethasone, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D(3), or transforming growth factor beta. ATRA did not induce FR-beta expression in receptor negative cells of diverse origin. The ATRA-induced increase in FR-beta expression in KG-1 cells occurred at the level of messenger RNA synthesis, and in 293 cells containing a stably integrated FR-beta promoter-luciferase reporter construct, ATRA induced expression of the reporter. From experiments using retinoid agonists and antagonists and from cotransfection studies using the FR-beta promoter and expression plasmids for the nuclear receptors retinoic acid receptor (RAR)alpha, RARbeta, or RARgamma, it appears that the retinoid effect on FR-beta expression could be mediated by ligand binding to RARs alpha, beta, or gamma, but not to retinoid X receptors. Furthermore, there was apparent cross-talk between RARalpha and RARgamma selective agonists or antagonists, suggesting a common downstream target for RAR isoforms in inducing FR-beta expression. Thus, blocks in the RARalpha-specific pathway of retinoid-induced differentiation may be bypassed during retinoid induction of FR-beta expression. The results suggest that to facilitate FR-targeted therapies, retinoids may be used to modulate FR-beta expression in myeloid leukemia cells refractory to retinoid differentiation therapy.","['Wang, H', 'Zheng, X', 'Behm, F G', 'Ratnam, M']","['Wang H', 'Zheng X', 'Behm FG', 'Ratnam M']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Ohio, Toledo, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Recombinant/drug effects', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Protein Isoforms/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48294-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Nov 15;96(10):3529-36.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 4.6.1.13 (Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase)']",,,,"['CA70873/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA80183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Vectors used so far, however, have been poorly satisfying in terms of either biosafety or efficiency of transgene expression. Herein is described the results obtained with human immunodeficiency virus-based vectors optimized in both of these aspects. It is thus shown that vectors containing the EF1alpha and, to a lesser extent, the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter, govern high-level gene expression in human hematopoietic progenitors as well as derived hematopoietic lineages of therapeutic relevance, such as erythrocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, and megakaryocytes. EF1alpha promoter-containing lentiviral vectors can also induce strong transgene expression in primary T lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood. A self-inactivating design did not affect the performance of EF1alpha promoter-based vectors but significantly reduced expression from the PGK promoter. This negative effect could nevertheless be largely rescued by inserting the post-transcriptional regulatory element of woodchuck hepatitis virus upstream of the vector 3' long terminal repeat.

It has been demonstrated that lentivirus vectors are more efficient than MLV vectors at transducing nondividing cell lines as well as human CD34(+) cells and severe combined immunodeficiency disease repopulating cells. We compared transduction of cell lines and Lin(-) bone marrow cells, using a vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G)-pseudotyped lentivirus or MLV vectors carrying a green fluorescent protein marker gene. As predicted, the lentivirus vector was more efficient at transducing mouse and human growth-inhibited cell lines. The transduction of mouse HSC by lentivirus vectors was compared directly to MLV vectors in a co-transduction assay. In this assay, transduction by ecotropic MLV is a positive internal control for downstream steps in retrovirus transduction, including cell division. Both the VSV-G lentivirus and MLV vectors transduced mouse HSCs maintained in cytokine-free medium at very low frequency, as did the ecotropic control. The lentivirus vector and the MLV vector were equally efficient at transducing bone marrow HSCs cultured in interleukin 3 (IL-3), IL-6, and stem cell factor for 96 hours. In conclusion, although lentivirus vectors are able to transduce growth-inhibited cell lines, the cell cycle status of HSCs render them resistant to lentivirus-mediated transduction, and it is hypothesized that entry into cycle, not necessarily division, may be a requirement for efficient lentivirus-mediated transduction.","['Barrette, S', 'Douglas, J L', 'Seidel, N E', 'Bodine, D M']","['Barrette S', 'Douglas JL', 'Seidel NE', 'Bodine DM']","['Hematopoiesis Section, Genetics and Molecular Biology Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/standards', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Hemoglobins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Titrimetry', 'Transduction, Genetic/*standards', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/genetics']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48275-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Nov 15;96(10):3385-91.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The event-free survival (EFS) experience for patients with 1 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample contaminated with blast cells was worse than that for patients with no contaminated CSF samples (P =.026); that of patients with 2 consecutive contaminated CSF samples was particularly poor (5-year EFS = 46 +/- 9%). In a Cox multiple regression analysis, the strongest prognostic indicator was 2 consecutive contaminated CSF samples, with a hazard ratio of 2.39 (95% confidence interval, 1. 36-4.20). These data indicate that contamination of CSF with circulating leukemic blast cells during diagnostic lumbar puncture can adversely affect the treatment outcome of children with ALL and is an indication to intensify intrathecal therapy.","['Gajjar, A', 'Harrison, P L', 'Sandlund, J T', 'Rivera, G K', 'Ribeiro, R C', 'Rubnitz, J E', 'Razzouk, B', 'Relling, M V', 'Evans, W E', 'Boyett, J M', 'Pui, C H']","['Gajjar A', 'Harrison PL', 'Sandlund JT', 'Rivera GK', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Razzouk B', 'Relling MV', 'Evans WE', 'Boyett JM', 'Pui CH']","[""Departments of Hematology-Oncology, Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA. amar.gajjar@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/cerebrospinal fluid/*etiology/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/cerebrospinal fluid/complications/*diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spinal Puncture/*adverse effects/standards', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48274-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Nov 15;96(10):3381-4.,,['Blood. 2001 Dec 1;98(12):3496-7.

Because thrombopoietin controls these functions in the normal megakaryocytic lineage, we asked the question: Are megakaryocytic progenitor cells in the myeloproliferative disorder essential thrombocythemia (ET) hypersensitive to thrombopoietin? Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with ET, or secondary (reactive) thrombocytosis (2 degrees T), or healthy volunteers were grown in strictly serum-free agarose culture containing interleukin 3 (IL-3) and all-trans-retinoic acid, with various concentrations of PEG-rHu megakaryocyte growth and development factor (MGDF). The concentration of cytokine at half-maximum colony number served as a measure of progenitor cell sensitivity. Hypersensitivity to PEG-rHu MGDF was found in circulating progenitors from 18 of 20 (90%) informative patients with presumptive diagnosis ET, 1 of 8 (12.5%) 2 degrees T patients, and none of the 22 healthy volunteers. Median MGDF sensitivity ratio in ET patients was approximately 53 times greater than in the controls. This hypersensitivity, which was also directed to rHu thrombopoietin, was highly specific with respect to cytokine, disease, and cell lineage. We propose that, despite their single pluripotential cell origin, the different clinicopathologic phenotypes in different chronic myeloproliferative disorders are determined by lineage-restricted hypersensitivities of hematopoietic progenitor cells to endogenous cytokines. This work emphasizes the importance of stringent serum-free conditions for revealing true sensitivities to cytokines. The findings also offer a basis for evolving a positive test for ET, a diagnosis now made essentially by exclusion.","['Axelrad, A A', 'Eskinazi, D', 'Correa, P N', 'Amato, D']","['Axelrad AA', 'Eskinazi D', 'Correa PN', 'Amato D']","['Department of Anatomy, University of Toronto, Mt Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. a.axelrad@utoronto.ca']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*etiology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Middle Aged', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/blood/*etiology', 'Thrombopoietin/*adverse effects/pharmacology']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48264-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Nov 15;96(10):3310-21.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (polyethylene glycol-recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development', 'factor)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This sector involves more than 16,000 farms of cattle and 10,000 farms of sheep and goats (respectively 6% and 15% of national production) which are actually increasing their number. Most livestock in Sicily is owned by small holders and pastoralists. Regional production of milk feeds some industries, which involve a large and increasing occupational area. Due to its peculiar geographic aspect Sicily is constituted by hill areas with sporadic grasses, therefore extensive grazing methods represent an ancient, traditional practice for using poor lands. For the control of infectious diseases Veterinary Services (VS) are based on the public regional network that is coordinated by the Ministry of Health in Rome. Even if Sicilian VS had to solve many constraints related to traditional ""pastoral management system"", to the lack of any sanitary background of this sector, to unknown data on the numbers of the whole livestock, the effort done in the last years has allowed to monitor for brucellosis, bovine leukemia virus (BLV), bovine TBC, swine vescicular disease (MVS) and other diseases for the majority of the farms. Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) still represent a serious impediment to the improvement of meat and milk production in the region. Every year, several outbreaks related to Theileria, Babesia or Anaplasma infections in cattle are recorded. Imported breeds pay the most expensive tribute often with a mortality rate of 100%. In the last five years more than 170 outbreaks of TBDs have been notified by our Institute although the pathogen prevalence and economical impact in the Sicilian livestock is still unknown. The outdoor grazing of the animals, far away from observation, a subclinical course of the disease, can in fact create difficulties in discovering infection and therefore the therapy is often too late. New diagnostic and control methods (PCR, vaccination) are being developed at the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale of Sicily in cooperation with other national and international laboratories (such as the University of Utrecht).","['Caracappa, S']",['Caracappa S'],"['Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Sicilia A.

C-to-T transitions were detected on exons 5 and 12 at the 769 and 1904 cDNA nucleotide positions, respectively. The mutation in exon 5 substitutes an arginine with a cysteine (R257C) in the extracellular domain, 11 amino acids distant from the WSXWS motif conserved in the cytokine-receptor superfamily. The mutation in exon 12 substitutes a proline with a leucine (P635L) in the last amino acid of the C-terminal intracellular domain, responsible for signal transduction. As in the Japanese family, the mutations were both transmitted from the parents. TPO plasma levels were highly increased in the patient. The patient's 7-year-old brother, who was a candidate donor for allografting, turned out to be an asymptomatic heterozygous carrier of P635L and showed defective megakaryocyte colony formation from bone-marrow progenitor cells.

These are due to considerable improvement in the techniques of molecular cytogenetics. Various applications of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), used in conjunction with conventional cytogenetics, make the recognition of some abnormalities easier, and the localization of chromosomal breakpoints in structural rearrangements more precise. Under many circumstances, accurate breakpoint localization is the first step toward the identification of genes involved in translocations and inversions. Some of the genes recently discovered may be rearranged with several partner genes. These promiscuous genes are natural experiments that generate mutants which help to identify the function of genes rearranged in hematopoietic malignancies as well as that of their normal counterparts. The diversity of the genes implicated in leukemogenesis makes their functional study a challenge, but, as recently shown by their role in chromatin remodeling, increasing recognition of cross-talk between many of these genes justifies the development of analyses of leukemia-associated chromosome abnormalities and of their functional consequences.","['Bernard, O A', 'Berger, R']","['Bernard OA', 'Berger R']","['INSERM U434, Institut de Genetique Moleculaire, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0037196300000329 [pii]', '10.1016/s0037-1963(00)90020-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2000 Oct;37(4):412-9. doi: 10.1016/s0037-1963(00)90020-9.,,,,59,,,,,,,,,

Together with rearrangements in immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes, balanced translocations are the most important genetic lesions amenable to molecular diagnosis. Moreover, many publications have identified significant differences in the prognosis of acute leukemia patients with such balanced translocations. Because not all balanced translocations can be diagnosed by cytogenetic techniques, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based methods are increasingly employed. This method has the added advantage that it can also be used to monitor for minimal residual disease (MRD). A disadvantage is that the multitude of balanced translocations in leukemia would make efforts to detect all lesions at diagnosis by such standard techniques extremely labor-intensive. Furthermore, difficulties in optimizing semiquantitative PCR assays have limited the utility of these methods for MRD. Recent advances in the design of multiplex PCR, which detects a number of genetic aberrations simultaneously, may improve the diagnostic process. Accurate quantitation of the fusion transcript for balanced translocations has become possible by use of fluorogenic probes and real-time PCR.

Characteristic patterns of genomic imbalances not only have confirmed recent classification schemes in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but they provide a basis for the successful identification of genes with previously unrecognized pathogenic roles in the development of different lymphomas. Based on its technical limitations, there is little reason to apply CGH to chromosomes of metaphase cells in routine diagnostic settings. However, the new approach of CGH to DNA microarrays, a procedure termed matrix-CGH, overcomes most of the limitations and opens new approaches for diagnostics and identification of genetically defined leukemia and lymphoma subgroups. Current efforts to develop leukemia specific matrix-CGH DNA chips, which are designed to meet the clinical needs, are presented and discussed.","['Lichter, P', 'Joos, S', 'Bentz, M', 'Lampel, S']","['Lichter P', 'Joos S', 'Bentz M', 'Lampel S']","['Abteilung Organisation komplexer Genome, Deutsches Krebforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,IM,"['Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/*methods', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0037196300000275 [pii]', '10.1016/s0037-1963(00)90015-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2000 Oct;37(4):348-57. doi: 10.1016/s0037-1963(00)90015-5.,,,,75,,,,,,,,,

To standardize drug delivery, we solubilized Bu for parenteral use. This new intravenous (i.v.) Bu formulation was combined with oral Bu and cyclophosphamide (Cy) to evaluate (1) the human acute toxicity of i.v. Bu and its solvent system and (2) the pharmacokinetics of Bu in patients undergoing hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT). One dose of i.v. Bu (escalating from 0.08 to 0.8 mg/kg) was given over 2 hours by pump; 6 hours later, an oral Bu regimen was begun, consisting of 1 mg/kg every 6 hours for 15 doses, followed by Cy, 60 mg/kg daily for 2 days. After 1 day of rest, HPCT was performed. The i.v. Bu dose was well tolerated and did not produce any acute toxicity reaction that could be attributed to the solvent system of dimethylacetamide and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-400. All observed treatment-related toxicity was as would be expected after high-dose oral Bu plus Cy. When the i.v. Bu was used as reference solution, the pharmacokinetic analysis indicated an average bioavailability of oral high-dose Bu of 69%, ranging from <10% to virtually 100%. Further, the 2-hour infusion of i.v. Bu gave a time to maximum plasma concentration following drug administration similar to that of oral Bu (2 hours and 1.8 hours, respectively), and i.v. Bu had a clearance similar to that of oral Bu. Based on the data in this study, we suggest that the optimal (starting) dose of i.v. Bu (in combination with Cy) in our forthcoming phase 2 trial should be on the order of 0.8 mg/kg to target an area under the curve (AUC) of 1100 to 1200 micromol/L per minute. This would secure myeloablation and engraftment but save the vast majority of patients from the increased risk of serious hepatic veno-occlusive disease that has been reported when the AUC level exceeds 1500 micromol/L per minute. Bu administration via the i.v. route will assure complete bioavailability and reliable systemic drug exposure with more predictable blood levels and, therefore, possibly lower the risks for serious/life-threatening toxicity, graft rejection, and recurrent leukemia.","['Andersson, B S', 'Madden, T', 'Tran, H T', 'Hu, W W', 'Blume, K G', 'Chow, D S', 'Champlin, R E', 'Vaughan, W P']","['Andersson BS', 'Madden T', 'Tran HT', 'Hu WW', 'Blume KG', 'Chow DS', 'Champlin RE', 'Vaughan WP']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77005, USA. bandersson@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,"['Acetamides/adverse effects', 'Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological Availability', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Drug Carriers/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polyethylene Glycols/adverse effects', 'Safety', 'Solvents/adverse effects', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s1083-8791(00)70064-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2000;6(5A):548-54. doi: 10.1016/s1083-8791(00)70064-4.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Solvents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'JCV5VDB3HY (dimethylacetamide)']",,,,"['3P30-CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '3PO1-CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

It was previously determined that both naive and leukemia-presensitized CD4+-enriched T cells are capable of mediating GVL activity to MMB3.19 challenge in both syngeneic (B6) and allogeneic (C3H.SW-->B6) strain combinations, with the latter coinciding with minimal graft-versus-host disease. In the present study, MMB3.19 and 2 other similarly derived, yet phenotypically diverse, B6 myeloid leukemia lines (MMB1.10 and MMB2.18) were investigated for potential shared tumor antigens in the syngeneic GVL model. Morphologically, all 3 tumor lines are blastic with high cytoplasmic:nuclear ratios, but MMB2.18 displays dendritic processes, whereas MMB1.10 and MMB3.19 have a more rounded appearance. Flow cytometric analysis of the 3 lines revealed constitutive surface molecule expression of Mac-1, Mac-2, F4/80, LFA-1, B7-1, B7-2, H2Kb, H2Db, and macrophage scavenger receptor, consistent with macrophage/monocyte lineages. Furthermore, each of the lines expresses H2I-Ab, but to varying degrees, with MMB2.18 cells having the lowest percentage (31.6%). In vitro 51Cr release assays using MMB3.19-primed T-cell effectors demonstrated equivalent specific lysis of all 3 leukemia-line target cells. In addition, enzyme-linked immunospot analysis of MMB3.19-primed CD4+ T cells revealed significantly increased frequencies of tumor-stimulated interleukin (IL)-2-, IL-4-, and interferon-gamma-secreting cells when restimulated with each of the 3 leukemia lines. Furthermore, when MMB3.19-primed CD4+ T cells were administered in a BMT setting, a protective GVL effect was seen in those mice challenged with MMB1.10, MMB2.18, or MMB3.19. Therefore, in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that the 3 distinct myeloid leukemia lines share 1 or more common major histocompatibility complex class II-restricted tumor antigens that can elicit a cross-protective in vivo T-cell GVL response.","['Patterson, A E', 'Korngold, R']","['Patterson AE', 'Korngold R']","['Kimmel Cancer Institute, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'Cytoplasm/ultrastructure', 'Dendrites/ultrastructure', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, myc', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phenotype', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/metabolism/ultrastructure']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s1083-8791(00)70063-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2000;6(5A):537-47. doi: 10.1016/s1083-8791(00)70063-2.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,"['CA-60630/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA-09683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Most anticonvulsant drugs induce drug-metabolising enzymes and thereby increase the clearance of anticancer agents. We investigated whether anticonvulsants compromise the efficacy of cancer chemotherapy. METHODS: We identified whom of 716 children treated consecutively for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at a single academic hospital in the USA between 1984 and 1994 received treatment for 30 days or longer with anticonvulsants (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or a combination) at the same time as antileukaemic therapy. Cox's proportional-hazards models were used to assess the prognostic significance of anticonvulsants on event-free survival and risk of haematological and central-nervous-system (CNS) relapse, with stratification for treatment protocol. FINDINGS: 40 (5.6%) of 716 patients received anticonvulsants. Use of these drugs was associated with age over 10 years (p=0.003), non-hyperdiploid leukaemia (p=0.031), and T-cell immunophenotype (p=0.022). After adjustment for age and ploidy, anticonvulsant therapy was significantly related to worse event-free survival (hazard ratio 2.67 [95% CI 1.50-4.76]; p=0.0009), haematological relapse (3.40 [1.69-6.88]; p=0.0006), and CNS relapse (2.90 [1.01-8.28]; p=0.047) among the 566 patients with B-lineage leukaemia. No such associations were seen among the 114 patients with T-cell leukaemia (p=0.61, 0.35, and 0.53, respectively). Faster clearance of teniposide (p=0.0001) and methotrexate (p=0.051), but not cytarabine (p=0.26) was found among patients receiving anticonvulsants. INTERPRETATION: Long-term anticonvulsant therapy increases the systemic clearance of several antileukaemic agents and is associated with lower efficacy of chemotherapy. Alternatives to enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants should be prescribed for patients receiving chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","['Relling, M V', 'Pui, C H', 'Sandlund, J T', 'Rivera, G K', 'Hancock, M L', 'Boyett, J M', 'Schuetz, E G', 'Evans, W E']","['Relling MV', 'Pui CH', 'Sandlund JT', 'Rivera GK', 'Hancock ML', 'Boyett JM', 'Schuetz EG', 'Evans WE']","[""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. mary.relling@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,IM,"['Anticonvulsants/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(00)02503-4 [pii]', '10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02503-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 2000 Jul 22;356(9226):285-90. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02503-4.,['0 (Anticonvulsants)'],,,,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

The diameter of the muscle fibers, the variance in muscle fiber diameter, the ratios of intermuscular connective tissue and muscle to the area of the bone niche for the stapedius muscle, the number of muscle fibers around the tendon, and the adipose cell count were measured for each temporal bone. In total, 80 temporal bones were examined, excluding specimens with facial nerve degeneration, degenerative diseases, middle ear disease and leukemia. Between the ages of 38 fetal weeks and 9 years, the muscle fibers and thin and the variance in fiber diameter is small. The areas of intermuscular connective tissue, muscle and the number of muscle fibers around the tendon do not change between 38 fetal weeks and 60 years. All of the parameters measured showed no significant changes between the ages of 10 and 60 years. The variance in muscle fiber diameter began to increase in specimens aged 70 years or older because some of the muscle fibers had begun to atrophy. Adipose cells were sometimes observed in very old specimens. In contrast to the tensor tympani muscle, in which degenerative changes begin during childhood, atrophic degeneration of the stapedius muscle as a result of aging begins at a very late age. The difference in aging between the stapedius muscle and the tensor tympani muscle is probably related to evidence suggesting that the stapedius muscle contracts in response to acoustic stimulation.","['Baba, Y']",['Baba Y'],"['Department of Otolaryngology, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nihon Jibiinkoka Gakkai Kaiho,Nihon Jibiinkoka Gakkai kaiho,7505728,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fetus', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stapedius/*pathology']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.3950/jibiinkoka.103.993 [doi]'],ppublish,Nihon Jibiinkoka Gakkai Kaiho. 2000 Sep;103(9):993-1000. doi: 10.3950/jibiinkoka.103.993.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATRA was therefore discontinued, and prednisolone was started on June 29. The fever and skin eruptions improved rapidly, and complete remission was obtained on July 13.

To find out the incidence of white matter changes during therapy, a prospective MRI study was designed, and the findings were correlated with neuropsychological evaluation. PROCEDURE: Thirty-three children with ALL underwent serial cranial MRI before, during, and after therapy. Twenty-eight of these children underwent also neuropsychological assessment at the end of treatment. They all received intravenous and intrathecal methotrexate for central nervous system (CNS) therapy, 15 patients received cranial irradiation in addition. RESULTS: Transient high-intensity white matter changes were observed by MRI in three children 9% (95% CI, 2-24%) who received chemotherapy only. The high-intensity changes were most prominent in the frontal lobes in two of these children. The children with white matter changes were significantly younger than those with normal MRI (2.8 vs. 7.4 years; mean). There was no correlation between neuropsychological tests and white matter changes, except in attention and in tests referring to the frontal areas in general. CONCLUSIONS: White matter changes are occasionally observed during therapy with the current Nordic protocols. Young children may be more susceptible to developing white matter changes after repeated intravenous methotrexate injections. There is no systematic correlation between neuropsychological deficits and MRI findings.","['Paakko, E', 'Harila-Saari, A', 'Vanionpaa, L', 'Himanen, S', 'Pyhtinen, J', 'Lanning, M']","['Paakko E', 'Harila-Saari A', 'Vanionpaa L', 'Himanen S', 'Pyhtinen J', 'Lanning M']","['Department of Diagnostic Radiology, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland. eija.paakko@oulu.fi']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Brain Injuries/*chemically induced', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects', 'Demyelinating Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1096-911X(20001101)35:5<456::AID-MPO3>3.0.CO;2-1 [pii]', '10.1002/1096-911x(20001101)35:5<456::aid-mpo3>3.0.co;2-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2000 Nov;35(5):456-61. doi: 10.1002/1096-911x(20001101)35:5<456::aid-mpo3>3.0.co;2-1.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

"" PROCEDURE: A total of 122 patients (64 boys; median age 5.3 years) with B-lineage ALL without CNS leukemia diagnosed between February 1987 and December 1997 were enrolled in the intermediate risk (IR) protocols: Associazione Italiana di Ematologia ed Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP)-ALL 87 (n = 33), 91 (n = 51), and 95 (n = 38). Presymptomatic CNS therapy consisted of intrathecal methotrexate (six doses) and cranial irradiation (18 Gy) in the IR AIEOP 87 study, and extended triple intrathecal therapy with methotrexate, cytarabine, and prednisone depending on age in the IR AIEOP-ALL 91 and 95 protocols (20 and 17 total doses, respectively). World Health Organization (WHO) grade 4 acute neurotoxicity criteria were employed. Patients with neurologic symptoms, in addition to physical examination, underwent EEG, computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and lumbar puncture to exclude CNS leukemia and infection. RESULTS: Acute NT was not reported in AIEOP-ALL 87 treated patients, but we observed acute NT in 3 out of 51 (5.8%) AIEOP-ALL 91 patients, and in 7 out of 38 (18.4%) AIEOP-ALL 95 patients. CONCLUSIONS: There was an increased incidence of acute NT in our patients with ALL treated with current intermediate risk protocols. The intensification of treatment, however, bettered event free survival (EFS) to 58%, 72% and 85% in IR AIEOP 87, 91 and 95 studies, respectively.","['Lo Nigro, L', 'Di Cataldo, A', 'Schiliro, G']","['Lo Nigro L', 'Di Cataldo A', 'Schiliro G']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/adverse effects', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/adverse effects', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1096-911X(20001101)35:5<449::AID-MPO2>3.0.CO;2-X [pii]', '10.1002/1096-911x(20001101)35:5<449::aid-mpo2>3.0.co;2-x [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2000 Nov;35(5):449-55. doi: 10.1002/1096-911x(20001101)35:5<449::aid-mpo2>3.0.co;2-x.,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

It is therefore of interest to understand the mechanism of glucocorticoid-regulation of the c-myc gene. In the present study, a detailed analysis of dexamethasone (Dex)-evoked regulation of the human c-myc gene in human leukemic CEM-C7 cells has been performed. Dex suppresses c-myc mRNA and immunoreactive protein expression in clone CEM-C7 and subclone CEM-C7-14 cells. Nuclear run-on assays suggested that the regulation occurred at the level of transcription initiation. The half-life of c-myc mRNA was approximately 30 min and its stability was not affected by Dex treatment. In addition, Dex suppressed luciferase gene expression driven by -2052 to +34 bp c-myc promoter in transfected CEM-C7-14 cells. This result further supports that c-myc gene is suppressed by Dex at the transcriptional level in apoptotic human leukemic cells.","['Zhou, F', 'Medh, R D', 'Thompson, E B']","['Zhou F', 'Medh RD', 'Thompson EB']","['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555-0645, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,9015483,IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Genes, myc', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC2761022,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0960-0760(00)00080-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0960-0760(00)00080-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 2000 Jul-Aug;73(5):195-202. doi: 10.1016/s0960-0760(00)00080-7.,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",,,,"['R01 CA041407/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA041407-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01CA41407/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['NIHMS147909'],,

Chief among the difficulties in diagnosing this entity is that the morphologic features are nonspecific and that it is difficult to distinguish it from reactive processes. The purpose of this study was to examine the histologic and immunophenotypic appearance of T-LGL leukemia in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, and to determine what features may suggest that ancillary studies such as flow cytometric and molecular analysis should be pursued to make a definitive diagnosis. We took a multidisciplinary approach by using morphology, immunoperoxidase staining, flow cytometric analysis, and molecular studies on 9 cases of T-lineage LGL leukemia. Our findings indicate that T-lineage LGL leukemia typically infiltrates the marrow diffusely. Most cases show a hypercellular marrow with an increase in myeloid precursors relative to the mature cells (i.e., an inversion of the myeloid maturation pyramid) and a decreased myeloid:erythroid ratio. Neutropenia without a left shift is usually seen in the peripheral blood. The tumor cells are usually CD3+, CD8+, CD57+, and TIA-1+. Most notably, the number of CD3+ T cells per high-power field is markedly elevated in T-LGL leukemia compared with normal, reactive, and pathologic marrows with neutropenia (mean values, 559 cells/mm(2) v. 7/mm(2), 11/mm(2), and 263/mm(2), respectively, P<.01). Moreover, CD57 staining also shows an increase in positive cells in T-LGL cases in comparison with normal, reactive, and pathologic marrows with neutropenia. Taken together, these findings indicate immunoperoxidase findings may be a useful tool to identify cases that should proceed to molecular or flow cytometric analysis.","['Evans, H L', 'Burks, E', 'Viswanatha, D', 'Larson, R S']","['Evans HL', 'Burks E', 'Viswanatha D', 'Larson RS']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0046-8177(00)27858-1 [pii]', '10.1053/hupa.2000.19298 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2000 Oct;31(10):1266-73. doi: 10.1053/hupa.2000.19298.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alterations in HOX expression have been clearly implicated in leukemia, but their role in most other malignant diseases remains unknown. By using degenerate reverse transcription-PCR and subsequent real-time quantitative assays, we examined HOX expression in lung cancer cell lines, direct tumor-control pairs, and bronchial epithelial cultures. As in leukemia, genes of the HOX9 paralogous group and HOXA10 were frequently overexpressed. For HOXB9, we confirmed that elevated RNA was associated with protein overexpression. In some cases, marked HOX overexpression was associated with elevated FGF10 and FGF17. During development, the WNT pathway affects cell fate, polarity, and proliferation, and WNT7a has been implicated in the maintenance of HOX expression. In contrast to normal lung and mortal short-term bronchial epithelial cultures, WNT7a was frequently reduced or absent in lung cancers. In immortalized bronchial epithelial cells, WNT7a was lost concomitantly with HOXA1, and a statistically significant correlation between the expression of both genes was observed in lung cancer cell lines.

Of note, both WNT7a and beta-catenin are encoded on chromosome 3p, which undergoes frequent loss of heterozygosity in these tumors.

The roles of proteins encoded in the pX open reading frame (ORF) II gene region in HTLV-1 replication or in mediating virus-associated diseases remain to be defined. A nucleus-localizing 30-kDa protein, p30(II), encoded within pX ORF II has limited homology with the POU family of transcription factors. Recently, we reported that selected mutations in pX ORF II diminish the ability of HTLV-1 to maintain high viral loads in infected rabbits. Herein we have tested the transcriptional ability of p30(II) in mammalian cells by using yeast Gal4 fusion protein vectors and transfection of luciferase reporter genes driven by CREB-responsive promoters. p30(II) as a Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) fusion protein transactivates Gal4-driven luciferase reporter gene activity up to 25-fold in 293 and HeLa-tat cells. We confirmed nuclear localization of p30(II) and demonstrate dose-dependent binding of p30(II)-Gal4(DBD) to Gal4 DNA-binding sites. The transcriptional activity of p30(II)-Gal4(DBD) was independent of TATA box flanking sequences, as shown by using two different Gal4 reporter systems. Studies of selected p30(II) mutants indicated that domains that mediate transcription are restricted to a central core region of the protein between amino acids 62 and 220. Transfection of a p30(II)-expressing plasmid repressed cellular CRE-driven reporter gene activity, with or without Tax expression. In contrast, p30(II) at lower concentrations enhanced HTLV-1 long terminal repeat-driven reporter gene activity independent of Tax expression. These data are the first to demonstrate a transcriptional function for p30(II) and suggest a mechanism by which this nuclear protein may influence HTLV-1 replication or cellular gene expression in vivo.","['Zhang, W', 'Nisbet, J W', 'Bartoe, J T', 'Ding, W', 'Lairmore, M D']","['Zhang W', 'Nisbet JW', 'Bartoe JT', 'Ding W', 'Lairmore MD']","['Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Open Reading Frames', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Rabbits', 'Response Elements', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Viral Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Virus Replication']",PMC113231,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.23.11270-11277.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Dec;74(23):11270-7. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.23.11270-11277.2000.,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",,,,"['R01 RR014324/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-70259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K02 AI01474/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-14324/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

We have investigated the role of a host cell cofactor, HMG I(Y) protein, in integration of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) cDNA. Previously we reported that HMG I(Y) cofractionates with HIV-1 preintegration complexes (PICs) isolated from freshly infected cells. PICs depleted of required components by treatment with high concentrations of salt could be reconstituted by addition of purified HMG I(Y) in vitro. Here we report studies using immunoprecipitation that indicate that HMG I(Y) is associated with MoMLV preintegration complexes. In mechanistic studies, we show for both HIV-1 and MoMLV that each HMG I(Y) monomer must contain multiple DNA binding domains to stimulate integration by HMG I(Y)-depleted PICs. We also find that HMG I(Y) can condense model HIV-1 or MoMLV cDNA in vitro as measured by stimulation of intermolecular ligation. This reaction, like reconstitution of integration, depends on the presence of multiple DNA binding domains in each HMG I(Y) monomer. These data suggest that binding of multivalent HMG I(Y) monomers to multiple cDNA sites compacts retroviral cDNA, thereby promoting formation of active integrase-cDNA complexes.","['Li, L', 'Yoder, K', 'Hansen, M S', 'Olvera, J', 'Miller, M D', 'Bushman, F D']","['Li L', 'Yoder K', 'Hansen MS', 'Olvera J', 'Miller MD', 'Bushman FD']","['Infectious Disease Laboratory, The Salk Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['DNA, Complementary/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'HMGA1a Protein', 'High Mobility Group Proteins/*physiology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology']",PMC113176,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.23.10965-10974.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Dec;74(23):10965-74. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.23.10965-10974.2000.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (High Mobility Group Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '124544-67-8 (HMGA1a Protein)']",,,,"['R01 AI034786/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI34786/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM56553/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The Tax protein of BLV acts through the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) of BLV and activates the transcription of BLV. In this study, we amplified tax genes from BLV-infected cattle using PCR. We cloned the genes and monitored the transcriptional activities of the products. Seven independent mutant Tax proteins, with at least one amino acid substitution between residues 240 and 265, exhibited a markedly stronger ability to stimulate the viral LTR-directed transcription than the wild-type Tax protein. Analysis of chimeric Tax proteins derived from wild-type and mutant Tax proteins clearly demonstrated that a single substitution between residue 240 and 265 might be critical for the higher activities of the Tax mutant proteins. Furthermore, it appeared that transient expression of a Tax mutant protein was better able to increase the production of viral proteins and particles from a defective recombinant proviral clone of BLV than was wild-type Tax. Analysis of mutations within the U3 region of the LTR revealed that a cyclic AMP-responsive element in Tax-responsive element 2 might be sufficient for the enhanced activation mediated by the mutant proteins. In addition to the LTR of BLV, other viral enhancers, such as the enhancers of HTLV-1 and of mouse mammary tumor virus, which cannot be activated by wild-type BLV Tax protein, were activated by a Tax mutant protein. Our observations suggest that the transactivation activity and target sequence specificity of BLV Tax might be limited or negatively regulated by the region of the protein between amino acids 240 and 265.","['Tajima, S', 'Aida, Y']","['Tajima S', 'Aida Y']","['RIKEN Tsukuba Institute, 3-1-1 Koyadai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0074, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Peptide Fragments/*physiology', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', '*Transcriptional Activation']",PMC113173,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.23.10939-10949.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Dec;74(23):10939-49. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.23.10939-10949.2000.,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We focused on the globin CAC and CAAT promoter motifs, as previous laboratory and clinical studies indicated a pivotal role for these elements in globin gene activation. A high-affinity CAC-binding site for the erythroid kruppel-like factor (EKLF) was placed in the epsilon-globin promoter at a position corresponding to that in the adult beta-globin promoter, thereby simultaneously ablating a direct repeat (DR) element. This mutation led to EKLF-independent epsilon-globin transcription during definitive erythropoiesis. A second 4-bp substitution in the epsilon-globin CAAT sequence, which simultaneously disrupts a second DR element, further enhanced ectopic definitive erythroid activation of epsilon-globin transcription, which surprisingly became EKLF dependent. We finally examined factors in nuclear extracts prepared from embryonic or adult erythroid cells that bound these elements in vitro, and we identified a novel DR-binding protein (DRED) whose properties are consistent with those expected for a definitive-stage epsilon-globin repressor. We conclude that the suppression of epsilon-globin transcription during definitive erythropoiesis is mediated by the binding of a repressor that prevents EKLF from activating the epsilon-globin gene.","['Tanimoto, K', 'Liu, Q', 'Grosveld, F', 'Bungert, J', 'Engel, J D']","['Tanimoto K', 'Liu Q', 'Grosveld F', 'Bungert J', 'Engel JD']","['Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Cell Biology, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208-3500, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'COUP Transcription Factors', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Receptors, Steroid', 'Repressor Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC317038,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.822500 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 2000 Nov 1;14(21):2778-94. doi: 10.1101/gad.822500.,"['0 (COUP Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (erythroid Kruppel-like factor)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",,,,"['CA60553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK052356-04/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA060553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK052356/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL24415/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL024415/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

In the present report, an in vitro model was used to identify signaling pathways regulating capillary formation in embryonic endothelial cells. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) plus leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) optimally stimulate the formation of capillary-like structures of the embryonic endothelial cell line IEM. LIF stimulation of IEM cells leads to activation of the Stat3 as well as the (P41/43)mitogen-activated protein kinase ((P41/43)MAPK) cascade, while bFGF does not activate Stat3 but does induce the (P41/43)MAPK cascade. Inhibition of Stat3 DNA-binding activity by expression of a dominant inhibitory Stat3 mutant increases the capillary outgrowth of the IEM cells induced by LIF. Increased Stat3 activity by overexpression of the wild-type Stat3 greatly reduced capillary outgrowth. In contrast, inhibition of the (P41/43)MAPK cascade using a MEK-1 inhibitor dramatically inhibits the LIF-induced capillary outgrowth. Moreover, the increased formation of capillary-like structures of the IEM cells mediated by Stat3 inhibition does not overcome the requirement for activation of the (P41/43)MAPK pathway for capillary outgrowth. Stat3 activity correlates with the LIF-induced expression of the negative feedback regulators of the Janus (JAK) family of tyrosine kinases, SOCS-1 and SOCS-3. These results provide evidence that Stat3 acts as a negative regulator of capillary outgrowth, possibly by increasing SOCS-1 or SOCS-3 expression. The contradictory signals stimulated by LIF could be necessary to control the intensity of the response leading to capillary outgrowth in vivo.","['Paradis, H', 'Gendron, R L']","['Paradis H', 'Gendron RL']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Research Foundation, Cincinnati, OH 45229-3039, USA. hparadis@chmcc.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,IM,"['Capillaries/cytology/embryology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fetus/cytology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/physiology', 'Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2000 Dec;113 Pt 23:4331-9.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",,,,['EY12827/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate clinicopathological features of a series of such cases. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with LC were studied. Nineteen had acute myeloblastic leukaemia, six had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, three had myelodysplastic syndrome-refractory anaemia with excess blast in transformation, three had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in leukaemic phase, two had chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and one had multiple myeloma. RESULTS: Cutaneous lesions were widely dispersed in 15 patients, but were restricted to the extremities in eight patients. In other patients lesions were localized on the face, hands and feet. Cutaneous lesions were generally erythematous, maculopapular, squamous, nodular, haemorrhagic or necrotic. Two localizations were very interesting: in one case, lesions were confined to the site of previous varicella zoster virus infection; in the other case, leukaemic infiltration occurred within a lesion of cutaneous leishmaniasis. All of the patients had high white blood cell count and/or other findings of high tumour burden. Vasculitis with leukaemic cell infiltration (LV) was detected in 24 patients, and was high-grade LV in 16 patients. Patients with high-grade LV tended to have a higher white blood cell count and other findings associated with an aggressive clinical course compared with patients not having LV. Thirteen patients with LV died within 1 month but five patients lived more than 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: LC, and especially LV, is generally an indicator of poor prognosis. Its pathogenesis must be evaluated further with additional studies, including adhesion molecules, angiogenic factors and other biological parameters.","['Paydas, S', 'Zorludemir, S']","['Paydas S', 'Zorludemir S']","['Department of Oncology, Cukurova University Faculty of Medicine, 01330 BalcalAdana, Turkey. sepay@mail.cu.edu.tr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Capillaries/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemic Infiltration/complications/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Skin/blood supply/*pathology', 'Vasculitis/*etiology/pathology']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']","['bjd3774 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2133.2000.03774.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2000 Oct;143(4):773-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2133.2000.03774.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sensitivity of leukemic cells to glucocorticoids was previously related to the cell concentration of 3[H]dexamethasone-binding sites. The latter represents the classic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) isoform alpha that binds ligand and modulates the transcription rates of glucocorticoid-responsive genes. In ALL, lymphoblasts of T-lineage are less sensitive to glucocorticoids than cells of the B-lineage. The alternatively spliced GR isoform (GRP), which exerts a dominant negative effect on GRalpha-mediated transcriptional activity, has been proposed as a possible mediator of glucocorticoid resistance. In this study, we determined the amount of GRalpha and GRbeta in mononuclear cells from 13 newly diagnosed and untreated children with ALL and 9 controls by quantitative Western analysis. Generally, leukemic patients expressed 6 times less GRalpha (ALL= 0.54 +/- 1.1; controls = 3.1 +/- 0.9; p < 0.01) than controls, but the same amount of GRbeta (ALL=3.62 +/- 3.3; controls = 3.6 +/- 3.4). ALL patients with T-cell disease had a much lower GRalpha (0.09 +/- 0.1; p < 0.01) but a similar or slightly higher GRbeta (5.98 +/- 3.9; p = 0.1) expression than controls, with a GRalpha/GRbeta ratio 15 times smaller than controls. Mononuclear leukocytes of T-cell lineage expressed significantly lower GRalpha (p = 0.04) and higher GRbeta (p < 0.01) than cells of the pre-B immunophenotype, with a 10 times smaller ratio. We conclude that the combination of low GRalpha and normal-to-high GRbeta expression in leukemic lymphoblasts might represent one of the mechanisms responsible for their reduced glucocorticoid sensitivity; this is more pronounced in T-lineage cells.","['Longui, C A', 'Vottero, A', 'Adamson, P C', 'Cole, D E', 'Kino, T', 'Monte, O', 'Chrousos, G P']","['Longui CA', 'Vottero A', 'Adamson PC', 'Cole DE', 'Kino T', 'Monte O', 'Chrousos GP']","['Section on Pediatric Endocrinology, DEB, NICHD, NIH, Bethesda, USA. fisiolab@santacasasp.org.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Horm Metab Res,Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme,0177722,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blotting, Western', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/genetics/*metabolism']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2007-978661 [doi]'],ppublish,Horm Metab Res. 2000 Oct;32(10):401-6. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-978661.,"['0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (glucocorticoid receptor alpha)', '0 (glucocorticoid receptor beta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The number of T cells that firmly bound to vascular endothelial cells under physiological shear stress increased 2-14-fold upon CD99 stimulation, and bound cells became much more resistant to detachment forces and spread. T cell arrest occurred within 1 min and was dependent on the alpha4beta1-VCAM-1 pathway. In contrast, the alphaLbeta2-ICAM-1 pathway remained unactivated. This was observed with T cell lines and with activated peripheral blood lymphocytes, and was limited within the resting peripheral CD4+ T cells to the memory subset, while virgin cells were unaffected.

CD5+ and CD5-B cells were obtained by cell sorting, CDRIII of rearranged VH genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and fragment length analysis was performed. All samples demonstrated a polyclonal pattern of VH gene length distribution. In addition, VH gene rearrangements were amplified and sequenced from sorted single cells of two of the donors.

Here, we provide evidence that occupancy of LAIR-1 on human myelomonocytic leukemic cell lines inhibits proliferation and leads to programmed cell death (PCD), evaluated by propidium iodide staining and transmission electron microscopy. Interestingly, PCD elicited via LAIR-1 was not blocked by different caspase inhibitors, at variance with apoptosis induced via CD95/Fas, which was prevented by the caspase-1 and caspase-8 specific inhibitors. In addition, we show that the p65 subunit of the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), constitutively expressed in the nucleus of these cell lines, was retained in the cytoplasm upon engagement of LAIR-1. This was evident already 8 h after LAIR-1 occupancy, when apoptosis was not yet detectable by fluorometric or ultrastructural analysis.

As blocking of NF-kappaB activation has been shown to rescue sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs in solid tumors, we suggest that LAIR-1 may represent a possible target for pharmacological approaches aimed to potentiate anti-leukemic therapy.","['Poggi, A', 'Pellegatta, F', 'Leone, B E', 'Moretta, L', 'Zocchi, M R']","['Poggi A', 'Pellegatta F', 'Leone BE', 'Moretta L', 'Zocchi MR']","['Laboratory of Immunology, National Institute for Cancer Research, Genoa, Italy. poggi@ermes.cba.unige.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Caspase 1/physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/physiology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Design', 'Fas Ligand Protein', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Receptors, Immunologic/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factor RelA', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'U937 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1521-4141(200010)30:10<2751::AID-IMMU2751>3.0.CO;2-L [pii]', '10.1002/1521-4141(200010)30:10<2751::AID-IMMU2751>3.0.CO;2-L [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2000 Oct;30(10):2751-8. doi: 10.1002/1521-4141(200010)30:10<2751::AID-IMMU2751>3.0.CO;2-L.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '0 (leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytosine replaces thymidine; the corresponding triplets are AAT (T allele) and AAC (C allele), respectively, both coding for asparagine. Therefore, this polymorphism has no implication in the primary structure of BCR and BCR-ABL proteins. However, since the alteration is located close to the fusion region it may have a significant influence on the annealing of PCR primers, probes for real time PCR, and antisense oligonucleotides. We have developed a RT-PCR-based screening method to easily identify polymorphic BCR and BCR-ABL alleles in CML patients and normal individuals in order to estimate their frequency. After amplification from cDNA, a melting curve of a specific fluorogenic probe mapping to the 3' end of BCR exon b2 and spanning the polymorphism readily discriminates between normal and polymorphic BCR and BCR-ABL alleles. This reporter probe is 3' labeled with fluorescein and placed next to 5' LC Red640-labeled anchor probes mapping to the 5' ends of BCR exon b3 or ABL exon a2 so that resonance energy transfer occurs when the probes are hybridized (LightCycler technology). T and C alleles were discriminated by a melting temperature difference of the reporter probe of 3.2 K. We have investigated cDNAs derived from leukocytes from seven cell lines and a total of 229 individuals: normal donors, n = 15; BCR-ABL negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders, n=30; BCR-ABL negative acute leukemias, n= 11; b2a2BCR-ABL positive CML, n = 93; and b3a2BCR-ABL positive CML, n= 80. The frequency of the C allele was 33.0% in BCR-ABL negative individuals, 30.6% in b2a2BCR-ABL, and 23.8% in b3a2BCR-ABL positive CML. In CML patients, 27.7% of BCR-ABL and 27.2% of BCR alleles had the C allele (NS). In total, 132 of 458 (28.8%) exons b2 of BCR or BCR-ABL alleles demonstrated this polymorphism. We conclude that a thymidine/cytosine replacement occurs frequently in BCR exon b2. Probes for real time quantitative RT-PCR should be designed not to map to the critical region in order to avoid underestimation of the number of BCR-ABL transcripts.","['Saussele, S', 'Weisser, A', 'Muller, M C', 'Emgi, M', 'La Rosee, P', 'Paschka, P', 'Kuhn, C', 'Willer, A', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Hochhaus, A']","['Saussele S', 'Weisser A', 'Muller MC', 'Emgi M', 'La Rosee P', 'Paschka P', 'Kuhn C', 'Willer A', 'Hehlmann R', 'Hochhaus A']","['III.

To determine whether cellular levels of topo IIalpha and beta are an important factor in determining drug sensitivity/resistance requires accurate, precise measurements of the two isoforms. We have developed a quantitative Western blotting method to accurately measure the absolute amounts of human topo IIalpha and beta, using recombinant human topo IIalpha and beta as standards. This quantitative method has been used to assess the efficiency of several commonly used topo II extraction protocols. The extractable amount of topo IIalpha and beta was found to be salt-dependent. However extraction using the optimal salt concentration was found to be as efficient as extraction with DNase I/Rnase A digestion and SDS solubilisation.

Transgenic mice with enforced expression of LMO2 in their thymocytes develop T cell leukemias thus demonstrating the role of LMO2 in leukemogenesis. The physiologic and leukemogenic functions of LMO2 are mediated through its transcriptional regulatory activities, but the identity of the target genes is completely unknown. In this report, we have used cDNA representational difference analysis (cDNA-RDA) to identify genes that are over-expressed and are likely to play a role in the LMO2 induced leukemias. cDNA-RDA was performed using very small amounts of mRNA pool (from 1 microg of total RNA) to reverse transcribe the cDNAs from leukemic cells or normal thymocytes. The cDNA-RDA led to the isolation of nine distinct clones that were specifically overexpressed in the leukemic cells. Sequence analysis revealed that five of the nine clones had identity or homology to known genes that are known to play a role in the pathogenesis of leukemias or other cancers. Three clones had no significant homology to any known genes and thus represent novel candidate genes. Our study demonstrates that cDNA-RDA using very small amounts of total RNA is a highly efficient method to identify novel genes that may play a role in leukemogenesis.","['Davenport, J', 'Neale, G A', 'Goorha, R']","['Davenport J', 'Neale GA', 'Goorha R']","[""Department of Virology and Molecular Biology, St Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Metalloproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Species Specificity', 'Subtraction Technique']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401913 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Nov;14(11):1986-96. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401913.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,"['CA 43237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 52259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

In the age group 15-44, the fall was about 40% for males and 45% for females. In the age group 45-59, the fall was around 25%. At age 60-69, the peak rate was observed in the late 1970s, and the subsequent fall was only 6% for females. At age > or =70, leukemia mortality rose up to the late 1980s, and levelled off there-after. Overall, the falls in leukemia mortality over the 35-year calendar period corresponded to the avoidance of about 7,000 deaths per year. In eastern Europe, the falls in children and young adults started later --in the late 1970s--and were less than 40% for children and 30% for young adults (15-44 years). Overall age-standardized mortality from leukemia did not appreciably change over the 35-year period considered. Leukemia mortality rates in the USA and Japan started from different values, but were similar to those of the EU in the late 1990s, indicating that the impact of therapeutic advancements has been comparable in developed areas of the world.

Based on fluorescence in situ hybridisation, STS-PCR analysis and screening of genomic PAC libraries, a physical map of contiguous DNA probes on chromosome 11 was constructed containing the anti-apoptotic genes API2 and API1 adjacent to the translocation breakpoint. RACE-PCR experiments revealed MALT1 the chromosome 18-derived fusion partner of API2, which has also been reported recently by other groups. RT-PCR analysis and DNA sequencing demonstrated the expression of an API2-MALT1 fusion transcript in 18/24 gastral and extragastral MALT-type lymphomas. In none of 10 LBLs was a translocation specific RT-PCR product detected. Five variants of the fusion transcript were identified and in all instances the open reading frame of the fused portion of the MALT1 gene was maintained. The molecular analysis of these variants allowed the design of optimised assays for the diagnosis of the API2-MALT1 gene rearrangement.","['Kalla, J', 'Stilgenbauer, S', 'Schaffner, C', 'Wolf, S', 'Ott, G', 'Greiner, A', 'Rosenwald, A', 'Dohner, H', 'Muller-Hermelink, H K', 'Lichter, P']","['Kalla J', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Schaffner C', 'Wolf S', 'Ott G', 'Greiner A', 'Rosenwald A', 'Dohner H', 'Muller-Hermelink HK', 'Lichter P']","['Organisation komplexer Genome, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Caspases', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/pathology', 'Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Translocation 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401918 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Nov;14(11):1967-74. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401918.,"['0 (API2-MALT1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (BIRC2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (MALT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma Translocation 1 Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Both in the input material and cultured grafts we determined the number of colony-forming cells (CFC), cobblestone area forming cells (CAFC), the NOD/SCID repopulating ability (SRA), and CD34+ CD38- subset by phenotyping. The highest fold-increase obtained for the number of nucleated cells (nc), CD34+, CD34+ CD38 cell numbers and CFC content was, respectively, 102 +/- 76, 24 +/- 19, 190 +/- 202 and 53 +/- 37 for stroma-free and 315 +/- 110, 25 +/- 3, 346 +/- 410 and 53 +/- 43 for stroma-supported cultures. CAFC week type 6 was maximally 11-fold expanded both under stroma-free and stroma-supported conditions. The FBMD-1 stromal cells supported a modest expansion of CD34+ CD38- cells (27 +/- 18-fold) and nc (6 +/- 4-fold), while a loss of CFC and CAFC subsets was observed. The stromal cells synergized with FL + TPO to give the highest expansion of hemopoietic progenitors. Stromal support could be fully replaced by complementing the FL + TPO stimulated cultures with SCF + IL6. FL + TPO were required and sufficient to give a 10- to 20-fold expansion of the ability of CD34+ UCB cells in 2-week cultures to engraft the BM of NOD/SCID mice. Stromal support, or complementation of the medium with SCF + IL6, did not significantly improve the in vivo engraftment potential. If the SRA and CAFC week 6 assays are accepted as tentative estimates of in vivo engrafting stem cells in humans, our findings may assist in the preparation of UCB grafts to meet the requirements for improved repopulation in the clinical setting.","['Kusadasi, N', 'van Soest, P L', 'Mayen, A E', 'Koevoet, J L', 'Ploemacher, R E']","['Kusadasi N', 'van Soest PL', 'Mayen AE', 'Koevoet JL', 'Ploemacher RE']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Membrane Proteins/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/cytology', 'Thrombopoietin/pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401917 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Nov;14(11):1944-53. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401917.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

A case control study of the International BFM study group.,1939-43,"The medium-risk B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) accounts for 50-60% of total childhood ALL and comprises the largest number of relapses still unpredictable with diagnostic criteria. To evaluate the prognostic impact of minimal residual disease (MRD) in this specific group, a case control study was performed in patients classified and treated as medium (or intermediate)-risk according to the criteria of national studies (ALL-BFM 90, DCLSG protocol ALL-8, AIEOP-ALL 91), which includes a good day 7 treatment response. Standardized polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of patient-specific immunoglobulin and T cell receptor gene (TCR) rearrangements were used as targets for semi-quantitative estimation of MRD levels: > or =10(-2), 10(-3), < or =10(-4). Twenty-nine relapsing ALL patients were matched with the same number of controls by using white blood cell count (WBC), age, sex, and time in first complete remission, as matching factors. MRD was evaluated at time-point 1 (end of protocol Ia of induction treatment, ie 6 weeks from diagnosis) and time-point 2 (before consolidation treatment, ie 3 months from diagnosis). MRD-based high risk patients (> or =10(-3) at both time-points) were more frequently present in the relapsed cases than in controls (14 vs 2), while MRD-based low risk patients (MRD negative at both time-points) (1 vs 18) showed the opposite distribution. MRD-based high risk cases experienced a significantly higher relapse rate than all other patients, according to the estimated seven-fold increase in the odds of failure, and a much higher rate than MRD-based low risk patients (OR = 35.7; P= 0.003). Using the Cox model, the prediction of the relapse-free interval at 4 years was 44.7%, 76.4% and 97.7% according to the different MRD categories. MRD-based risk group classification demonstrate their clinical relevance within the medium-risk B cell precursor ALL which account for the largest number of unpredictable relapses, despite the current knowledge about clinical and biological characteristics at diagnosis. Therefore, MRD detection during the first 3 months of follow-up can provide the tools to target more intensive therapy to those patients at true risk of relapse.","['Biondi, A', 'Valsecchi, M G', 'Seriu, T', ""D'Aniello, E"", 'Willemse, M J', 'Fasching, K', 'Pannunzio, A', 'Gadner, H', 'Schrappe, M', 'Kamps, W A', 'Bartram, C R', 'van Dongen, J J', 'Panzer-Grumayer, E R']","['Biondi A', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Seriu T', ""D'Aniello E"", 'Willemse MJ', 'Fasching K', 'Pannunzio A', 'Gadner H', 'Schrappe M', 'Kamps WA', 'Bartram CR', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Panzer-Grumayer ER']","['Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Ospedale S Gerardo, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401922 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Nov;14(11):1939-43. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401922.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytokine-dependent murine myeloid FDC-P1 and human erythroleukemic TF-1 cell lines were transformed to grow in response to deregulated Raf expression in the absence of exogenous cytokines. The conditionally active Raf proteins were regulated by beta-estradiol as cDNAs containing the Raf catalytic, but lacking negative-regulatory domains, were ligated to the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor (deltaRaf:ER). Continuous deltaRaf expression prevented apoptosis in the absence of exogenous cytokines and altered the morphology of the FD/deltaRaf:ER cells as they grew in large aggregated masses (>100 cells) whereas the parental cytokine-dependent FDC-P1 cells grew in smaller grape-like clusters (< 10 cells). FD/deltaRaf-1:ER cells growing in response to Raf activation displayed decreased levels of the Mac-2 and Mac-3 molecules on their cell surface. In contrast, when these cells were cultured in IL-3, higher levels of these adhesion molecules were detected. Expression of activated Raf oncoproteins also abrogated cytokine dependency and prevented apoptosis of TF-1 cells. Moreover, the differentiation status of these Raf-responsive cells was more immature upon Raf activation as culture with the differentiation-inducing agent phorbol 12 myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and beta-estradiol resulted in decreased levels of the CD11b and CD18 integrin molecules on the cell surface. In contrast when the Raf-responsive cells were induced to differentiate with PMA and GM-CSF, in the absence of deltaRaf:ER activation, increased levels of the CD11b and CD18 molecules were detected. Retinoic acid (RA) inhibited 3H-thymidine incorporation in response to GM-CSF. Interestingly, Raf activation counterbalanced the inhibition of DNA synthesis caused by RA but not PMA. Thus deregulated Raf expression can alter cytokine dependency, integrin expression and the stage of differentiation.

Although drug-resistance is known to be induced by the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) encoded by the MDR-1 gene, little is known about the mechanisms regulating this gene. Herein, we studied the DNA methylation patterns at the enhancer and repressor binding sites of the MDR-1 gene using the human erythroleukemia cell line K562 and its multidrug resistant derivative K562/ADM (adriamycin). Direct DNA sequence analysis demonstrated methylation to be present at the repressor site (minus 110 GC-box) of the MDR-1 gene in K562/ADM cells, but not in parental K562 cells. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) analysis yielded similar results. Treatment of K562/ADM cells with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine; DAC), an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, caused demethylation of the repressor binding site of MDR-1 gene, as assessed by MSP, and also decreased P-gp expression, as assessed by flow cytometric and Northern blot analysis. Although it is generally accepted that DAC upregulates gene expression by demethylating the activator binding sites, our present results suggest that DAC induces down-regulation of P-gp expression as a result of demethylation at the repressor binding site in K562/ADM cells. In this regard, methylation-dependent regulation of the MDR-1 gene in K562/ADM cells is unique.","['Ando, T', 'Nishimura, M', 'Oka, Y']","['Ando T', 'Nishimura M', 'Oka Y']","['The Third Department of Internal Medicine, Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*biosynthesis', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites/drug effects', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry', 'Decitabine', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', '*Genes, MDR', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401914 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Nov;14(11):1915-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401914.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

A decrease in translation rates and concomitant regulation of two repressors of translation initiation, 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 (eIF4E-binding proteins 1 and 2), occur in cells induced to differentiate along the monocytic/macrophage pathway or along the granulocytic pathway. Induction of HL-60 and U-937 cell differentiation into monocytes/macrophages results in a dephosphorylation and consequent activation of 4E-BP1. In contrast, following treatment of HL-60 cells with retinoic acid (RA) which results in a granulocytic differentiation of these cells, 4E-BP1 protein expression is decreased whereas 4E-BP2 protein expression is strongly increased. In this study, we further investigated the regulation of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 in the RA-induced differentiation process using the NB4 promyelocytic cell line and the RA maturation-resistant NB4 subclones, NB4-R1 and NB4-R2. RA treatment resulted in a decrease in 4E-BP1 protein and mRNA expression and concomitant increase in 4E-BP2 protein expression, in NB4 cells, but not in NB4-R1 and NB4-R2 cells. The increase in 4E-BP2 protein expression was not correlated to an increase in 4E-BP2 mRNA level suggesting a post-transcriptional regulation of 4E-BP2 expression. In RA-primed cells, cAMP induce maturation of NB4-R1, but not NB4-R2 cells. cAMP treatment resulted in a down-regulation of 4E-BP1 protein and mRNA expression in RA-primed NB4-R1, but not NB4-R2 cells. However, 4E-BP2 expression was not modified in both cell types following cAMP treatment. This indicates that 4E-BP1 down-regulation is associated with granulocytic maturation, whereas post-transcriptional regulation of 4E-BP2 expression is associated with the early action of RA.","['Grolleau, A', 'Wietzerbin, J', 'Beretta, L']","['Grolleau A', 'Wietzerbin J', 'Beretta L']","['INSERM U.365, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Eukaryotic Initiation Factors', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Granulocytes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Repressor Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401904 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Nov;14(11):1909-14. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401904.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (EIF4EBP1 protein, human)', '0 (EIF4EBP2 protein, human)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Initiation Factors)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', ""41941-66-6 (8-((4-chlorophenyl)thio)cyclic-3',5'-AMP)"", '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we analyzed the subcellular localization of conditionally expressed MLL3AT in both U937 and HeLa cell lines. Immunofluorescence staining, confocal laser scanning microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy indicated that MLL3AT, like endogenous MLL, localized in the nucleoplasm in a punctate pattern of distribution, including regions attached to the nuclear envelope and the periphery of the nucleolus. We found that MLL3AT and endogenous MLL were present in interphase nuclear matrices and colocalized with topoisomerase II to mitotic chromosomal scaffolds. Nucleoplasm and nucleolar localization was observed even for MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF4 conditionally expressed chimeric proteins, suggesting a common target conferred by the amino terminus of MLL to many if not all the chimeric MLL proteins.

However, we have recently demonstrated that Bcr can also associate with condensed chromatin. Since two major Bcr proteins have been characterized (p160Bcr and p130Bcr), we sought to determine if different forms of Bcr localized to the nucleus vs the cytoplasm. Metabolic labeling and Western blotting experiments were performed using nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of three human Philadelphia-negative leukemia/lymphoma cell lines (KG-1, HL-60, and Jurkat). Both methodologies showed that p160Bcr and p130Bcr localized to the cytoplasm, but the p130 form predominated in the nucleus.

We also show that when newborn Evi1 transgenic mice of these two lines were infected with Cas-Br-M MuLV, tumor incidence was greatly enhanced in comparison with nontransgenic littermates, indicating an increased susceptibility for leukemia development. Interestingly, analysis of a third founder line revealed that all male progeny consistently displayed severely impaired erythropoiesis with major defects in the bone marrow, spleen and peripheral blood.

We recently cloned a new cDNA, BP1, which is a member of the homeobox gene family. BP1 expression was investigated in bone marrow samples from acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute T cell lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and pre-B cell ALL. Expression levels of two apparent isoforms of BP1, DLX7 and DLX4, were measured in the same samples. They are weakly if at all detectable in normal bone marrow, PHA-stimulated T cells or B cells. BP1 RNA was highly expressed in 63% of AML cases, including 81% of the pediatric and 47% of the adult cases, and in 32% of T-ALL cases, but was not found in any of the pre-B ALL cases. Coexpression of BP1, DLX7 and DLX4 occurred in a significant number of leukemias. Our data, including co-expression of BP1 with c-myb and GATA-1, markers of early progenitors, suggest that BP1 expression occurs in primitive cells in AML. Analysis of CD34+ and CD34- normal bone marrow cells revealed BP1 is expressed in CD34- cells and virtually extinguished in CD34+ cells. Ectopic expression of BP1 in the leukemia cell line K562 increased clonogenicity, consistent with a role for BP1 in leukemogenesis. The presence of BP1 RNA in leukemic blasts may therefore be a molecular marker for primitive cells and/or may indicate that BP1 is an important upstream factor in an oncogenic pathway.","['Haga, S B', 'Fu, S', 'Karp, J E', 'Ross, D D', 'Williams, D M', 'Hankins, W D', 'Behm, F', 'Ruscetti, F W', 'Chang, M', 'Smith, B D', 'Becton, D', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Berg, P E']","['Haga SB', 'Fu S', 'Karp JE', 'Ross DD', 'Williams DM', 'Hankins WD', 'Behm F', 'Ruscetti FW', 'Chang M', 'Smith BD', 'Becton D', 'Raimondi SC', 'Berg PE']","['Division of Human Genetics, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Age Factors', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/cytology', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/isolation & purification', '*Oncogene Proteins', 'Protein Isoforms/biosynthesis/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401912 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Nov;14(11):1867-75. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401912.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DLX4 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Dlx4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,"['5P30CA06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK53533/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,['GENBANK/AF254115'],,,,,,

Several reports have suggested that AML-TLD is a subtype of de novo AML in adults and has a poor clinical outcome when treated by conventional chemotherapy. It is not certain whether allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) brings a favorable outcome for AML-TLD. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of allogeneic BMT for AML-TLD, we investigated the clinical data and outcomes of conventional chemotherapy and allogeneic BMT for 118 patients with de novo AML. These patients were registered consecutively for the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group (JALSG) protocols at our institutes. We treated 28 AML-TLD patients and 90 AML-nonTLD patients with conventional chemotherapeutic protocols. AML-TLD patients did not have a significantly different complete remission (CR) rate (75.0% and 88.4% P = 0.1234), but had a significantly higher relapse rate than AML-nonTLD patients (94.1% and 49.3%, P= 0.0007). The outcome of chemotherapy for AML-TLD was significantly worse than that for AML-nonTLD. The overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 6 years were 9.4% and 0% in AML-TLD group, and 51.9% (P= 0.0017) and 46.3% (P< 0.0001) in AML-nonTLD group, respectively. Meanwhile, among the patients who underwent allogeneic BMT, five of eight AML-TLD patients and eight of 14 AML-nonTLD patients were alive, and three and five patients survived more than 3 years, respectively. These results suggest that allogeneic BMT can improve the outcome for AML-TLD, which is poor when conventional chemotherapy is given alone. Allogeneic BMT before relapse may be the best therapeutic strategy for AML-TLD patients under 50 years of age if a donor is available.","['Taguchi, J', 'Miyazaki, Y', 'Yoshida, S', 'Fukushima, T', 'Moriuchi, Y', 'Jinnai, I', 'Matsuo, T', 'Kuriyama, K', 'Tomonaga, M']","['Taguchi J', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Yoshida S', 'Fukushima T', 'Moriuchi Y', 'Jinnai I', 'Matsuo T', 'Kuriyama K', 'Tomonaga M']","['Department of Hematology and Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/drug therapy/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning', '*Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",,2000/11/09 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/09 11:00'],"['2000/11/09 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/09 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401924 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Nov;14(11):1861-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401924.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9YVR68W306 (enocitabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results show that positive staining with PG-M1, but not KP1, suggests monocytic differentiation of myeloid cells in GS and correlates with the monocytic differentiation of blasts in the bone marrow. Expression of CD56 is frequent in GS, especially when the marrow blasts have monocytic differentiation, and should not be interpreted as a primary natural-killer cell process.

METHODS: A prospective observational survey involving 120 consecutive episodes of febrile neutropenia during 1 year was carried out. These episodes were observed in 630 patients discharged with diagnoses of leukemia or lymphoma, or after bone-marrow transplantation. RESULTS: At least one pathogen was isolated in 42 of 120 episodes (35%), and was present in 39 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (43%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (23%), and in patients who underwent bone-marrow transplantation (20%). Primary bacteremia was the most frequent cause of fever (24 episodes, 57%), followed by intravascular device-related infections (5 episodes, 17%), and soft-tissue infections (5 episodes, 15%). Escherichia coli (33%) was the most frequently isolated agent of primary bacteremia, followed by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (29%), and Klebsiella oxytoca (16%). Fungal infection was responsible for five events (4%): two episodes of pneumonia (Penicillium marneffei and Aspergillus fumigatus, one event each); two cases of fungemia, one due to Candida tropicalis and one to Rhodotorula gluttinis, and one cryptococcal meningitis event. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation rate, approximately 30%, was in accordance with previous reports; similar percentages of Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates were found. A remarkably low rate of viridans group streptococci and fungal agents was observed, despite the fact that neutropenia is the main risk factor for infection due to these agents. Studies reporting local microbiological findings are necessary because they support an antibiotic choice for prophylaxis or therapy more accurately than reports from other areas.","['Gaytan-Martinez, J', 'Mateos-Garcia, E', 'Sanchez-Cortes, E', 'Gonzalez-Llaven, J', 'Casanova-Cardiel, L J', 'Fuentes-Allen, J L']","['Gaytan-Martinez J', 'Mateos-Garcia E', 'Sanchez-Cortes E', 'Gonzalez-Llaven J', 'Casanova-Cardiel LJ', 'Fuentes-Allen JL']","['Departamento de Infectologia, Hospital de Infectologia, Mexico, D.

We show that IFN-gamma down-regulates intracellular and surface levels of gp70 protein resulting in a reduced lysis by CTL, which is restored by pulsing IFN-gamma-treated CT26 with the L(d)-restricted immunodominant AH1 epitope derived from gp70. To investigate the role of CT26 sensitivity to IFN-gamma in vivo, we constructed two variants of CT26, CT26.mugR and CT26.IFN, that are unresponsive to IFN-gamma or express IFN-gamma, respectively. We demonstrate using these variants that tumor responsiveness to IFN-gamma promotes a reduction in tumor immunogenicity in vivo that is correlated with an increased tumor incidence in immune mice. Analysis of the tumors from mice challenged with CT26 or CT26.mugR revealed infiltration of CD8 T cells secreting IFN-gamma. We conclude that IFN-gamma secreted by tumor-infiltrating T cells promotes tumor escape through the down-regulation of the endogenous tumor Ag gp70.

The effect of NOK-1 anti-FasL mAb (mouse IgG1) on the cytotoxicity of FasL VP against various targets was determined. At high concentrations (1-10 microg/ml), NOK-1 inhibited the cytotoxicity. By contrast, NOK-1 in the dose range of 1-100 ng/ml significantly enhanced cytotoxicity against the FcR(+) LB27.4, M59, and LF(+) targets, but not the FcR(-) Jurkat and K31H28 hybridoma T cell targets. The ability to enhance FasL VP-mediated cytotoxicity could be blocked by the FcR-specific mAb 2.4G2. Enhancement was also observed with FcR(+) A20 B lymphoma but not with the FcR(-) A20 variant. Enhancement of FasL VP cytotoxicity was observed with five IgG anti-FasL mAbs, but not with an IgM anti-FasL mAb. Inhibition was observed with high doses of all mAb except the IgG anti-FasL mAb G247-4, which is specific to a segment outside the FasL binding site. Interestingly, under identical conditions but in the presence of 2.4G2, G247-4 inhibited the cytotoxicity of FasL VP. In addition, G247-4 inhibited the FasL VP-mediated killing of FcR(-) Jurkat.

Review the pathophysiology and discuss the clinical and diagnostic features of M3. Describe the variant of M3 (M3m or M3v). Compare conventional chemotherapy with all-trans retinoic acid differentiation therapy (ATRA) in the treatment of M3. Discuss the future direction of differentiation therapy. DATA SOURCES: Current literature. DATA SYNTHESIS: Until the late 1970s, the methods of diagnosis and treatment of AML-M3 were similar to the other forms of acute myelocytic leukemia. One notable difference between M3 and other acute myelocytic leukemias involved the common occurrence of life-threatening consumptive coagulopathies in M3 patients that dramatically affected patient outcomes. In 1977 the method of diagnosis confirmation was altered by the identification of a consistent chromosomal translocation involving the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 17. Reports in the 1970s and 1980s indicated that certain types of active metabolites of vitamin A, collectively termed retinoids, could induce differentiation in a variety of cancer derived cell lines, in vitro. It was shown in the early 1980s that 13-cis-retinoic acid (13cRA) could stimulate differentiation in bone marrow cells collected from patients with various acute leukemias, including M3. The first clinical trial of a retinoid, given as a remission induction therapeutic regimen, involved all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) administered to M3 patients in 1988. Since then, ATRA therapy has been shown to reduce tumor burden by stimulating differentiation of the leukemic cells, induce long-term clinical remission when administered in conjunction with chemotherapy, and lower the incidence of consumptive coagulopathies in patients with AML-M3. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis and treatment of AML-M3 has improved dramatically in the past decade, which has greatly enhanced the prognosis of patients with this disease. First remission rates have increased to greater than 85% world wide, the incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) has declined dramatically, and 60% to 70% of patients with AML-M3 have achieved long term survival and are potentially cured.","['Randolph, T R']",['Randolph TR'],"['Department of Clinical Laboratory Science, School of Allied Health Professions, Saint Louis University Health Sciences Center, St. Louis, MO 63104-1111, USA.

Monoclonal antibodies specific to the malignant cells of question play an essential part in this technique. Various fluorescent dyes and cell panels also must be incorporated into the system. Analysis is done and statistics are plotted on dot plots that can be read by the CLS to give helpful insight into the etiology of disease process.

Describe the molecular defect including the fusion gene and fusion protein produced from the translocation. Discuss the proposed mechanism of leukemogenesis in M3. Discuss the proposed mechanism of differentiation induction stimulated by ATRA therapy. Present the future direction of this and other forms of therapy. DATA SOURCES: Current literature. DATA SYNTHESIS: Acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML-M3) is a form of acute leukemia that presents with a less dramatic leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia than other acute leukemias. However, AML-M3 has a lower first remission rate and a higher morbidity and mortality rate than most of the other acute leukemias when treated with conventional chemotherapy. AML-M3 frequently stimulates a serious concomitant coagulation disorder, disseminated intravascular coagulation, which is a major contributor to the high mortality rate. This and other devastating sequela of M3 have prompted clinicians and investigators to develop methods of improving diagnosis and therapy. In 1977 the method of diagnosis confirmation was improved by the identification of a consistent chromosomal translocation involving the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 17. Identification of the specific molecular lesion that produced the t(15;17) translocation occurred in 1990 and was shown to involve the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene (RAR alpha). Because the RAR alpha gene is mutated in all AML-M3 patients studied so far and because it is often the only mutation identified, several proposed mechanisms of leukemogenesis have evolved. From these discoveries a novel approach to cancer treatment focusing on differentiation therapy instead of traditional chemotherapy emerged. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has been shown to stimulate differentiation of promyelocytes from the malignant clone and has become an important element in the treatment of patients with AML-M3. CONCLUSION: Since the discovery of the t(15;17) translocation, the identification of the fusion gene containing the retinoic acid receptor alpha, and the success of ATRA as a form of differentiation therapy, the diagnosis and treatment of AML-M3 has dramatically improved. In addition, AML-M3 has become a model system used to study the mechanisms that produce uncontrolled growth and lack of differentiation in leukemic cells (leukemogenesis) and the mechanisms of therapeutic reversal of this block in differentiation (differentiation therapy).","['Randolph, T R']",['Randolph TR'],"['Department of Clinical Laboratory Science, School of Allied Health Professions, Saint Louis University Health Sciences Center, MO 63104-1111, USA.

The HOX11 proto-oncogene is frequently activated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). HOX11 activation can occur in the absence of translocation of the gene to the T-cell receptor locus (Salvati et al., 1995), implying that activation mechanisms must be involved other than the juxtaposition of the gene to adjacent enhancing sequences. We tested whether the methylation status of the proximal promoter was correlated with expression status in T-ALL and found that, in all cases, expression of HOX11 in T-ALL was associated with extensive demethylation of the proximal HOX11 promoter, regardless of whether or not translocation was involved. In contrast, cells that did not express HOX11 showed a more methylated pattern of CpG residues in the proximal promoter. Methylation of this sequence in vitro was sufficient to silence the proximal promoter. We propose a model in which the selection of leukemia clones via a pathway involving HOX11 expression requires the demethylation of its promoter as a prerequisite for additional gene activation mechanisms.","['Watt, P M', 'Kumar, R', 'Kees, U R']","['Watt PM', 'Kumar R', 'Kees UR']","['TVW Telethon Institute for Child Health Research and Centre for Child Health Research, University of Western Australia, West Perth, Australia. paulw@ichr.uwa.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Chromosome Mapping', 'CpG Islands/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,2000/11/07 11:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2000/11/07 11:00'],"['2000/11/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/07 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1098-2264(2000)9999:9999<::AID-GCC1050>3.0.CO;2-Y [pii]', '10.1002/1098-2264(2000)9999:9999<::aid-gcc1050>3.0.co;2-y [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2000 Dec;29(4):371-7. doi: 10.1002/1098-2264(2000)9999:9999<::aid-gcc1050>3.0.co;2-y.,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)']",,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

Here we report the cytogenetic analysis of the THP-1 cell line using G-banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and spectral karyotyping (SKY), and the molecular characterization of the MLL-AF9 rearrangement by RT-PCR. The THP-1 cell line was established from the peripheral blood of a 1-year-old boy with acute monocytic leukemia (AML-M5). THP-1 is near-diploid and consists of two related subclones with a number of aberrations, including the t(9;11), associated with AML M5. The use of FISH allowed us to identify and characterize otherwise hidden cytogenetic rearrangements, which include duplication of the 3' portion of MLL in the derivative 9 chromosome and a deletion of the 5' portion of the AF9 gene involved in the translocation. In addition to confirming the FISH results, SKY allowed for a more precise characterization of the karyotype of THP-1 and allowed us to identify other abnormalities in this cell line, including der(1)t(1;12), der(20)t(1;20), deletions 6p, 12p, and 17p, trisomy 8, and monosomy 10. Sequencing of the RT-PCR product showed a direct in-frame fusion product on the derivative chromosome 11 between exon 6 (exon 9) of MLL and exon 5 of AF9, which is most commonly involved in MLL-AF9 translocations. This study demonstrates that combining different techniques to achieve a more precise characterization of the THP-1 cell line provides important information that will be valuable for understanding the critical events required for leukemogenesis.","['Odero, M D', 'Zeleznik-Le, N J', 'Chinwalla, V', 'Rowley, J D']","['Odero MD', 'Zeleznik-Le NJ', 'Chinwalla V', 'Rowley JD']","['University of Navarra, Pamplona, Navarra, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/11/07 11:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2000/11/07 11:00'],"['2000/11/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/07 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1098-2264(2000)9999:9999<::AID-GCC1040>3.0.CO;2-Z [pii]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2000 Dec;29(4):333-8.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,['CA 42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

To date, 12 partner genes for ETV6 have been cloned, and a further 23 chromosomal regions have been described. We previously identified a cryptic t(7;12) with ETV6 involvement in two cases of infant leukemia. The finding of a third case of t(7;12), also in an infant, prompted a more focussed search based on the common features found in these patients and those reported in the literature. The selection criteria were age at diagnosis < 20 months and the presence of +19 and/or +8 in the karyotype; cases with abnormalities of 7q and/or 12p were also considered. FISH studies using whole chromosome paints and probes for the ETV6 gene revealed a t(7;12) in 10 out of 23 cases studied. Seven of these had evidence of ETV6 rearrangement. Of those with ETV6 involvement, six had a 7q36 and one a 7q22 breakpoint. Importantly, in three cases the 7q36 breakpoint was within the same PAC, suggesting the existence of a new nonrandom translocation. However, in at least one patient the 7q36 breakpoint was different. The identification of the 7q partner genes will determine whether it is the disruption of ETV6 alone, or the formation of fusion genes, that is important for leukemogenesis in these patients. As both 7q36 and 7q22 are critical regions of gene loss in del(7q) leukemias, the identification of partner genes from these regions may also be important in understanding the pathogenesis of these diseases.","['Tosi, S', 'Harbott, J', 'Teigler-Schlegel, A', 'Haas, O A', 'Pirc-Danoewinata, H', 'Harrison, C J', 'Biondi, A', 'Cazzaniga, G', 'Kempski, H', 'Scherer, S W', 'Kearney, L']","['Tosi S', 'Harbott J', 'Teigler-Schlegel A', 'Haas OA', 'Pirc-Danoewinata H', 'Harrison CJ', 'Biondi A', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Kempski H', 'Scherer SW', 'Kearney L']","['MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Oxford, U.K. stosi@pinnacle.jr2.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Chromosome Breakage/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",,2000/11/07 11:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2000/11/07 11:00'],"['2000/11/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/07 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1098-2264(2000)9999:9999<::AID-GCC1039>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]', '10.1002/1098-2264(2000)9999:9999<::aid-gcc1039>3.0.co;2-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2000 Dec;29(4):325-32. doi: 10.1002/1098-2264(2000)9999:9999<::aid-gcc1039>3.0.co;2-9.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,45,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

Using a new model of prostate cancer progression that permits comparison of the cellular and molecular properties of increasingly aggressive sublines of simian virus 40 large T-antigen-immortalized human prostate epithelial cells within the same lineage, the role of WT1 in tumorigenesis was investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using RT-PCR and northern blotting, we identified a novel truncated WT1 transcript in these prostate cancer cell lines. This 2.1-kb transcript consisted of the coding region of the zinc-finger domain of WT1, together with a portion of intron 5 at the 5' end of the transcript. Furthermore, two peptides were detected by western blotting using antibodies to epitopes of the COOH terminus of WT1. Using RT-PCR, the 2.1-kb transcript was also detected in leukemia cell line K562, breast cancer cell line MCF7, and blood samples from patients with acute leukemia.

The inhibition was not due to the blockade of LPS cell signaling, as evidenced by the unaffected LPS-induced TF synthesis. We herein determined the mechanism by which 48/80 inhibits the extrinsic coagulation in agonist-challenged THP-1 monocytes. LPS as well as A23187 substantially induced TF activity. TF synthesis was enhanced by LPS but not by A23187. However, the elevated FVII binding to monocytes accompanying the upregulation of factor VII (FVII) activation was uniformly observed in both cases. A 5-min preincubation of the cells with a sheep anti-humanTF antibody (anti-hTF Ab) showed the downregulation of FVII activation, indicating a regulatory role of FVII binding in the modulation of the extrinsic coagulation. The 48/80 blocked FVII binding to monocytes, leading to the preferential inhibition of FVII activation. As the result of the diminished FVIIa formation, monocytic TF-initiated extrinsic coagulation was downregulated in agonist-challenged THP-1 monocytes.","['Chu, A J', 'Wang, Z G', 'Raphael, U O']","['Chu AJ', 'Wang ZG', 'Raphael UO']","['Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA. ad5742@wayne.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cardiovasc Pharmacol,Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology,7902492,IM,"['Blood Coagulation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endotoxins/pharmacology', 'Factor VII/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Thromboplastin/*drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'p-Methoxy-N-methylphenethylamine/*pharmacology']",,2000/11/07 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/11/07 11:00'],"['2000/11/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/07 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00005344-200011000-00015 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cardiovasc Pharmacol. 2000 Nov;36(5):649-55. doi: 10.1097/00005344-200011000-00015.,"['0 (Endotoxins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '4091-50-3 (p-Methoxy-N-methylphenethylamine)', '9001-25-6 (Factor VII)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: To further evaluate the hypothesis connecting the IGF system to this disease, we have examined whether IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 are associated with the two main endogenous risk factors for childhood leukemia, namely gender and birth weight, since boys and heavier newborns are known to be at higher risk. IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were measured under code in the serum of 118 apparently healthy children aged 0-14 years and the values of each of these components were regressed on age, gender and birth weight. Insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF-2), as a dependent variable, and anemia during the corresponding pregnancy, as a predictor variable, were also evaluated for exploratory purposes. RESULTS: In the total data set, IGF-1 was positively associated with birth weight (p = 0.0001), whereas girls had higher levels of IGFBP-3 (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: It appears that the associations of measured components of the IGF system with the examined risk factors for childhood leukemia are largely compatible with those that would have been expected, if this system played a role in the pathogenesis of childhood leukemia.","['Petridou, E', 'Skalkidou, A', 'Dessypris, N', 'Moustaki, M', 'Mantzoros, C', 'Spanos, E', 'Trichopoulos, D']","['Petridou E', 'Skalkidou A', 'Dessypris N', 'Moustaki M', 'Mantzoros C', 'Spanos E', 'Trichopoulos D']","['Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Athens University Medical School, Greece.

Hence, the introduction of such techniques in our clinical laboratory area is becoming more important and indispensable year by year. In addition to morphological and phenotypical analysis, we are now establishing a molecular diagnosis system to support the clinical diagnosis of hematological malignancies. In the present study, we show our ongoing results focusing on adult T-cell leukemia(ATL). Southern blot analysis for detection of the monoclonal integration of HTLV-I proviral genome, a causative agent of ATL, was performed using digoxigenin-labeled probe. The sensitivity was equivalent to RI-labeled probe and was enough for clinical use. We are also doing Southern blot analysis for immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and T-cell receptor beta chain gene as custom service for the diagnosis of B-lymphoproliferative disorders and non-ATL T-lymphoproliferative disorders. We are reporting such results to the clinical site with our interpretation. Since the band size of the HTLV-I provirus obtained by Southern blot differed in each case and was sometimes smaller than the size of the complete virus, we further analyzed the structure of HTLV-I using long and accurate PCR(LA-PCR) and sequence-target-site PCR(STS-PCR). We found that the integrated HTLV-I provirus is divided into two subtypes, complete virus and defective virus. The incidence of defective virus was high in acute-type ATL compared with that in chronic- or lymphoma-type ATL. Although there are several difficulties in introducing such molecular analyses into the clinical laboratory area, we think that the need is increasing together with the progression of gene therapy and evidence-based medicine.","['Sugahara, K', 'Yamada, Y']","['Sugahara K', 'Yamada Y']","['Central Diagnostic Laboratory, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

Immunophenotype was determined by cell surface antigen analysis by laser flow cytometry, FACscan, using various monoclonal antibodies. Information on cytogenetic and molecular genetic characteristics can be also integrated for diagnosis. One hundred fifty patients were diagnosed with acute leukemia, in which 59 cases were ALL and 91 cases were AML. Seventy-four cases were MDS, 76 cases were myeloproliferative disorders, 21 cases were CLL related disorders, 104 patients were malignant lymphoma, and 18 cases were multiple myeloma. The ratio of male to female was 1.7. The probability of diagnostic rate by Immunophenotyping was estimated by Discriminant analysis in 189 patients, using multivariate analysis of immunophenotype compared to morphology. The average probability by immunophenotypic analysis for diagnostic rate was 91.7%, in which the probability for NHL was very high of 97.1%. Thus, morphologic and immunophenotypic analysis is most essential and basic approach in laboratory hematology, from the perspective of rapid and precise diagnostic methods.

Phenotypic analyses using flow cytometry provides useful information regarding the lineage and maturation status of leukemic cells. Chromosomal and genetic data are thought to reflect the biological characteristics of leukemic cells and certain chromosomal abnormalities strongly associated with the good or poor prognoses of AML patients. Genetic analysis of AML blasts became available recently in a clinical field, along with progress in molecular analysis of leukemia but its clinical significance in AML has not been well established yet. When clinicians see patients, the diagnosis of AML is usually made based on the morphological and phenotypic data of peripheral and bone marrow slides, then chromosomal and genetic data are usually received by doctors after the initial therapy.

Cytogenetic analysis and molecular probing of variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) have been used to confirm this unusual event in the few cases so far reported in the literature. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that extensive molecular characterization of leukemic cells at diagnosis and relapse may be necessary to avoid many technical pitfalls possibly leading to an erroneous diagnosis of leukemia relapse in donor cells after allogeneic transplantation. DESIGN AND METHODS: We report the case of a 49- year old man who received an allogeneic transplantation from his HLA-identical sister because of BCR-ABL+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). After having achieved complete hematologic and molecular remission, two years later an overt leukemia relapse occurred with cytogenetic findings suggesting a leukemia relapse in donor cells. The donor or patient origin of leukemic cells at relapse was further investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) karyotyping, reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of BCR-ABL chimeric transcripts, PCR amplification of several VNTRs and the Y chromosome-specific DYS14 sequence and finally by amplification, cloning and sequencing of the CDRIII region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene. RESULTS: At the time of relapse, conventional and FISH karyotyping revealed the presence of a Phl+ chromosome and a female karyotype in all the 25 metaphases analyzed and PCR amplification of the Y chromosome-specific DYS14 sequence was negative. Moreover, the molecular evaluation of hematopoietic chimerism performed by the NZ-22 VNTR allowed us to demonstrate that at the time of relapse, a consistent proportion of hematopoietic cells was of donor origin. However, the molecular cloning and sequencing of the CDRIII region of the immunoglobuin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement in leukemic blasts at diagnosis and relapse demonstrated their identity thus formally proving the patient origin of both leukemic clones. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: While the simplest interpretation of the apparent female karyotype at relapse is the consequence of a loss of the Y chromosome which in leukemic blasts took place along with duplication of an X-chromosome, this case strongly emphasizes the need for accurate and extensive molecular characterization to prove the donor origin of a leukemia relapse after allogeneic transplantation.","['Spinelli, O', 'Giussani, U', 'Borleri, G', 'Lazzari, M', 'Michelato, A', 'Dotti, G', 'Barbui, T', 'Rambaldi, A']","['Spinelli O', 'Giussani U', 'Borleri G', 'Lazzari M', 'Michelato A', 'Dotti G', 'Barbui T', 'Rambaldi A']","['Divisione di Ematologia e Centro Trasfusionale, Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology/pathology', 'Nuclear Family', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2000/11/07 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/11/07 11:00'],"['2000/11/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/07 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 Nov;85(11):1153-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A recent histologic study has shown that CD23 is expressed more strongly in the proliferating centers of the lymph nodes, where the large prolymphocytoid cells are located. The aim of our study was to quantify the expression of CD23 and CD21 in small and prolymphocytoid cells from patients with CLL and B-cell lymphomas, and correlate this expression with clinical parameters. DESIGN AND METHODS: Using quantitative flow cyto-metry we analyzed the antigen density of CD23 and CD21 in: 1) 101 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 84 typical, 14 with increased prolymphocytes (CLL/PL) and 3 atypical, 2) 15 cases of CD23 positive B-cell lymphoma with circulating lymphoma cells and 3) 8 normal subjects. The results were correlated with morphology and clinical staging. RESULTS: Cells from CLL and CLL/PL have a significantly higher number of CD23 molecules than normal and lymphoma B-cells (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). Differences were not significant for CD21. CLL and CLL/PL cases had similar values of CD23 and CD21 molecules, but analysis at a single level showed that prolymphocytes in typical CLL and CLL/PL expressed significantly higher CD23 (p=0.001, p=0.006) and CD21 (p=0.001, p=0.001) than small lymphocytes. There was no correlation between CD23 or CD21 antigen density and clinical stages although there was a trend for a brighter CD23 in stage C patients. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Since interaction between CD23 and CD21 is important for B-cell activation, proliferation and tumor formation, findings that both molecules are upregulated in prolymphocytes suggest that this is the proliferating cell component in CLL and underline the association between progression and increased prolymphocytes in typical CLL and CLL/PL.","['Lopez-Matas, M', 'Rodriguez-Justo, M', 'Morilla, R', 'Catovsky, D', 'Matutes, E']","['Lopez-Matas M', 'Rodriguez-Justo M', 'Morilla R', 'Catovsky D', 'Matutes E']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Royal Marsden NHS Trust, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Complement 3d/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",,2000/11/07 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/11/07 11:00'],"['2000/11/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/07 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 Nov;85(11):1140-5.,"['0 (Receptors, Complement 3d)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Fludarabine was given for 5 consecutive days at the dose of 25 mg/m2/day in a 30 min infusion. Treatment was repeated every 28 days for a maximum of 6 courses.E RESULTS. Nineteen (26%) patients achieved a complete response (CR) and 20 (27%) patients had a partial response (PR), giving an overall response rate of 53%. The median overall survival was 68 months, and there was a strong negative correlation with the number of previous treatments. The median time to progression was 18 months for patients who achieved a CR and 12 months for those with a PR. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained with fludarabine alone in this subset of CLL patients indicate the existence of a conspicuous disease-free survival period. This time window could be used to consolidate the initial response with either biological approaches or high-dose therapeutic strategies such as autologous bone marrow transplantation, with the aim of eventual eradication of the disease.","['Zinzani, P L', 'Bendandi, M', 'Magagnoli, M', 'Albertini, P', 'Rondelli, D', 'Stefoni, V', 'Tani, M', 'Tura, S']","['Zinzani PL', 'Bendandi M', 'Magagnoli M', 'Albertini P', 'Rondelli D', 'Stefoni V', 'Tani M', 'Tura S']","['Istituto di Ematologia e Oncologia Medica ""Seragnoli"", Policlinico S.

Tax activation of IKK requires physical interaction of this viral protein with the IKK regulatory subunit, IKKgamma. The Tax/IKKgamma interaction allows Tax to engage the IKK catalytic subunits, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, although it remains unclear whether this linker function of IKKgamma is sufficient for supporting the Tax-specific IKK activation. To address this question, we have examined the sequences of IKKgamma required for modulating the Tax/IKK signaling. We demonstrate that when fused to Tax, a small N-terminal fragment of IKKgamma, containing its minimal IKKalpha/beta-binding domain, is sufficient for bringing Tax to and activating the IKK catalytic subunits. Disruption of the IKKalpha/beta-binding activity of this domain abolishes its function in modulating the Tax/IKK signaling. We further demonstrate that direct fusion of Tax to IKKalpha and IKKbeta leads to activation of these kinases. These findings suggest that the IKKgamma-directed Tax/IKK association serves as a molecular trigger for IKK activation.","['Xiao, G', 'Sun, S C']","['Xiao G', 'Sun SC']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, 500 University Drive, Hershey, Pennsylvania, PA 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Subunits', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,2000/11/07 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/07 11:00'],"['2000/11/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/07 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1203894 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Oct 26;19(45):5198-203. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203894.,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",,,,['2R01 CA68471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Although p16(INK4a) and p15(INK4b) are involved in the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, p14(ARF) interacts with the MDM-2 oncoprotein antagonizing its function as a suppressor of p53. The role of deletions of p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF) and p15(INK4b) and expressions of MDM-2 in myeloid leukemias and its influence on prognosis remain unclear. METHODS: The authors analyzed deletions of p16(INK4)/p14(ARF) and p15(INK4b) in 74 adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by Southern blotting. Western blotting was used to determine Rb protein phosphorylation in patients with deletions of p16(INK4)/p14(ARF) and p15(INK4b). Then, they analyzed the levels of MDM-2 protein expression and correlated it with prognosis in an expanded population of 79 adults with AML by immunoblot analysis and solid-phase radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Deletions of p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF) and/or p15(INK4b) occurred in 4 of 74 patients (5%) (hemizygous in 3, homozygous in 1 patient). Although the complete remission (CR) rate was similar (79% vs. 50%; P = 0.187), CR duration (10 vs. 46 weeks; P < 0.001), event free survival rate (EFS; 6 vs. 85 weeks; P < 0.004) and overall survival rate (11 vs. 86 weeks; P = 0.001) were significantly shorter in patients with deletions of p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF) and/or p15(INK4b). Thirty-seven (47%) of 79 patients studied for MDM-2 showed increased MDM-2 expression. These patients had a significantly shorter EFS rate (50 vs. 64 weeks; P = 0.023) and a trend for shorter CR duration (24 vs. 53 weeks; P = 0.07). Overall survival rate was not significantly different (50 vs. 84 weeks; P = 0.136). CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that 1) deletions of p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF) and/or p15(INK4b) occur with low incidence in patients with AML; 2) patients with deletions of p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF) and/or p15(INK4b) have a significantly shorter CR duration, EFS rate, and overall survival rate than do patients without deletions; (3) overexpression of MDM-2 is common in AML and is associated with shorter CR duration and EFS rate. Mechanisms other than p14(ARF) deletion are responsible for MDM-2 overexpression, and this overexpression may play a role in the biology of the disease.","['Faderl, S', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Estey, E', 'Manshouri, T', 'Chan, C Y', 'Rahman Elsaied, A', 'Kornblau, S M', 'Cortes, J', 'Thomas, D A', 'Pierce, S', 'Keating, M J', 'Estrov, Z', 'Albitar, M']","['Faderl S', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Estey E', 'Manshouri T', 'Chan CY', 'Rahman Elsaied A', 'Kornblau SM', 'Cortes J', 'Thomas DA', 'Pierce S', 'Keating MJ', 'Estrov Z', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, p16', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Prognosis', '*Proteins/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF']",,2000/11/07 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/07 11:00'],"['2000/11/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/07 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0142(20001101)89:9<1976::AID-CNCR14>3.0.CO;2-N [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20001101)89:9<1976::aid-cncr14>3.3.co;2-e [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2000 Nov 1;89(9):1976-82. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20001101)89:9<1976::aid-cncr14>3.3.co;2-e.,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",,,,,['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,

Total AML blast populations, early progenitor (CD34(+)/CD36(-)) cells, and more differentiated (CD34(-)/CD36(+)) cells were treated with the PI3-K inhibitor Ly294002 and p70S6K inhibitor rapamycin. The effects on proliferation, IL-6 protein secretion, and intracellular signaling cascades were determined and compared with normal CD34(+) cells and monocytes. The function of the PI3-K pathway was dependent on the differentiation state of the AML cell population. In immature blasts, the IL-1-induced proliferation was strongly inhibited by Ly294002 and rapamycin, without a distinct effect on IL-6 protein production. In contrast, in mature monocytic blast cells inhibition of the PI3-K signaling route had a stimulatory effect on IL-6 protein secretion. Interestingly, these findings were not specifically linked to the malignant counterpart but were also observed with normal CD34(+) sorted cells vs mature monocytes. Evidence is provided that the Ly294002-induced increase in IL-6 protein secretion is linked to the cAMP dependent signaling pathway and not to changes in the phosphorylation of ERK or p38. However, although the enhanced IL-6 protein secretion is cAMP dependent, it was not found to be mediated by protein kinase A (PKA) or by the GTP-ase Rap1. This study indicates that inhibition of the PI3-K signaling pathway has an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation but a stimulatory effect on IL-6 expression mediated by a cAMP-dependent but PKA-independent route.","['Birkenkamp, K U', 'Esselink, M T', 'Kruijer, W', 'Vellenga, E']","['Birkenkamp KU', 'Esselink MT', 'Kruijer W', 'Vellenga E']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromones/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/11/07 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/07 11:00'],"['2000/11/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/07 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(00)00529-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00529-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 Nov;28(11):1239-49. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00529-4.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we investigated Ikaros isoforms in human non-lymphoid leukemia cell lines and normal granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) and erythroid (BFU-E)-derived colonies. We evaluated Ikaros gene expression by RT-PCR, Southern blotting, sequencing analysis, Northern blotting, and immunoblotting.Ikaros isoforms Ik-1 and Ik-2, 3 were predominantly expressed in human non-lymphoid leukemia cell lines. Ik-4 and Ik-8 were also detectable as a minor population. In contrast to the previous report in mice, multiple Ikaros isoforms were expressed in human CFU-GM and BFU-E-derived colonies, and the dominant-negative isoform Ik-6 was not detectable. We also showed that human Ikaros isoforms contained an additional coding sequence in the N-terminal region, which was highly homologous to the sequence reported in mice. These observations suggest that the Ikaros gene may play some role in the development of human non-lymphoid lineage hematopoiesis.

In this report, we examine changes in gene expression observed between freshly isolated CLL B cells and after maintenance in vitro with and without Fludara. We compare these effects with an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed cell line treated similarly. Kinetic effects of drug treatment on apoptosis and cell division were examined with DNA laddering, radioisotopic labeling, and flow cytometry using the fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and hybridization blots of microarray cDNA analyses were performed to examine gene expression. We demonstrate that many genes, especially cyclin D1, were downregulated after culture of CLL cells. Anti-apoptotic genes BAG-1 and Akt2 were upregulated. The greatest positive effect with Fludara was the upregulation of JNK1. The EBV-transformed cell line was resistant to classic DNA laddering induced with Fludara. Although DNA synthesis was blocked, the EBV-transformed cell line had some ability to recover from treatment following drug washout. CLL cells express cell cycle regulatory genes that are specific for activated cells in the G(1)-S phase of the cell cycle. Growth regulatory signals are lost when the leukemic cells are isolated from the body. Fludara enhances kinetics of apoptosis and induces expression of a gene responsive to stress that regulates expression of a kinase involved in initiation of the apoptotic pathway.","['Plate, J M', 'Petersen, K S', 'Buckingham, L', 'Shahidi, H', 'Schofield, C M']","['Plate JM', 'Petersen KS', 'Buckingham L', 'Shahidi H', 'Schofield CM']","[""Rush Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, Ill 60612, USA. jplate@rush.edu""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,2000/11/07 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/07 11:00'],"['2000/11/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/07 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(00)00536-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00536-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 Nov;28(11):1214-24. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00536-1.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '1X9VK9O1SC (fludarabine phosphate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

At this time, it is important to evaluate their results and to compare the outcome of umbilical cord blood transplants with allogeneic bone marrow transplants. Data have been reported to the Eurocord Registry by multiple transplant centers. Close links have been established with the cord blood banks through Netcord. Bone marrow transplant data have been provided by transplant centers and through the European Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) and International Bone Marrow Transplant Registries (IBMTR). Eurocord has analyzed the outcomes of 527 umbilical cord blood transplants from 121 transplant centers and 29 countries. The donor was related in 138 cases and unrelated in 399 cases. The results showed that survival with umbilical cord blood transplants was comparable to that with related or unrelated bone marrow transplants. Engraftment with cord blood was delayed resulting in an increased incidence of early transplant complications. The incidence of acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease was reduced with cord blood grafts even in HLA-mismatched transplants and in adults.

Previous studies have reported relations of trisomy 15 with low-grade myelodysplasia or a benign age-related phenomenon associated with loss of the Y chromosome. To define the significance of trisomy 15, we conducted a retrospective study of all examples of trisomy 15 accessed in our laboratories. Trisomy 15 was observed as a clonal abnormality (> or =2 cells) in 17 cases and nonclonal (single cell) in 9 cases. The majority of cases (14/17 clonal cases) had a minor clone (5-35% of metaphase cells) of trisomy 15. The minority of cases (3/17) had a major clone (80-95% of metaphase cells) of trisomy 15. Two of these 3 cases were diagnosed as having acute myelocytic leukemia. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) with the use of a chromosome 15-specific alpha-satellite probe was performed on 3 of 17 clonal cases and on 3 of 9 nonclonal cases. FISH results revealed the presence of a minor clone (from 3 to 5 of 700 interphase cells) in 5 of them, 2 of which had trisomy 15 in 20% of metaphase cells. These results may indicate that the 20% of trisomy 15 are very likely an overrepresentation of a very minor clone that could be transitory. In summary, the analysis of our cytogenetic and FISH results revealed the presence of two types of trisomy 15 clones: a minor clone that could be transitory or indolent and a major clone that could be of a neoplastic nature.","['Batanian, J R', 'Slovak, M L', 'Mohamed, A', 'Dobin, S', 'Luthardt, F W', 'Keitges, E A']","['Batanian JR', 'Slovak ML', 'Mohamed A', 'Dobin S', 'Luthardt FW', 'Keitges EA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Health Science Center, Saint Louis University and Pediatrics Research Institute, St. Louis, MO, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/*genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Trisomy']",,2000/11/07 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/07 11:00'],"['2000/11/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/07 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(00)00253-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00253-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2000 Sep;121(2):186-9. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(00)00253-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the cellular level, FA is characterized by spontaneous chromosomal breakage and a unique hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents. Complementation analysis has indicated that at least seven distinct genes are involved in the pathogenesis of FA. Despite the identification of four of these genes (FANCA, FANCC, FANCF and FANCG), the nature of the 'FA pathway' has remained enigmatic, as the FA proteins lack sequence homologies or motifs that could point to a molecular function. To further define this pathway, we studied the subcellular localizations and mutual interactions of the FA proteins, including the recently identified FANCF protein, in human lymphoblasts. FANCF was found predominantly in the nucleus, where it complexes with FANCA, FANCC and FANCG. These interactions were detected in wild-type and FA-D lymphoblasts, but not in lymphoblasts of other FA complementation groups. This implies that each of the FA proteins, except FANCD, is required for these complexes to form. Similarly, we show that the interaction between FANCA and FANCC is restricted to wild-type and FA-D cells. Furthermore, we document the subcellular localization of FANCA and the FANCA/FANCG complex in all FA complementation groups. Our results, along with published data, culminate in a model in which a multi-protein FA complex serves a nuclear function to maintain genomic integrity.","['de Winter, J P', 'van der Weel, L', 'de Groot, J', 'Stone, S', 'Waisfisz, Q', 'Arwert, F', 'Scheper, R J', 'Kruyt, F A', 'Hoatlin, M E', 'Joenje, H']","['de Winter JP', 'van der Weel L', 'de Groot J', 'Stone S', 'Waisfisz Q', 'Arwert F', 'Scheper RJ', 'Kruyt FA', 'Hoatlin ME', 'Joenje H']","['Department of Clinical Genetics and Human Genetics, Free University Medical Center, Van der Boechorststraat 7, NL-1081 BT Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,IM,"['Antibody Specificity', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Nucleus/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group F Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group G Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Models, Biological', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,2000/11/07 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/07 11:00'],"['2000/11/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/07 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/hmg/9.18.2665 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2000 Nov 1;9(18):2665-74. doi: 10.1093/hmg/9.18.2665.,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FANCA protein, human)', '0 (FANCC protein, human)', '0 (FANCF protein, human)', '0 (FANCG protein, human)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group F Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group G Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)']",,,,['HL56045/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Both molecular events rely on specific protein-DNA interactions that occur within these promoter sequences. Binding of CBFalpha/AML/PEBP2alpha (core binding factor alpha/acute myelogenous leukemia/polyoma enhancer binding protein 2alpha) proteins is a key event in both tissue-specific and developmentally regulated osteocalcin (OC) promoter activity. To address linkage between chromatin organization and transcription factor binding, we reconstituted segments of the rat OC gene proximal promoter into mononucleosomes and studied binding of CBFalpha proteins. We analyzed binding of bacterially produced Cbfalpha2Alpha and Cbfalpha2B, two splice variants of the human CBFalpha2 gene, and determined the effect of heterodimerization with the Cbfbeta subunit on binding activity. Our results indicate that binding of the truncated Cbfalpha2A protein to naked DNA is independent of Cbfbeta whereas Cbfalpha2A binding to nucleosomal DNA was enhanced by Cbfbeta. In contrast, the Cbfalpha2B interaction with either naked or nucleosomal DNA was strongly dependent on heterodimerization with the Cbfbeta subunit. Additionally, our results demonstrate that both Cbfalpha2A alone and Cbfalpha2B complexed with Cbfbeta can interact with nucleosomal DNA only if there is a degree of flexibility in the positioning of the histone octamer on the DNA fragment and exposure of the CBFalpha site. This situation was achieved with a DNA segment of 182 bp from the rat OC promoter that preferentially positions mononucleosomes upstream of the CBFalpha binding site and leaves this element partially exposed. Taken together, these results suggest that nucleosomal translational positioning is a major determinant of the binding of CBFalpha factors to nucleosomal DNA.","['Gutierrez, J', 'Sierra, J', 'Medina, R', 'Puchi, M', 'Imschenetzky, M', 'van Wijnen, A', 'Lian, J', 'Stein, G', 'Stein, J', 'Montecino, M']","['Gutierrez J', 'Sierra J', 'Medina R', 'Puchi M', 'Imschenetzky M', 'van Wijnen A', 'Lian J', 'Stein G', 'Stein J', 'Montecino M']","['Departamento de Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de Concepcion, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion, Chile.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Composition', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Chickens', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits', 'Core Binding Factors', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histones/genetics/*metabolism', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nucleosomes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Osteocalcin/genetics/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",,2000/11/07 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/07 11:00'],"['2000/11/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/07 11:00 [entrez]']","['bi0013896 [pii]', '10.1021/bi0013896 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 2000 Nov 7;39(44):13565-74. doi: 10.1021/bi0013896.,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits)', '0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Runx2 protein, rat)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,"['AR39588/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR45689/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'TW00990/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Their ability to interact with DNA, their cytostatic activity and their liver organotropic properties have been characterized. Two new compounds of this family, with particular structural properties, have been developed. Bamet-UD2 was formed by two ursodeoxycholic acid moieties bound by the carboxylate groups to cisplatin. In contrast, in Bamet-D3, glycine and a polyamine were used as tandem spacer elements to separate a cholic acid moiety from the platinum(II) atom. The aim of this work was to evaluate how these changes affect the ability of these compounds to interact with DNA and reduce tumour cell growth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Drug reactivity with DNA was determined by changes in the electrophoretic mobility of the pUC18 plasmid test and by the ethidium bromide (EthBr) displacement assay. Cytostatic activity was measured against two mouse-derived cell lines from lymphocytic leukemia (L1210) and sarcoma (S-180-II). RESULTS: Bamet-UD2, and more markedly Bamet-D3, induced changes in the electrophoretic mobility of pUC18, suggesting the formation of DNA-drug interactions. Bamet-UD2 displaced EthBr from its binding to DNA. This effect was stronger in the case of Bamet-D3. Scatchard plots revealed that pre-incubation with both Bamet-UD2 and Bamet-D3 decreased the number of DNA sites available and their ability to bind EthBr. In spite of the enhanced DNA-reactivity of Bamet-D3, its ability to reduce tumour cell growth was much weaker than that of Bamet-UD2, which was seen to exert a very strong cytostatic effect. CONCLUSION: Although the distance between the platinum atom and the bile acid moiety affects the in vitro Bamet reactivity with DNA, other factors determine the overall cytostatic activity of these compounds.","['Martinez-Diez, M C', 'Larena, M G', 'Serrano, M A', 'Macias, R I', 'Izco-Basurko, I', 'Marin, J J']","['Martinez-Diez MC', 'Larena MG', 'Serrano MA', 'Macias RI', 'Izco-Basurko I', 'Marin JJ']","['Department of Physiology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bile Acids and Salts/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'DNA/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Ethidium', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Glycocholic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid/*pharmacology']",,2000/11/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/04 11:00'],"['2000/11/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/04 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2000 Sep-Oct;20(5A):3315-21.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bamet-D3)', '0 (Bamet-UD2)', '0 (Bile Acids and Salts)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '724L30Y2QR (Ursodeoxycholic Acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EN464416SI (Ethidium)', 'G59NX3I3RT (Glycocholic Acid)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA is thus identified as a valid target for this new series of drugs particularly toxic to human (HL60) and murine (P388) leukemia cells.","['Benoit, J', 'Routier, S', 'Merour, J Y', 'Colson, P', 'Houssier, C', 'Bailly, C']","['Benoit J', 'Routier S', 'Merour JY', 'Colson P', 'Houssier C', 'Bailly C']","[""Institut de Chimie Organique et Analytique, associe au CNRS, Universite d'Orleans, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cycloheptanes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Conformation']",,2000/11/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/04 11:00'],"['2000/11/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/04 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2000 Sep-Oct;20(5A):3307-14.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cycloheptanes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

But the molecular mechanisms of its concentration-dependent effects are not clearly defined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells were treated with low (5 microM) or high (100 microM) concentrations of this drug and the changes of cell cycle progression, expression of cell cycle regulating genes and cyclin B1-dependent histone H1 kinase activity were studied. RESULTS: In the presence of 5 microM etoposide, K562 cells continued to synthesize DNA and most cells showed progress into G2 phase until 24 hours. In contrast, 100 microM etoposide rapidly inhibited DNA synthesis by around 6 hours and most cells remained in their initial phase, while the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine was partially resumed from 12 hours. The histone H1 kinase activity was only down-regulated in the early phase of 100 microM treated cells. Among the cell cycle controlling genes, c-Myc and P21Cip1/WAF1 showed impressive responses to the two etoposide concentrations. At 100 microM, c-Myc protein rapidly vanished at 3 hours, while p21Cip1/WAF1 was inversely induced from 3 hours. These changes were also observed at 5 microM, but they occurred slowly and weakly. CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate that two concentrations of etoposide functioned as an anticancer agent through modulating the genes related in cell cycle progression. Differing responses of c-Myc and p21Cip1/WAF1 at two concentrations may govern the antiproliferative effects of etoposide.","['Fukumi, S', 'Horiguchi-Yamada, J', 'Iwase, S', 'Ohno, T', 'Yamada, H']","['Fukumi S', 'Horiguchi-Yamada J', 'Iwase S', 'Ohno T', 'Yamada H']","['Department of Oncology, Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cyclin B/metabolism', 'Cyclin B1', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",,2000/11/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/04 11:00'],"['2000/11/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/04 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2000 Sep-Oct;20(5A):3105-10.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (histone H1 kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Some studies show, however, that nearly 50% of patients are fludarabine-resistant from the very onset of therapy. Others relapse after an initial response rarely lasting more than 2 years. For this reason, modulating agents have been considered for use with fludarabine to potentiate fludarabine cytotoxicity and circumvent drug resistance. The chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, Rituximab (IDEC-C2B8), is used to treat patients with low grade and follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Rituximab is known to inhibit the cell progression of tumor B cells and to sensitize them to chemotherapeutic drugs. A slower cell progression may enhance the efficacy of fludarabine incorporation, thus increasing its cytotoxicity. Therefore, the use of fludarabine and Rituximab in combination could potentiate fludarabine cytotoxicity. The methylxanthine, pentoxifylline, disrupts DNA repair mechanisms within a cell by not allowing a cell to arrest at the G2/M checkpoint. By not allowing cells to repair fludarabine DNA incorporation, pentoxifylline was thought to increase fludarabine-induced cytotoxicity in tumor cells. We tested these hypotheses in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analysis of cytotoxicity was performed using the XTT assay on tumor cell lines and patient samples. RESULTS: Tumor cell models, including two B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cell lines and a T-cell leukemia cell line, were shown to respond more effectively to fludarabine therapy in the presence of Rituximab or pentoxifylline. Two freshly derived B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient samples were also seen to exhibit a better response with a combination of fludarabine and pentoxifylline than with either alone. CONCLUSION: This study proves the hypothesis that Rituximab and pentoxifylline may provide a clinical approach to hinder the outgrowth of drug refractory tumor cells and achieve a longer period of remission.","['Alas, S', 'Bonavida, B', 'Emmanouilides, C']","['Alas S', 'Bonavida B', 'Emmanouilides C']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics, University of California, Los Angeles 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Pentoxifylline/*pharmacology', 'Rituximab', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,2000/11/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/04 11:00'],"['2000/11/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/04 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2000 Sep-Oct;20(5A):2961-6.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'SD6QCT3TSU (Pentoxifylline)']",,,,['AI07126-23/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

A 784-bp fragment with 92% sequence homology to the intracisternal A-particle (IAP) element family was isolated from the latter cells. IAP sequences are endogenous, noninfectious retroviral elements that can undergo transpositions and act as mutagens. Expression of IAP transcripts (as detected by the isolated fragment) was 5- to 10-fold higher in T-25-Adh cells than in T-25 cells. IAP RT-PCR cDNA clones derived from the immunogenic T-25-Adh cells, but not from T-25 cells, contain two distinctive motifs: (i) a motif characteristic of IAP elements expressed in lymphoid cells (lymphocyte specific, LS); (ii) a nonapeptide sequence known to stimulate cytotoxic T lymphocytes in a leukemia cell line expressing IAP sequences. In addition, expression of transcripts containing these motifs is enhanced in the immunogenic cells as opposed to the tumorigenic cells. Furthermore, one of the IAP elements (belonging to the LS1 subfamily) is specifically hypomethylated in the DNA of the immunogenic cells. The above-mentioned relationship was strengthened when tumorigenic revertants derived from T-25-Adh cells, as well as independently selected tumorigenic and immunogenic S49 sublines, were studied. In all cases, enhanced immunogenicity was linked to the up-regulation of specific IAP elements. No transpositions of LS1 elements were observed among the different sublines studied. These findings suggest that, in the S49 lymphoma, selectively expressed IAP retroviral elements may function in a tumor suppressive capacity by affecting the immunogenic potential of these cells.","['Braun, E', 'Rorman, E', 'Lueders, K K', 'Bar-Sinai, A', 'Hochman, J']","['Braun E', 'Rorman E', 'Lueders KK', 'Bar-Sinai A', 'Hochman J']","['Department of Cell and Animal Biology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, 91904, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/genetics', '*Genes, Intracisternal A-Particle', '*Genes, gag', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/*virology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/11/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/04 11:00'],"['2000/11/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/04 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/viro.2000.0568 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(00)90568-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Virology. 2000 Nov 10;277(1):136-46. doi: 10.1006/viro.2000.0568.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,

Variant forms of p13(II) were derived from two HTLV-I molecular clones, K30p and K34p, that differ in both virus production and in vivo and in vitro infectivity. Two nucleotide differences between the p13 from K30p (p13K30) and K34p (p13K34) result in a Trp-Arg substitution at amino acid 17 and the truncation of the 25 carboxyl-terminal residues of p13K34. A cDNA library from an HTLV-I-infected rabbit T-cell line was screened with p13K30 and p13K34 as bait. Products of two cDNA clones, C44 and C254, interacted with p13K34 but not with p13K30. Interactions were further confirmed using the GST-fusion protein coprecipitation assay. Sequence analysis of C44 and C254 cDNA clones revealed similarities to members of the nucleoside monophosphate kinase superfamily and actin-binding protein 280, respectively.

FeLV-B, which by itself is poorly infectious, will increase to high titer in the presence of FeLV-A, and is associated with FeLV-related neoplastic disease. Although the participation of FeLV-B in disease progression has not been definitively proven, circumstantial evidence supports the hypothesis that the generation of FeLV-B is linked to disease progression. The present study was designed to evaluate whether increasing the levels of FeLV-B early in FeLV-A infection could result in reduction of the incubation period for development of neoplastic disease. For this study, an isolate of FeLV-B, designated FeLV-1B3, was biologically cloned, partially sequenced, and subgroup typed. In in vivo studies, none of the neonatal cats inoculated with FeLV-1B3 alone converted to viremia positive, and all remained healthy throughout the observation period. All of the kittens inoculated with FeLV-A alone became chronically viremic, and those held for long-term observation all developed either neoplastic disease or anemia. However, kittens inoculated with the combination of FeLV-1B3 and FeLV-A showed attenuated infections whereby the majority of cats failed to develop chronic viremia. The apparent interference of FeLV-A infection by FeLV-B was time and titer dependent. This unexpected result suggests that FeLV-B may act as an attenuated virus, causing inhibition of FeLV-A possibly through an immune-mediated mechanism. Partial support for this view was provided by postmortem examination of cats inoculated with FeLV-1B3 alone. Even though none of these cats became viremic, FeLV antigen was detected as focal infections in select tissues, especially salivary gland epithelium, where enough antigen may be expressed to provide an immunizing dose against gag and pol cross-reacting antigens. This work may also provide another approach to vaccine development based on endogenous retrovirus vector systems.","['Phipps, A J', 'Hayes, K A', 'Al-dubaib, M', 'Roy-Burman, P', 'Mathes, L E']","['Phipps AJ', 'Hayes KA', 'Al-dubaib M', 'Roy-Burman P', 'Mathes LE']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Center for Retrovirus Research, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, 1925 Coffey Road, Columbus, Ohio, 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Cats', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Disease Progression', 'Genes, env', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/classification/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Feline/immunology/pathology/*physiopathology/*virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences']",,2000/11/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/04 11:00'],"['2000/11/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/04 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/viro.2000.0606 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(00)90606-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Virology. 2000 Nov 10;277(1):40-7. doi: 10.1006/viro.2000.0606.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)']",,,,"['P30 CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA51485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,

Mast cell secretion is also triggered by a number of peptides, such as bradykinin and substance P, and may also be involved in the development of inflammatory responses. An example is interstitial cystitis, which is a sterile painful bladder disorder that has been associated with a defective glycosaminoglycan bladder mucosal layer and an increased number of activated mast cells. Pentosanpolysulfate is a synthetic, sulfated polysaccharide that has been approved for the treatment of interstitial cystitis on the premise that it may replenish the defective glycosaminoglycan layer. We hypothesize that pentosanpolysulfate may also have an additional or alternate action on bladder mast cells. We report that pentosanpolysulfate has a powerful dose dependent inhibitory effect on mast cell release of histamine induced by the mast cell secretagogue compound 48/80. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inhibition of mast cell secretion was documented by light and electron microscopy and extended to stimulation by substance P or IgE and antigen. RESULTS: The inhibition was more potent than that seen with the clinically available mast cell stabilizer disodium cromoglycate (cromolyn). Maximal inhibition by pentosanpolysulfate was apparent within 1 minute, was unaffected by the length of pre-incubation and persisted after the drug was washed off. In contrast, the effect of cromolyn was limited by rapid tachyphylaxis. In addition, while cromolyn has no effect on mucosal or rat basophilic leukemia cells, pentosanpolysulfate inhibited histamine secretion from both. Confocal microscopy using a calcium indicator dye showed that pentosanpolysulfate decreased intracellular calcium ion levels. CONCLUSIONS: Pentosanpolysulfate appears to be a potent inhibitor of allergic and nonimmune mast cell stimulation, which is an alternative explanation of its benefit in interstitial cystitis.","['Chiang, G', 'Patra, P', 'Letourneau, R', 'Jeudy, S', 'Boucher, W', 'Green, M', 'Sant, G R', 'Theoharides, T C']","['Chiang G', 'Patra P', 'Letourneau R', 'Jeudy S', 'Boucher W', 'Green M', 'Sant GR', 'Theoharides TC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Urol,The Journal of urology,0376374,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Chondroitin Sulfates/pharmacology', 'Cromolyn Sodium/pharmacology', 'Cystitis, Interstitial/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Immunoglobulin E/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Pentosan Sulfuric Polyester/*pharmacology', 'Peritoneum/cytology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Substance P/pharmacology', 'Urinary Bladder/cytology', 'p-Methoxy-N-methylphenethylamine/pharmacology']",,2000/11/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/04 11:00'],"['2000/11/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/04 11:00 [entrez]']",['S0022-5347(05)66981-9 [pii]'],ppublish,J Urol. 2000 Dec;164(6):2119-25.,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)', '37300-21-3 (Pentosan Sulfuric Polyester)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '4091-50-3 (p-Methoxy-N-methylphenethylamine)', '9007-28-7 (Chondroitin Sulfates)', 'Q2WXR1I0PK (Cromolyn Sodium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies have suggested infusional therapy may be beneficial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This trial used an infusional regimen called I-CHOPE in resistant patients who had previously received only bolus CHOPE or CHOP regimen. Resistance was defined as: a) primary refractory disease, b) progression on therapy, c) partial response, d) complete remission lasting less than one year. Eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of DA-NHL (IWF E-H), no prior irradiation and adequate organ function. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were entered and twenty-nine were eligible. Reasons for ineligibility were incorrect histology (5) and other (3). The median age was 57 years (range 29-81) with 21 males. The performance status scores were: 0 (12 patients); 1 (9 patients); 2 (8 patients). Prior therapy consisted of standard CHOP (26 patients), bolus CHOPE (2 patients), high dose CHOP (1 patient). Therapy consisted of a 120 hour continuous intravenous infusion of doxorubicin 10 mg/m2/day, vincristine 0.28 mg/m2/day (maximum 0.4 mg/day), and etoposide 48 mg/m2/day. Cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 was given as an i.v. bolus day 6 and prednisone was given at 100 mg/day p.o. on days 1-5. G-CSF was allowed for myelosuppression. The overall response rate was 48% (CR 17%; PR 31%). Freedom from progression was 24% at six months and 8% at one year. Survival was 69% at six months and 40% at one year. In an exploratory analysis a prior CR or PR predicted response to I-CHOPE. Twelve of sixteen patients who had a CR/PR on previous therapy responded while two of thirteen who had no prior response, responded to I-CHOPE (P = 0.003).

So far, very little is known about the regulation of the human HLA-G gene. The present study was, thus, designed to investigate the regulation of the human HLA-G promoter. JEG3 choriocarcinoma cells, which express HLA-G endogenously, were used as a model. A 890 bp fragment of the human HLA-G promoter was amplified by nested PCR from genomic DNA, cloned into pCR-Script and, after sequencing, subcloned into pGL3-Luc in front of the luciferase reporter gene. This vector was then used in transient transfection experiments in JEG3 cells. Parallel transfection experiments were performed using an alpha subunit (alphaSU)-Luc reporter plasmid as a control. Using this system, several potential modulating substances were tested in different concentrations and for different periods of time: phorbol ester (TPA), cAMP, IFNgamma, IL-1, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), with only LIF administration resulting in induction of the HLA-G promoter. LIF treatment also resulted in induction of HLA-G mRNA. JEG3 cells are shown to possess LIF receptors. LIF is a pleiotropic cytokine produced at the maternal-fetal interface which has been shown to play an essential role in implantation in mice. LIF is produced in high amounts by the human endometrium and the trophoblast itself, and LIF receptors are present on cytotrophoblast cells. LIF could, thus, play a role in modulating HLA-G production and immune tolerance at the maternal-fetal interface.","['Bamberger, A M', 'Jenatschke, S', 'Schulte, H M', 'Loning, T', 'Bamberger, M C']","['Bamberger AM', 'Jenatschke S', 'Schulte HM', 'Loning T', 'Bamberger MC']","['Institute of Pathology, Dept. of Gynecopathology, University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. bamberger@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Choriocarcinoma/*metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HLA Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'HLA-G Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uterine Neoplasms/*metabolism']",,2000/11/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/04 11:00'],"['2000/11/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/04 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/jcem.85.10.6849 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2000 Oct;85(10):3932-6. doi: 10.1210/jcem.85.10.6849.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-G Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In many cases of acute leukaemia chromosomal aberrations are translocations of transcription factors which change their expression and induce the leukaemic phenotype. These abnormal transcription factors are tumour-specific and can be targets for novel treatments approaches. Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) is a distinct and unique subtype of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) characterised by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17 t(15q22;17q21). The breakpoints of chromosome 15 and 17 are in the PML and RARalpha genes, respectively, forming the fusion PML-RARalpha gene expressed exclusively and universally in APL. The normal RARalpha is an all-trans retinoic acid- (ATRA-)dependent transcription factor involved in the normal differentiation of myeloid cells. The aberrant fusion PML-RARalpha protein remains sensitive to ATRA and underlies the pathogenesis of the APL. ATRA modulation of gene transcription mediated by PML-RARalpha results in a major clinical response. Almost all newly diagnosed APL cases can be induced into complete remission with ATRA with or without chemotherapy by in vivo differentiation of the APL cells. Randomised clinical trials have shown that the most significant effect of ATRA is an additive or synergistic activity with chemotherapy to improve the long-term outcome of the disease. On the other hand, ATRA with or without induction chemotherapy did not increase the complete remission rate compared to chemotherapy alone. In addition, the relapse rate was significantly lower for patients randomised to induction with concurrent ATRA/chemotherapy than with ATRA followed by chemotherapy. Chemotherapy and/or ATRA maintenance may further improve the long-term outcome compared to no maintenance. PML-RARalpha fusion transcripts can be assayed by RT-PCR to identify PCR positive cells during remission, which are highly predictable of a subsequent haematological relapse. The goal of therapy has been modified to induce a molecular remission with a negative PCR to the PML-RARalpha transcript. This is the first example of an effective response to treatment with a ligand binding to a mutated form of its natural transcription factor. The transcription factor mutation, caused by translocation to another gene, underlies the pathogenesis of the disease.","['Douer, D']",['Douer D'],"['Division of Hematology, USC/Norris Cancer Center, 1441 Eastlake Ave. Rm. 3460, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA. douer_d@mikey.hsc.usc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2000/11/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/04 11:00'],"['2000/11/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/04 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1517/13543784.9.2.329 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2000 Feb;9(2):329-46. doi: 10.1517/13543784.9.2.329.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,150,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we report the biological characterization of a truncated Mo-MLV envelope gene, LN11, which is devoid of a signal peptide. Its expression in various cell types, as compared to the control, enabled the transduced cells to assume a more normal phenotype, which is defined by an increase in contact inhibition and factor dependence, as well as reduced tumorigenicity. LN11-transduced fibroblasts exhibited a higher degree of contact inhibition, assumed a more flattened morphology and were more adherent compared to the control. In v-abl transformed hematopoietic cells, expression of LN11 resulted in slower cell growth, which was due to an enhanced dependence on exogenous growth factors. Enforced expression of LN11 also resulted in a slower rate of tumor development and a reduced tumor load.

In the present study we provide evidence that the p38 MAP kinase pathway is activated in a RA-dependent manner in the NB-4, acute pro-myelocytic leukemia, and the MCF-7, breast carcinoma, cell lines. RA treatment of cells induces a time- and dose-dependent phosphorylation of p38, and such phosphorylation results in activation of its catalytic domain. p38 activation is not inducible by RA in a variant NB-4 cell line, NB-4.007/6, which is resistant to the effects of RA, suggesting a role for this pathway in the induction of RA responses. Our data also demonstrate that the small G-protein Rac1 is activated by RA and functions as an upstream regulator of p38 activation, whereas the MAPKAPK-2 serine kinase is a downstream effector for the RA-activated p38. To obtain information on the functional role of the Rac1/p38/MAPKAPK-2 pathway in RA signaling, the effects of pharmacological inhibition of p38 on RA-induced gene transcription and cell differentiation were determined. Our results indicate that treatment of cells with the SB203580 inhibitor does not inhibit RA-dependent gene transcription via retinoic acid response elements or induction of Stat1 protein expression. However, treatment with SB203580 or SB202190 strongly enhances RA-dependent induction of cell differentiation and RA-regulated growth inhibitory responses. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that the Rac1/p38 MAP kinase pathway is activated in a RA-dependent manner and exhibits negative regulatory effects on the induction of differentiation.","['Alsayed, Y', 'Uddin, S', 'Mahmud, N', 'Lekmine, F', 'Kalvakolanu, D V', 'Minucci, S', 'Bokoch, G', 'Platanias, L C']","['Alsayed Y', 'Uddin S', 'Mahmud N', 'Lekmine F', 'Kalvakolanu DV', 'Minucci S', 'Bokoch G', 'Platanias LC']","['Section of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Illinois and West Side Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois 60607, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/*metabolism']",,2000/11/04 00:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2000/11/04 00:00'],"['2000/11/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/04 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M007431200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)46399-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Feb 9;276(6):4012-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M007431200.

The response of eukaryotic cells to ionizing radiation includes apoptosis, a process which requires activation of multiple genes. We sought to determine whether radiation-induced gene expression plays a role in radiation-induced apoptosis. We found Apo2 ligand (Apo2L, also called TRAIL) mRNA induction following gamma-irradiation of Jurkat, MOLT-4, CEM, and PBMC, all human T lineage-derived cells. Increased Apo2L protein levels were found in MOLT-4 and Jurkat cells. Radiation also activated the Apo2L death receptor (DR)5 (also called Apo2, TRAIL-R2, or KILLER) in MOLT-4 cells, which harbor a wild-type p53. We isolated 1152 bp of 5' flanking region of the Apo2L gene and a shorter fragment of 716 bp, both of which showed promoter activity driving the expression of a luciferase reporter gene; however, the response to radiation in MOLT-4 cells was lost when only 430 bp of 5' proximal flanking sequence was maintained. Exogenous Apo2L induced phosphatidylserine exposure on cell membranes, caspase 8 and caspase 3 activation, key markers of apoptosis, confirming that the Apo2L/DR5 pathway is functional in these cells. Bid, a Bcl-2 family protein also known to contribute to receptor-mediated apoptosis, was also activated. To determine whether Apo2L and DR5 were critical for radiation signaling to apoptosis, we stably expressed a dominant negative DR5delta-receptor in Jurkat cells. Cell survival was significantly augmented, indicating that increased Apo2L expression contributed to radiation-induced apoptosis. Clonogenic assays demonstrated that purified, recombinant soluble Apo2L enhanced the lethality of low, therapeutic doses (1-2 Gy) of gamma-irradiation. These data suggest that production of Apo2L may cooperate synergistically with the cytotoxic effect of radiation, and that combinations of Apo2L and radiation may become a powerful tool in clinical therapy.","['Gong, B', 'Almasan, A']","['Gong B', 'Almasan A']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/pathology/radiation effects', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology/*radiation effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology/radiation effects', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",,2000/11/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/04 11:00'],"['2000/11/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/04 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Oct 15;60(20):5754-60.,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,"['CA81504/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA82858/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA081504-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA082858-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

In this study, we have: (a) quantitated the in vitro brain tumor cell lysis; (b) measured the cytokine secretion upon coincubation of TALL-104 cells with brain tumor cells; (c) investigated the effect of dexamethasone on brain tumor cell cytolysis by TALL-104 cells; (d) explored the effects of lethal irradiation and cryopreservation on TALL-104 cell viability and lytic efficacy; and (e) estimated the damage TALL-104 cells induce to murine normal and tumor brain cells and their trafficking patterns in both normal and tumor-bearing rat brain upon intracranial infusion. In vitro coincubation of TALL-104 cells with human brain tumor cells, explants, and cell lines resulted in significant lysis of them, but normal brain cells were spared. Lysis of tumor at 4 h was unaffected by dexamethasone or lethal irradiation. Secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, tumor necrosis factor-beta, IFN-gamma, or granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor upon TALL-104 cell coincubation with brain tumor cells variably occurred without always correlating with lysis. In vivo experiments using irradiated TALL-104 cells, placed at multiple times into normal cannulated rat brain, produced focal sterile abscesses at the instillation site but no widespread allergic encephalitic reaction. Cells morphologically consistent with TALL-104 cells specifically trafficked from the site of instillation through the neuropil, occasionally into the contralateral brain, and egressed at perivascular and leptomeningeal spaces. In vivo experiments with cannulated rats bearing 9L gliosarcoma showed a preferential localization of the TALL-104 cells in tumor compared with normal brain. Taken together, these data support the concept that TALL-104 cells can be used as a novel nontoxic and efficacious paradigm for cellular immunotherapy trials in human primary malignant brain tumors.","['Kruse, C A', 'Visonneau, S', 'Kleinschmidt-DeMasters, B K', 'Gup, C J', 'Gomez, G G', 'Paul, D B', 'Santoli, D']","['Kruse CA', 'Visonneau S', 'Kleinschmidt-DeMasters BK', 'Gup CJ', 'Gomez GG', 'Paul DB', 'Santoli D']","['Department of Immunology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver 80262, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/pharmacology', 'Astrocytes/cytology', 'Brain/cytology/immunology', 'Brain Neoplasms/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Catheterization', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cryopreservation', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Glioblastoma/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Gliosarcoma/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/*immunology/radiation effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/11/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/04 11:00'],"['2000/11/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/04 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Oct 15;60(20):5731-9.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Cytokines)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",,,,"['CA10815-30/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS28905/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Recent studies have indicated that a fraction of B-CLL displays somatically mutated immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (IgV(H)) genes, which suggests an origin from a post-germinal center (GC) B cell. It has been shown that the 5' noncoding region of the BCL-6 proto-oncogene is affected by mutations in normal GC B-lymphocytes and in lymphoid malignancies displaying GC/post-GC phenotype. To further explore the cellular origin of B-CLL, we have analyzed 34 cases for mutations in the BCL-6 5' noncoding region and in the IgV(H) genes. We found somatically mutated IgV(H) genes in 24 (73%) of 33 samples (average frequency, 6.5 x 10(-2)/bp) and BCL-6 mutations in 8 (24%) of 34 cases (average frequency, 0.14 x 10(-2)/bp in the mutated cases). The occurrence of BCL-6 mutations was restricted to those cases displaying IgV(H) mutations. Analysis of BCL-6 protein expression as a marker of GC phenotype showed that, regardless of the presence of IgV(H) or BCL-6 mutations, B-CLLs express BCL-6 at levels clearly below those found in normal or transformed GC B cells. These results indicate that a subset of B-CLL derives from a cell that has been exposed to the somatic hypermutation mechanism and support the hypothesis that BCL-6 mutations result from the same process that targets immunoglobulin genes.","['Pasqualucci, L', 'Neri, A', 'Baldini, L', 'Dalla-Favera, R', 'Migliazza, A']","['Pasqualucci L', 'Neri A', 'Baldini L', 'Dalla-Favera R', 'Migliazza A']","['Institute of Cancer Genetics and Department of Pathology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics']",,2000/11/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/04 11:00'],"['2000/11/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/04 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Oct 15;60(20):5644-8.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,['CA75553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Only hundred years ago human exposure to radiation was limited to electric and magnetic fields arising either from extraterrestrial or terrestrial sources, yet both natural. For the past fifty years there has been large growth of artificial sources of electric and magnetic fields, especially with frequencies of 50 and 60 Hz (power generating and distribution systems). The concern about long-term exposure to artificial fields and possible adverse effects on human health has been entirely justified and led to numerous intensive epidemiological and laboratory studies. Results of several epidemiological studies confirm the connection between exposure to electric and magnetic fields of extremely low frequencies (up to 300 Hz) and increased risk of leukemia and brain tumor in children and adults. In addition, the risk of breast cancer in occupationally exposed population has increased. Laboratory studies on animal models, in vitro systems, and human volunteers did not confirm this connection. There is a growing interest in investigation of other possible adverse health effects such as neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), cardiovascular disorders (arrhythmias and acute myocardial infarction), psychiatric disorders, and electrosensitivity.","['Busljeta, I', 'Gomzi, M', 'Trosic, I']","['Busljeta I', 'Gomzi M', 'Trosic I']","['Institut za medicinska istrazivanja i medicinu rada, Zagreb.

The importance of prothrombin and factor V genetic-molecular alterations in thromboembolic pathology and of the activation of calcineurin phosphatase or other intracellular signal regulator molecules during cardiac insufficiency genesis is also discussed. Particular attention is paid to progress regarding the socially important Alzheimer's syndrome, and the diagnosis of endocrine tumors. Moreover, the authors believe that the identification of new endocrine nuclear receptors, ""orphans"" of hormonal ligands, will open up interesting prospects--even therapeutic--in endocrinology. The authors conclude by reviewing the therapeutic prospects for immunodeficiency syndromes and malignant tumors, offered by new gene therapy methodologies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comparison of the ratio of the quadratic and linear coefficients (in dose) in Japanese atomic bomb survivor cancer incidence data, based on follow-up to 1987 and taking account of random errors in DS86 dose estimates with the same ratio in four datasets of chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes measured in vitro and exposed to 60Co gamma radiation. RESULTS: There are no statistically significant differences between the four in vitro datasets in the ratio of the quadratic to the linear coefficients for dicentrics or chromosome translocations, nor are there indications of differences between this ratio for dicentrics and that for complete chromosome translocations (p > 0.1 in all cases). If the 0-4 Gy dose range is used in the Japanese atomic bomb survivor data, the ratio of the quadratic to the linear coefficients for all solid cancers is 0.06 -1 (95% CI -0.22, 0.67) and so is not significantly different from 0; this ratio is statistically highly inconsistent (p<0.0001) with the analogous ratio estimated for the in vitro chromosome aberration data (4.20 Sv-1; 95% CI 3.06, 6.51). By contrast, there are no statistically significant differences (p=0.42) between the ratio of the quadratic to the linear coefficients for leukaemia incidence in the Japanese cohort, 1.81 Sv-1 (95% CI 0.21, > 1,000), with that for chromosome aberrations in vitro. These results are not markedly changed if the 0-2 Gy dose range is used in the Japanese atomic bomb survivor data. CONCLUSIONS: It is unlikely that in vitro chromosome aberrations could be a correlate for the initiating radiogenic lesions leading to radiation-induced solid cancers. However, taken together with certain other biological information, it may not be unreasonable on this basis to use in vitro chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes as a correlate of the radiogenic lesions leading to radiation-induced leukaemia.","['Little, M P']",['Little MP'],"[""Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Imperial College School of Medicine, St Mary's Campus, London, UK. mark.little@ic.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/genetics', '*Nuclear Warfare']",,2000/11/01 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/01 11:00'],"['2000/11/01 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/01 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09553000050151646 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2000 Oct;76(10):1365-75. doi: 10.1080/09553000050151646.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A dose of 2 Gy IR was selected for further analyses to determine if subsequent exposure to 10nM bryostatin- would overcome the resistance to IR-induced apoptosis conferred by Bcl-2 over expression. METHODS AND RESULTS: Although bryostatin- did not increase IR-induced apoptosis in U937/pCEP4 or U937/Bcl-2 cells, it impaired mitochondrial function and increased the antiproliferative effects of IR in both cell lines. The effects were more pronounced in U937/Bcl-2 cells. Bryostatin-1 also exerted differential effects on cell-cycle distributions of U937 transfectant cells, producing a significant G0/G1 arrest in U937/Bcl-2 cells, while decreasing IR-induced G2/M arrest in U937/pCEP4 cells. Although Bcl-2 over expression attenuated IR-induced apoptosis, clonogenic survival was similar in U937/pCEP4 and U937/Bcl-2 cells following 2 Gy IR treatment. Treatment with 10nM bryostatin-1 after 2 Gy IR further reduced clonogenic survival in both cell lines. Moreover, U937/Bcl-2 cells were more susceptible to the growth-inhibitory effects of IR/bryostatin-1 than U937/pCEP4 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Bryostatin-1 increased the radiosensitivity of U937 transfectant cell lines without enhancing apoptosis; furthermore, U937/Bcl-2 cells were more susceptible to IR/bryostatin-1-mediated antiproliferative effects than their empty-vector counterparts.","['Cartee, L', 'Davis, C', 'Lin, P S', 'Grant, S']","['Cartee L', 'Davis C', 'Lin PS', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*therapeutic use', 'Macrolides', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*therapeutic use', 'U937 Cells']",,2000/11/01 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/01 11:00'],"['2000/11/01 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/01 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09553000050151592 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2000 Oct;76(10):1323-33. doi: 10.1080/09553000050151592.,"['0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)']",,,,"['CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

To test this possibility, we studied the toxicity of para substituted benzyl alcohols on rapidly dividing cancer cells (L1210 leukemia). This system has previously found utility in studying the apparent radical toxicity of a variety of phenols. However, no evidence could be found for an electronic effect and the cellular toxicity was associated primarily with hydrophobicity. Comparison of this quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) with others for the reactions of benzyl alcohols in diverse systems provides insight into mechanisms of action. A QSAR for the interaction of benzyl alcohols with protozoa yields an equation that is dependent on both hydrophobicity and acidity of the OH group versus a mixture of bacteria and fungi, the critical dependence on hydrophobicity prevails with a small dependence on a resonance-stabilized, radical mediated electronic effect. The chloramphenicols provide an instructive example, where the radical mediated electronic effect overshadows the hydrophobic contribution to bacterial toxicity. These various QSAR for benzyl alcohols indicate that mechanisms of growth inhibition in vitro vary depending on cell/organism type, the strength of the bond and lability of the hydrogen, and the strength of the initiating radical reagent.","['Kapur, S', 'Shusterman, A', 'Verma, R P', 'Hansch, C', 'Selassie, C D']","['Kapur S', 'Shusterman A', 'Verma RP', 'Hansch C', 'Selassie CD']","['Department of Chemistry, Pomona College, Claremont, CA 91711, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Chemosphere,Chemosphere,0320657,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzyl Alcohols/*chemistry/*toxicity', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Free Radicals', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', '*Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thermodynamics', 'Toxicity Tests']",,2000/11/01 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/11/01 11:00'],"['2000/11/01 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/01 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0045-6535(00)00019-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0045-6535(00)00019-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemosphere. 2000 Nov;41(10):1643-9. doi: 10.1016/s0045-6535(00)00019-9.,"['0 (Benzyl Alcohols)', '0 (Free Radicals)']",,,,['R01 ES 07595/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Tracheobronchial biopsy and culture of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid revealed Aspergillus tracheobronchitis. Despite mechanical ventilation and antifungal therapy, he succumbed to progressive respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Aspergillus tracheobronchitis should be suspected in heavily immunosuppressed stem cell transplant recipients presenting with recurrent pneumomediastinum and progressive respiratory failure.","['Koh, L P', 'Goh, Y T', 'Linn, Y C', 'Hwang, J', 'Tan, P']","['Koh LP', 'Goh YT', 'Linn YC', 'Hwang J', 'Tan P']","['Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,IM,"['Adult', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', '*Aspergillus fumigatus', 'Biopsy', 'Bronchitis/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/microbiology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Tracheitis/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy']",,2000/11/01 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/11/01 11:00'],"['2000/11/01 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/11/01 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 2000 Jul;29(4):531-3.,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether such patients can safely undergo lumbar puncture (LP) without prophylactic platelet transfusion is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an association exists between thrombocytopenia and LP complications among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective review of the records of 958 consecutive children (median age, 5.5 years) with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were treated at a pediatric cancer center between February 1984 and July 1998. INTERVENTIONS: All patients underwent a diagnostic LP followed by a median of 4 LPs to instill intrathecal chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Serious complications of LP occurring during the remission induction and consolidation treatment periods (when thrombocytopenia is likely to occur), defined as any neurologic, infectious, or hemorrhagic problems related to the procedure, reported by platelet count at the time of the procedure. RESULTS: Of the 5223 LPs evaluated, 29 were performed at platelet counts of 10 x 10(9)/L or less, 170 at platelet counts of 11 to 20 x 10(9)/L, and 742 at platelet counts of 21 to 50 x 10(9)/L. No serious complications were encountered, regardless of the platelet count. The 95% confidence interval for the proportion of serious complications in the 199 patients with platelet counts of 20 x 10(9)/L or less was 0% to 1.75% and that for the 941 patients with platelet counts of 50 x 10(9)/L or less was 0% to 0.37%. CONCLUSIONS: In our study of children undergoing remission induction or consolidation therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, serious complications of LP were not observed, regardless of platelet count. Prophylactic platelet transfusion is not necessary in children with platelet counts higher than 10 x 10(9)/L. Due to the small number of patients in our study with platelet counts of 10 x 10(9)/L or less, conclusions cannot yet be drawn for such patients.

In both cycles, endometrial biopsy, phlebotomy and vaginal sonogram were performed 8-10 days after the urinary LH surge. No significant difference was found between untreated and treated cycles in most measures of endometrial histology or in endometrial expression of beta3 integrin subunit, leukaemia inhibitory factor, glycodelin, or progesterone receptors assessed by immunohistochemical techniques. Five statistically significant changes were noted in treated cycles: a reduction in endometrial MUC-1 expression, an increase in endometrial oestrogen receptor, lower luteal phase serum oestrogen concentration, reduced endometrial thickness, and greater proportion of glandular supranuclear vacuoles.

Recent studies have shown a deficient expression of this gene in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, treatment with retinoids was able to upregulate JEM-1 mRNA in maturing NB4 leukemia cells. Here, we report the characterization of the structural organization of JEM-1. By hybridization screening of a human genomic library derived from blood mononuclear cells, five overlapping genomic DNA clones were isolated. These clones extend over 34 kb of the human genome and comprise the complete JEM-1 gene and a 4-kb 5'flanking region. Determination of the exon-intron structure of Jem-1 revealed seven exons whose junctions with introns exhibited typical splice sequences. A shorter transcript (Jem-1s, 1.3 kb) generated by exon 3 extension and polyadenylation was identified. Its translation generated a 23-kDa protein that exhibited a cytoplasmic localization. 5'RACE-PCR identified a major transcription start site (TSS) located at 403 nt upstream of the ATG. Computer analysis of the 1. 8-kb 5'flanking region showed that it lacks a TATA box, Inr motifs or DPE motifs, but it contains a typical CCAAT box located 95 bp upstream of the TSS. Sequencing also revealed potential cis-acting elements for multiple transcription regulators including Sp1, GATA, C/EBP, AP-1, and Pu1. No retinoic acid receptor elements or retinoic X receptor elements were detected. This 1.8-kb DNA sequence showed a strong constitutive promoter activity determined by a luciferase-reporter gene assay in transiently transfected HeLa cells. Retinoids further increased luciferase expression 2.7-fold. We demonstrated that the 1-kb distal sequence contains yet unidentified elements reducing constitutive transcription. Thus, the maximal constitutive promoter activity was assigned to a -432 + 101 region overlapping the TSS. These data support the idea of a constitutive expression of JEM-1, but a negative regulation in APL released by retinoids.","['Tong, J H', 'Fant, X', 'Benoit, G', 'Chen, S J', 'Chen, Z', 'Lanotte, M']","['Tong JH', 'Fant X', 'Benoit G', 'Chen SJ', 'Chen Z', 'Lanotte M']","['Centre G.

Comparison with rat.,781-8,"Cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes have been used extensively to study cellular and molecular mechanisms of cardiac hypertrophy. However, there are only a few studies in cultured mouse myocytes despite the increasing use of genetically engineered mouse models of cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, we characterized hypertrophic responses in low-density, serum-free cultures of neonatal mouse cardiac myocytes and compared them with rat myocytes. In mouse myocyte cultures, triiodothyronine (T3), norepinephrine (NE) through a beta-adrenergic receptor, and leukemia inhibitory factor induced hypertrophy by a 20% to 30% increase in [(3)H]phenylalanine-labeled protein content. T3 and NE also increased alpha-myosin heavy chain (MyHC) mRNA and reduced beta-MyHC. In contrast, hypertrophic stimuli in rat myocytes, including alpha(1)-adrenergic agonists, endothelin-1, prostaglandin F(2alpha), interleukin 1beta, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), had no effect on mouse myocyte protein content. In further contrast with the rat, none of these agents increased atrial natriuretic factor or beta-MyHC mRNAs. Acute PMA signaling was intact by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and immediate-early gene (fos/jun) activation. Remarkably, mouse but not rat myocytes had hypertrophy in the absence of added growth factors, with increases in cell area, protein content, and the mRNAs for atrial natriuretic factor and beta-MyHC. We conclude that mouse myocytes have a unique autonomous hypertrophy. On this background, T3, NE, and leukemia inhibitory factor activate hypertrophy with different mRNA phenotypes, but certain Gq- and protein kinase C-coupled agonists do not.","['Deng, X F', 'Rokosh, D G', 'Simpson, P C']","['Deng XF', 'Rokosh DG', 'Simpson PC']","['VA Medical Center and the Cardiovascular Research Institute and Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,IM,"['Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Atrial Natriuretic Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dinoprost/pharmacology', 'Endothelin-1/pharmacology', 'Fetus', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Heart/*drug effects/embryology', 'Hypertrophy', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Phase-Contrast', 'Models, Animal', 'Myocardium/*pathology', 'Myosin Heavy Chains/genetics/metabolism', 'Myosins/analysis', 'Norepinephrine/pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Phenylalanine/analysis', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Triiodothyronine/pharmacology']",,2000/10/31 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/31 11:00'],"['2000/10/31 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/31 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/01.res.87.9.781 [doi]'],ppublish,Circ Res. 2000 Oct 27;87(9):781-8. doi: 10.1161/01.res.87.9.781.,"['0 (Adrenergic alpha-Agonists)', '0 (Endothelin-1)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '06LU7C9H1V (Triiodothyronine)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', '85637-73-6 (Atrial Natriuretic Factor)', 'B7IN85G1HY (Dinoprost)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosin Heavy Chains)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'X4W3ENH1CV (Norepinephrine)']",,,,['R01 HL031113/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

The IL-11 mRNA increased after nerve damage and immediately returned to control levels. The OSM mRNA expression increased rapidly after nerve injury and relatively high expressions were maintained for at least 14 days. The CT-1 mRNA was not expressed in any time before and after the injury. Interestingly, IL-11Ralpha was expressed in the intact nerve and decreased after injury.

Childhood Leukemia-EMF Study Group.",624-34,"We obtained original individual data from 15 studies of magnetic fields or wire codes and childhood leukemia, and we estimated magnetic field exposure for subjects with sufficient data to do so. Summary estimates from 12 studies that supplied magnetic field measures exhibited little or no association of magnetic fields with leukemia when comparing 0.1-0.2 and 0.2-0.3 microtesla (microT) categories with the 0-0.1 microT category, but the Mantel-Haenszel summary odds ratio comparing >0.3 microT to 0-0.1 microT was 1.7 (95% confidence limits = 1.2, 2.3). Similar results were obtained using covariate adjustment and spline regression. The study-specific relations appeared consistent despite the numerous methodologic differences among the studies. The association of wire codes with leukemia varied considerably across studies, with odds ratio estimates for very high current vs low current configurations ranging from 0.7 to 3.0 (homogeneity P = 0.005). Based on a survey of household magnetic fields, an estimate of the U.S. population attributable fraction of childhood leukemia associated with residential exposure is 3% (95% confidence limits = -2%, 8%). Our results contradict the idea that the magnetic field association with leukemia is less consistent than the wire code association with leukemia, although analysis of the four studies with both measures indicates that the wire code association is not explained by measured fields. The results also suggest that appreciable magnetic field effects, if any, may be concentrated among relatively high and uncommon exposures, and that studies of highly exposed populations would be needed to clarify the relation of magnetic fields to childhood leukemia.","['Greenland, S', 'Sheppard, A R', 'Kaune, W T', 'Poole, C', 'Kelsh, M A']","['Greenland S', 'Sheppard AR', 'Kaune WT', 'Poole C', 'Kelsh MA']","['Department of Epidemiology, UCLA School of Public Health, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Epidemiology,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",9009644,IM,"['Child', '*Electric Wiring', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology']",,2000/10/31 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/10/31 11:00'],"['2000/10/31 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/31 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001648-200011000-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Epidemiology. 2000 Nov;11(6):624-34. doi: 10.1097/00001648-200011000-00003.,,['Epidemiology. 2001 Jul;12(4):472-4.

In patients with leukemia, the rate of relapse appeared to be similar to that documented in bone marrow transplant recipients.

The disadvantages associated with T-cell depletion (TCD), including loss of the graft-versus-leukemia effect and impaired immune recovery have been important drawbacks for application on a wider scale. Recently, however, new approaches such as the use of peripheral blood stem cells and the application of TCD, in conjunction with delayed donor lymphocyte infusion, have opened new possibilities. The first clinical studies addressing the merits of these approaches suggest that effective prevention of graft-versus-host disease may be achieved by TCD, whereas the graft-versus-leukemia effect may be maintained by delayed donor lymphocyte infusion. Also, immune recovery may be accelerated by the use of peripheral blood stem cells. New techniques to manipulate stem cell grafts in vitro are being developed with the purpose to either selectively delete alloantigen specific T cells or tolerize such T cells by blocking costimulatory pathways. As a result, the in vitro manipulation of T cells of allogeneic stem cell grafts currently enjoys renewed scientific interest.","['Cornelissen, J J', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Cornelissen JJ', 'Lowenberg B']","['University Hospital Rotterdam/Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, The Netherlands. cornelissen@hemh.azr.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Animals', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/*methods', '*T-Lymphocytes', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology/methods/standards']",,2000/10/31 11:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2000/10/31 11:00'],"['2000/10/31 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/31 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00062752-200011000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2000 Nov;7(6):348-52. doi: 10.1097/00062752-200011000-00005.,,,,29,,,,,,,,,

CASE SUMMARY: A 48-year-old white man with acute lymphoblastic leukemia was started on an induction chemotherapeutic regimen that included intravenous vincristine. He received a total of 6 mg of vincristine over two weeks during induction chemotherapy. Over the next two weeks, he developed a fulminant peripheral neuropathy with severe quadriparesis. DISCUSSION: Although commonly associated with peripheral neuropathy, vincristine neurotoxicity only rarely involves instances of fulminant peripheral neuropathy with severe quadriparesis. Guillain-Barre syndrome is also associated with leukemia and may present as a fulminant peripheral neuropathy with severe quadriparesis. CONCLUSIONS: Fulminant neuropathy with severe quadriparesis occurring in patients with leukemia being treated with vincristine (and who do not have coexistent Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) is more likely due to Guillain-Barre syndrome than to vincristine neurotoxicity.","['Moudgil, S S', 'Riggs, J E']","['Moudgil SS', 'Riggs JE']","['Department of Neurology, West Virginia University Health Sciences Center, Morgantown 26506, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Guillain-Barre Syndrome/complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Quadriplegia/*chemically induced', 'Vincristine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use']",,2000/10/31 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/10/31 11:00'],"['2000/10/31 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/31 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1345/aph.19396 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2000 Oct;34(10):1136-8. doi: 10.1345/aph.19396.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, we developed a controlled release device for LIF based on a calcium alginate rod (release rate about 0.5% per day). These rods were sutured to the abdominal surface of the hemidiaphragm of mdx mice 3 months old. At age 6 months the mice were killed and the diaphragm muscles fixed and sectioned. The sections showed obvious muscle degeneration at 3 months of age in mdx mouse diaphragms and further degeneration at 6 months in saline-perfused muscle. Hemidiaphragm muscles continuously exposed to LIF over the same period contained more normal myofibers, larger regenerated fibers, and less adipose tissue and other non-contractile tissue. Morphometric analysis of the diaphragm sections was carried out. The LIF-treated animals showed a significant increase in fiber number and size compared to saline rod controls. The amount of nonmuscle (connective tissue and adipose tissue) was significantly reduced and the maximum force-producing capacity of isolated diaphragm muscle strips was higher in LIF-treated mice.

Because thyroid hormones are critically involved in growth and differentiation, we speculated that hormone levels could be of significance to the development of leukemia in early life. Specifically, we hypothesized that high levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) would be associated with a low risk of leukemia. Accordingly, high TSH (low free thyroid hormone) early after birth most likely reflects low function of the thyroid accompanied by low rate of cell turnover and so lower risk of faulty cell divisions leading to cancer. In a matched case-control study nested from all singleton children born in Denmark between 1986 and 1998, we compared levels of TSH (as measured in a neonatal screening program for congenital hypothyroidism) in 188 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 28 of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with levels in 1,450 and 216 matched controls, respectively. Data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression and odds ratios (OR) were adjusted for birth weight. As hypothesized, we found a decreased risk of ALL and AML associated with high TSH (OR(ALL) = 0.7 [0.5-1.0]; OR(AML) = 0.3 [0.1-1.0]). However, both conditions were also associated with low levels of TSH (OR(ALL) = 0.4 [0.2-0.7]; OR(AML) = 0.3 [0.1-1.4]). In conclusion, extreme TSH levels a few days after birth appears to be associated with a decreased risk of acute childhood leukemia.","['Lei, U', 'Wohlfahrt, J', 'Hjalgrim, H', 'Hjalgrim, L L', 'Simonsen, H', 'Melbye, M']","['Lei U', 'Wohlfahrt J', 'Hjalgrim H', 'Hjalgrim LL', 'Simonsen H', 'Melbye M']","['Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/etiology', 'Risk', 'Thyrotropin/*blood']",,2000/10/31 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/31 11:00'],"['2000/10/31 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/31 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0215(20001101)88:3<486::AID-IJC24>3.0.CO;2-W [pii]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2000 Nov 1;88(3):486-8.,['9002-71-5 (Thyrotropin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In flow cytometry analysis, a block in the G1 phase was noted in all the pCR3-B23 and pCR3 cells after 2 days of 10 microM RA treatment and continued to be observed at all times measured up to 6 days. Smaller peaks of apoptotic cells with less than G1 DNA content were observed in pCR3-B23 as compared with pCR3 cells after 4-6 days of 10 microM RA treatment. As measured by expressions of differentiation markers and the functional assessment of the ability to reduce nitroblue-tetrazolium, our results further showed that over-expression of nucleophosmin/B23 decreased the response of the cells to RA-induced differentiation. Less cleavage of PARP and in vitro caspase-3 activity were observed in PCR3-B23 cells as compared with pCR3 cells treated with 10 microM RA for 3-4 days. IRF-1 was induced after 6 hr of 10 microM RA treatment in the pCR3-B23 and pCR3 cells. Significantly more nucleophosmin/B23 was co-immunoprecipitated with IRF-1 from pCR3-B23 cells than from pCR3 cells during RA treatment (10 microM; 24 hr, 96 hr). The IRF-1 transcriptional activity was found to be attenuated in pCR3-B23 cells as compared with pCR3 cells during the treatment of cells with RA. Nucleophosmin/B23, through interacting with IRF-1, plays an important role in the control of the susceptibility of cells to RA-induced differentiation and apoptosis.","['Hsu, C Y', 'Yung, B Y']","['Hsu CY', 'Yung BY']","['Graduate Institute of Pharmacology, National Yang Ming University, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,2000/10/31 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/31 11:00'],"['2000/10/31 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/31 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0215(20001101)88:3<392::AID-IJC11>3.0.CO;2-7 [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0215(20001101)88:3<392::aid-ijc11>3.0.co;2-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2000 Nov 1;88(3):392-400. doi: 10.1002/1097-0215(20001101)88:3<392::aid-ijc11>3.0.co;2-7.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Cachexia makes an organism susceptible to secondary pathologies and can result in death. Cachexia-anorexia may result from pain, depression or anxiety, hypogeusia and hyposmia, taste and food aversions, chronic nausea, vomiting, early satiety, malfunction of the gastrointestinal system (delayed digestion, malabsorption, gastric stasis and associated delayed emptying, and/or atrophic changes of the mucosa), metabolic shifts, cytokine action, production of substances by tumor cells, and/or iatrogenic causes such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The cachexia-anorexia syndrome also involves metabolic and immune changes (mediated by either the pathophysiologic process, i.e., tumor, or host-derived chemical factors, e.g., peptides, neurotransmitters, cytokines, and lipid-mobilizing factors) and is associated with hypertriacylglycerolemia, lipolysis, and acceleration of protein turnover. These changes result in the loss of fat mass and body protein. Increased resting energy expenditure in weight-losing cachectic patients can occur despite the reduced dietary intake, indicating a systemic dysregulation of host metabolism. During cachexia, the organism is maintained in a constant negative energy balance. This can rarely be explained by the actual energy and substrate demands by tumors in patients with cancer. Overall, the cachectic profile is significantly different than that observed during starvation. Cachexia may result not only from anorexia and a decreased caloric intake but also from malabsorption and losses from the body (ulcers, hemorrhage, effusions). In any case, the major deficit of a cachectic organism is a negative energy balance. Cytokines are proposed to participate in the development and/or progression of cachexia-anorexia; interleukin-1, interleukin-6 (and its subfamily members such as ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor), interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor have been associated with various cachectic conditions. Controversy has focused on the requirement of increased cytokine concentrations in the circulation or other body fluids (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid) to demonstrate cytokine involvement in cachexia-anorexia. Cytokines, however, also act in paracrine, autocrine, and intracrine manners, activities that cannot be detected in the circulation. In fact, paracrine interactions represent a predominant cytokine mode of action within organs, including the brain. Data show that cytokines may be involved in cachectic-anorectic processes by being produced and by acting locally in specific brain regions. Brain synthesis of cytokines has been shown in peripheral models of cancer, peripheral inflammation, and during peripheral cytokine administration; these data support a role for brain cytokines as mediators of neurologic and neuropsychiatric manifestations of disease and in the brain-to-peripheral communication (e.g., through the autonomic nervous system). Brain mechanisms that merit significant attention in the cachexia-anorexia syndrome are those that result from interactions among cytokines, peptides/neuropeptides, and neurotransmitters. These interactions could result in additive, synergistic, or antagonistic activities and can involve modifications of transducing molecules and intracellular mediators. Thus, the data show that the cachexia-anorexia syndrome is multifactorial, and understanding the interactions between peripheral and brain mechanisms is pivotal to characterizing the underlying integrative pathophysiology of this disorder.","['Plata-Salaman, C R']",['Plata-Salaman CR'],"['Division of Molecular Biology, School of Life and Health Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware, USA. cplatasa@prius.jnj.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Nutrition,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",8802712,IM,"['*Anorexia/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Brain/*physiopathology', 'Cachexia/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Time Factors']",,2000/10/31 11:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2000/10/31 11:00'],"['2000/10/31 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/31 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0899-9007(00)00413-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0899-9007(00)00413-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Nutrition. 2000 Oct;16(10):1009-12. doi: 10.1016/s0899-9007(00)00413-5.,['0 (Cytokines)'],,,50,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cellular hypersensitivity was confirmed in vitro and attributed to the ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) gene in cases I and II, a newly described defect in the DNA ligase 4 gene in case III, and a novel and as yet incompletely defined, molecular defect in case IV who presented with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). RESULTS: The severe clinical hypersensitivity preceded the cellular and molecular analysis, but did not manifest as a clinically exaggerated normal tissue reaction until 3+ weeks after the start of a conventionally fractionated course of radiotherapy, by which time the latent damage had been inflicted. There were no clinical stigmata to alert the clinician to a predisposing syndrome in two patients (cases I and II). We point out that approximately 20% of A-T patients are classified as variants with delayed expression of clinical symptoms, and case II falls into this category. CONCLUSIONS: As lymphoma (incidence, one in 100000 children) constituted the majority of the diagnoses, questions arise as to: (1), the probability of other centres having experienced and being presented in the future with similar problems (particularly bearing in mind that other oncologically predisposing radiosensitivity syndromes have not been not represented in our experience); and (2), the appropriateness, efficiency and applicability of predictive assays. Unambiguous cellular radiosensitivity would have been apparent from clonal assays on fibroblast cultures from all four cases prior to treatment, but such assays take 4-6 weeks to produce results. While estimates of chromosome damage or clonal assays on pre-treatment blood derived cells would be faster, there is a health economics issue as to the general applicability of such 'screening' assays.","['Rogers, P B', 'Plowman, P N', 'Harris, S J', 'Arlett, C F']","['Rogers PB', 'Plowman PN', 'Harris SJ', 'Arlett CF']","[""Department Of Radiotherapy, St Bartholomew's Hospital, West Smithfield, London EC1A 7BE, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Ireland,Radiother Oncol,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,8407192,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Brain Neoplasms/diagnosis/*radiotherapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/diagnosis/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Radiation Dosage', '*Radiation Tolerance/genetics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Analysis', 'Xeroderma Pigmentosum/*diagnosis/etiology']",,2000/10/31 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/31 11:00'],"['2000/10/31 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/31 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0167-8140(00)00249-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-8140(00)00249-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiother Oncol. 2000 Nov;57(2):143-54. doi: 10.1016/s0167-8140(00)00249-8.,,,,105,,,,,,,,,

We now report that both Q190N and Q190A MuLV RTs are more efficient in their activity to incorporate ddNTPs and exhibit higher fidelity than the wild-type (WT) enzyme of DNA synthesis in both RNA- and DNA-directed reactions. To obtain some insight into the structural basis for the differential utilization of dNTP and ddNTP by the mutant enzymes, we modeled the binary and the ternary complexes of MuLV RT using corresponding HIV-1 RT structures and available structure of the fragment of MuLV RT. Q190 of MuLV RT appears to be essential for the interaction with 3'OH of dNTP. The lack of a 3'OH moiety in ddNTP does not permit the binding of ddNTPs to WT MuLV RT. However, the shorter side chain of Q190N (or A) mutant MuLV RT and the absence of 3'OH in ddNTP result in the rearrangement of hydrophobic interactions favoring the binding and limited incorporation of ddNTPs. In addition, while modeling the binary and ternary complexes of MuLV RT, we noted that in the formation of the ternary complex, an interaction of Q190 with dNTP substrate requires a shift from its interaction with the template base. This may be achieved by a small conformational change or motion of the loop between beta9 and alphaH containing Q190, which may correspond to the conformational change step requiring participation of Q190 during the catalytic reaction as reported in an earlier biochemical investigation.","['Singh, K', 'Kaushik, N', 'Jin, J', 'Madhusudanan, M', 'Modak, M J']","['Singh K', 'Kaushik N', 'Jin J', 'Madhusudanan M', 'Modak MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, UMD-New Jersey Medical School and Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Protein Eng,Protein engineering,8801484,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Catalytic Domain', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/chemistry/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/*metabolism', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/chemistry/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*enzymology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Conformation', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",,2000/10/31 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/31 11:00'],"['2000/10/31 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/31 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/protein/13.9.635 [doi]'],ppublish,Protein Eng. 2000 Sep;13(9):635-43. doi: 10.1093/protein/13.9.635.,"['0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (bacteriophage T7 induced DNA polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,['GM-36307/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

We found that, in the early stage of differentiation (1-48 h), PMA induction elicited an upregulation of intracellular H ferritin and H ferritin binding sites and a downregulation of transferrin receptor. In addition, we found that iron administration to PMA-differentiating cells induced the expression of TNF-alpha mRNA and TNF-alpha secretion to levels even higher than those induced by IFN-gamma alone. The iron chelator desferrioxamine showed the opposite effect and reduced TNF-alpha release. In contrast, preincubation of the cells with iron before PMA induction resulted in a decrease of the TNF-alpha secretion induced by IFN-gamma, whereas the opposite was true after preincubation with desferrioxamine. The data support a co-ordinate interaction between iron and TNF-alpha in monocyte macrophages, with an iron-mediated upregulation of TNF-alpha in the early phase of differentiation and an iron-mediated inhibition at later stages. This complex relationship has to be considered in evaluating the effects of iron on inflammation.","['Scaccabarozzi, A', 'Arosio, P', 'Weiss, G', 'Valenti, L', 'Dongiovanni, P', 'Fracanzani, A L', 'Mattioli, M', 'Levi, S', 'Fiorelli, G', 'Fargion, S']","['Scaccabarozzi A', 'Arosio P', 'Weiss G', 'Valenti L', 'Dongiovanni P', 'Fracanzani AL', 'Mattioli M', 'Levi S', 'Fiorelli G', 'Fargion S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Maggiore Hospital, IRCCS, University of Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Ferritins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Iron/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/metabolism', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",,2000/10/29 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/29 11:00'],"['2000/10/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/29 11:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2280 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02280.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Sep;110(4):978-84. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02280.x.,"['0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Total RNA was isolated from bone-marrow or blood-cell samples collected at diagnosis in children or adult patients, 18 of whom had acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML), 61 of whom had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 11 of whom had chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). The ratio (Ik1 + Ik2)/(Ik1 + Ik2 + Ik4 + Ik7 + Ik8) ranged from 13.5% to 85% and was lower (P < 0. 05) in samples from patients with m-bcr-abl ALL. An alternative splicing resulting in the deletion of 30 nucleotides at the end of exon 6 was observed in leukaemic samples, and in normal thymus and bone marrow. Our results are consistent with previous reports and suggest that the pattern of expression of the different human Ikaros isoforms are not homogeneous among different subsets of leukaemias.","['Olivero, S', 'Maroc, C', 'Beillard, E', 'Gabert, J', 'Nietfeld, W', 'Chabannon, C', 'Tonnelle, C']","['Olivero S', 'Maroc C', 'Beillard E', 'Gabert J', 'Nietfeld W', 'Chabannon C', 'Tonnelle C']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire, Centre de Therapie Cellulaire, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/genetics']",,2000/10/29 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/29 11:00'],"['2000/10/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/29 11:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2297 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02297.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Sep;110(4):826-30. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.02297.x.,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier studies showed that in vitro cellular drug resistance is a strong independent adverse risk factor in childhood ALL. Knowledge about cellular drug resistance in adult ALL is still limited. The present study compared the in vitro drug resistance profiles of 23 adult ALL patients with that of 395 childhood ALL patients. The lymphoblasts were tested by the MTT assay. The group of adult ALL samples was significantly more resistant to cytosine arabinoside, L-asparaginase, daunorubicin, dexamethasone and prednisolone. The resistance ratio (RR) was highest for prednisolone (31.7-fold) followed by dexamethasone (6.9-fold), L-asparaginase (6. 1-fold), cytosine arabinoside (2.9-fold), daunorubicin (2.5-fold) and vincristine (2.2-fold). Lymphoblasts from adult patients were not more resistant to mercaptopurine, thioguanine, 4-HOO-ifosfamide, mitoxantrone and teniposide. There were no significant differences in drug resistance between adult T-cell (T-) ALL (n = 11) and adult common/pre-B-cell (B-) ALL (n = 10). Additionally, adult T-ALL did not differ from childhood T-ALL (n = 69). There were significant differences between adult common/pre-B-ALL and childhood common/pre-B-ALL (n = 310) for prednisolone (RR = 302, P = 0.008), dexamethasone (RR = 20.9, P = 0.017) and daunorubicin (RR = 2.7, P = 0.009). Lymphoblasts from adults proved to be relatively resistant to drugs commonly used in therapy.

METHODS: The population of this study included 55 patients; these were 40 males and 15 females, with a mean age 64.4+/-8.6 years. The previous malignancy was considered tobacco-induced in 15 patients (kidney, two; bladder, ten; esophagus, three), hormone-dependant in 18 (breast, six; female genital, eight; prostate, four), and miscellaneous in 22 (leukemia, four; skin, seven; colon, 11). Following complete resection, 25 patients were classified stage I, 13 were stage II, and 17 were stage IIIA. RESULTS: There were two early perioperative deaths (3.6%), and three during the second month owing to cardiovascular complications. At the conclusion of the study (July 1st, 1997), 32 further patients had died (58.2%): 25 had progression of lung cancer, one had progression of previous malignancy, and six were without evidence of disease. Five-year survival (Kaplan-Meier) was estimated 47+/-10.2% in stage I (median 44 months), 30.8+/-15.6% in stage II (median 26 months), and 16. 7+/-9.9% in stage IIIA (median 17 months). When excluding five early perioperative deaths, 5-year survival was 51.1+/-10.6% in stage I (median 93 months), 33.3+/-16.7% in stage II (median 36.5 months), and 19.0+/-11.2% in stage IIIA (median 20.5 months). Comparing the three groups defined according to location of previous malignancy, there was no significant difference neither in stage distribution (chi(2)=1.326; P=0.857), nor in 5-year survival estimates: 38.9+/-12. 9% (median 27 months) after tobacco-induced malignancies, 38.9+/-11. 5% (median 24 months) following hormone-dependant malignancies, and 28.4+/-10.2% (median 28 months) following miscellaneous cancers (chi(2)=0.059; P=0.9707). CONCLUSIONS: In opposition to data collected in patients with previous head and neck cancer, survival estimates according to stage were contained within the universally accepted range no high risk group has been identified.

Optimal patient management should take that risk into account by replacing, for instance, the classical, in-hospital administered, broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics by newer therapeutic approaches including oral and/or outpatient therapeutic strategies for the 'low-risk' patients. The development of such approaches which have been shown safe and feasible, implies the existence of universally accepted, validated and reliable clinical prediction rules for the identification of these low-risk patients. Some prognostic factors predicting the response to the empiric treatment, the development of a bacteremia, and the final outcome of a febrile neutropenic episode have been established (such as duration and profoundness of neutropenia, acute leukemia, administration of chemotherapy for treatment of relapse, high temperature, shock and/or chills, inpatient status at fever onset) and some models combining them have already been proposed, firstly by Talcott and coworkers and more recently by the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) study section on infections. The sensitivity of these rules as a selection tool for identifying patients at low-risk of complication, however, needs to be improved and we have to assess their clinical usefulness, safety and/or reproducibility better in order to allow a more adequate choice between the therapeutic strategies, to continue to improve patients quality of life and to optimize the cost-effectiveness of the treatments.","['Paesmans, M']",['Paesmans M'],"['Unite de Biostatistique, Institut Jules Bordet, 1 rue Heger-Bordet, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Int J Antimicrob Agents,International journal of antimicrobial agents,9111860,IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Fever/*complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infections/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Neutropenia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Quality of Life', 'Risk Factors']",,2000/10/29 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/29 11:00'],"['2000/10/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/29 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0924-8579(00)00213-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0924-8579(00)00213-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2000 Oct;16(2):107-11. doi: 10.1016/s0924-8579(00)00213-2.,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],,,25,,,,,,,,,

A similar analysis was performed in two MHC class II expressing pediatric leukemia patients after treatment with an allo-BMT who were included in our study as control. It was observed that CD4(+) T cells displayed cytolytic alloreactivity in both BLS patients prior to and within the first year after allo-BMT, whereas such cells were absent at a later time-point, in the donors and pediatric leukemia controls. In addition, reduced MHC class II expression was observed in CD8(+) T cells of both recipients early after allo-BMT, irrespective of the T cell chimerism pattern. Lack of endogenous MHC class II expression in BLS patients, therefore, results in aberrant T cell selection within the first year after allo-BMT, analogous to T cell selection before transplantation. These T cell selection processes seem to be normalized at a later time point after allo-BMT probably due to migration and integration of graft-derived MHC class II-positive antigen presenting cells to sites of T cell selection.","['Godthelp, B C', 'Van Eggermond, M C', 'Van Tol, M J', 'Vossen, J M', 'van den Elsen, P J']","['Godthelp BC', 'Van Eggermond MC', 'Van Tol MJ', 'Vossen JM', 'van den Elsen PJ']","['Departments of Pediatrics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Immunol,Human immunology,8010936,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Lineage', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HLA-DR Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Hematopoiesis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/*immunology/therapy', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2000/10/29 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/29 11:00'],"['2000/10/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/29 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0198-8859(00)00156-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0198-8859(00)00156-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Immunol. 2000 Sep;61(9):898-907. doi: 10.1016/s0198-8859(00)00156-7.,['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)'],,,,,,,,,,,,

A multistep pathogenesis caused by a clonal stem cell defect affecting several differentiation pathways has been proposed for MDS. Contrary to the better characterized alteration of lymphoid and myeloid differentiation, defects in thrombocytopoesis in MDS remain less clear. In the present study, we analyzed the expression of platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ia/IIa, IIb/IIIa, Ib/IX, and IV in 21 MDS patients (12 RA, 2 RARS, 4 RAEB, 1 RAEB-T, 2 CMML) and healthy controls by flowcytometric analysis and quantitation of platelet GP RNA using fluorescence-based PCR. We observed a reduced cell surface expression of GPIb (p<0.01) and GPIIb/IIIa (p<0.01), while GPIa/IIa and GPIV expression was only marginally different between patients and controls. In contrast, there was a two-fold increase of platelet GPIb and GPIIb RNA and a three-fold increase of GPIV RNA among MDS patients.

However, topoisomerase II-targeted drugs can cause acute myeloid leukemia, with the risk of this secondary leukemia linked to a genetic defect in thiopurine catabolism. Chronic thiopurines result in thioguanine substitution in DNA. The effect of these substitutions on DNA topoisomerase II activity is not known. Our goal was to determine whether deoxythioguanosine substitution alters DNA cleavage stabilized by human topoisomerase II. We studied four variations of a 40 mer oligonucleotide with a topoisomerase II cleavage site, each with a single deoxythioguanosine in a different position relative to the cleavage site (-1 or +2 in the top and +2 or +4 in the bottom strand). Deoxythioguanosine substitution caused position-dependent quantitative effects on cleavage. With the -1 or +2 top and +2 or +4 bottom substitutions, mean topoisomerase II-induced cleavage was 0.6-, 2.0-, 1.1-, and 3.3-fold that with the wild-type substrate (P=0. 011, < 0.008, 0.51, and < 0.001, respectively). In the presence of 100 microM etoposide, cleavage was enhanced for wild-type and all thioguanosine-modified substrates relative to no etoposide, with the +4 bottom substitution showing greater etoposide-induced cleavage than the wild-type substrate (P=0.015). We conclude that thioguanine incorporation alters the DNA cleavage induced by topoisomerase II in the presence and absence of etoposide, providing new insights to the mechanism of thiopurine effect and on the leukemogenesis of thiopurines, with or without topoisomerase inhibitors.","['Krynetskaia, N F', 'Cai, X', 'Nitiss, J L', 'Krynetski, E Y', 'Relling, M V']","['Krynetskaia NF', 'Cai X', 'Nitiss JL', 'Krynetski EY', 'Relling MV']","[""University of Tennessee, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis 38105-2794, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Models, Molecular', 'Oligonucleotides/genetics/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Thioguanine/chemistry/*metabolism']",,2000/10/29 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/29 11:00'],"['2000/10/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/29 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1096/fj.00-0089com [doi]', '14/14/2339 [pii]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2000 Nov;14(14):2339-44. doi: 10.1096/fj.00-0089com.,"['0 (Oligonucleotides)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",,,,"['CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA52814/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA82313/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

Recent reports indicate that LIF is relevant to murine embryo implantation. In this work, results of indirect immunofluorescence under a confocal microscope illustrated that LIF was mainly located in the uterine lumen and uterine epithelial cells in pregnant mice on day 4. The number of embryos implanted in pregnant mice on day 8 decreased significantly after injection of 3 microg LIF antibodies into a uterine horn (P<0.001), which demonstrated again that LIF is a critical factor for embryo implantation. In a co-culture system, LIF (0.1 ng/ml, 1 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml) significantly enhanced the blastocyst outgrowth after 24, 48 or 72 h of co-culture, and outgrowth areas after 72 h of co-culture. Conversely, 5 microg/ml and 10 microg/ml, but not 1 microg/ml, LIF antibodies decreased the percentage of blastocysts with outgrowth; only 10 microg/ml LIF antibody inhibited blastocyst outgrowth area significantly (P<0.001). However, neither LIF nor its antibodies changed embryo attachment. Analysis of correlation showed that the effects of LIF or its antibodies on the blastocyst outgrowth were dose-dependent. In summary, different pathways may exist to regulate the blastocyst attachment and outgrowth on a monolayer of uterine epithelial cells. LIF protein from the maternal uterus exerts an essential role in embryo implantation in the mouse, which is mediated by stimulating trophoblast outgrowth, but not by promoting the attachment.","['Cai, L Q', 'Cao, Y J', 'Duan, E K']","['Cai LQ', 'Cao YJ', 'Duan EK']","['State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Institute of Zoology, Academia Sinica, Beijing, P.

The splicing-derived cytokine receptor protein isoforms are mostly soluble receptors or show alterations in their cytoplasmic domain. It is possible that receptor abnormalities or a pathological ratio of different isoforms may contribute to leukaemia by circumventing normal growth factor control or altering the balance of proliferation and differentiation. IL-7 plays a critical role in early stages of both B and T cell maturation. Moreover, it stimulates the expansion of mature T cells including anti-tumour reactive cells as well as a number of T and B cell malignancies underlining its potential importance for deregulated lymphoid proliferation and leukaemogenesis. Here, we present detailed data on the expression of the interleukin 7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7Ralpha) in leukaemic cells from 210 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and describe two novel alternatively spliced transcripts of human IL-7Ralpha coding for truncated receptor proteins which are still capable of binding IL-7. IL-7Ralpha mRNA expression was more frequent in more mature pre-B ALL [91% (30/33)] than in common [81% (81/100)] or pro-B ALL [64% (18/28)], or even in T ALL [64% (29/45)]. These results are in concordance with flow cytometric analyses on the proportion of IL-7Ralpha bearing cells among total blast cell population. Our results lead us to assume that splicing derived IL-7Ralpha isoforms play a potential role in modulating IL-7 signal transduction and might be important for the pathogenesis of leukaemia.","['Korte, A', 'Kochling, J', 'Badiali, L', 'Eckert, C', 'Andreae, J', 'Geilen, W', 'Kebelmann-Betzing, C', 'Taube, T', 'Wu, S', 'Henze, G', 'Seeger, K']","['Korte A', 'Kochling J', 'Badiali L', 'Eckert C', 'Andreae J', 'Geilen W', 'Kebelmann-Betzing C', 'Taube T', 'Wu S', 'Henze G', 'Seeger K']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite Medical Center, Campus Virchow, Germany. alexander.korte@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Exons', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Introns', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/10/29 11:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2000/10/29 11:00'],"['2000/10/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/29 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/cyto.2000.0777 [doi]', 'S1043-4666(00)90777-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2000 Nov;12(11):1597-608. doi: 10.1006/cyto.2000.0777.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '0 (interleukin-7 receptor, alpha chain)']",,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,

DaunoXome (DNX, NeXstar) is a liposomal-encapsulated preparation of daunorubicin registered for treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma that during prior in vitro studies showed a toxicity to leukemic cells at least comparable to that of free daunorubicin. The aim of our study was to determine DNX pharmacokinetics in 11 poor-risk patients with acute leukemia treated with DNX 60 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 3, and 5. Blood and urine samples were collected at appropriate intervals after each of the three DNX administrations. The total amount of daunorubicin (free and entrapped) (t-DNR) and of its metabolite daunorubicinol (DNRol) was assayed by HPLC. The main pharmacokinetic parameters (t1/2alpha 4.54 +/- 0.87 h; VdSS 2.88 +/- 0.93 l/m2; Cl 0.47 +/- 0.26 l/h/m2) showed that in patients with acute leukemia liposomal-entrapped daunorubicin pharmacokinetics greatly differed from that observed for the conventional formulation. In fact, DNX produced mean plasma AUC levels (t-DNR AUC0-infinity 456.27 +/- 182.64 microg/ml/h) about 100- to 200-fold greater than those reported for the free drug at comparable doses due to a very much lower total body clearance. Volume of distribution at steady state was 200-to 500-fold lower than for the free drug. Plasma AUC of DNRol (17.62 +/- 7.13 microg/ml x h) was similar to or even greater than that observed with free daunorubicin for comparable doses. Cumulative urinary excretion showed that about 6% and 12% of the total dose of DNX administered was excreted in urine as daunorubicin and daunorubicinol, respectively. No major toxicity was encountered. Therefore, pharmacokinetic characteristics suggest that DNX may be more convenient than free daunorubicin in the treatment of acute leukemia. In fact, liposomal formulation may allow a reduction of daunorubicin captation in normal tissues. thus minimizing toxicity at least for the parent drug, and guarantee an unimpeded access to leukemic cells in the bloodstream and bone marrow, thus theoretically improving efficacy.","['Pea, F', 'Russo, D', 'Michieli, M', 'Baraldo, M', 'Ermacora, A', 'Damiani, D', 'Baccarani, M', 'Furlanut, M']","['Pea F', 'Russo D', 'Michieli M', 'Baraldo M', 'Ermacora A', 'Damiani D', 'Baccarani M', 'Furlanut M']","['Institute of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Chair of Pharmacology, DPMSC, University iof Udine, Italy. federicopea@med.uniud.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/urine', 'Calibration', 'Daunorubicin/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/urine', 'Drug Carriers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",,2000/10/29 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/29 11:00'],"['2000/10/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/29 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800000163 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2000;46(4):279-86. doi: 10.1007/s002800000163.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Scandinavian Breast Group 9401 study.",1384-91,"BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy drug distribution varies greatly among individual patients. Therefore, we developed an individualised fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide (FEC) regimen to improve outcomes in patients with high-risk early breast cancer. We then did a randomised trial to compare this individually tailored FEC regimen with conventional adjuvant chemotherapy followed by consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell support. METHODS: 525 women younger than 60 years of age with high-risk primary breast cancer were randomised after surgery to receive nine cycles of tailored FEC to haematological equitoxicity with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support (n=251), or three cycles of FEC at standard doses followed by high-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin (CTCb), and peripheral-blood stem-cell or bone-marrow support (n=274). Both groups received locoregional radiation therapy and tamoxifen for 5 years. The primary outcome measure was relapse-free survival, and analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: At a median follow-up of 34.3 months, there were 81 breast-cancer relapses in the tailored FEC group versus 113 in the CTCb group (double triangular method p=0.04). 60 deaths occurred in the tailored FEC group and 82 in the CTCb group (log-rank p=0.12). Patients in the CTCb group experienced more grade 3 or 4 acute toxicity compared with the tailored FEC group (p<0.0001). Two treatment-related deaths (0.7%) occurred in the CTCb group.

METHODS: A nonparametric test for a change in the slope of the birth-cohort trend has been developed. The test is a generalisation of the sign test and is based on permutational distributions. A method for identifying interactions between age and calendar-period effects is also presented. RESULTS: The nonparametric method is shown to be powerful in detecting changes in the slope of the birth-cohort trend, although its power can be reduced considerably by calendar-period patterns of risk. The method identifies a previously unidentified decrease in the birth-cohort risk of lung-cancer mortality from 1912 to 1919, which appears to reflect a reduction in the initiation of smoking by young men at the beginning of the Great Depression (1930s). The method also detects an interaction between age and calendar period in leukemia mortality rates, reflecting the better response of children to chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: The proposed nonparametric method provides a data analytic approach, which is a useful adjunct to log-linear Poisson analysis of age-period-cohort models, either in the initial model building stage, or in the final interpretation stage.","['Tarone, R E', 'Chu, K C']","['Tarone RE', 'Chu KC']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Epidemiol Biostat,Journal of epidemiology and biostatistics,9611181,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Birth Rate/*trends', 'Cohort Studies', '*Epidemiologic Factors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Risk Factors', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",,2000/10/29 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/10/29 11:00'],"['2000/10/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/29 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Epidemiol Biostat. 2000;5(3):177-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In heme deficiency, inhibition of protein synthesis correlates with the activation of heme-regulated eIF-2alpha kinase (HRI), which blocks the initiation of protein synthesis by phosphorylating eIF-2alpha. HRI is a hemoprotein with 2 distinct heme-binding domains. Heme negatively regulates HRI activity by binding directly to HRI. To further study the physiological function of HRI, the wild-type (Wt) HRI and dominant-negative inactive mutants of HRI were expressed by retrovirus-mediated transfer in both non-erythroid NIH 3T3 and mouse erythroleukemic (MEL) cells. Expression of Wt HRI in 3T3 cells resulted in the inhibition of protein synthesis, a loss of proliferation, and eventually cell death. Expression of the inactive HRI mutants had no apparent effect on the growth characteristics or morphology of NIH 3T3 cells. In contrast, expression of 3 dominant-negative inactive mutants of HRI in MEL cells resulted in increased hemoglobin production and increased proliferative capacity of these cells upon dimethyl-sulfoxide induction of erythroid differentiation. These results directly demonstrate the importance of HRI in the regulation of protein synthesis in immature erythroid cells and suggest a role of HRI in the regulation of the numbers of matured erythroid cells.","['Crosby, J S', 'Chefalo, P J', 'Yeh, I', 'Ying, S', 'London, I M', 'Leboulch, P', 'Chen, J J']","['Crosby JS', 'Chefalo PJ', 'Yeh I', 'Ying S', 'London IM', 'Leboulch P', 'Chen JJ']","['Harvard-Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Division of Health Sciences and Technology, Cambridge MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Heme/*physiology', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis', 'Homeostasis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'eIF-2 Kinase/*metabolism']",,2000/10/26 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/26 11:00'],"['2000/10/26 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/26 11:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48357-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Nov 1;96(9):3241-8.,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,"['R01 DK016272/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK16272/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL55435/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

In this study, genes were searched near the breakpoints at 1p36.3, and a novel gene was isolated that encoded a zinc finger protein with a PR domain, which is highly homologous to the MDS1/EVI1 gene. The novel gene, designated as MEL1 (MDS1/EVI1-like gene 1), with 1257 amino acid residues is 64% similar in nucleotide and 63% similar in amino acid sequences to MDS1/EVI1 with the same domain structure. The MEL1 gene is expressed in leukemia cells with t(1;3) but not in other cell lines or bone marrow, spleen, and fetal liver, suggesting that MEL1 is specifically in the t(1;3)(p36;q21)-positive MDS/AML. On the basis of the positional relationship between the EVI1 and MEL1 genes in each translocation, it was suggested that both genes are transcriptionally activated by the translocation of the 3q21 region with the Ribophorin I gene. Because of the transcriptional activation of the EVI1 family genes in both t(1;3)(p36;q21)-positive MDS/AML and 3q21q26 syndrome, it is suggested that they share a common molecular mechanism for the leukemogenic transformation of the cells.","['Mochizuki, N', 'Shimizu, S', 'Nagasawa, T', 'Tanaka, H', 'Taniwaki, M', 'Yokota, J', 'Morishita, K']","['Mochizuki N', 'Shimizu S', 'Nagasawa T', 'Tanaka H', 'Taniwaki M', 'Yokota J', 'Morishita K']","['Biology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers']",,2000/10/26 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/26 11:00'],"['2000/10/26 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/26 11:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48353-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Nov 1;96(9):3209-14.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PRDM16 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Pharmacologic doses of retinoic acid (RA) induce differentiation in human APL cells and complete clinical remissions. Unfortunately, APL cells develop resistance to RA in vitro and in vivo. Recently, mutations in PML/RARalpha have been described in APL cells from patients clinically resistant to RA therapy. The mutations cluster in 2 regions that are involved in forming the binding pocket for RA. These mutant PML/RARalpha proteins have been expressed in vitro, which shows that they cause a diversity of alterations in binding to ligand and to nuclear coregulators of transcription, leading to varying degrees of inhibition of retinoid-induced transcription. This contrasts with the nearly complete dominant negative activity of mutations in PML/RARalpha previously characterized in cell lines developing RA resistance in vitro. Current data from this study provide additional insight into the molecular mechanisms of resistance to RA and suggest that alterations in the ability of mutants to interact with coregulators can be determinant in the molecular mechanism of resistance to RA. In particular, ligand-induced binding to the coactivator ACTR correlated better with transcriptional activation of RA response elements than the ligand-induced release of the corepressor SMRT. The diversity of effects that are seen in patient-derived mutations may help explain the partial success to date of attempts to overcome this mechanism of resistance in patients by the clinical use of histone deacetylase inhibitors.","['Cote, S', 'Zhou, D', 'Bianchini, A', 'Nervi, C', 'Gallagher, R E', 'Miller, W H Jr']","['Cote S', 'Zhou D', 'Bianchini A', 'Nervi C', 'Gallagher RE', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B.

As it is likely that resistance to a single agent would be observed, combinations of STI571 with other antileukemic agents have been evaluated for activity against Bcr-Abl-positive cell lines and in colony-forming assays in vitro.

In proliferation assays that use Bcr-Abl-expressing cells lines, the combination of STI571 with IFN, DNR, and Ara-C showed additive or synergistic effects, whereas the combination of STI571 and HU demonstrated antagonistic effects. However, in colony-forming assays that use CML patient samples, all combinations showed increased antiproliferative effects as compared with STI571 alone.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the key factor playing a pivotal role in solid tumor-induced angiogenesis. Recent studies indicate that angiogenesis may also be involved in the pathogenesis of certain hemic malignancies, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Mechanisms underlying angiogenesis in B-CLL and the role of VEGF in this process are incompletely understood. In this study, it was examined whether angiogenically functional VEGF is produced by B-CLL cells. Immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against VEGF and CD34, an endothelial cell marker, demonstrated the presence of VEGF protein and abundant blood vessels in infiltrated lymphoreticular tissues. Low levels of VEGF were detected by ELISA in the culture media of unstimulated cells; this was enhanced up to 7-fold by hypoxic stimulation. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of the concentrated culture media showed 2 isoforms of VEGF protein with molecular weights of 28 and 42 kd, respectively. RNA hybridization showed that these cells expressed VEGF mRNA. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, combined with nucleotide sequence analysis, revealed that the predominantly expressed isoforms were VEGF121 and VEGF165. Moreover, (3)H-thymidine incorporation and an in vivo angiogenic assay demonstrated that the VEGF produced by CLL cells can induce angiogenesis by stimulating endothelial cell proliferation. In conclusion, this study shows that B-CLL cells produce VEGF and demonstrates the angiogenic effects of this growth factor, which may be relevant for the tissue phase of the disease.","['Chen, H', 'Treweeke, A T', 'West, D C', 'Till, K J', 'Cawley, J C', 'Zuzel, M', 'Toh, C H']","['Chen H', 'Treweeke AT', 'West DC', 'Till KJ', 'Cawley JC', 'Zuzel M', 'Toh CH']","['Departments of Haematology and Immunology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom. hjchen@liverpool.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/blood', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/analysis/*genetics', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphokines/analysis/*genetics', 'Monocytes/physiology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Protein Isoforms/analysis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",,2000/10/26 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/26 11:00'],"['2000/10/26 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/26 11:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48349-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Nov 1;96(9):3181-7.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to explore the possibility that B-CLL cells play a direct role in this phenomenon. To this end, patients' bone marrow (BM) immunoglobulin (Ig)-secreting cells were cocultured with autologous purified B-CLL cells. The results show that tumoral cells inhibited the spontaneous IgG secretion by BM plasma cells, and this effect increased after PMA-induction of B-CLL cells. This inhibitory process was proportional to the number of B-CLL cells added and depended on cellular contact. Adhesion molecules did not appear to be involved in the cellular interaction, because the inclusion of blocking antibody to a variety of these proteins did not reverse the inhibitory phenomenon. However, the addition of monoclonal antibody that blocked the function of either CD95 or CD95L clearly reversed B-CLL cell inhibition on autologous BM plasma cells. These latter cells were shown to express CD95, and B-CLL cells contained detectable quantities of CD95L at the level of messenger RNA and protein. Annexin V-binding experiments revealed increased apoptosis of BM Ig-secreting cells when cocultured with autologous B-CLL cells. Finally, this inhibitory phenomenon might be operative in vivo because (a) there was a good correlation between the intensity of the inhibitory effect in vitro and the serum IgG level exhibited by every patient and (b) B-CLL cells also inhibited in vivo antigen-induced IgG-tetanus toxoid-secreting cells obtained from normal immunized subjects. Collectively, these data suggest that B-CLL cells inhibit autologous CD95-bearing Ig-secreting cells by the interaction with CD95L present on B-CLL cells and, hence, contribute to the state of humoral immunodeficiency that occurs in these patients.","['Sampalo, A', 'Navas, G', 'Medina, F', 'Segundo, C', 'Camara, C', 'Brieva, J A']","['Sampalo A', 'Navas G', 'Medina F', 'Segundo C', 'Camara C', 'Brieva JA']","['Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario Puerta del Mar, Cadiz, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antibody Formation', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*immunology']",,2000/10/26 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/26 11:00'],"['2000/10/26 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/26 11:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48347-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Nov 1;96(9):3168-74.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Although such homing is incompletely understood, it generally involves cell adhesion and migration mediated by a number of adhesion receptors and cytokines. In this article, the potential importance of hyaluronan (HA) is examined for the tissue homing of hairy cells (HCs) in hairy cell leukemia (HCL). It is shown that HCs readily adhere to, and spontaneously move on, HA-coated surfaces using CD44. This indicates that activated CD44 and spontaneous movement on HA form part of the intrinsically activated phenotype of HCs. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) inhibited HC movement on HA, and this cell arrest was accompanied by increased actin polymerization and a more pronounced association of CD44 with the cytoskeleton. All of these findings are in sharp contrast to our previous observations with chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, which are nonmotile on HA, but in response to IL-8 become polarized and motile using the receptor for HA-mediated motility rather than their apparently inactive CD44. Immunohistochemical examination of HCL tissues showed the ubiquitous presence of IL-8 and the prominence of HA in bone marrow stroma and hepatic portal tracts. This suggests that CD44-HA interactions are important in HC homing to these sites, but not to splenic red pulp or hepatic sinusoids, where HA is largely absent. Moreover, engagement of CD44 on HCs stimulates fibronectin synthesis, an observation that is likely to be relevant to the restriction of fibrosis in the disease to HC-infiltrated areas containing HA.","['Aziz, K A', 'Till, K J', 'Zuzel, M', 'Cawley, J C']","['Aziz KA', 'Till KJ', 'Zuzel M', 'Cawley JC']","['Department of Haematology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Chemotaxis', 'Cytoskeleton/physiology', 'Fibronectins/biosynthesis/*blood', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/blood/*physiology', 'Hyaluronic Acid/blood/*pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin G/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-8/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/pharmacology', 'Microscopy, Video', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitronectin/pharmacology']",,2000/10/26 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/26 11:00'],"['2000/10/26 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/26 11:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48346-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Nov 1;96(9):3161-7.,"['0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Vitronectin)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Purified P-selectin is oligomeric and has increased avidity for its ligand relative to the monomeric form, but whether P-selectin self-associates in the membrane of intact cells is not known. A chemical cross-linking approach was used to show that P-selectin is present as noncovalent dimers in resting platelets, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and heterologous RIN5F cells expressing P-selectin. The results of 2-dimensional isoelectric focusing are consistent in showing P-selectin dimers as homodimers, but they are composed of a more basic subset of P-selectin than the monomers. This suggests that the dimers are a biochemically distinct subset of P-selectin. P-selectin dimers form in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments of human umbilical vein endothelial cells only after synthesis of the mature P-selectin subunit, and are not preferentially stored in Weibel-Palade bodies as compared with the monomeric form. Platelet activation with thrombin receptor-activating peptide leads to the presence of P-selectin monomers and homodimers on the cell surface as well as P-selectin heterodimers, which are composed of P-selectin and an unidentified protein of approximately 81 kd molecular weight. In summary, these studies demonstrate that P-selectin is homodimeric in situ and that platelet activation leads to the formation of an additional activation-specific heterodimeric species. In addition, the homodimer has unique biochemical characteristics compared with the monomeric form, and dimerization occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments of endothelial cells.","['Barkalow, F J', 'Barkalow, K L', 'Mayadas, T N']","['Barkalow FJ', 'Barkalow KL', 'Mayadas TN']","[""Department of Pathology and the Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Blood Platelets/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Dimerization', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/physiology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*physiology', 'Golgi Apparatus/physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Organelles/physiology', 'P-Selectin/blood/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Umbilical Veins']",,2000/10/26 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/26 11:00'],"['2000/10/26 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/26 11:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)48334-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Nov 1;96(9):3070-7.,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (P-Selectin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,"['DK51643/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'NS33296/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Subgroup-adjusted treatment has already greatly improved treatment outcomes in T- and mature B-cell ALL. These approaches should be further refined, for example, in T-ALL with cyclophosphamide and cytarabine, in pro-B ALL with high-dose cytarabine (HdAC), in B-precursor ALL with high-dose methotrexate (HdM) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), and in mature B-ALL with HdM and HdAC. The indications for SCT will be extended to include elderly patients undergoing allogeneic mini-transplants, and tumor eradication will be improved by better conditioning regimens such as radioimmunoconjugates and methods to induce the graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect, such as donor leukocyte infusions (DLI) or allogeneic mini-transplants applied after autologous transplants. Molecular therapeutic approaches, for example, those directed against the fusion protein BCR-ABL with ABL-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, are on the way to creating a new avenue for the treatment of ALL. In the future, drug resistance should be exploited as a pretherapeutic test for treatment strategies, but whether multidrug resistance modulation with available drugs will be used in ALL remains open. Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of cytostatic drugs and the pharmacogenomics of cytostatic agents in adult ALL may contribute to the development of individualized treatment strategies with higher efficacy and lower toxicity. Minimal residual disease (MRD) evaluation is attractive in adult ALL, because it can be determined in a very high percentage of patients. It has been shown to be predictive for relapse and might be of benefit for redefinition of complete remission (CR), for determination of the efficacy of single treatment elements, and for treatment tailoring during the course of disease. New treatment approaches include also several forms of immunotherapy for B- as well as T-lineage ALL; after the demonstration that such approaches are also effective in ALL, their optimal place in the treatment strategy for adult ALL can be determined.","['Hoelzer, D', 'Gokbuget, N']","['Hoelzer D', 'Gokbuget N']","['J.W.

New and exciting strategies being developed for use in conjunction with transplant will be useful in overcoming tumor resistance. It is now clear that a significant part of the antitumor effect of allogeneic stem cell transplantation is derived from the graft itself and is independent of the preparative regimen. Immune therapy derived from the donor's graft is uniquely suited for killing chemoresistant tumor cells and may prove to be an invaluable tool for decreasing the risk of relapse in patients with advanced disease. Among patients who have relapsed after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), an immunologically based antitumor effect may be obtained simply by transfusing T cells obtained by leukopheresis of the original bone marrow donor. Referred to as donor leukocyte infusion (DLI), this technique has been used to obtain complete remissions in relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Another approach that uses the donor's graft to obtain a potent antitumor effect is the combination of nonmyeloablative BMT followed by immunotherapy with DLI. Numerous investigators are exploring ways of combining autologous BMT with immune therapy. Animal studies using tumor vaccines in conjunction with autologous transplantation offer a promising method for eliminating tumor. Patients undergoing autologous transplantation may have marrow that has been contaminated with tumor, which places them at a higher risk of relapse.

Human data, including stem cell migration, adhesion receptor expression, and manipulations for gene therapy, are reviewed. The NOD/scid mouse model serves as a bridge between the basic bench work and human clinical trials, and we discuss applications related to umbilical cord blood and gene therapy, as well as discuss the inherent variability of this system. Finally, we address unique clinical applications in gene therapy, high-dose cell transplants, minimal myeloablation, and cellular immune therapy as approaches to treatment of for patients with hematologic malignancies.","['Ballen, K K', 'Becker, P S', 'Stewart, F M', 'Quesenberry, P J']","['Ballen KK', 'Becker PS', 'Stewart FM', 'Quesenberry PJ']","['University of Massachusetts Cancer Center, Worcester, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,IM,"['Animals', 'Fetal Blood', '*Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/pathology/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy/methods', 'Mice', 'Models, Animal', '*Stem Cells', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,2000/10/26 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/26 11:00'],"['2000/10/26 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/26 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2000 Oct;27(5):512-23.,,,,104,,,,,,,,,

Through the transfer of genes into hematopoietic stem cells, one can reduce the sensitivity of myeloid cells to chemotherapy. Donor T cells can be modified to become sensitive to otherwise nontoxic prodrugs, allowing for their safer use as effectors in graft-versus-leukemia immune reactions following allogeneic transplantation. Neoplastic cells also may be modified to enhance their sensitivity to various drugs. Finally, neoplastic cells can be modified to enhance their immunogenicity using genes that encode immune stimulatory cytokines or cell surface proteins. Recent studies, for example, indicate that the stealth-like phenotype of leukemia cells can be reversed through transfer of genes such as the one encoding CD154, the ligand for CD40. A phase I clinical trial using autologous CD154-transduced leukemia cells as a cellular vaccine has provided encouraging results. Indeed, we may soon enter an era of effective gene therapy for hematologic malignancies.","['Wierda, W G', 'Kipps, T J']","['Wierda WG', 'Kipps TJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0663, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Gene Transfer, Horizontal', '*Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes']",,2000/10/26 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/26 11:00'],"['2000/10/26 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/26 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2000 Oct;27(5):502-11.,['0 (Cancer Vaccines)'],,,71,,,,,,,,,

Following ALA administration PpIX increased in all leukemic cell lines under investigation (HEL 26-fold, HL60 6-fold, Jurkat 3-fold, ML2 2-fold) but not in lymphocytes. Compared to other cell lines studied, HEL cells showed the lowest basal level of PpIX and the largest relative increase in PpIX. Despite a high increase following ALA treatment, the PpIX level in HEL cells is almost as low as in lymphocytes. It is in agreement with their relatively low sensitivities of ALA-induced photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) shown previously [(Grebenova, D., Cajthamlova, H., Bartosova, J., Marinov, J., Klamova, H., Fuchs, O., Hrkal, Z., 1998.

The ferrochelatase activities in the individual cell lines are in good inverse correlation with PpIX amounts accumulated in the ALA-induced cells, but not with the relative increase (ratio) of PpIX levels from basal to ALA-induced ones. This is most apparent in HEL cells and lymphocytes. There is probably different regulation of heme biosynthesis in erythroid cells, which are therefore not suitable for the studies of ALA-PDT mechanism. PpIX was accumulated more extensively in absence of fetal calf serum than in its presence. The amounts of PpIX accumulated in cells decreased exponentially with increasing fetal calf serum concentration.","['Bartosova, J', 'Hrkal, Z']","['Bartosova J', 'Hrkal Z']","['Department of Cellular Biochemistry, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, Prague, Czech Republic. jitka@uhkt.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol,Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

The addition of cytarabine can reduce the number of Ph positive metaphases. The achievement of cytogenetic response is connected with longer survival of patients with chronic myeloic leukaemia. The aim of the study was the evaluation of the achievement of hematologic and cytogenetic response as well as adverse effects of the treatment in chronic myeloic leukaemia patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The followed was the group of 87 previously untreated CML Ph positive patients. 34 patients with the median age of 44.6 years were treated with hydroxyurea, 42 patients were treated with single interferon alpha and 11 patients with the median age of 41.3 years with the combined interferon plus cytarabine therapy. The complete hematologic remission occurred in only 17.5% of patients treated with hydroxyurea, but in 35.7% treated with interferon and in 54.5% patients treated with the combined therapy. The cytogenetic response we have not found in any of hydroxyurea treated patients, in the group of interferon alpha in 38%. The highest number of cytogenetic responses was in the group treated with interferon plus cytarabine. As we have expected, the addition of cytarabine increased hematotoxicity and gastrotoxicity. CONCLUSION: Based on the published date, that show a better survival of patients with the achieved cytogenetic response as well as the higher number of cytogenetic responses in the group of interferon plus cytarabine therapy from our observation, we believe, that combined therapy should be suitable as a front-line therapy of chronic myeloic leukaemia patients.","['Tothova, E', 'Fricova, M', 'Stecova, N', 'Kafkova, A', 'Mudronova, B', 'Svorcova, E', 'Guman, T', 'Raffac, S', 'Hlebaskova, M']","['Tothova E', 'Fricova M', 'Stecova N', 'Kafkova A', 'Mudronova B', 'Svorcova E', 'Guman T', 'Raffac S', 'Hlebaskova M']","['Klinika hematologie LF UPJS a FNsP, Kosice.']",['slo'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome']",,2000/10/26 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/26 11:00'],"['2000/10/26 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/26 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 2000 Jul 19;139(14):437-9.,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,Hematologicka a cytogeneticka odpoved na liecbu u chorych s chronickou myeloickou leukemiou.,,,,,,,,,,

They correspond to the major system eliminating abnormal proteins, short half-life proteins and proteins controlling the cell cycle. They are essential for the production of peptides subsequently presented by the MHC-I. They are formed by a proteolytic core (the 20S proteasome) made of 4 rings of 7 proteic subunits associated with regulatory complexes (namely the 19S complex forming the 26S proteasome). Using classical cell biology techniques (cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, Western blot) our group has particularly studied the proteasome expression of leukaemic cell lines (U937 and CCRF-CEM) during in vitro differentiation induced by PMA and Vitamin D plus retinoic acid. During differentiation, the level of proteasome expression and its localization vary. The various monoclonal antibodies used provided different patterns according to the different subunits. There was a general trend to a disappearance of nuclear proteasome and to a decrease in their cytoplasmic expression. In contrast, proteosomal antigens were increased on the cell membrane and in culture supernatants. We derived an ELISA test to measure plasma proteasome concentrations. Preliminary results showed differences between patients with haemopoietic malignancies or solid tumors and normal donors. Proteasome levels varied under treatment. They were correlated with LDH levels. Taken together, these results argue in favor of a role for cellular proteasomes in malignant differentiation process, and emphasize the qualitative changes in proteasome expression. Plasma proteasomes do not only reflect tumor cell mass and could play a role in addition to their proteolytic activity. They seem to be a relevant tool for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic monitoring.","['Lavabre-Bertrand, T', 'Henry, L', 'Guiraud, I', 'Carillo, S', 'Bureau, J P']","['Lavabre-Bertrand T', 'Henry L', 'Guiraud I', 'Carillo S', 'Bureau JP']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire et de Cytogenetique Moleculaire.

PKHs are a family of lipophilic, fluorescent membrane intercalating dyes.

Despite the presence of HOXB1 and PBX1, this enhancer fails to activate reporter gene expression in retinoic acid-treated P19 cell monolayers. Activation requires cell aggregation in addition to RA. This suggests that HOX-PBX complexes may repress transcription under some conditions. Consistent with this, multimerized HOX-PBX binding sites repress reporter gene expression in HEK293 cells. We provide a mechanistic basis for repressor function by demonstrating that a corepressor complex, including histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1 and 3, mSIN3B, and N-CoR/SMRT, interacts with PBX1A. We map a site of interaction with HDAC1 to the PBX1 N terminus and show that the PBX partner is required for repression by the HOX-PBX complex. Treatment with the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A not only relieves repression but also converts the HOX-PBX complex to a net activator of transcription. We show that this activation function is mediated by the recruitment of the coactivator CREB-binding protein by the HOX partner. Interestingly, HOX-PBX complexes are switched from transcriptional repressors to activators in response to protein kinase A signaling or cell aggregation. Together, our results suggest a model whereby the HOX-PBX complex can act as a repressor or activator of transcription via association with corepressors and coactivators. The model implies that cell signaling is a direct determinant of HOX-PBX function in the patterning of the animal embryo.","['Saleh, M', 'Rambaldi, I', 'Yang, X J', 'Featherstone, M S']","['Saleh M', 'Rambaldi I', 'Yang XJ', 'Featherstone MS']","['McGill Cancer Centre, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3G 1Y6.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Acetyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC102167,2000/10/25 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/25 11:00'],"['2000/10/25 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/25 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.20.22.8623-8633.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2000 Nov;20(22):8623-33. doi: 10.1128/MCB.20.22.8623-8633.2000.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (HOXB1 homeodomain protein)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxd4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '145420-66-2 (HOXD10 protein, human)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Crebbp protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The absence of Msh2 or Mlh1, two key molecules that mediate mismatch repair in eukaryotic cells, increases the frequency of mutation and also alters the response of some cells to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. To understand the way these changes contribute to cancer predisposition, we examined the effects of defective mismatch repair on the multistep process of pre-B-cell transformation by Abelson murine leukemia virus. In this model, primary transformants undergo a prolonged apoptotic crisis followed by the emergence of fully transformed cell lines. The latter event is correlated to a loss of function of the p53 tumor suppressor protein and down-modulation of the p53 regulatory protein p19Arf. Analyses of primary transformants from Msh2 null mice and their wild-type littermates revealed that both types of cells undergo crisis. However, primary transformants from Msh2 null animals recover with accelerated kinetics, a phenomenon that is strongly correlated to the appearance of cells that have lost p53 function. Analysis of the kinetics with which p53 function is lost revealed that this change provides the dominant stimulus for emergence from crisis. Therefore, the absence of mismatch repair alters the molecular mechanisms involved in transformation by affecting a gene that controls apoptosis and cell cycle progression, rather than by affecting these processes directly.","['Jenab-Wolcott, J', 'Rodriguez-Correa, D', 'Reitmair, A H', 'Mak, T', 'Rosenberg, N']","['Jenab-Wolcott J', 'Rodriguez-Correa D', 'Reitmair AH', 'Mak T', 'Rosenberg N']","['Departments of Pathology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/pathogenicity', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology/*virology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*genetics', 'DNA Repair/genetics', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'MutS Homolog 2 Protein', 'Mutation', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/pathology/*virology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",PMC102144,2000/10/25 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/25 11:00'],"['2000/10/25 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/25 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.20.22.8373-8381.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2000 Nov;20(22):8373-81. doi: 10.1128/MCB.20.22.8373-8381.2000.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (Msh2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutS Homolog 2 Protein)']",,,,"['GM08448/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T35 HL007785/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL07785/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008448/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA033771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 HL007785/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Although the potential therapeutic value of arsenite may lie in triggering apoptosis, it has not been established that cytotoxicity is the sole mechanism of action. We have used a myelomonocytic leukemia cell line (U937) to characterize the concentration-dependent effects of arsenite on cell growth, viability, apoptosis, and differentiation. Arsenite has multiple effects on U937 cells. Low concentrations of arsenite (i.e., < or = 1 microM) potentiate vitamin-D(3)-induced differentiation. Two markers of monocyte differentiation, Mac-1 expression and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, are increased in arsenite-exposed, D(3)-costimulated cells. Concentrations of arsenite >10 microM rapidly induce the death of cells irrespective of cell cycle phase. Intermediate concentrations of arsenite (i.e., 5 to 10 microM) are cytostatic initially. Cell cycle analysis using elutriated, synchronous cell populations revealed that intermediate concentrations of arsenite delay both G(1) and G(2) transit. G(2) cells appear to be most sensitive to arsenite, in that transit through G(2)/M is more delayed than transit through G(1), and apoptosis is induced in these cells as they emerge from an aberrant G(2)/M. Arsenite-induced apoptosis was caspase-3 dependent. Arsenite-mediated cytotoxicity was reduced in the presence of the broad caspase inhibitor Z-Val-Ala-DL-Asp-fluoromethylketone; however, caspase inhibition did not reverse arsenite-induced cytostasis. Thus, arsenite has multiple effects on U937 cells that are dependent on concentration and cell cycle phase. Specifically, cell cycle transit and differentiation are more sensitive to arsenite than is the induction of apoptosis.","['McCabe, M J Jr', 'Singh, K P', 'Reddy, S A', 'Chelladurai, B', 'Pounds, J G', 'Reiners, J J Jr', 'States, J C']","['McCabe MJ Jr', 'Singh KP', 'Reddy SA', 'Chelladurai B', 'Pounds JG', 'Reiners JJ Jr', 'States JC']","['Institute of Chemical Toxicology, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA.

Janus tyrosine kinase (Jak)3 and transcription factors Stat5a and Stat5b are essential for the proliferation of normal T cells and are constitutively hyperactivated in both HTLV-1-transformed human T cell lines and lymphocytes isolated from HTLV-1-infected patients; therefore, a critical role for the Jak3-Stat5 pathway in the progression of this disease has been postulated. We recently reported that tyrphostin AG-490 selectively blocked IL-2 activation of Jak3/Stat5 and growth of murine T cell lines. Here we demonstrate that disruption of Jak3/Stat5a/b signaling with AG-490 (50 microM) blocked the proliferation of primary human T lymphocytes, but paradoxically failed to inhibit the proliferation of HTLV-1-transformed human T cell lines, HuT-102 and MT-2. Structural homologues of AG-490 also inhibited the proliferation of primary human T cells, but not HTLV-1-infected cells. Disruption of constitutive Jak3/Stat5 activation by AG-490 was demonstrated by inhibition of 1) tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3, Stat5a (Tyr(694)), and Stat5b (Tyr(699)); 2) serine phosphorylation of Stat5a (Ser(726)) as determined by a novel phosphospecific Ab; and 3) Stat5a/b DNA binding to the Stat5-responsive beta-casein promoter. In contrast, AG-490 had no effect on DNA binding by p50/p65 components of NF-kappaB, a transcription factor activated by the HTLV-1-encoded phosphoprotein, Tax. Collectively, these data suggest that the Jak3-Stat5 pathway in HTLV-1-transformed T cells has become functionally redundant for proliferation. Reversal of this functional uncoupling may be required before Jak3/Stat5 inhibitors will be useful in the treatment of this malignancy.","['Kirken, R A', 'Erwin, R A', 'Wang, L', 'Wang, Y', 'Rui, H', 'Farrar, W L']","['Kirken RA', 'Erwin RA', 'Wang L', 'Wang Y', 'Rui H', 'Farrar WL']","['Department of Integrative Biology and Pharmacology, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. rkirken@farmr1.med.uth.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*immunology/*pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*immunology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification/metabolism/*physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-15/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 3', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', '*Milk Proteins', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phytohemagglutinins/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification/metabolism/*physiology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Serine/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification/metabolism/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Tyrosine/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology']",,2000/10/25 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/25 11:00'],"['2000/10/25 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/25 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.165.9.5097 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2000 Nov 1;165(9):5097-104. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.165.9.5097.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (STAT5B protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Humans and mice contain six TRAF genes, but little is known about their in vivo expression at the single cell level. The in vivo locations of TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 were determined in human and mouse tissues by immunohistochemistry. Striking diversity was observed in the patterns of immunostaining obtained for each TRAF family protein, suggesting their expression is independently regulated in a cell type-specific manner. Dynamic regulation of TRAFs was observed in cultured PBLs, where anti-CD3 Abs, mitogenic lectins, and ILs induced marked increases in the steady-state levels of TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6. TRAF1 was also highly inducible by CD40 ligand in cultured germinal center B cells, whereas TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF5, and TRAF6 were relatively unchanged. Analysis of 83 established human tumor cell lines by semiquantitative immunoblotting methods revealed tendencies of certain cancer types to express particular TRAFs. For example, expression of TRAF1 was highly restricted, with B cell lymphomas consistently expressing this TRAF family member. Consistent with results from tumor cell lines, immunohistochemical analysis of 232 non-Hodgkin lymphomas revealed TRAF1 overexpression in 112 (48%) cases. TRAF1 protein levels were also elevated in circulating B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia specimens (n = 49) compared with normal peripheral blood B cells (p = 0.01), as determined by immunoblotting. These findings contribute to an improved understanding of the cell-specific roles of TRAFs in normal tissues and provide evidence of altered TRAF1 expression in lymphoid malignancies.","['Zapata, J M', 'Krajewska, M', 'Krajewski, S', 'Kitada, S', 'Welsh, K', 'Monks, A', 'McCloskey, N', 'Gordon, J', 'Kipps, T J', 'Gascoyne, R D', 'Shabaik, A', 'Reed, J C']","['Zapata JM', 'Krajewska M', 'Krajewski S', 'Kitada S', 'Welsh K', 'Monks A', 'McCloskey N', 'Gordon J', 'Kipps TJ', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Shabaik A', 'Reed JC']","['The Burnham Institute, Program on Apoptosis and Cell Death Regulation, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Germinal Center/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Specificity/immunology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*biosynthesis', '*Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Staining and Labeling', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/10/25 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/25 11:00'],"['2000/10/25 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/25 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.165.9.5084 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2000 Nov 1;165(9):5084-96. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.165.9.5084.,"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1)']",,,,"['CA 69381/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS36821/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The two major subtypes, gp49A and gp49B, are encoded by two different genes adjacent to each other. gp49B contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif in its cytoplasmic region and is known to function as an inhibitory molecule. In contrast, gp49A does not harbor any specific motif for signal transduction, nor has its physiological role been determined. Here we report on the stimulatory nature of gp49A by analyzing biochemical characteristics of chimeric molecules consisting of an ectodomain of Fc receptor and a C-terminal half of gp49A, namely the pretransmembrane, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic portions, expressed on the rat basophilic leukemia mast cell line. Cross-linking of the chimeric receptors evoked cytoplasmic calcium mobilization, PGD(2) release, and transcription of IL-3 and IL-4 genes, but did not elicit degranulation of the cells. The chimeric molecule could be expressed as a singlet and a homodimeric form on the cell surface. A pretransmembrane cysteine residue of gp49A was necessary for dimer formation. Dimerization was be necessary for their incorporation into glycolipid-enriched membrane fraction (GEM) upon cross-linking stimuli. The calcium mobilization response was inhibited by treatment of cells with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, an inhibitor of GEM formation. Together with these results, it was strongly suggested that gp49A could be expressed as a homodimer and elicit activation signals that lead to calcium mobilization, eicosanoid production, and cytokine gene transcription through its incorporation into GEM.","['Lee, K H', 'Ono, M', 'Inui, M', 'Yuasa, T', 'Takai, T']","['Lee KH', 'Ono M', 'Inui M', 'Yuasa T', 'Takai T']","['Department of Experimental Immunology and Core Research for Evolutionary Science and Technology Program, Japan Science and Technology Corp, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University, Seiryo, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Calcium Signaling/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Degranulation/genetics/immunology', 'Cysteine/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Dimerization', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*immunology/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/*immunology/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Membrane Microdomains/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Mice', 'Prostaglandin D2/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptor Aggregation/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, IgG/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/10/25 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/25 11:00'],"['2000/10/25 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/25 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.165.9.4970 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2000 Nov 1;165(9):4970-7. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.165.9.4970.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Gp49a protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Results from flow cytometric analysis showed that the release of cytochrome c was especially pronounced in JCS cells, and well correlated with the extent of apoptotic cell death as reported earlier.

Furthermore, it has been implicated in various immunological processes including thymic T cell maturation and embryo implantation. We investigated implication of various modalities in the application of prolonged and viable allograft to the wound, using cytokines and growth factors. MATERIALS: BALB/c and B6D2F1 strains of mice were used either as a skin graft donor or host. LIF cDNA inserted in plasmid vector or the vector alone was injected intradermally in graft skin and observed up to 21 days. LIF, LIF-receptor, gp130, as well as type 1 and 2 T helper cytokine expressions were investigated by reverse transcription polymerasse chain reaction, in situ hybridization, and histological studies. RESULTS: LIF cDNA-treated groups showed significantly improved graft survival compared to the vector-treated control in 21 days postoperatively for grafting from B6D2F1 to BALB/c and BALB/c to B6D2F1. LIF and LIF receptor mRNA expressions were observed 24 hr and 21 days posttransplantation. The gp130 expression was only observed in LIF-treated B6D2F1 to BALB/c allografting on day 21 posttransplantation. LIF transcripts were strongly present in the epidermal, dermal, and subdermal tissues as determined by an in situ hybridization of LIF-treated grafting. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that LIF cDNA treatment is an effective and beneficial adjuvant for the skin allograft survival. Improved skin allograft modulation by cytokine gene transfer is a potentially promising therapy for temporary large skin coverage.","['Akita, S', 'Ishihara, H', 'Mohammad Abdur, R', 'Fujii, T']","['Akita S', 'Ishihara H', 'Mohammad Abdur R', 'Fujii T']","['Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Nagasaki University, School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Graft Survival/genetics', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Skin/drug effects', 'Skin Transplantation/*immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology']",,2000/10/25 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/25 11:00'],"['2000/10/25 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/25 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-200010150-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2000 Oct 15;70(7):1026-31. doi: 10.1097/00007890-200010150-00007.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The genetic deficiency of PNP in humans is associated with severe T-cell immunodeficiency, while B-cell immunity remains functional. Inhibitors of PNP have been proposed for treatment of T-cell leukemia, to suppress the graft-vs.-host response, or to counter type IV autoimmune diseases without destroying humoral immunity. Calf spleen PNP is a homotrimer of polypeptide chains with 284 amino residues, molecular weight 31,541. Immucillin-H inhibits PNP with a Kd of 23 pM when only one of the three catalytic sites is occupied. Deuterium exchange occurs at 167 slow-exchange sites in 2 h when no catalytic site ligands are present. The substrate analogue and product prevented H/D exchange at 10 of the sites. Immucillin-H protected 32 protons from exchange at full saturation. When one of the three subunits of the homotrimer is filled with immucillin-H, and 27 protons are protected from exchange in all three subunits. Deuterium incorporation in peptides from residues 132-152 decreased in all complexes of PNP. The rate and/or extent of deuterium incorporation in peptides from residues 29-49, 50-70, 81-98, and 112-124 decreased only in the complex with the transition state analogue. The peptide-specific H/D exchange demonstrates that (1) the enzyme is most compact in the complex with immucillin-H, and (2) filling a single catalytic site of the trimer reduces H/D exchange in the same peptides in adjacent subunits. The peptides most highly influenced by the inhibitor surround the catalytic site, providing evidence for reduced protein dynamic motion caused by the transition state analogue.","['Wang, F', 'Miles, R W', 'Kicska, G', 'Nieves, E', 'Schramm, V L', 'Angeletti, R H']","['Wang F', 'Miles RW', 'Kicska G', 'Nieves E', 'Schramm VL', 'Angeletti RH']","['Laboratory for Macromolecular Analysis and Proteomics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Protein Sci,Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,9211750,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Purine Nucleosides', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidinones/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Pyrroles/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Solvents']",PMC2144693,2000/10/25 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/25 11:00'],"['2000/10/25 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/25 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1110/ps.9.9.1660 [doi]'],ppublish,Protein Sci. 2000 Sep;9(9):1660-8. doi: 10.1110/ps.9.9.1660.,"['0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Solvents)', '426X066ELK (forodesine)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)']",,,,"['GM41916/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-09113/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The extent of 3H-thymidine incorporation into activated cells was tested when cultured with various concentrations of Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). A paradoxical dose-response curve resulted when ACTH caused a biphasic response of augmenting and inhibiting 3H-thymidine uptake in lymphocytes depending on the hormone concentration. Low levels of ACTH (0.001-1-nM) augmented 3H-thymidine uptake and high levels (10-1000 nM) reversed the effect. The optimal ACTH concentration was 10 pM ACTH in the presence of 5 ug/ml ConA and there was no ACTH effect on quiescent cells (no ConA). Conditioned media from splenic lymphocytes treated with various concentrations of ConA or ACTH was tested for increased uptake of 3H-thymidine by the IL-2 growth dependent Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Leukemia (CTLL-2) cells. ConA conditioned medium could sustain the CTLL-2 cells indicating the presence of IL-2. Conditioned medium from splenic lymphocytes treated with both ConA and 100 pM ACTH further increased CTLL-2 cell proliferation indicating an additional increase of IL-2 secretion. The identity of IL-2 was confirmed by using an anti-rat IL-2 antibody to neutralize the growth potential of the conditioned medium. ACTH alone had no effect on the CTLL-2 cell proliferation indicating the effect is due solely to induced IL-2 found in the conditioned medium. IL-2 levels in the conditioned media were quantitated by ELISA assay; splenic lymphocytes produced 4.2 ng/ml to ConA only, 19.2 ng/ml in ConA plus 10 nM ACTH, and no detectable IL-2 at ConA plus 10 uM ACTH. These results demonstrated that ACTH modulates IL-2 secretion from activated lymphocytes, which is both biphasic and concentration dependent.","['Wermerskirchen, A S', 'LaTocha, D H', 'Clarke, B L']","['Wermerskirchen AS', 'LaTocha DH', 'Clarke BL']","['Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Minnesota at Duluth, 55812, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,IM,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Concanavalin A/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Corticotropin/physiology', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",,2000/10/25 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/25 11:00'],"['2000/10/25 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/25 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0024320500008109 [pii]', '10.1016/s0024-3205(00)00810-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2000 Sep 22;67(18):2177-87. doi: 10.1016/s0024-3205(00)00810-9.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Corticotropin)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) has been the renal replacement therapy for the past 5 years since a failed cadaveric renal transplant. Past medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, anemia, bilateral subclavian vein thrombosis with superior vena cava syndrome, secondary hyperparathyroidism, leukemia (at age 8), and hyperlipidemia. On presentation, soft tissue nodules were noted in the anterolateral surfaces of the legs. After 3 months of continued low-calcium-dialysate CCPD, calcitriol, and oral phosphate binders, a 2 x 3 cm nodule was noted on the posterior aspect of the thorax at the scapula.

Radiological examination revealed a 3 x 4 cm soft tissue opacity in the superior segment of the left lower lobe laterally. Despite a prior subtotal parathyroidectomy, phosphate binders, and calcitriol, the parathyroid hormone levels continued to increase, with development of tumoral calcinosis, worsening renal osteodystrophy, and calciphylaxis. Computed tomography examination revealed extensive soft tissue calcification consistent with tumoral calcinosis. An ulcerative lesion (1 cm) developed on the lateral aspect of the upper thigh owing to warfarin necrosis versus calciphylaxis. At this time, the phosphate binder was changed from calcium acetate to sevelamer hydrochloride. Aggressive wound treatment and aggressive calcium and phosphate control added to the treatment regimen has resulted in healing of the single ulcer and a decrease in the size of the tumoral lesions.

A patient with CTCL had slowly developing skin tumors as well as chronic leukemia. The tumor cell was CD4+ CD7- Th2 cells lacking T-cell receptor/CD3 complex and persistently occupied 27% to 48% of peripheral blood lymphocytes. In skin tumors, only 13% of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were malignant cells and substantial numbers of nonmalignant CD4+ or CD8+ T cells and B cells coinfiltrated. CD8+-infiltrating T cells had cytotoxic activity against the malignant T cell. Our case demonstrates the existence of the leukemic form of CTCL presenting with skin manifestation other than erythroderma and parapsoriatic patches. The nonerythrodermic feature and indolent course may be associated with the lack of T-cell receptor/CD3 expression and coinfiltration of a high percentage of nontumor lymphocytes, including tumoricidal CD8+ T cells.","['Tokura, Y', 'Yagi, H', 'Seo, N', 'Takagi, T', 'Takigawa, M']","['Tokura Y', 'Yagi H', 'Seo N', 'Takagi T', 'Takigawa M']","['Department of Dermatology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 3600 Handa-cho, Hamamatsu 431-3192, Japan. tokuray@hama-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Breast', 'CD3 Complex/*analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/*analysis', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/immunology/*pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*analysis', 'Skin Neoplasms/immunology/*pathology', 'Th2 Cells/*immunology']",,2000/10/25 11:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2000/10/25 11:00'],"['2000/10/25 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/25 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0190-9622(00)70232-5 [pii]', '10.1067/mjd.2000.101880 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 2000 Nov;43(5 Pt 2):946-54. doi: 10.1067/mjd.2000.101880.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: 39 ALL patients (age 10.7-20.5 years) who were in first remission for 3.4-14.6 years after standardized treatment with chemotherapy plus cranial irradiation (n = 25) or with chemotherapy alone (n = 14) were examined. After fasting overnight, the following parameters were investigated: body mass index (BMI) of patients and their parents; patients' BMI before ALL therapy; serum free thyroxin, growth hormone-dependent factors, estradiol, testosterone, cortisol, leptin and c-peptide; fat-free mass (bioelectrical impedance); resting metabolic rate (RMR, indirect calorimetry); caloric intake (24-hour recall); and physical activity (questionnaire). RMR data were applied to the fat-free mass and compared with 83 controls. RESULTS: The prevalence of obesity (criterion: BMI > 2 SDS) was significantly (p < 0.05) higher after ALL therapy (38%; irradiated patients 48%, non-irradiated patients 21%) than before therapy (3%). Compared to non-irradiated patients, irradiated patients had significantly lower RMRs (-1.07 +/- 0.24 vs. -0.32 +/- 0.21 SDS; p < 0.05), reduced physical activity levels (1.41 +/- 0.03 vs. 1.52 +/- 0.03; p < 0.05), and lower concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (-0.65 +/- 0.17 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.33 SDS; p < 0.05) and of free thyroxin (1.17 +/- 0.06 vs. 1.38 +/- 0.08 ng/dl; p < 0.05). Caloric intake was adequate. CONCLUSIONS: After ALL during childhood, patients face a higher risk of obesity. In the cranially irradiated patients, the likely causes are low physical activity, RMRs and hormonal insufficiency.","['Mayer, E I', 'Reuter, M', 'Dopfer, R E', 'Ranke, M B']","['Mayer EI', 'Reuter M', 'Dopfer RE', 'Ranke MB']","[""University Children's Hospital, Tubingen, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Horm Res,Hormone research,0366126,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Basal Metabolism', 'Body Composition', 'Body Mass Index', 'C-Peptide/blood', 'Child', '*Energy Intake', '*Energy Metabolism', 'Estradiol/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/blood', 'Leptin/analysis', 'Male', 'Obesity/*epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Testosterone/blood', 'Thyroxine/blood']",,2000/10/25 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/25 11:00'],"['2000/10/25 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/25 11:00 [entrez]']","['23566 [pii]', '10.1159/000023566 [doi]']",ppublish,Horm Res. 2000;53(4):193-9. doi: 10.1159/000023566.,"['0 (C-Peptide)', '0 (Leptin)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'Q51BO43MG4 (Thyroxine)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",,,,,"['Copyright 2000 S.

Error-prone DNA synthesis catalyzed by reverse transcriptase (RT) generates variation in retroviral populations. Structural features within RTs are likely to contribute to the high rate of errors that occur during reverse transcription. We sought to determine whether amino acids within murine leukemia virus (MLV) RT that contact the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) substrate are important for in vivo fidelity of reverse transcription. We utilized the previously described ANGIE P encapsidating cell line, which expresses the amphotropic MLV envelope and a retroviral vector (pGA-1). pGA-1 expresses the bacterial beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ), which serves as a reporter of mutations. Extensive mutagenesis was performed on residues likely to interact with the dNTP substrate, and the effects of these mutations on the fidelity of reverse transcription were determined. As expected, most substitution mutations of amino acids that directly interact with the dNTP substrate significantly reduced viral titers (>10,000-fold), indicating that these residues played a critical role in catalysis and viral replication. However, the D153A and A154S substitutions, which are predicted to affect the interactions with the triphosphate, resulted in statistically significant increases in the mutation rate. In addition, the conservative substitution F155W, which may affect interactions with the base and the ribose, increased the mutation rate 2.8-fold. Substitutions of residues in the vicinity of the dNTP-binding site also resulted in statistically significant decreases in fidelity (1. 3- to 2.4-fold). These results suggest that mutations of residues that contact the substrate dNTP can affect viral replication as well as alter the fidelity of reverse transcription.","['Halvas, E K', 'Svarovskaia, E S', 'Pathak, V K']","['Halvas EK', 'Svarovskaia ES', 'Pathak VK']","['Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center and Department of Biochemistry, West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia 26506, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Lac Operon', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Transfection', 'Virus Replication']",PMC110909,2000/10/24 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/24 11:00'],"['2000/10/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/24 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.22.10349-10358.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Nov;74(22):10349-58. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.22.10349-10358.2000.,"['0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,['CA58875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

In this study, we tested replication properties for Moloney murine leukemia viruses with targeted mutations in the PPT and in conserved sequences upstream, as well as for pools of mutants with randomized sequences in these regions. The importance of maintaining some purine residues within the PPT was indicated both by examining the evolution of random PPT pools and from the replication properties of targeted mutants. Although many different PPT sequences could support efficient replication and one mutant that contained two differences in the core PPT was found to replicate as well as the wild type, some sequences in the core PPT clearly conferred advantages over others. Contributions of sequences upstream of the core PPT were examined with deletion mutants. A conserved T-stretch within the upstream sequence was examined in detail and found to be unimportant to helper functions. Evolution of virus pools containing randomized T-stretch sequences demonstrated marked preference for the wild-type sequence in six of its eight positions. These findings demonstrate that maintenance of the T-rich element is more important to viral replication than is maintenance of the core PPT.","['Robson, N D', 'Telesnitsky, A']","['Robson ND', 'Telesnitsky A']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-0620, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/*genetics', 'Genetic Variation', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/*physiology', 'Mutation', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Purines/*chemistry', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Virus Replication']",PMC110903,2000/10/24 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/24 11:00'],"['2000/10/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/24 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.22.10293-10303.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Nov;74(22):10293-303. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.22.10293-10303.2000.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Purines)']",,,,"['R29 CA069300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA69300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The survival time of mice bearing L1210 or P388 leukemia treated with both drugs simultaneously was not longer than that of mice treated with either of drugs alone. Combination of 2-CdA and DEX in doses 5 and 10 mg/kg resulted in decrease of survival time of animals bearing P388 leukemia as compared with the control group without any treatment. Our study revealed that combination of 2-CdA with DEX in both leukemias is not more effective than 2-CdA alone.

Between April 1985 and December 1995, all patients with newly diagnosed AML admitted to our institution with an initial white blood cell (WBC) count greater than 100 x 10(9)/l were scheduled to undergo leukapheresis. This represented 53 patients (median age 59 years, range 16-78 years) who underwent from 1 to 4 sets of leukapheresis (median 1).

Analysis of cell cycle was performed on bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood leukemic cells before and after leukapheresis in three cases.

Furthermore, the influence of dFdC on the level of intracellular metabolites of 2-CdA was studied using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Apoptosis was evaluated using flow cytometry with 7-aminoactinomycin D. In MNCs of patients with CLL, dFdC + 2-CdA showed an antagonistic effect when applied simultaneously. This antagonism was reduced by consecutive application. The combination of dFdC with doxorubicin was synergistic, independent of incubation schedule. In blasts from newly diagnosed patients with de novo AML, all drug combinations (dFdC+2-CdA, doxorubicin, or cytosine arabinoside) were antagonistic by simultaneous incubation. Reduced antagonism or even synergism was shown (P<0.001) by consecutive incubation. The simultaneous combination of dFdC with 2-CdA in all tested cell lines resulted in a competitive inhibition on the rate of apoptosis. By changing the incubation period to a consecutive schedule, the antagonism was diminished or synergism of apoptosis was measured (P< 0.001). Using similar incubation conditions, these experiments were supported by HPLC measurement of intracellular metabolites of 2-CdA influenced by dFdC application. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the efficacy of dFdC in vitro in combination with other cytotoxic drugs depends on the incubation condition and on the origin of neoplastic cells (lymphatic vs myeloid). The data suggest that simultaneous combination therapy with purine and pyrimidine analogues may not improve the clinical efficacy of one or the other drug administered alone.","['Chow, K U', 'Ries, J', 'Weidmann, E', 'Pourebrahim, F', 'Napieralski, S', 'Stieler, M', 'Boehrer, S', 'Rummel, M J', 'Stein, J', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Mitrou, P S']","['Chow KU', 'Ries J', 'Weidmann E', 'Pourebrahim F', 'Napieralski S', 'Stieler M', 'Boehrer S', 'Rummel MJ', 'Stein J', 'Hoelzer D', 'Mitrou PS']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology/Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Anthracyclines/*pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphatic System/*cytology', 'Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology']",,2000/10/24 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/24 11:00'],"['2000/10/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/24 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770000181 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2000 Sep;79(9):485-92. doi: 10.1007/s002770000181.,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The 2- to 4-cell embryos of CB6F1 mice were cultured in the human tubal fluid (HTF) media containing different concentrations of LIF. Mouse embryos were divided into seven groups: (1) HTF; (2) 1500 IU/ml LIF; (3) 1000 IU/ml LIF; (4) 750 IU/ml LIF; (5) 500 IU/ml LIF; (6) 250 IU/ml LIF; (7) 125 IU/ml LIF. The embryonic numbers of different stages including 5-8 cell, 9-16 cell, morula, blastocyst, and hatching blastocyst were recorded. RESULTS: The percentage of early embryo stage (2-cell embryos to 6- to 16-cell stages) in all groups were nonsignificantly different. There were higher formation rates of preimplantation embryos (morula to hatching blastocyst) in groups 2, 3, 4, and 5 than in groups 1, 6 and 7. CONCLUSIONS: LIF has positive effects on preimplantation embryo development and has nonsignificant influence on the early embryo development.

The pre-leukemic phase of the disease results from the abnormal activation of the Erythropoietin (Epo) receptor by the gp55 env gene product of SFFV. Later in disease progression, the emergence of leukemic clones is associated with recurrent genetic events, in particular the activation of the expression of SPI-1, an ETS family transcriptional regulator. We show here that the expression of either SPI-1 or GP55 with the mouse EPOR in avian primary erythroblasts only marginally affects their normal Epo-induced terminal differentiation. In contrast, the co-expression of GP55 and SPI-1 resulted in inhibition of Epo-induced differentiation of EPOR-expressing erythroblasts, promoting instead their proliferation. Co-expression of SPI-1 and GP55 also inhibited the apoptotic cell death program normally induced in response to Epo withdrawal. This cooperation between SPI-1 and GP55 to induce primary erythroblast transformation suggests that progression of Friend erythroleukemia critically depends upon inter-dependent interactions between the molecular events specific of the early and late phase of the disease.","['Pereira, R', 'Raingeaud, J', 'Pironin, M', 'Ghysdael, J', 'Quang, C T']","['Pereira R', 'Raingeaud J', 'Pironin M', 'Ghysdael J', 'Quang CT']","['CNRS UMR146 Institut Curie, Centre Universitaire, Bat. 110, 91405 Orsay, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/genetics/*physiology', 'Chickens', 'Erythroblasts/*cytology/metabolism/virology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/virology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology']",,2000/10/24 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/24 11:00'],"['2000/10/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/24 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1203886 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Oct 19;19(44):5106-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203886.,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein gp55, Friend spleen focus-forming virus)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Phosphorylation of p53 occurs after DNA damage thereby modulating its activity and impeding the interaction of p53 with its negative regulator oncogene Mdm2. The serines 15 and 37 present in the amino terminal region of p53 are phosphorylated by the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) in response to DNA damage. In order to verify if specific p53 mutations occur in the multi-drug resistance phenotype, we analysed the p53 gene in two T-lymphoblastoid cell lines, CCRF-CEM and its multi-drug-resistant clone CCRF-CEM VLB100, selected for resistance to vinblastine sulfate and cross-resistant to other cytotoxic drugs. Both cell lines showed two heterozygous mutations in the DNA binding domain at codons 175 and 248. The multi-drug resistant cell line, CCRF-CEM VLB100, showed an additional mutation that involves the serine 37 whose phosphorylation is important to modulate the protein activity in response to DNA damage. The effects of these mutations on p53 transactivation capacity were evaluated. The activity of p53 on pro-apoptotic genes expression in response to DNA damage induced by (-irradiation, was affected in the vinblastine (VLB) resistant cell line but not in CCRF-CEM sensitive cell line resulting in a much reduced apoptotic cell death of the multi-drug resistant cells.","['Cinti, C', 'Claudio, P P', 'Luca, A D', 'Cuccurese, M', 'Howard, C M', ""D'Esposito, M"", 'Paggi, M G', 'Sala, D L', 'Azzoni, L', 'Halazonetis, T D', 'Giordano, A', 'Maraldi, N M']","['Cinti C', 'Claudio PP', 'Luca AD', 'Cuccurese M', 'Howard CM', ""D'Esposito M"", 'Paggi MG', 'Sala DL', 'Azzoni L', 'Halazonetis TD', 'Giordano A', 'Maraldi NM']","['Institute of Normal and Pathologic Cytomorphology, CNR, c/o IOR, 40136 Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Genes, p53/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Radiation Tolerance/genetics', 'Serine/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",,2000/10/24 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/24 11:00'],"['2000/10/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/24 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1203848 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Oct 19;19(44):5098-105. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203848.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Examinations of growth-affected cell populations show that SCC lines ME-180 and SiHa treated with IFN-beta undergo a specific slower progression through the S phase that seems to trigger cellular death. In combination treatment RA potentiates IFN-beta effect in SCC ME-180 but not in SiHa cell line, partially resistant to RA antiproliferative action. RA added as single agent affects cell proliferation differently by inducing a slight G1 accumulation. The IFN-beta-induced S phase lengthening parallels the increased expression of PML, a nuclear phosphoprotein specifically up-regulated at transcriptional level by IFN, whose overexpression induces cell growth inhibition and tumor suppression. We report that PML up-regulation may account for the alteration of cell cycle progression induced by IFN-beta in SCC by infecting cells with PML-PINCO recombinant retrovirus carrying the PML-3 cDNA under the control of the 5' LTR. In fact PML overexpression reproduces the IFN-beta-induced S phase lengthening. These findings provide important insight into the mechanism of tumor suppressing function of PML and could allow PML to be included in the pathways responsible for IFN-induced cell growth suppression.","['Vannucchi, S', 'Percario, Z A', 'Chiantore, M V', 'Matarrese, P', 'Chelbi-Alix, M K', 'Fagioli, M', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Malorni, W', 'Fiorucci, G', 'Romeo, G', 'Affabris, E']","['Vannucchi S', 'Percario ZA', 'Chiantore MV', 'Matarrese P', 'Chelbi-Alix MK', 'Fagioli M', 'Pelicci PG', 'Malorni W', 'Fiorucci G', 'Romeo G', 'Affabris E']","['Laboratory of Virology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'S Phase/*drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology']",,2000/10/24 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/24 11:00'],"['2000/10/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/24 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1203883 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Oct 19;19(44):5041-53. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203883.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Although all cell lines contain the same p53 mutations at codons 175 (Arg-->His) and 248 (Arg-->Gln), the constitutive levels of p53 were progressively increased with the resistance of the cells to teniposide. By pulse-chase experiments, we found that the half-lives of mutant p53 protein were approximately 12, 17, and >30 h in CEM, CEM/VM-1, and CEM/VM-1-5 cells, respectively. The prolonged half-lives of p53 in these cells is consistent with the fact that the protein harbors the indicated mutations. Of note, however, is the fact that the increased p53 protein half-lives in the two drug-resistant cell lines corresponds to a proportional decrease in MDM2 protein levels but an increase in p53-MDM2 binding interactions. This suggests that MDM2-mediated p53 degradation may be altered in our leukemic cell lines. The DNA damage-induced p53 response is fully functional in the drug-sensitive CEM cells containing a mutant p53, but this pathway is attenuated in the drug-resistant cells. Specifically, while the mutant p53 was phosphorylated at serine-15 in response to ionizing radiation in all these cell lines, mutant p53 induction in response to teniposide or ionizing radiation and induction of the p53-target genes, p21 and GADD45 only occurred in the drug-sensitive CEM cells. As assessed by MTT cytotoxicity assay, CEM cells were also significantly more sensitive to ionizing radiation, compared to the drug-resistant cell lines, and this correlated with p53 induction. Collectively, these results suggest that changes in constitutive mutant p53 protein levels, p53-MDM2 binding interactions, and altered regulation of the DNA damage-inducible p53-dependent pathway may play a role in drug- and radiation-responsiveness in these cells.","['Morgan, S E', 'Kim, R', 'Wang, P C', 'Bhat, U G', 'Kusumoto, H', 'Lu, T', 'Beck, W T']","['Morgan SE', 'Kim R', 'Wang PC', 'Bhat UG', 'Kusumoto H', 'Lu T', 'Beck WT']","['Division of Molecular Pharmacology, Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, IL 60607, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA Damage/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/radiation effects', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Teniposide/*pharmacology', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2000/10/24 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/24 11:00'],"['2000/10/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/24 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1203865 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Oct 12;19(43):5010-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203865.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (GADD45 protein)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",,,,"['CA30103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40570/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

This incubation period is significantly shortened in HTLV-1 carrier with Strongyloides stercoralis (Ss) infection, suggesting that Ss could be a cofactor of ATLL. As an increased T cell proliferation at the asymptomatic stage of HTLV-1 infection could increase the risk of malignant transformation, the effect of Ss infection on infected T lymphocytes was assessed in vivo in HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers. After real-time quantitative PCR, the mean circulating HTLV-1 proviral load was more than five times higher in HTLV-1 carriers with strongyloidiasis than in HTLV-1+ individuals without Ss infection (P<0.009). This increased proviral load was found to result from the extensive proliferation of a restricted number of infected clones, i.e. from oligoclonal expansion, as evidenced by the semiquantitative amplification of HTLV-1 flanking sequences. The positive effect of Ss on clonal expansion was reversible under effective treatment of strongyloidiasis in one patient with parasitological cure whereas no significant modification of the HTLV-1 replication pattern was observed in an additional case with strongyloidiasis treatment failure.

In this study, we demonstrate that in addition to these effects about 25% of U937 cells accumulated in an apoptotic subG1 phase after TPA treatment. The appearance of these apoptotic suspension cells was detectable throughout the time course of the culture and was independent of TPA concentrations between 0.5 and 500 nM. Experiments with cells synchronized by centrifugal elutriation revealed dominant susceptibility of G1-phase cells to TPA-mediated apoptosis. While adherent cells expressed differentiation markers including the integrin CD11c, this effect was less pronounced in the TPA-treated suspension fraction. Moreover, previous work has demonstrated cell cycle arrest in differentiating U937 cells. Accordingly, PKC activation by TPA treatment was associated with a significant expression of the cdk/cyclin inhibitor p21WAF/CIP/sdi-1 in the adherent population and subsequent G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. In contrast, suspension cells failed to induce significant levels of p21WAF/CIP/sdi-1 after TPA stimulation. Immunoblotting experiments demonstrated no difference in the expression of the pro-apoptotic factors Bax, Bad, and Bak in either control U937 and TPA-treated adherent or suspension cells, respectively. However, anti-apoptotic factors including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 were significantly induced in the adherent population whereas no induction was detectable in the suspension cells. In this context, incubation with the caspase-3/caspase-7 specific tetrapeptide inhibitor DEVD prior to TPA treatment prevented an accumulation of cells in subG1, respectively, demonstrating an involvement of these caspases. Taken together, these data suggest that PKC activation can relay distinct signaling pathways such as induction of adherence coupled with monocytic differentiation and growth arrest, or induction of caspase-mediated apoptosis coupled with the failure to adhere and to differentiate.","['Meinhardt, G', 'Roth, J', 'Hass, R']","['Meinhardt G', 'Roth J', 'Hass R']","['Medizinische Klinik Innenstadt, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Ziemssenstrasse 1, 80336 Munich, Germany. geroldmeinhardt@yahoo.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'CD18 Antigens/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells']",,2000/10/24 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/24 11:00'],"['2000/10/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/24 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cdd.4400709 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2000 Sep;7(9):795-803. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400709.,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The CD34+ cell yield was higher after mobilisation with HDCy plus rhG-CSF than after rhG-CSF alone in 21 out of 22 patients who were actually harvested after both procedures. If a patient mobilised insufficiently after rhG-CSF alone, the yield of CD34+ cells after the following HDCy priming was lower compared to patients who mobilised sufficiently after rhG-CSF priming alone. In 12 patients with B cell malignancies a reduced number of B cells such as CD10+, CD19+, CD20+ cells in bone marrow as well as in leukapheresis products was observed after HDCy plus rhG-CSF compared to rhG-CSF alone. Toxicity data revealed HDCy as a relatively toxic priming regimen with all patients hospitalised and 74% experiencing neutropenic fever and administration of intravenous antibiotics. In two patients, seizure-like episodes were observed during cyclophosphamide bolus infusion. In conclusion, HDCy increased the yield of CD34+cell and reduced B cells in leukapheresis products indicating reduced tumour cell load compared with rhG-CSF priming alone.

The stem cell source was allogeneic related bone marrow (BM) (n = 53), allogeneic unrelated BM (n = 5), allogeneic unrelated peripheral blood (PBSC) (n = 2), syngeneic BM (n = 2), autologous BM purged (n = 9) or unpurged (n = 9), autologous PBSC (n = 10). Fifty-six patients (62%) were in first CR, 26 (29%) were > first CR, and eight (9%) were transplanted in relapse. Principal toxicities in both groups were mucositis and hepatotoxicity. Forty-five mg/kg etoposide resulted in greater hepatic toxicity (P = 0.03), and a higher incidence of VOD (23 vs 12%, P = 0.04) and acute GVHD grade III/IV (13 vs 5%, NS). The treatment-related mortality was 17% in the 30 mg/kg group and 33% in the 45 mg/kg group, mainly due to infections, intestinal pneumonia and GVHD. Hematological recovery of leukocytes 1/nl was comparable in both groups (17 vs 16 days). After a median follow-up of 16 months 19% in the 30 mg/kg group and 23% in the 45 mg/kg group relapsed. In patients who had undergone allogeneic related bone marrow transplantation in first CR no relapses occurred after a median follow-up of 3 years. For all patients the 3-year estimated disease-free survival was 62% in the 30 mg/kg group and 40% in the 45 mg/kg group (P = 0.03). For patients in first CR who underwent allogeneic related stem cell transplantation the 3 year disease-free survivals were 80% and 66%, respectively (P = 0.4). We conclude that etoposide 30 mg/kg or 45 mg/kg in combination with busulfan/cyclophosphamide is a highly active regimen for bone marrow transplantation of patients with AML with a low relapse rate. However, conditioning with 30 mg/kg rather than 45 mg/kg etoposide resulted in less toxicity and a better overall survival due to a lower transplant-related mortality.

A standard measure of the efficacy of this treatment for patients is assessment of leukaemia-free survival, that is, the probability of being alive and in remission at different time intervals after transplant. During the last 10 years a new approach to managing patients who relapse after allografting was developed - namely infusion of lymphocytes (white blood cells) collected from the original donor. Such donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) are highly effective in restoring complete remission and it appears that these remissions are durable. Consequently estimates of long-term success of allografting must consider salvage of initial relapses with DLI. To do so a new estimator of treatment efficacy, called 'current leukaemia-free survival' is sometimes used in the medical literature. This curve attempts to estimate the probability that a patient is alive in an original remission or in subsequent remission after treatment with DLI at a given time after transplant. Here we show that this estimator does not actually estimate the probability of interest and we use a multi-stage model to develop a new and more appropriate estimator for 'current leukaemia-free survival'.","['Klein, J P', 'Szydlo, R M', 'Craddock, C', 'Goldman, J M']","['Klein JP', 'Szydlo RM', 'Craddock C', 'Goldman JM']","['Division of Biostatistics, Medical College of Wisconsin, P.O.

Both therapies may be suitable for younger patients. The authors reviewed current data to assist in prioritizing these modalities in an individual patient. METHODS: The authors reviewed and summarized current data on outcomes of SCT and IFN-alpha therapy in patients with early chronic phase CML. RESULTS: Several disease-, patient-, and physician-related factors affect outcomes with both modalities. Interferon-alpha does not induce myelofibrosis. The course of CML is predictable in most patients; sudden emergence of blastic phase; disease is unusual. There is no significant adverse impact of delaying SCT for the 12 months usually necessary to assess cytogenetic response to an IFN-alpha-based regimen. Interferon-alpha may be discontinued some months before SCT and is not associated with an adverse impact on post-SCT outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: An individualized risk assessment-based approach is of value in prioritizing SCT and IFN-alpha in younger patients with chronic phase CML. The authors recommend a risk-based therapy algorithm based on the expected SCT associated 1-year mortality for an individual patient.","['Kantarjian, H M', 'Giles, F J', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Giralt, S', 'Talpaz, M']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Giles FJ', ""O'Brien S"", 'Giralt S', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Leukemia, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA. hkantarj@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/prevention & control', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/10/24 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/24 11:00'],"['2000/10/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/24 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0142(20001015)89:8<1647::AID-CNCR1>3.0.CO;2-U [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20001015)89:8<1647::aid-cncr1>3.0.co;2-u [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2000 Oct 15;89(8):1647-58. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20001015)89:8<1647::aid-cncr1>3.0.co;2-u.,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],,,85,,['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,

To increase the mechanical strength of the capsule, we prepared photosensitive microcapsules that could form covalent bonds between polymers in the capsular membrane by light irradiation. Two types of photosensitive poly(allylamine), with 5% and 10% of amino groups modified by alpha-phenoxycinnamylidene acetylchloride, were synthesized. Both photopolymers exhibited an absorption maximum at 325 nm and were capable of crosslinking upon light exposure. These photosensitive polymers were used for the preparation of microcapsules. The capsules formed from this photosensitive poly(allylamine) and alginate were strengthened significantly by light irradiation. Only 28% of the microcapsules prepared from the 5%-modified photopolymer fractured after 48 h of shaking at 150 rpm. This fracture percentage is much lower when compared with the 60% of capsules fractured when prepared from the untreated poly(allylamine). By using poly(allylamine) at 10% modification, the mechanical strength was improved only slightly, with 26% of capsules fractured. Analysis of the permeability test indicated that the photo-crosslinked capsular membrane was freely permeable to cytochrome c and myoglobin, but less permeable to serum albumin. The encapsulation method was used to entrap and culture IW32 mouse leukemia cells. The cells proliferated to a density of about 1.1 x 10(7) cells/mL in the capsules after 7 days of cultivation. Concurrently, the concentration of erythropoietin in the microcapsules increased to 800 mU/mL. This new encapsulation technique has great potential in the application of a bioindustrial cell-culturing process.","['Lu, M Z', 'Lan, H L', 'Wang, F F', 'Chang, S J', 'Wang, Y J']","['Lu MZ', 'Lan HL', 'Wang FF', 'Chang SJ', 'Wang YJ']","['Institute of Biomedical Engineering, National Yang Ming University, Shih-Pai, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,IM,"['Alginates/*chemistry/radiation effects', 'Allylamine/*analogs & derivatives/*chemistry', 'Animals', 'Biotechnology/*methods', 'Cell Division', 'Cytochrome c Group/chemistry/metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/chemistry/metabolism', 'Light', 'Materials Testing', 'Mechanics', '*Membranes, Artificial', 'Mice', 'Myoglobin/chemistry/metabolism', 'Permeability', 'Photochemistry/methods', 'Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Serum Albumin/chemistry/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/10/24 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/10/24 11:00'],"['2000/10/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/24 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0290(20001205)70:5<479::AID-BIT1>3.0.CO;2-E [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0290(20001205)70:5<479::aid-bit1>3.0.co;2-e [doi]']",ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2000 Dec 5;70(5):479-83. doi: 10.1002/1097-0290(20001205)70:5<479::aid-bit1>3.0.co;2-e.,"['0 (Alginates)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Membranes, Artificial)', '0 (Myoglobin)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '48G762T011 (Allylamine)']",,,,,"['Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.']",,,,,,,

Recent in vitro studies demonstrated that As(2) O(3) effectively inhibits the growth of some cell lines derived from patients with malignant lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma. Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is an aggressive neoplasm of mature T-cell origin caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I) the prognosis of which still remains very poor. A possible role of As(2) O(3) for the treatment of ATL is demonstrated from evidence that As(2) O(3) significantly inhibits the growth of HTLV-I infected T-cell lines and induces apoptosis in fresh ATL cells at clinically achievable concentration of the agent. The growth inhibition of As(2) O(3) treated HTLV-I infected T-cell lines was induced by both apoptosis and G(1) phase accumulation. Cleaved bcl-2 protein and an enhanced expression of bak protein in the cells were coincidentally observed during As(2) O(3) treatment. A broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, z-Val-Ala-DL-Asp-fluoromethylketone inhibited the apoptosis induced by As(2) O(3). Increased expression of p53, Cip1/p21 and Kip1/p27, and dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb) were detected in the As(2) O(3) treated cells. In conclusion, As(2) O(3) might become a new therapeutic tool in the treatment of ATL as As(2) O(3) induces apoptosis by destruction of the bcl-2 protein and enhancement of the bak protein production proceeding to activate caspases, and also induces G(1) phase accumulation by enhancement of p53, Cip1/p21, Kip1/p27 and dephosphorylation of pRb to HTLV-I infected T-cell lines.","['Ishitsuka, K', 'Hanada, S', 'Uozumi, K', 'Utsunomiya, A', 'Arima, T']","['Ishitsuka K', 'Hanada S', 'Uozumi K', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Arima T']","['2nd Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan. kishkoj@med6.kufm.kagoshima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line/drug effects/virology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Genes, p53', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/virology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein']",,2000/10/24 11:00,2003/06/24 05:00,['2000/10/24 11:00'],"['2000/10/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2000/10/24 11:00 [entrez]']","['I308J991220 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190009058521 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 May;37(5-6):649-55. doi: 10.3109/10428190009058521.,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Divergent expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKI) in the cell cycle may contribute to these differences. We analysed CLL as well as low and high grade B-cell NHL for expression of G1-specific and universal CKI by competitive RT-PCR and immunostaining. p16(INK4A) expression was low in all types of neoplasms. Highest p14(ARF) /p16 beta expression levels were found in normal lymphocytes.

These leukemic cells proliferated well in vitro in response to 10-100 U/ml of IL-2, and functionally showed significant cytotoxicity against K562 target cells in a 4-hour (51) Cr release assay.

It has been suggested that the atypical morphology might be a feature of the abnormal trisomy 12 clone, but so far it has been difficult to allocate chromosomal aberrations to individual leukemic cells identified by cytomorphology. We therefore wanted to use our MGG/FISH method, which combines fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and standard cytomorphology, to study if the trisomy 12 clone in CLL was restricted to lymphocytes with atypical morphology. Peripheral blood specimens of four patients with aCLL were studied using a DNA probe against the pericentromeric region of chromosome 12. Trisomy 12 was found in 10-34 % of the lymphocytes. In three patients, the proportion of atypical and typical lymphocytes with trisomy 12 was quite comparable, and so was the percentage of atypical cells with lymphoplasmacytoid morphology and those with cleaved nucleus showing trisomy 12. Only one patient differed, since we found an overrepresentation of trisomy 12 among the atypical lymphocytes. However, this could be fully explained by the diluting effect of contaminating T-cells after chemotherapy. The results of the present study show that despite the strong association of trisomy 12 and atypical morphology in CLL, this chromosomal abnormality is not confined to lymphocytes with atypical morphology, but is also found in typical CLL cells. This supports that both cell types have the same clonal origin and that different cell morphology cannot be explained alone by the acquisition of an additional chromosome 12.","['Hjalmar, V', 'Kimby, E', 'Matutes, E', 'Sundstrom, C', 'Wallvik, J', 'Hast, R']","['Hjalmar V', 'Kimby E', 'Matutes E', 'Sundstrom C', 'Wallvik J', 'Hast R']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. viktoria.hjalmar@kids.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Coloring Agents', 'Eosine Yellowish-(YS)', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Methylene Blue', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Staining and Labeling/*methods', '*Trisomy']",,2000/10/24 00:00,2003/06/24 05:00,['2000/10/24 00:00'],"['2000/10/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2000/10/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['I308J991228 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190009058509 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 May;37(5-6):571-6. doi: 10.3109/10428190009058509.,"['0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (May-Grunwald Giemsa)', 'T42P99266K (Methylene Blue)', 'TDQ283MPCW (Eosine Yellowish-(YS))']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, recent data suggest that the response to remission induction may substantially differ according to the previous medical history of the patients. Therapy related leukemia, arising following exposure to previous alkylating agents or radiotherapy, is often associated with chromosomal abnormalities involving chromosomes 5 and 7 and has a particularly bad response, whereas AML after exposure to epipodophyllotoxins or topoisomerase-II active agents could have a somewhat better response. Acute promyelocytic leukemia secondary to treatment of a primary malignant neoplasm seems to be associated with a better response if compared to other cytotypes of AML or to AML arising after transformation of myelodysplasia. However, here the literature data are not in full agreement, as different kinds of approaches have been applied. In fact, even if the problems encountered in treating patients with secondary leukemia are similar to those seen in patients with AML arising in a background of myelodysplasia (resistant disease and prolonged cytopenia after treatment), there are data suggesting that the use of high dose ara-C, with or without fludarabine, can circumvent resistance in a small but significant number of cases. One of the unsolved problems which still remains is how to consolidate the CR induced with high dose ara-C or with cycles based on anthracycline derivatives. In addition, another question relates to the categories of patients in whom chemotherapy may change the expected survival. Intensive post-remission chemotherapy, with or without autologous HSCT, may constitute an appropriate alternative for patients lacking a suitable sibling donor or for older patients who are in remission after chemotherapy and also able to tolerate other cycles of intensive chemotherapy. In this respect, the specific cytogenetic abnormality involved should be considered the most important prognostic factor for response and disease free survival; patients with abnormalities of chromosome 5 and 7 have a particularly low possibility of response and duration of CR. Furthermore, it is still debatable whether patients, especially the elderly, with these characteristics should go through a series of conventional treatments or just receive supportive treatment. On the other hand, patients with better prognostic factors should be entitled to further intensive treatments, taking into account possible delayed recovery and/or possible less successful collection of peripheral or marrow stem cells.","['Visani, G', 'Pagano, L', 'Pulsoni, A', 'Tosi, P', 'Piccaluga, P P', 'Pastano, R', 'Grafone, T', 'Malagola, M', 'Isidori, A', 'Tura, S']","['Visani G', 'Pagano L', 'Pulsoni A', 'Tosi P', 'Piccaluga PP', 'Pastano R', 'Grafone T', 'Malagola M', 'Isidori A', 'Tura S']","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology Seragnoli-University of Bologna, Italy.

Furthermore, complex molecular alterations that include the loss of as well as the acquisition of mutations are noticed by comparing multiple genes associated with leukemia, suggesting a continuous genetic evolution.

On the other hand, LIF-R mRNAs containing unspliced introns are abundantly present in human tissues. These intronic sequences introduce a termination codon before the transmembrane domain. Human choriocarcinoma cells expressing these mRNAs release soluble LIF-R. The cytoplasmic domain of LIF-R can generate the signals for growth arrest and differentiation of mouse myeloid leukemic cells when they are induced to form a homodimer of the cytoplasmic domain independently of gp130.

In a significant proportion of cases, myeloid leukemias occur. Using conventional criteria, such leukemias resemble acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), or myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Mast cell leukemia (MCL) may also occur. Myeloid leukemias (AML, CML, CMML) can develop in indolent or aggressive mastocytosis (skin lesions present or absent) with a variable prephase of MC disease. By contrast, MCL (typically without skin lesions) often develops on a ""de novo"" basis, and, if at all recognized, a prephase resembling (malignant) mastocytosis, is short. MCL differs from myeloid leukemias (AML, CML, CMML) by morphologic and phenotypic cellular characteristics. In fact, MCL are strongly tryptase-positive, c-kit-positive, myeloperoxidase (MPO) -negative neoplasms with variable metachromasia and chloroacetate esterase expression, whereas an MPO-positive, tryptase-negative phenotype supports the diagnosis of a myeloid non-MC lineage disease. Thus, MCL, but also myeloid non-MC lineage leukemias can develop in patients with (systemic) mastocytosis. Little is known, however, about the pathophysiologic basis of co-evolution.

Investigations in our laboratory have focused on CD40, a critical regulator of B cell survival and differentiation, and its ligand, CD154 (CD40L). We have established that in some cases of CLL the malignant cells express both CD40 and CD154, and on the basis of those observations, proposed a model for CLL tumor growth due to CD40-CD154 interactions within and among the malignant cells, and for the occurrence of autoimmune syndromes in some cases of CLL. Here, we include an update on our studies regarding CD154 expression in CLL, a review of the data regarding the consequences of CD40 engagement in CLL B cells, and a discussion of these findings in the context of the complex and potentially opposite outcomes that have been reported for CD40-mediated signals in CLL. The implications for therapy, such as by impedance to CD154-CD40 interaction using antibody to CD154, or by selective inhibitors of NF-kappa B, are considered.","['Schattner, E J']",['Schattner EJ'],"['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Medical College and Immunology Program, Weill Graduate School of Medical Sciences of Cornell University, New York, NY 10021, USA. ejsch@mail.med.cornell.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Apoptosis', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Autoimmune Diseases/etiology', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/pathology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/*physiology', 'CD40 Ligand/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/etiology/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Cooperation', 'Models, Biological', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Paracrine Communication']",,2000/10/24 11:00,2003/06/24 05:00,['2000/10/24 11:00'],"['2000/10/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2000/10/24 11:00 [entrez]']","['I308J991219 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190009058499 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 May;37(5-6):461-72. doi: 10.3109/10428190009058499.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",,,113,['CA71589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Moreover, we show that TPA-induced ROS production is restored in TUR cells stably transfected to express PKCbetaII. The results also demonstrate that TPA-induced ROS production is required for activation of the MEK kinase-1 (MEKK-1)--> SAPK pathway. In concert with this observation, treatment of U-937 with H(2)O(2) as a source of ROS is associated with activation of the MEKK-1-->SAPK cascade.

The activity of the single channels in excised patches could be modulated by Ca(2+), Mg(2+), and pH. The maximal activation of these channels by divalent cation-free conditions occurred independently of depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) stores, whether in excised patches or in whole cell mode. Yet, a number of points of evidence establish these single-channel openings as amplified store-operated channel events. Specifically, (i) the single channels are exquisitely sensitive to inhibition by intracellular Ca(2+), and (ii) both the store-operated current and the single-channel openings are completely blocked by the capacitative calcium entry blocker, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borane. In addition, in Jurkat T cells single-channel openings with lower open probability have been observed in the whole cell mode with intracellular Mg(2+) present (Kerschbaum, H. H., and Cahalan, M. D.

Here we synthesized a series of N-acyl-dopamines (NADAs) and studied their effects on the anandamide membrane transporter, the anandamide amidohydrolase (fatty acid amide hydrolase, FAAH) and the two cannabinoid receptor subtypes, CB(1) and CB(2). NADAs competitively inhibited FAAH from N18TG2 cells (IC(50)=19-100 microM), as well as the binding of the selective CB(1) receptor ligand, [(3)H]SR141716A, to rat brain membranes (K(i)=250-3900 nM). The arachidonoyl (20:4 omega 6), eicosapentaenoyl (20:5 omega 3), docosapentaenoyl (22:5 omega 3), alpha-linolenoyl (18:3 omega 3) and pinolenoyl (5c,9c,12c 18:3 omega 6) homologues were also found to inhibit the anandamide membrane transporter in RBL-2H3 basophilic leukaemia and C6 glioma cells (IC(50)=17.5-33 microM). NADAs did not inhibit the binding of the CB(1)/CB(2) receptor ligand, [(3)H]WIN55,212-2, to rat spleen membranes (K(i)>10 microM). N-arachidonyl-dopamine (AA-DA) exhibited 40-fold selectivity for CB(1) (K(i)=250 nM) over CB(2) receptors, and N-docosapentaenoyl-dopamine exhibited 4-fold selectivity for the anandamide transporter over FAAH. AA-DA (0.1-10 microM) did not displace D1 and D2 dopamine-receptor high-affinity ligands from rat brain membranes, thus suggesting that this compound has little affinity for these receptors. AA-DA was more potent and efficacious than anandamide as a CB(1) agonist, as assessed by measuring the stimulatory effect on intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization in undifferentiated N18TG2 neuroblastoma cells. This effect of AA-DA was counteracted by the CB(1) antagonist SR141716A. AA-DA behaved as a CB(1) agonist in vivo by inducing hypothermia, hypo-locomotion, catalepsy and analgesia in mice (1-10 mg/kg). Finally, AA-DA potently inhibited (IC(50)=0.25 microM) the proliferation of human breast MCF-7 cancer cells, thus behaving like other CB(1) agonists. Also this effect was counteracted by SR141716A but not by the D2 antagonist haloperidol. We conclude that NADAs, and AA-DA in particular, may be novel and useful probes for the study of the ECS.","['Bisogno, T', 'Melck, D', 'Bobrov MYu', 'Gretskaya, N M', 'Bezuglov, V V', 'De Petrocellis, L', 'Di Marzo, V']","['Bisogno T', 'Melck D', 'Bobrov MYu', 'Gretskaya NM', 'Bezuglov VV', 'De Petrocellis L', 'Di Marzo V']","['Istituto per la Chimica di Molecole di Interesse Biologico, C.N.R., Via Toiano 6, 80072 Arco Felice, Napoli, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Amidohydrolases/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Arachidonic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Dopamine/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Female', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Polyunsaturated Alkamides', 'Rats', '*Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2', 'Receptors, Cannabinoid', 'Receptors, Drug/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC1221424,2000/10/24 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/24 11:00'],"['2000/10/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/24 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biochem J. 2000 Nov 1;351 Pt 3:817-24.,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Cnr2 protein, rat)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Polyunsaturated Alkamides)', '0 (Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2)', '0 (Receptors, Cannabinoid)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (fatty-acid amide hydrolase)', 'UR5G69TJKH (anandamide)', 'VTD58H1Z2X (Dopamine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore the possibility that hedgehog signaling is involved in the control of hematopoietic differentiation, we screened a panel of human leukemia cell lines for the expression of Patched1 and Smoothened, the receptor and coreceptor for hedgehog ligands. Expression was found in multiple cell lines, and Patched1 expression was detected in normal marrow. Induction of myeloid differentiation in cell lines downregulated expression of both genes. When normal marrow mononuclear cells were grown in semisolid medium in the presence of 10 microM cyclopamine, development of colonies of granulocytic/monocytic lineage was unaffected in terms of both number and morphology. The number of erythroid colonies, however, was significantly reduced (P < 0.01). Furthermore, hemoglobinization was substantially delayed relative to controls in those erythroid colonies that did form. Incubation of hematopoietic progenitors with Shh-N and GM-CSF resulted in increased granulocyte/monocyte colonies (P < 0.01); the increase was blocked by cyclopamine. Incubation of hematopoietic progenitors with Shh-N and stem cell factor resulted in larger erythroid colonies.

It also possesses chemotactic and activating properties for monocytes, macrophages, and T-cells. CD34+ progenitors isolated utilizing an avidin-biotin immunoadsorption column produced significant amounts of MIP-1alpha from 24 h onward when cultured in medium with 10% fetal calf serum (>200 pg/ml). Such production persisted through 96 h of culture and was greater when such progenitors were cocultured with a preformed marrow stromal layer (4000 pg/ml at 24 h). The production of MIP-1alpha declined over time of coculture with stromal layers, and stromal layers themselves produced minimal MIP-1alpha as detected by ELISA: <100 pg/ml. In contrast, CD34+ cells isolated by flow cytometry or by magnetic bead adsorption produced minimal MIP-1alpha (0-30 pg/ml). MIP-1alpha production also increased when cells isolated by these two methods were cocultured with stromal layers. The difference in MIP-1alpha production could not be accounted for by differences in purity of the CD34+ population between isolation methods nor on the basis of monocytic or lymphocytic contamination as assessed by the presence of CD14 or CD3 positive cells. CD34+ cells isolated by immune adsorption had increased expression of endothelial and mesenchymal associated antigens, however, suggesting that this subpopulation might account for the MIP-1alpha production observed. Freshly isolated CD34+ cells expressed MIP-1alpha message as assessed by RT-PCR and by in situ hybridization. Coculture of CD34+ cells isolated by any means with stromal cells increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) production, in this case by the stromal layer itself. Both MIP-1alpha and TGF-beta have been found to influence cell cycle status and proliferation status of early hematopoietic progenitors, and both have potential effects on accessory cell function. These studies indicate that progenitor-stromal cell interactions may influence local cytokine output, thus potentially influencing progenitor cycling status and accessory cell activation. The method of isolation of CD34+ progenitors may influence secretion of certain cytokines and chemokines.","['Liesveld, J L', 'Harbol, A W', 'Belanger, T', 'Rosell, K E', 'Abboud, C N']","['Liesveld JL', 'Harbol AW', 'Belanger T', 'Rosell KE', 'Abboud CN']","['Department of Medicine, University of Rochester Cancer Center, Rochester, New York 14642, USA. jane_liesveld@urmc.rochester.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL3', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'RNA/genetics/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/10/24 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/24 11:00'],"['2000/10/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/24 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bcmd.2000.0305 [doi]', 'S1079-9796(00)90305-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2000 Aug;26(4):261-75. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.2000.0305.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,

This study investigated the contribution of Akt and p70S6-kinase in insulin rescue from two different apoptotic triggers, serum deprivation and ceramide treatment. Insulin rescued serum-deprived immortalized brown adipocytes from apoptosis through phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and Akt pathways, but independently of p70S6-kinase, as demonstrated by the use of inhibitors such as LY294002 or Rapamycin, and transfection experiments with dominant-negative constructs of Akt or p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. A constitutively active Akt construct mimicked the insulin survival effect, decreasing the percentage of hypodiploid cells, the percentage of apoptopic cells and precluding the formation of apoptotic nuclei. We propose that the insulin survival effect on immortalized brown adipocytes is mediated through activation of Akt. However, insulin and EGF failed to rescue brown adipocytes from ceramide-induced apoptosis, as determined by DNA laddering, hypodiploid cells and apoptotic nuclei. Ceramide treatment blunted Akt activity but not PI 3-kinase activity, and insulin and EGF were unable to activate Akt. Ceramide also caused apoptosis in cells transfected with a constitutively active Akt construct, since phosphorylation of Akt was impaired under these experimental conditions. This study suggests that activation of Akt may be an absolute requirement for the survival of brown adipocytes.","['Navarro, P', 'Valverde, A M', 'Rohn, J L', 'Benito, M', 'Lorenzo, M']","['Navarro P', 'Valverde AM', 'Rohn JL', 'Benito M', 'Lorenzo M']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular II, Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad Complutense, 28040-Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Scotland,Growth Horm IGF Res,Growth hormone & IGF research : official journal of the Growth Hormone Research Society and the International IGF Research Society,9814320,IM,"['Adipocytes/*drug effects/physiology', 'Adipose Tissue, Brown/cytology/*drug effects/physiology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Ceramides/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Insulin/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/metabolism', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Transfection']",,2000/10/24 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/24 11:00'],"['2000/10/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/24 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1054/ghir.2000.0165 [doi]', 'S1096-6374(00)90165-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Growth Horm IGF Res. 2000 Oct;10(5):256-66. doi: 10.1054/ghir.2000.0165.,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (N-acetylsphingosine)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (dihydroceramide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",,,,,['Copyright 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.'],,,,,,,

Fifty-two patients underwent autologous (n = 25) or allogeneic (n = 27) SCT. The median age was 8.9 years (range 0.6-53 years). Conditioning therapy consisted of BU and cyclophosphamide. Improved disease-free survival was found in those patients with a steady-state concentration of BU (CssBU) below the median (<578 mg/ml, P = 0.05), and the same trend was noted for overall survival (P = 0.07). This was secondary to a higher incidence of NRM in the group of patients with CssBU above the median (P = 0.06). There was no significant correlation with CssBU and relapse (P = 0.31). No association between CssBU and GVHD was found in allogeneic patients (P = 0.30). Relapse was evaluated among the subgroups of age (< or >10 years) and transplant type (allogeneic or autologous) with no statistically significant association observed among these factors. Multiple regression analysis for relapse revealed no significant correlation with CssBU above or below the median, age, or transplant type. In this study, CssBU below the median did not correlate with an inferior outcome for patients with AML. Pharmacokinetic dosing of BU may be important for prevention of NRM but does not appear to influence the risk of relapse in this largely pediatric population with AML.","['Baker, K S', 'Bostrom, B', 'DeFor, T', 'Ramsay, N K', 'Woods, W G', 'Blazar, B R']","['Baker KS', 'Bostrom B', 'DeFor T', 'Ramsay NK', 'Woods WG', 'Blazar BR']","['University of Minnesota Cancer Center and Department of Pediatrics, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*metabolism/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods']",,2000/10/21 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/21 11:00'],"['2000/10/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/21 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702590 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000 Sep;26(6):607-14. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702590.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 23 long-term survivors (median age 20 years) were studied 3-18 years after bone-marrow transplantation and compared with 23 healthy controls matched for age and sex and with 13 patients in remission from leukaemia. FINDINGS: 12 (52%) of the 23 bone-marrow transplantation patients had insulin resistance, including impaired glucose tolerance in six and type 2 diabetes in four. The core signs of the metabolic syndrome (hyperinsulinaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia combined), were found in nine (39%) of the bone-marrow transplantation patients compared with one (8%) of the 13 leukaemia patients and none of the healthy controls (p=0.0015). The frequency of insulin resistance increased with the time since bone-marrow transplantation. Abdominal obesity, but not overweight, was common among the patients with insulin resistance. INTERPRETATION: Long-term survivors of bone-marrow transplantation are at substantial risk of insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and type 2 diabetes even at normal weight and young age. They also develop typical signs of the metabolic syndrome. We advocate measurement of serum lipids, fasting blood glucose, and serum insulin for the follow-up of all patients who undergo transplants in childhood, to be continued regularly and possibly life-long.","['Taskinen, M', 'Saarinen-Pihkala, U M', 'Hovi, L', 'Lipsanen-Nyman, M']","['Taskinen M', 'Saarinen-Pihkala UM', 'Hovi L', 'Lipsanen-Nyman M']","['Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University of Helsinki, Finland. mervi.taskinen@hus.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Blood Glucose/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*etiology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Finland', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hypertriglyceridemia/*etiology', 'Insulin/blood/metabolism', '*Insulin Resistance', 'Male', 'Obesity/etiology']",,2000/10/21 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/21 11:00'],"['2000/10/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/21 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(00)02717-3 [pii]', '10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02717-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 2000 Sep 16;356(9234):993-7. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02717-3.,"['0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Insulin)']","['Lancet. 2000 Sep 16;356(9234):957-8.

In this study, we further studied the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and intracellular Ca2+ in gallic acid-induced apoptosis. The enhancement of intracellular ROS in HL-60RG cells was detected dose-dependently as early as 5 min after stimulation with gallic acid by using 5,6-carboxy-2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA). Further studies that used various antioxidants and ROS scavengers showed that the intracellular peroxide level was well correlated with the potency to induce apoptosis and that the increased intracellular peroxides after gallic acid treatment seemed likely to result from the influx of H2O2 derived from superoxide which were generated extracellularly. In addition, gallic acid, HX/XO, and H2O2-induced apoptosis was completely inhibited by pretreatment with intracellular Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxyethane)-N,N,N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis (acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA-AM), but increase of intracellular peroxide levels by gallic acid were suppressed only slightly. It is suggested that intracellular ROS induced by gallic acid plays an important role in eliciting an early signal in apoptosis. Especially, H2O, which is derived from superoxide anion generated extracellularly may increase intracellular Ca2+ levels or cooperate with intracellular Ca2+, thus resulting in apoptosis induction.","['Inoue, M', 'Sakaguchi, N', 'Isuzugawa, K', 'Tani, H', 'Ogihara, Y']","['Inoue M', 'Sakaguchi N', 'Isuzugawa K', 'Tani H', 'Ogihara Y']","['Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan. inoue@phar.nagoya-cu.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,IM,"['Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Calcium/physiology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Gallic Acid/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*physiology']",,2000/10/21 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/10/21 11:00'],"['2000/10/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/21 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.23.1153 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2000 Oct;23(10):1153-7. doi: 10.1248/bpb.23.1153.,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '632XD903SP (Gallic Acid)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

TPA-induced PKC activation resulted in dephosphorylation of pRb and subsequently induced ML-1 differentiation based on morphological changes and CD14 expression. In the present study, we showed that inhibition of protein phosphatases (PP-1 and PP-2a) prevented the TPA-induced differentiation in ML-1 cells. Preinhibition of PP-1 and PP-2a activities with 1-100 nM okadaic acid dose-dependently blunted the decrease in the phosphorylation status of pRb obtained with TPA and overrode cell cycle arrest. PKA stimulation with 8-chlorophenylthio-cAMP (100 microM) decreased cell proliferation by 65% and the distribution of cells in the G1 phase significantly increased from 38% to 83% concomitant with a 34% decline in the number of cells present in the S phase.

However, the pathophysiological basis of such a coevolution has not been clarified. Recent data have shown that the c-kit mutation Asp 816 to Val is detectable in neoplastic mast cells in most patients with systemic mastocytosis, including those who have associated haematological disorders. The aim of this study was to study clonal disease evolution by analysing bone marrow cells from a patient with systemic mastocytosis and associated chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) for the presence of this mutation. METHODS: The DNA of microdissected bone marrow cells from a patient with systemic mastocytosis and associated CMML was analysed for the presence of the c-kit mutation Asp 816 to Val by means of HinfI digestion and direct sequencing of semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. RESULTS: The two neoplasms could easily be identified and discriminated in paraffin wax embedded bone marrow sections by tryptase and chloroacetate esterase staining. A total number of 10 tryptase positive systemic mastocytosis infiltrates and 10 tryptase negative CMML infiltrates were removed by microdissection. As assessed by HinfI digestion and direct sequencing of semi-nested PCR products, the c-kit mutation Asp 816 to Val was detected in five of seven systemic mastocytosis infiltrates and four of six CMML infiltrates. By contrast, no c-kit mutation Asp 816 to Val was found in bone marrow infiltrates in patients with CMML without associated systemic mastocytosis (n = 20). CONCLUSION: These data support a monoclonal evolution of systemic mastocytosis and concurrent CMML in the patient studied.","['Sotlar, K', 'Marafioti, T', 'Griesser, H', 'Theil, J', 'Aepinus, C', 'Jaussi, R', 'Stein, H', 'Valent, P', 'Horny, H P']","['Sotlar K', 'Marafioti T', 'Griesser H', 'Theil J', 'Aepinus C', 'Jaussi R', 'Stein H', 'Valent P', 'Horny HP']","['Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Mol Pathol,Molecular pathology : MP,9706282,IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Point Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics']",PMC1186968,2000/10/21 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/21 11:00'],"['2000/10/21 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/21 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/mp.53.4.188 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pathol. 2000 Aug;53(4):188-93. doi: 10.1136/mp.53.4.188.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The predisposition to infections in CLL patients has many components, including both immunodeficiency related to the leukemia itself (humoral and cellular immune dysfunction) and the results of cumulative immunosuppression related to CLL treatment. The risk of infectious complications increases with the duration of CLL, reflecting the natural history of the disease and the cumulative immunosuppression related to its treatment. Hence, in early, untreated CLL, the infectious risk is mainly related to hypogammaglobulinemia, and infections by encapsulated bacteria are common. However, in patients having advanced CLL, particularly those who receive the newer purine analogues, neutropenia and defects in cell-mediated immunity appear to be the major predisposing factors. An expanded spectrum of pathogens, including opportunistic fungi, Pneumocystis carinii, Listeria monocytogenes, mycobacteria, and herpesviruses, are seen in that setting.

The lymphoid malignancies are particularly good candidates for this therapeutic approach, due to the identification of multiple lymphocyte-specific antigens. The recent introduction of rituximab marks the beginning of a new era in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. Rituximab is one of the most active single agents for patients with refractory indolent lymphoma, producing response rates of approximately 50%, with low toxicity and a brief duration of treatment. Additional uses of rituximab are being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials, and are briefly reviewed. As a first-line agent, responses of approximately 70% are produced in patients with indolent lymphoma, with minimal toxicity. A substantial percentage of patients can be successfully retreated with rituximab, with second remission durations longer than the first remission (14-16 months versus 12 months). Multiple combination regimens using rituximab plus chemotherapy are also being evaluated. Although the role of these combined approaches is incompletely defined, high complete response rates can be obtained, with a higher rate of molecular complete remission (i.e., eradication of detectable bcl-2 rearrangements) than has been observed in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Rituximab is also being evaluated in other CD20(+) lymphoid malignancies including large-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Within the next 12 months, several additional monoclonal antibodies will be available for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies.

We have studied the contribution of CD82 proteins to the transmission of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), which is greatly dependent on cell-to-cell contacts. CD82 proteins belong to a class of cell surface molecules, the tetraspanins, that can act as molecular facilitators in cellular adhesion processes. The coexpression of CD82 proteins with HTLV-1 envelope glycoproteins resulted in marked inhibition of syncytium formation, whereas CD82 proteins had no effect on syncytium formation induced by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope proteins. The presence of CD82 proteins also inhibited cell-to-cell transmission of HTLV-1. Coimmunoprecipitation and cocapping experiments showed that CD82 associates with HTLV-1 envelope glycoproteins, both within the cell and at the cell surface. Finally, whereas the intracellular maturation of HTLV-1 glycoproteins was not modified by the presence of CD82 proteins, HTLV-1 protein coproduction delayed the intracellular maturation of CD82 proteins.

The L2 protein also can cause the relocalization of the PV early protein, E2TA, to nuclear subdomains known as promyelocytic leukemia oncogenic domains (PODs) in which it is localized. E2TA is a transcriptional transactivator that also plays a critical role in viral DNA replication. In this study, we investigated whether L2, in causing the relocalization of E2TA, alters the activities of E2TA. We provide evidence that L2 inhibits the transcriptional transactivation function of E2, but it does not specifically inhibit the capacity of E2 to support viral DNA replication. We also investigated whether the colocalization of E2 and L2 to PODs and the ability of L2 to inhibit the transcriptional transactivation activity of E2TA might be mediated through a direct interaction between these two proteins. Using an in vitro protein-protein association assay, we found that L2 binds to E2TA. Two regions in E2TA were found to mediate this interaction.

Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice have been used as the best model for studying the pathogenesis of human IDDM. To identify new autoantigens associated with IDDM, the lambda gt11-cDNA library from MIN6N8a, NOD-derived pancreatic beta cell line, was constructed and then candidate autoantigen clones were screened with prediabetic NOD sera. Nine positive clones were selected from 2x10(5)phage plaques. The nucleotide sequencing and homology searching showed that six of the nine positive clones had part of the endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia viral (MuLV) envelope gene. Nested deletion of this envelope gene revealed that the leucine zipper region in the transmembrane domain of MuLV envelope protein was the target epitope(s) reactive with prediabetic NOD mice sera. The prevalence of MuLV envelope protein-positive antibody in NOD mice was around 46%, while the non-NOD mice strains including BALB/c, ICR, C57BL/6, and SJL/J mice did not produce this envelope protein-reactive antibody. The expression of endogenous ecotropic MuLV envelope gene in NOD mouse pancreas was distinct in those with severe insulitis. However, both prediabetic and diabetic NOD mice did not show the MHC class II-restrictive cellular autoimmunity against our purified recombinant envelope protein.

We have hypothesized that expression of some apoptosis regulators is cell cycle-dependent, which in turn influences tumor cell chemosensitivity in a cell cycle-dependent fashion. To test these hypotheses, we synchronized human leukemia Jurkat T, Neo (using aphidicolin), breast cancer MCF-7, normal fibroblast, and simian virus 40-transformed cells (by aphidicolin or serum starvation), and measured levels of several Bcl-2 family proteins. The highest expression of Bcl-2 protein was found in the G(1) phase of all the five cell lines tested. In contrast, levels of Bax protein remained relatively unchanged in four of the cell lines, and levels of Bcl-X(L), Bcl-X(S), and Bak proteins showed little or no cell cycle-dependent changes in Jurkat T cells. Similar to the changes in Bcl-2 protein levels, its mRNA expression was also G(1) phase-specific, whereas the level of a Bcl-2 cleavage activity remained constitutive. When treated with an anticancer drug (etoposide or cisplatin) or the kinase inhibitor staurosporin, the cells containing a high G(1) population and a high Bcl-2 protein level were much more resistant to the induced apoptosis than the cells containing a high S phase population and a low Bcl-2 protein level. Constitutive overexpression of Bcl-2 protein in Jurkat T cells completely blocked the S phase-associated sensitivity to these apoptosis stimuli. The cell cycle-dependent Bcl-2 protein expression seems to contribute to the regulation of chemosensitivity and apoptotic commitment of human tumor cells.","['Gao, G', 'Dou, Q P']","['Gao G', 'Dou QP']","['Drug Discovery Program, H.

The bone-specific expression of a reporter gene controlled by the osteoblast-specific osteocalcin promoter after transplantation of a mixed population of marrow cells is shown.

Human, baboon, canine, and rat mesenchymal stem cells were transduced optimally with amphotropic vector supernatants. In contrast, sheep, goat, and pig mesenchymal stem cells showed highest transduction levels with xenotropic retroviral vector supernatant, and rabbit mesenchymal stem cells were transduced optimally with gibbon-ape-enveloped vectors. Using a myeloablative canine transplantation model and gene-marked canine mesenchymal stem cells, the biodistribution of infused and ex vivo expanded mesenchymal stem cells were examined. The majority of transduced canine mesenchymal stem cells were found in the bone marrow samples.

Although the symptoms of HMB have been supposed to derive from Arthus phenomenon, it has become apparent that this unique disorder has the potential to develop into so-called malignant histiocytosis (MH) or related disorders. Accordingly, the criteria for MH have been changed, and a newer diagnostic name, hemophagocytic syndrome, has been described as being associated with viral infection or leukemia/lymphoma. We previously reported that biopsy specimens taken from skin lesions demonstrated infiltration of lymphocytes bearing the phenotype of NK cells. In this study, we found that skin lesions exhibited infiltration of atypical lymphocytes around the small vessels, resembling angiocentric lymphoma, and that these infiltrating cells were positive for EBER-1 by in situ hybridization. These findings support the concept that HMB is the most important manifestation of a certain type of lymphoproliferative disease that presents with an intense local skin reaction and high fever following mosquito bites, and whose essence is the lymphoproliferation of EBV DNA-positive NK cells.","['Ishihara, S', 'Yabuta, R', 'Tokura, Y', 'Ohshima, K', 'Tagawa, S']","['Ishihara S', 'Yabuta R', 'Tokura Y', 'Ohshima K', 'Tagawa S']","['Section of Pediatrics, Kashiwara Municipal Hospital, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Culicidae', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*complications/pathology', 'Female', 'Histiocytosis, Non-Langerhans-Cell/diagnosis/virology', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/*etiology/virology', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Insect Bites and Stings/*pathology/virology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/virology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/complications/pathology/*virology', 'Male']",,2000/10/20 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/20 11:00'],"['2000/10/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/20 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2000 Aug;72(2):223-8.,,,,21,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed the available data relating to the therapeutic potential of TPO for MDS and found the following. The endogenous TPO level is elevated in MDS patients, especially in those with refractory anemia (RA). In RA patients, but not in patients with RA with excess blasts (RAEB) or RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t), both the platelet and megakaryocyte counts correlate inversely with the endogenous TPO level. This scenario indicates that the physiological mechanism for regulating the endogenous TPO level is conserved, at least in part, in RA patients. The number of TPO receptors (TPO-R) expressed on platelets and CD41+ and/or CD34+ cells in MDS is reduced to nearly half the number present in normal subjects. This is consistent with the finding that TPO-induced in vitro megakaryocytopoiesis is not uniformly observed in MDS. Meanwhile, in some patients with RAEB, RAEB-t, or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, blasts have the TPO-R mRNA and probably TPO-R protein. This fact may explain the lack of correlation between the endogenous TPO level and the platelet and megakaryocyte counts in RAEB and RAEB-t and suggests that TPO may induce blast proliferation in some cases. These findings may be of use when designing a clinical trial of TPO for MDS.","['Ogata, K', 'Tamura, H']","['Ogata K', 'Tamura H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan. ogata@nms.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Anemia, Refractory/drug therapy', 'Animals', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*drug therapy', 'Thrombocytopenia/drug therapy/etiology', 'Thrombopoietin/*therapeutic use']",,2000/10/20 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/20 11:00'],"['2000/10/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/20 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2000 Aug;72(2):173-7.,['9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)'],,,46,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic SCT from an HLA-identical sibling donor is the curative treatment option for a relatively young patient (younger than 60 years) with MDS or secondary acute myeloid leukemia. Older age and lack of sibling donors limit this application. Alternative stem cell sources, such as unrelated donors, nonidentical family members, or autologous transplants, have been used more recently. Most patients may benefit optimally from an allogeneic SCT when the transplant is performed as soon as an HLA-identical family member has been identified. Progression to more advanced leukemia conditions will be associated with a higher failure rate due to increased relapse rate after SCT and higher treatment-related mortality. Delay of the transplant may be justified in a minority of patients with refractory anemia or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts without profound cytopenias or complex cytogenetic abnormalities and no need for erythrocyte transfusions. The present data from patients transplanted with sources of hematopoietic stem cells other than histocompatible sibling donors give an indication of the potential of other forms of transplantation. The disease-free survival of patients transplanted with histocompatible sibling donors was significantly better than the outcome of patients transplanted with other sources of stem cells. About one-third of the patients transplanted with stem cells from histocompatible siblings and about one-quarter of the patients with stem cells from other sources may be free of disease for 3 years or longer. The results of these treatment forms have improved considerably, but the continuing high treatment-related mortality warrants that these patients should be treated within investigational protocols.","['De Witte, T']",['De Witte T'],"['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center St. Radboud, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

Intensification of induction therapy by the use of intermediate- or high-dose cytosine arabinoside in combination with fludarabine, idarubicin, or topotecan seemingly improved complete response (CR) rates, particularly in patients with poor prognosis karyotypes. The various high-intensity regimens appear to be comparable in inducing CR, although some are better tolerated with low mortality even in advanced-age populations with MDS. The encouraging early results with new agents, eg, topoisomerase inhibitors (topotecan) and hypomethylating agents (5-azacytidine), have been disappointing because long-term follow-up has shown continuous relapses. Regardless of the intensity of chemotherapy, remissions are short, even with continuation of intensive postremission therapy. Long-term disease-free survival remains dismal. In a large population with HR MDS treated with high-dose chemotherapy, only 5% of patients were alive at 3 years, and a majority of survivors were the younger patients with diploid karyotype refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation. Further intensification of either induction chemotherapy or postremission therapy is unlikely to improve results with current drug combinations. With these results at hand, the role of intensive chemotherapy in the management of MDS remains controversial. Because CR status is associated with clinical benefits and possibly better survival, induction of CR should remain an important aim for HR MDS. The intensive combination chemotherapy may be integrated as an initial part of the management of HR MDS, as an alternative for patients not eligible for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Regimens with low early mortality, eg, topotecan plus intermediate dose Ara-C, could also be used to reduce tumor load prior to allogeneic BMT. Induction of CR should be attempted with the most effective and best tolerated regimens, particularly, but not only, in younger patients with good performance status regardless of karyotype. Postremission therapy remains a major challenge. It should involve either allogeneic BMT or investigational approaches to eliminate or control the minimal residual disease with different mechanisms In elderly patients, allogeneic ""minitransplant"" is an investigational alternative seeking to exploit graft-versus-tumor reaction. New agents, such as farnesyl transferase inhibitors (ras inhibitors), drug-antibody conjugates (Myelotarg), thalidomide, arsenic trioxide, maintenance chemotherapy with hypomethylating agents, or oral topoisomerase inhibitors along with agents modulating factors affecting growth and differentiation, should be explored to maintain remission with minimal compromise of quality of life. Although prognostic scoring systems such as the new International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) do not predict for initial response, IPSS continues to predict survival in patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy. Although activity of new agents could be rapidly assessed in single-arm pilot studies, the final merit of high-dose chemotherapy could be assessed only in well-designed randomized trials with patients assigned according to risk-based classification and evaluated for response by generally accepted and standardized criteria.","['Beran, M']",['Beran M'],"['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, 77030, USA. mberan@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/10/20 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/20 11:00'],"['2000/10/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/20 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2000 Aug;72(2):139-50.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,79,,,,,,,,,

Six case reports].,756-63,"PURPOSE: Alpha, beta or gamma interferon (INF) are cytokines produced by cells in response to antigenic stimulation. They are used to treat various hepatic, hematological, oncological and neurological diseases. Cutaneous reactions (rash, alopecia, labial herpes, erythema, or induration at the site of injection, and more rarely cutaneous necrosis) represent 5 to 12% of side-effects observed in patients receiving INF. The authors report six cases of local cutaneous reactions to alpha INF, five of which corresponded to cutaneous necrosis. This makes them question the relevance of INF reintroduction. METHODS: The study included 5 male and 1 female patients (mean age: 59.1 years; range: 42 to 74 years old). Three patients had chronic hepatitis C, while three others presented a blood disease. RESULTS: Cutaneous necrosis occurred after 1 to 10 months of treatment. The mean time to healing was 16.2 weeks. Reintroduction of the drug including injection in other sites did not lead to recurrence of necrosis in five out of the six cases. CONCLUSION: INF-induced cutaneous necrosis does not depend on the type of INF, the site of injection, the dose and may occur 2 months to 9 years after treatment implementation. The exact mechanisms involved in cutaneous necrosis remain unknown. Morbidity is due to a very long time to healing (4 to 6 months). Futhermore, healing sometimes requires prior surgery. Physicians should be aware of the potential occurrence of erythema in patients treated by INF, as it is the first sign of necrosis. The site of injection should then be modified. In case of necrosis, risk factors for thrombophilia, factors reducing microcirculation (DHE, beta-blockers, cigarette smoking) should be investigated. INF injections should be cautiously reintroduced in other sites with the help of a nurse in case of self-injections prior to the occurrence of necrosis. Regarding self-injections patients' training should be emphasized.","['Sparsa, A', 'Loustaud-Ratti, V', 'Liozon, E', 'Denes, E', 'Soria, P', 'Bouyssou-Gauthier, M L', 'Le Brun, V', 'Boulinguez, S', 'Bedane, C', 'Scribbe-Outtas, M', 'Outtas, O', 'Labrousse, F', 'Bonnetblanc, J M', 'Bordessoule, D', 'Vidal, E']","['Sparsa A', 'Loustaud-Ratti V', 'Liozon E', 'Denes E', 'Soria P', 'Bouyssou-Gauthier ML', 'Le Brun V', 'Boulinguez S', 'Bedane C', 'Scribbe-Outtas M', 'Outtas O', 'Labrousse F', 'Bonnetblanc JM', 'Bordessoule D', 'Vidal E']","['Service de medecine interne, hopital Dupuytren, CHU, Limoges, France.']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Rev Med Interne,La Revue de medecine interne,8101383,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antiviral Agents/*adverse effects', 'Biopsy', 'Drug Eruptions/*etiology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic/therapy', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Necrosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Wound Healing']",,2000/10/20 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/20 11:00'],"['2000/10/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/20 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0248866300002216 [pii]', '10.1016/s0248-8663(00)00221-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Med Interne. 2000 Sep;21(9):756-63. doi: 10.1016/s0248-8663(00)00221-6.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",,Reactions cutanees ou necrose a l'interferon alpha: peut-on reprendre l'interferon?

Hydroxyurea, a small organic compound, has been successfully used to treat sickle cell anemia and beta-thalessaemia. Our data demonstrated that the growth rate of HEL cell proliferation was inhibited by different doses of hydroxyurea (from 50 mumol/L to 200 mumol/L). Using both routine RT-PCR and quantitative PCR analyses, we revealed that the expression of beta-globin gene was sharply activated and alpha-globin gene was almost completely silenced when HEL cells were induced for 3 or 5 days. Meanwhile, gamma-globin gene was expressed with no much difference between induced and uninduced HEL cells. We also demonstrated that the expression of GATA-1 and NF-E 2, which were two of the most important transcription factors in erythrocyte development, was activated about 3 folds in the induced cells. We suggested that the induction of GATA-1 and NF-E 2 expression by hydroxyurea might lead to activation of the adult beta-globin gene through some pathways of signal transduction, therefore, hydroxyurea might play a role to induce HEL cells to terminal differentiation.","['Gui, C Y', 'Jiang, C', 'Qian, R L']","['Gui CY', 'Jiang C', 'Qian RL']","['Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology, Academia Sinica.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Shi Yan Sheng Wu Xue Bao,Shi yan sheng wu xue bao,0413570,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Globins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/10/20 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/20 11:00'],"['2000/10/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/20 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Shi Yan Sheng Wu Xue Bao. 1997 Dec;30(4):375-82.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Ineffective platelet transfusion was strongly related to LCT positive and LCT intensity (P < 0.01). The HLA A2 gene frequency was 0.91. The frequency was much higher than that of health human being (0.54). CONCLUSION: Positive LCT was mainly immune factor for ineffective platelet transfusion.

By using murine leukemia cell lines that express no, normal, or high levels of RFC1, we demonstrate that RFC1 does not mediate thiamin influx. However, high level RFC1 expression substantially reduced accumulation of the active thiamin coenzyme, thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP). This decreased level of TPP, synthesized intracellularly from imported thiamin, resulted from RFC1-mediated efflux of TPP. This conclusion was supported by the following observations. (i) Efflux of intracellular TPP was increased in cells with high expression of RFC1. (ii) Methotrexate inhibits TPP influx. (iii) TPP competitively inhibits methotrexate influx. (iv) Loading cells, which overexpress RFC1 to high levels of methotrexate to inhibit competitively RFC1-mediated TPP efflux, augment TPP accumulation. (v) There was an inverse correlation between thiamin accumulation and RFC1 activity in cells grown at a physiological concentration of thiamin. The modulation of thiamin accumulation by RFC1 in murine leukemia cells suggests that this carrier may play a role in thiamin homeostasis and could serve as a modifying factor in thiamin nutritional deficiency as well as when the high affinity thiamin transporter is mutated.","['Zhao, R', 'Gao, F', 'Wang, Y', 'Diaz, G A', 'Gelb, B D', 'Goldman, I D']","['Zhao R', 'Gao F', 'Wang Y', 'Diaz GA', 'Gelb BD', 'Goldman ID']","['Department of Medicine and Molecular Pharmacology, and the Albert Einstein Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacokinetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Thiamine/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Thiamine Pyrophosphate/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/10/20 11:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2000/10/20 11:00'],"['2000/10/20 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/20 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M007919200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)44124-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Jan 12;276(2):1114-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M007919200.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (SLC19A2 protein, human)', '0 (Slc19a2 protein, mouse)', 'Q57971654Y (Thiamine Pyrophosphate)', 'X66NSO3N35 (Thiamine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,"['CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-82621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

In order to extend this studies, we analyzed the effect of OSM on other human glioma cell lines including A172, U343-MG and T98G. All of these cell lines express the receptor components of OSM and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) gp130, LIFR and the OSM specific OSMRbeta. Therefore, we expected these cell lines to respond to OSM and LIF. Using specific antibodies recognizing proteins of the janus kinase (Jak-)/signal transducers and activator of transcription (Stat-) signaling cascade that has been shown to transduce the signals of the IL-6 cytokines to the nucleus, we could show that Jak1, Jak2 and Tyk2, as well as the Stat proteins Stat1, Stat3 and Stat5b were phosphorylated in all three cell lines by OSM and, at least in part, by LIF. Activation of the Stat proteins was also detected by EMSA which revealed complex formation on the Stat3 DNA-binding element and on a Stat5 binding site. Consistent with our recent findings, OSM treatment also induced the activation of the MAPK erk2 and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 in cells of the A172, T98G and U343-MG cell lines.

The aim of this study was to evaluate high-dose treatment (HDT) with autologous bone marrow support (ABMS) as consolidation of first complete remission (CR). PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred forty-four patients (AML-M3 excluded, median age 38 years, range 15-49 years) received remission induction therapy comprising: adriamycin 25 mg/m2, days 1-3, cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) and 6-thioguanine, both at 100 mg/m2 bid, days 1-7. Patients in whom CR was achieved received two further cycles of the same treatment prior to bone marrow being harvested and cryopreserved. HDT comprised ara-C: 1 g/m2 b.i.d. x six days and total body irradiation (TBI): 200 cGy b.i.d. for three days. Thawed autologous marrow was then re-infused. RESULTS: Complete remission was achieved in 106 of 144 patients (73%) who were thus eligible to receive ara-C + TBI + ABMS; 61 actually received it. Following HDT, the median time to neutrophil recovery (> 0.5 x 10(9)/l) was 25 days (range 11-72 days) and to platelet recovery (> 20 x 10(9)/l), 42 days (range 15-159 days). There were eight treatment-related deaths. Analysis by 'intention to treat' shows both remission duration (log-rank, P = 0.001) and survival (log-rank, P = 0.004) to be significantly longer for the 106 patients eligible to receive HDT than for a historical control group (n = 133) who received identical remission induction and consolidation therapy but without ara-C + TBI + ABMS. With a median follow-up of 5.5 years, 39 of 106 patients remain in CR (37%) and 54 (51% of those in whom CR was achieved) remain alive, with a predicted actuarial survival of 52% at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of ara-C + TBI + ABMS to conventional consolidation therapy significantly improved remission duration and survival over those of a historical control group of patients with AML (aged < 50, AML-M3 excluded). HDT was, however, associated with significant treatment-related mortality and slow blood count recovery. The use of ara-C + TBI supported by peripheral blood progenitor cells should make the treatment safer and more widely applicable in AML.","['Rohatiner, A Z', 'Bassan, R', 'Raimondi, R', 'Amess, J A', 'Arnott, S', 'Personen, A', 'Rodeghiero, F', 'Barbui, T', 'Bradburn, M J', 'Carter, M', 'Lister, T A']","['Rohatiner AZ', 'Bassan R', 'Raimondi R', 'Amess JA', 'Arnott S', 'Personen A', 'Rodeghiero F', 'Barbui T', 'Bradburn MJ', 'Carter M', 'Lister TA']","['ICRF Medical Oncology Unit, Dept of Medical Oncology, St. Bartholomewis Hospital, London, UK. a.rohatiner@icrf.icnet.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,2000/10/19 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/19 11:00'],"['2000/10/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/19 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1008333903220 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)55629-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2000 Aug;11(8):1007-15. doi: 10.1023/a:1008333903220.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

MRC Childhood Leukaemia Working Party.,999-1006,"BACKGROUND: Although reinduction rates are good for children with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia there is no consensus on whether bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is the most effective treatment to prolong second remission. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Analyses comparing the outcome of related donor allogeneic BMT (related allograft) with chemotherapy are unreliable because of selection biases. To avoid these biases, the MRC UKALL R1 trial was analysed by HLA-matched donor availability. RESULTS: No significant difference in outcome was found between the donor and no donor groups. The donor group had a non-significant eight-year event-free survival (EFS) advantage of 8%, (95% confidence interval -9%-24%) over the no donor group. Patients with a first remission less than two years appeared to benefit most from having a donor, although the effect was only marginally significantly different from patients with longer first remission. Analysis by treatment received gave similar results, with BMT patients having a 5% (P = 0.8) eight-year EFS advantage over patients who received chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Related allograft was not found to be significantly better than chemotherapy, but there was the possibility of a moderate EFS benefit with related allograft. especially in patients with a short first remission.","['Harrison, G', 'Richards, S', 'Lawson, S', 'Darbyshire, P', 'Pinkerton, R', 'Stevens, R', 'Oakhill, A', 'Eden, O B']","['Harrison G', 'Richards S', 'Lawson S', 'Darbyshire P', 'Pinkerton R', 'Stevens R', 'Oakhill A', 'Eden OB']","['Clinical Trial Service Unit, Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bias', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2000/10/19 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/19 11:00'],"['2000/10/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/19 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1008381801403 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)55628-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2000 Aug;11(8):999-1006. doi: 10.1023/a:1008381801403.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leptin also plays a regulatory role in immunity, inflammation, and hematopoiesis. Alterations in immune and inflammatory responses are present in leptin- or leptin-receptor-deficient animals, as well as during starvation and malnutrition, two conditions characterized by low levels of circulating leptin. Both leptin and its receptor share structural and functional similarities with the interleukin-6 family of cytokines. Leptin exerts proliferative and antiapoptotic activities in a variety of cell types, including T lymphocytes, leukemia cells, and hematopoietic progenitors. Leptin also affects cytokine production, the activation of monocytes/macrophages, wound healing, angiogenesis, and hematopoiesis. Moreover, leptin production is acutely increased during infection and inflammation. This review focuses on the role of leptin in the modulation of the innate immune response, inflammation, and hematopoiesis.","['Fantuzzi, G', 'Faggioni, R']","['Fantuzzi G', 'Faggioni R']","['Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver 80262, USA.

The genetic defect in AT predisposes not only to malignancy but also to severe toxicity from anti-neoplastic therapies. It is important to consider the diagnosis of AT in any child with a lymphoid malignancy at a younger than expected age, or who has a pre-existing ataxia, to anticipate unusually severe toxicities from the antineoplastic therapy, to avoid confusing the development of ataxia with toxicity from therapy, and to provide appropriate genetic counseling. We describe two children at a young age with a lymphoid malignancy diagnosed before the diagnosis of AT. One patient had severe toxicity from his chemotherapy, requiring truncation of the planned course of treatment. The other child was able to tolerate his entire planned course of therapy, but ataxia that was initially interpreted as toxicity from chemotherapy rather than as a sign of his AT developed. Lymphoid malignancy may be the presenting sign of AT. Making this diagnosis may influence therapy of the malignancy. The neurologic manifestations of the disease can be misinterpreted as toxicities of the chemotherapy, and diagnosis of AT allows appropriate genetic counseling for the family.","['Loeb, D M', 'Lederman, H M', 'Winkelstein, J A']","['Loeb DM', 'Lederman HM', 'Winkelstein JA']","['Ataxia-Telangiectasia Clinical Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia/*complications/genetics', 'Child, Preschool', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Male']",,2000/10/19 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/19 11:00'],"['2000/10/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/19 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-200009000-00017 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2000 Sep-Oct;22(5):464-7. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200009000-00017.,,,,,['RR00052/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

A questionnaire was administered at the Pediatric Hematology Center, San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy, to all former patients age 12 to 20 years and off therapy from leukemia for at least 2 years (total of 116 adolescents) during 1997; 70 patients responded to the mailing and a comparison group of 70 secondary-school students was investigated. The two groups were matched as closely as possible on key characteristics (age, gender, socio-economic level of families, education and occupation of the parents, and geographic area of residence). The Offer Self-Image Questionnaire was the instrument used in this study.

Soon after the discovery of HTLV-I, an association of this virus with a slowly progressive neurological disorder was found independently in Japan and Caribbean islands, and this new clinical entity (HTLV-I-associated myelopathy with tropical spastic paraparesis) was named HAM/TSP. Autopsy findings clarified the chronic inflammatory nature of the disease. Detailed neuropathological analysis demonstrated: (i) T-cell-dominant mononuclear cell infiltration; (ii) diffuse and symmetrical degeneration of the anterolateral and inner portion of the posterior columns involving both myelin and axons; (iii) the presence of cytotoxic T cells and apoptosis of helper/inducer T cells; (iv) in vivo localization of HTLV-I provirus in the perivascular infiltrated T cells; and (v) accentuation of inflammatory lesions at the site with slow blood flow. From these findings it is suggested that a T-cell-mediated chronic inflammatory process targeting the HTLV-I-infected T cells is the primary pathogenic mechanism of HAM/TSP.","['Izumo, S', 'Umehara, F', 'Osame, M']","['Izumo S', 'Umehara F', 'Osame M']","['Molecular Pathology and Genetic Epidemiology, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Australia,Neuropathology,Neuropathology : official journal of the Japanese Society of Neuropathology,9606526,IM,"['Arteries/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/immunology/pathology/physiopathology', 'Japan', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/immunology/*pathology/*virology', 'Spinal Cord/blood supply/pathology/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/pathology/virology']",,2000/10/19 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/10/19 11:00'],"['2000/10/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/19 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1440-1789.2000.00320.x [doi]'],ppublish,Neuropathology. 2000 Sep;20 Suppl:S65-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1440-1789.2000.00320.x.,,,,19,,,,,,,,,

For example, T cells are identified by the expression of CD3 (reviewed in this issue of CD corner). A mature T cell may belong to the T4 subset, in which case it will express CD4. Similarly, there are markers for other cell populations and sub-populations. Within the lineages, it is helpful to distinguish cells at different stages of differentiation and activation. Differentiation status is particularly useful in the diagnostic analysis of the lymphoid and myeloid malignancies, and in research on the haemopoietic system. Examples include markers for naive or antigen-experienced cells (especially the CD45 isoforms) and molecules such as CALLA (CD9) found on B-lineage precursors, including B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Activation status is especially interesting in studies of cell function. Activation markers include growth factor receptors such as CD25 (a component of the receptor for IL-2), and molecules who's cellular function is not fully understood, such as CD69 and CD98. These markers have revolutionised aspects of pathology and research, and the ease with which some cell populations can be identified has lead to some unrealised, and perhaps unrealistic, expectations. We expect to be able to identify T helper type 1 (TH1) and T helper type 2 (TH2) cells on the basis of a simple surface marker; we are frustrated by the lack of a single marker for all dendritic cells or for all NK cells; we are confused by the un-coordinated expression of different activation markers; we tend to over-interpret phenotype in some situations. To find solutions to these problems it is helpful to examine why the successful lineage markers work so well, and to reconsider our expectations. Lineage markers are the main focus in this commentary; the question of activation markers and markers of differentiation state will be considered in a separate paper.","['Zola, H']",['Zola H'],"[""Child Health Research Institute, Women's and Children's Hospital, North Adelaide, Australia. hzola@medicine.adelaide.edu.au""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,8809253,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', '*Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",,2000/10/19 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/10/19 11:00'],"['2000/10/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/19 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Biol Regul Homeost Agents. 2000 Jul-Sep;14(3):218-9.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",,,6,,,,,,,,,

For example, the prognosis for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia whose leukemic cells express the TEL-AML1 fusion is favorable when they are treated on modem chemotherapy protocols, whereas patients whose leukemic lymphoblasts contain the MLL-AF4 or the BCR-ABL fusion sometimes require allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for cure.

Less clear is the effectiveness of laparoscopic excision of accessory spleens after initial splenectomy in the management of recurrent hematologic disease. We report here our early experience of this technique. METHODS: All patients who underwent laparoscopic excision of accessory spleens (LEAS) after initial splenectomy were reviewed for preoperative studies, technical success, and effects on either platelet count or hemoglobin level. RESULTS: In 5 patients LEAS was attempted. Two patients had initial open splenectomies, and 3 had initial laparoscopic splenectomies. Hematologic diagnoses were immune thrombocytopenic purpura (3), chronic lymphocytic leukemia-induced thrombocytopenia (1), and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (1). All patients underwent preoperative damaged red blood cell scintigraphy, which demonstrated functioning splenic tissue, and abdominal computed tomography scans, which demonstrated a nodule in 4 of 5 patients. LEAS was technically successful in 4 patients, with the 1 failure also being the patient in whom the computed tomography scan could not demonstrate the accessory spleen. However, only 2 of the 4 patients after LEAS had durable hematologic responses to surgery, despite follow-up damaged red blood cell scintigraphy showing no residual functioning splenic tissue. CONCLUSION: LEAS can be technically successful when the accessory spleen is demonstrated on both damaged red blood cell scintigraphy and computed tomography scan; therefore, adequate visualization in both studies is required. However, hematologic response to excision may be less effective than with the initial splenectomy. Further study is needed to determine the causes of these outcomes.","['Velanovich, V', 'Shurafa, M']","['Velanovich V', 'Shurafa M']","['Divisions of General Surgery and Hematology/Oncology, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, Michigan 48202-2689, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg,American journal of surgery,0370473,IM,"['Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/surgery', 'Erythrocytes', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Diseases/surgery', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', '*Laparoscopy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications', 'Platelet Count', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/surgery', 'Radiography, Abdominal', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Recurrence', 'Spleen/*abnormalities/diagnostic imaging/surgery', 'Splenectomy', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology/surgery', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/10/19 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/19 11:00'],"['2000/10/19 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/19 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9610(00)00417-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9610(00)00417-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Surg. 2000 Jul;180(1):62-4. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9610(00)00417-7.,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcr-Abl is a tyrosine kinase whose activity is inhibited by the antineoplastic drug STI571. This drug can cure mice given an injection of human leukemic cells, but treatment ultimately fails in animals that have large tumors when treatment is initiated. We created a mouse model to explore the mechanism of resistance in vivo. METHODS Nude mice were injected with KU812 Bcr-Abl(+) human leukemic cells. After 1 day (no evident tumors), 8 days, or 15 days (tumors >1 g), mice were treated with STI571 (160 mg/kg every 8 hours). Cells recovered from relapsing animals were used for in vitro experiments. Statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Tumors regressed initially in all STI571-treated mice, but all mice treated 15 days after injection of tumor cells eventually relapsed. Relapsed animals did not respond to further STI571 treatment, and their Bcr-Abl kinase activity in vivo was not inhibited by STI571, despite high plasma concentrations of the drug. However, tumor cells from resistant animals were sensitive to STI571 in vitro, suggesting that a molecule in the plasma of relapsed animals may inactivate the drug. The plasma protein alpha1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) bound STI571 at physiologic concentrations in vitro and blocked the ability of STI571 to inhibit Bcr-Abl kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Plasma AGP concentrations were strongly associated with tumor load. Erythromycin competed with STI571 for AGP binding. When animals bearing large tumors were treated with STI571 alone or with a combination of STI571 and erythromycin, greater tumor reductions and better long-term tumor-free survival (10 of 12 versus one of 13 at day 180; P:<.001) were observed after the combination treatment. CONCLUSION: AGP in the plasma of relapsed animals binds to STI571, preventing this compound from inhibiting the Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase. Molecules such as erythromycin that compete with STI571 for binding to AGP may enhance the therapeutic potential of this drug.","['Gambacorti-Passerini, C', 'Barni, R', 'le Coutre, P', 'Zucchetti, M', 'Cabrita, G', 'Cleris, L', 'Rossi, F', 'Gianazza, E', 'Brueggen, J', 'Cozens, R', 'Pioltelli, P', 'Pogliani, E', 'Corneo, G', 'Formelli, F', ""D'Incalci, M""]","['Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Barni R', 'le Coutre P', 'Zucchetti M', 'Cabrita G', 'Cleris L', 'Rossi F', 'Gianazza E', 'Brueggen J', 'Cozens R', 'Pioltelli P', 'Pogliani E', 'Corneo G', 'Formelli F', ""D'Incalci M""]","['Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan, Italy.

The main idea is to identify subsets of the genes and samples, such that when one of these is used to cluster the other, stable and significant partitions emerge. The search for such subsets is a computationally complex task. We present an algorithm, based on iterative clustering, that performs such a search. This analysis is especially suitable for gene microarray data, where the contributions of a variety of biological mechanisms to the gene expression levels are entangled in a large body of experimental data. The method was applied to two gene microarray data sets, on colon cancer and leukemia. By identifying relevant subsets of the data and focusing on them we were able to discover partitions and correlations that were masked and hidden when the full dataset was used in the analysis. Some of these partitions have clear biological interpretation; others can serve to identify possible directions for future research.","['Getz, G', 'Levine, E', 'Domany, E']","['Getz G', 'Levine E', 'Domany E']","['Department of Physics of Complex Systems, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Cluster Analysis', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']",PMC17297,2000/10/18 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/18 11:00'],"['2000/10/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/18 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.210134797 [doi]', '210134797 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Oct 24;97(22):12079-84. doi: 10.1073/pnas.210134797.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In case 1, the patient had a stage IE nasal-type NK-cell lymphoma involving the cervix. The tumor was composed of medium-sized, irregular lymphoid cells with angioinvasion and necrosis. In case 2, the patient had a stage IV blastoid NK-cell lymphoma/leukemia infiltrating all organs in a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy specimen. Subsequent biopsy specimens revealed that the bone marrow and lymph nodes were also involved. The neoplasm was composed of small to medium lymphoid cells with fine nuclear chromatin. Case 1 was assessed immunohistochemically and the neoplastic cells were positive for CD3, CD56, and TIA-1. Case 2 was analyzed using both immunohistochemical and flow cytometry methods. The neoplastic cells were positive for cytoplasmic CD3, CD4, CD7, CD43, CD45, and CD56 and were negative for surface CD3. Both cases were negative for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) and molecular studies showed no evidence of T-cell receptor gamma chain gene rearrangements. The immunophenotype and absence of T-cell receptor gene rearrangements support NK-cell origin. We report these cases to illustrate that NK-cell lymphomas can involve, and rarely arise in, the gynecologic tract.","['Mhawech, P', 'Medeiros, L J', 'Bueso-Ramos, C', 'Coffey, D M', 'Gei, A F', 'Shahab, I']","['Mhawech P', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Coffey DM', 'Gei AF', 'Shahab I']","['Departments of Pathology, University of Texas, M.D Anderson Medical Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cervix Uteri/*pathology', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hysterectomy', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Killer Cells, Natural/chemistry/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/chemistry/*pathology/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/chemistry/*pathology/therapy', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",,2000/10/18 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/18 11:00'],"['2000/10/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/18 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.5858/2000-124-1510-NKCLIT [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2000 Oct;124(10):1510-3. doi: 10.5858/2000-124-1510-NKCLIT.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We successfully treated a patient with an HLA-mismatched graft without donor T cell depletion. Mixed chimerism was observed 30 days and 60 days after transplantation. STR-PCR showed that 28% and 62% of blood mononuclear cells (MNC) were donor derived at day +30 and day +60, respectively. Mixed chimerism converted into full donor chimerism, when 99.7% of the MNC in the recipient were donor derived after three courses of DLI. A powerful GVL effect related to mixed chimerism was observed. No acute GVHD occurred, only grade II chronic GVHD occurred 6 months after transplant. Based on this case, we suggest that: (1) stable mixed chimerism can be intentionally established across HLA barriers without donor T cell depletion; (2) mixed chimerism can be converted into full donor chimerism by DLI; (3) mixed chimerism induced with this approach can be associated with a very powerful GVL effect, and these may be enhanced by DLI, without severe GVHD.","['Wu, B Y', 'Guo, K Y', 'Song, C Y', 'Yang', 'Li, D']","['Wu BY', 'Guo KY', 'Song CY', 'Yang', 'Li D']","[""Hematology Department, Zhujiang Hospital, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation Chimera/immunology']",,2000/10/18 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/18 11:00'],"['2000/10/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/18 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702563 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000 Sep;26(6):691-3. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702563.,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the years the field of transplantation has changed dramatically. More and more unrelated donors became available, regimens for haploidentical transplantations were introduced and G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood stem cells and fetal cells from umbilical cord became available as alternate sources of hematopoietic stem cells. However, especially the introduction of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) for the successful treatment of leukemic relapses after allogeneic stem cell transplantations improved our understanding of transplantation immunology and opened amazing perspectives in allogeneic transplantation. It was long believed, that myeloablative therapy with high-dose chemotherapy and total body irradiation (TBI) are the sole antileukemic principles in allogeneic transplantations. But by now it became clear, that donor lymphocytes exert a very potent antileukemic effect, now referred as the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) or graft-versus-malignancy (GVM) reaction. The efficacy of DLI in controlling leukemic relapses suggests that myeloablative therapy is not essential for long-term disease control. By exploiting the GVL or GVM reaction more intensively the role of chemotherapy and TBI is changing to immunosuppression. Sufficient immunosuppression to allow grafting, however, can be achieved with much lower doses as those which have been used in conventional transplants. Therefore allogeneic transplants have become also available for the elderly or for patients with concurrent medical conditions, which would have excluded them from conventional transplants. Moreover, this allogeneic transplantation strategy with reduced intensity conditioning is now also under investigation in patients with susceptible solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. However, one major obstacle in allogeneic transplantations, namely the graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), remains to be solved.","['Schleuning, M']",['Schleuning M'],"['Med.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The features of CD34(+) cell mobilisation of patients with haematological malignancies that underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation were examined. Mobilisation chemotherapy consisted mainly of cyclophosphamide (CY) 4 or 7 g/m(2) followed by growth factors. Leukapheresis was started when the WBC counts reached 1.0x10(9)/l with the aim to collect at least 5x10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg body weight. The aphereses were performed on continuous-flow blood cell separators. The analysed variables were: age, diagnosis, CT mobilisation regimen, type of growth factor, number of previous CT lines, prior radiotherapy, days for WBC recovery and number of aphereses procedures to achieve the target of CD34(+) cells. RESULTS: There were 41 consecutive patients (26 M/15 F): 21 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 15 Hodgkin's disease (HD), two chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and three multiple myeloma (MM). Eleven patients could not collect the proposed threshold of CD34(+) cells. CY 4 mobilised patients recovered WBC counts in less days (P=0.03). By ANOVA, the days to WBC recovery had a linear function of the predictors ""number of aphereses"" and ""type of mobilisation CT"" (coefficients: 0.86 and 0.95, respectively). For the number of aphereses and WBC recovery after CT mobilisation, we obtained a correlation coefficient of 0.36 (P=0.02). CONCLUSION: This study shows that it is feasible to mobilise and collect PBPC in patients previously treated with CT with or without RT. There was a linear correlation between the days for WBC recovery and the number of aphereses needed to collect the target number of CD34(+) cells. The study suggests that early WBC recovery, using mainly CY 4 mobilisation chemotherapy, is an important predictor of a low number of aphereses to achieve a good CD34(+) yield.","['Marques, J F', 'Vigorito, A C', 'Aranha, F J', 'Lorand-Metze, I', 'Miranda, E C', 'Lima Filho, E C', 'Valbonesi, M', 'Santini, G', 'De Souza, C A']","['Marques JF', 'Vigorito AC', 'Aranha FJ', 'Lorand-Metze I', 'Miranda EC', 'Lima Filho EC', 'Valbonesi M', 'Santini G', 'De Souza CA']","['Haematology and Blood Transfusion Centre, Haemocentro/Unicamp, State University of Campinas, P.O.

Infectivity assays showed a very low infectious titer with the restricted host range expected for a murine amphotropic retrovirus. A Western blot assay for the viral capsid protein was developed to confirm the high titer values and provide a means for monitoring batch consistency and virus removal during the purification process. Mass spectrometry of several of the viral Gag proteins demonstrated that the cell line appeared to produce at least two closely related retroviruses. N-terminal sequencing of three of the Gag proteins demonstrated that these retroviruses were members of the murine leukemia retroviral family. Western blot detection with an antibody for the capsid protein gave a linear standard curve over the range of 0.1-3 ng per lane. This allows the detection of viral titers as low as 6x10(7) virions per ml without the need to concentrate the sample. The Western blot method has higher throughput and less variability than transmission electron microscopy methods and has potential for monitoring viral titer and clearance during development of manufacturing processes.","['Taylor, F R', 'Ferrant, J L', 'Foley, S F', 'Zeng, C', 'Sernatinger, J', 'Juffras, R', 'Pepinsky, R B']","['Taylor FR', 'Ferrant JL', 'Foley SF', 'Zeng C', 'Sernatinger J', 'Juffras R', 'Pepinsky RB']","['Biogen Inc., 14 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA. fred_taylor@biogen.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Biotechnol,Journal of biotechnology,8411927,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bioreactors', 'Blotting, Western', 'Capsid/*analysis', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Gene Products, gag/*analysis', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*chemistry/*isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Multiple Myeloma', 'Retroviridae Infections', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/ultrastructure/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections', 'Viral Load']",,2000/10/18 11:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2000/10/18 11:00'],"['2000/10/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/18 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0168165600003357 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-1656(00)00335-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biotechnol. 2001 Nov 17;84(1):33-43. doi: 10.1016/s0168-1656(00)00335-7.,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Horizontal sections of the temporal bones were studied by light microscopy and immunohistological staining by avidin-biotin-complex-technique was performed on selected archival sections. Three sections were processed for detection of the virus genome by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: By light microscopy the epithelium of the endolymphatic sac, the utricle and the semicircular canals showed deeply stained acidophilic inclusions and the stria vascularis had a loose structure especially in the intermediate layer. The changes were limited to the non-sensory parts of the labyrinth and no CMV type cells were observed in the organ of Corti. There was a loss of inner and outer hair cells and loss of cochlear ganglion cells caused by either the virus or treatment with gentamicin. Standard immunohistochemistry failed to demonstrate staining with CMV antibodies, but PCR, demonstrated CMV-DNA in one section. CONCLUSION: Molecular techniques may be able to detect acquired CMV infections in archival pediatric bones temporal bones. The histologic findings in the labyrinth were milder, however showed some similarity to children with congenital CMV labyrinthitis.","['Bachor, E', 'Sudhoff, H', 'Litschel, R', 'Karmody, C S']","['Bachor E', 'Sudhoff H', 'Litschel R', 'Karmody CS']","['Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Universitat Ulm, Prittwitzstrasse 43, D-89075, Ulm, Germany. edgar.bachor@medizin.uni-ulm.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Ireland,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,8003603,IM,"['Autopsy', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/pathology/*virology', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Labyrinthitis/pathology/*virology', 'Opportunistic Infections/pathology/*virology', 'Otitis Media/pathology/virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/diagnosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Temporal Bone/*pathology/*virology']",,2000/10/18 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/18 11:00'],"['2000/10/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/18 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0165587600004031 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-5876(00)00403-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol. 2000 Oct 16;55(3):215-24. doi: 10.1016/s0165-5876(00)00403-1.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In humans and rabbits, the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) binds N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLF) with high affinity (K(d) approximately 1 nM). The mouse FPR (mFPR) is a low-affinity receptor for fMLF (K(d) approximately 100 nM); therefore, other agonists for this receptor may exist. Using mFPR-transfected rat basophilic leukemia cells, we found that a recently identified synthetic peptide Trp-Lys-Tyr-Met-Val-D-Met (WKYMVm) is a potent agonist for mFPR. WKYMVm induced calcium mobilization with an EC(50) of 1.2-1.5 nM. Optimal chemotaxis was achieved with 1 nM of WKYMVm, but it required 100 nM of fMLF. WKYMVm stimulated rapid and potent phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases extracellular signal-related kinases 1 and 2 when used at 50 nM. Pertussis toxin only partially blocked calcium mobilization and production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in the stimulated mFPR cells, suggesting the possibility that this receptor couples to Galpha proteins other than Gi and Go. Competitive binding and desensitization data suggest that both peptides interact with the same receptor but may use nonoverlapping binding sites because WKYMVm was unable to effectively displace [(3)H]fMLF bound to mFPR. These results provide evidence for the presence of an alternative potent agonist for mFPR, and suggest a potential usage of WKYMVm for probing the ligand-receptor interactions with the murine formyl peptide receptor homologs.","['He, R', 'Tan, L', 'Browning, D D', 'Wang, J M', 'Ye, R D']","['He R', 'Tan L', 'Browning DD', 'Wang JM', 'Ye RD']","['Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects/immunology', 'Chemotactic Factors/*immunology', 'Chemotaxis/immunology', 'Enzyme Activation/immunology', 'Extracellular Space/immunology/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/*agonists/*immunology/metabolism', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Protein Binding/immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*agonists/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Peptide/*agonists/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/toxicity']",,2000/10/18 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/18 11:00'],"['2000/10/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/18 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.165.8.4598 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2000 Oct 15;165(8):4598-605. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.165.8.4598.,"['0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (Trp-Lys-Tyr-Met-Val-Met)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go)']",,,,['AI33503/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

In this paper we report that the two cdk inhibitors, p27(Kip1) and p18(INK4c), are differently expressed and control different steps of human B lymphocyte activation. Resting B cells contain large amounts of p27(Kip1) and no p18(INK4c). In vitro stimulation by Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1 strain or CD40 ligand associated with IL-10 and IL-2 induces a rapid decrease in p27(Kip1) expression combined with cell cycle entry and progression. In contrast, in vitro Ig production correlates with specific expression of p18(INK4c) and early G(1) arrest. This G(1) arrest is associated with inhibition of cyclin D3/cdk6-mediated retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation by p18(INK4c). A similar contrasting pattern of p18(INK4c) and p27(Kip1) expression is observed both in B cells activated in vivo and in various leukemic cells. Expression of p18(INK4c) was also detected in various Ig-secreting cell lines in which both maximum Ig secretion and specific p18(INK4c) expression were observed during the G(1) phase. Our study shows that p27(Kip1) and p18(INK4c) have different roles in B cell activation; p27(Kip1) is involved in the control of cell cycle entry, and p18(INK4c) is involved in the subsequent early G(1) arrest necessary for terminal B lymphocyte differentiation.","['Schrantz, N', 'Beney, G E', 'Auffredou, M T', 'Bourgeade, M F', 'Leca, G', 'Vazquez, A']","['Schrantz N', 'Beney GE', 'Auffredou MT', 'Bourgeade MF', 'Leca G', 'Vazquez A']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Unite 131, and Centre de Recherche Claude Bernard, Clamart, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*enzymology', 'CD40 Antigens/physiology', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Down-Regulation/immunology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'G1 Phase/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Up-Regulation/immunology']",,2000/10/18 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/18 11:00'],"['2000/10/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/18 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.165.8.4346 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2000 Oct 15;165(8):4346-52. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.165.8.4346.,"['0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (CDKN2C protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have demonstrated that, unlike resting cells, activation of cycling human mature PBT lymphocytes, and T lymphocyte leukemia cell lines is accompanied by the accumulation of RXRalpha mRNA and protein. Interestingly, cyclosporin A further augmented RXRalpha expression, indicating the involvement of calcineurin pathways in the process. 9-cis retinoic acid inhibited the accumulation, suggesting that retinoids can regulate the synthesis of their own receptors during T cell activation. Transfection analysis in Jurkat cells, using RXRE-dependent reporter assays, showed that RXRalpha accumulated during T cell activation was transcriptionally inactive. To investigate the mechanism of such inhibition, the role of two mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), in modulating RXRE-dependent transcription, was explored. The expression of constitutively active MAP/ERK kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) inhibited RXRE-dependent transcription, whereas dominant negative MEKK1 increased the transcription, indicating the involvement of JNK signaling pathways in the process. In contrast, expression of constitutively active MEK1, which activates ERK pathway, enhanced RXRE-dependent activation. When both were activated simultaneously, JNK pathway was dominant over ERK pathway and resulted in inhibition of RXRE-mediated transcription. These data demonstrate a dual regulatory control of RXRalpha expression during the activation of resting and cycling T lymphocytes and indicate a dynamic balance between JNK and ERK pathways in modulating RXRE-mediated transactivation.","['Ishaq, M', 'Fan, M', 'Natarajan, V']","['Ishaq M', 'Fan M', 'Natarajan V']","['Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology, Science Applications International Corporation-Frederick, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, MD 21702, USA. mishaq@nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Alitretinoin', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites/drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/genetics/*immunology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Response Elements/*immunology', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/enzymology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/immunology', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/*immunology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/genetics/immunology']",,2000/10/18 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/18 11:00'],"['2000/10/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/18 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.165.8.4217 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2000 Oct 15;165(8):4217-25. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.165.8.4217.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '1UA8E65KDZ (Alitretinoin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,['N01-CO-56000/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that cultured rat splenic DCs exhibit a cytotoxic activity against selected target cells. In this study, we analyzed this function in DCs freshly prepared from lymphoid organs using the DC-specific OX62 mAb and magnetic beads. Freshly extracted splenic DCs, but not lymph node and thymic DCs, exhibited a strong and moderate cytotoxic activity against YAC-1 and K562 target cells, respectively. FACS analyses showed that spleen contained a minor subset (10-15%) of CD4(+) and class II(int) DCs that also expressed the OX41 Ag and the lymphoid-related Ags CD5 and CD90 (Thy-1) and a major (80-85%) subset of CD4(-)/OX41(-)/CD5(-) and class II(int) DCs. The cytotoxic activity of splenic DCs was strictly restricted to the CD4(-) DCs, a subset poorly represented in LN and thymus. Contrasting with our previous report using cultured splenic DCs, freshly isolated splenic DCs killed YAC-1 cells using a Ca(2+)-independent mechanism, but this function did not appear mediated by Fas ligand, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, or TNF-alpha. Therefore, rat DCs contain a subset of naturally cytolytic cells that could play a role in both innate and acquired immune responses. Together with our previous report, these data suggest that rat DCs can use two mechanisms of cytotoxicity depending on their maturation/activation state.","['Trinite, B', 'Voisine, C', 'Yagita, H', 'Josien, R']","['Trinite B', 'Voisine C', 'Yagita H', 'Josien R']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Unite 437 and Institut de Transplantation et de Recherche en Transplantation, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'CD4 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Ligands', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Mice', 'Organ Specificity/immunology', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/physiology', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",,2000/10/18 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/18 11:00'],"['2000/10/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/18 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.165.8.4202 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2000 Oct 15;165(8):4202-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.165.8.4202.,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Faslg protein, rat)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Tnfsf10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tnfsf10 protein, rat)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the regulation of PAF activity by capsaicin in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Capsaicin inhibited PAF-induced superoxide production in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition to PAF, the fMLP- and extracellular ATP-induced superoxide productions were inhibited by capsaicin, whereas PMA-induced superoxide production was not affected. In the PAF-stimulated cytosolic Ca2+ increase, capsaicin inhibited in particular the sustained portion of the raised Ca2+ level without attenuation of the peak height. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the PAF-induced Ca2+ elevation was not inhibited by capsaicin because capsaicin only inhibited the Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space. In addition, capsaicin did not affect PAF-induced inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production, suggesting that phospholipase C activation by PAF is not affected by capsaicin. Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) induced by thapsigargin was inhibited by capsaicin in a concentration-dependent manner. This capsaicin effect was also observed on thapsigargin-induced Ba2+ and Mn2+ influx. Furthermore, capsaicin's inhibitory effect on the thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ rise overlapped with that of SK&F96365, an inhibitor of SOCE. Both capsaicin and SK&F96365 also inhibited PAF-induced cytosolic superoxide generation in HL-60 cells differentiated by all-trans-retinoic acid. Our data suggest that capsaicin exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting SOCE elicited via PLC activation, which occurs upon PAF activation and results in the subsequent superoxide production.","['Choi, S Y', 'Ha, H', 'Kim, K T']","['Choi SY', 'Ha H', 'Kim KT']","['Department of Life Science, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Calcium/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Capsaicin/*pharmacology', 'Cytosol/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Platelet Activating Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Superoxides/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Thapsigargin/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2000/10/18 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/18 11:00'],"['2000/10/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/18 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.165.7.3992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2000 Oct 1;165(7):3992-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.165.7.3992.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', 'S07O44R1ZM (Capsaicin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous reports showed that the DAP12 message could be detected not only in NK cells but also in granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages. In this study we found a significant level of DAP12 protein expression in macrophage-related cell lines and organs. Additionally, we observed increased expression of DAP12 after LPS-induced differentiation of M1 cells into macrophages. To examine the role of DAP12 in the myeloid cell lineage, we established M1 FLAG-DAP12 transfectants (FDAP-M1) and demonstrated the marked morphological changes in FDAP-M1 cells caused by signaling through DAP12.

Several human tissues were found to contain both leukotriene C synthase and microsomal glutathione S-transferase mRNA. These data suggest that the interaction may be physiologically important. To study this further, expression vectors encoding the two enzymes were cotransfected into mammalian cells and the subcellular localization of the enzymes was determined by indirect immunofluorescence using confocal laser scanning microscopy. The results showed that leukotriene C synthase and microsomal glutathione S-transferase were both localized on the nuclear envelope and adjacent parts of the endoplasmic reticulum.

However, the mechanisms leading to its beneficial effect are not completely clarified, and there is no information on IFN-alpha gene expression in this disease. Therefore, we investigated the pattern of IFN-alpha gene expression and protein production in HCL and their potential regulation by rhIFN-alpha. Blood samples from 10 patients with HCL and 8 healthy donors (HD) were investigated. Expression of IFN-alpha mRNA was assessed by reverse transcription-PCR analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) under basal conditions and on induction with rhIFN-alpha and polyionosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I.C)]. IFN-alpha concentrations in plasma and culture supernatants were measured by immunoassays, and intracellular IFN-alpha was evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Results showed that, in contrast to blood samples from HDs, freshly isolated PBMCs from un treated HCL patients did not express IFN-alpha mRNA, whereas IFN-alpha transcripts were found in patients who were under rhIFN-alpha therapy Plasma of untreated patients contained no, or extremely low levels of IFN-alpha as compared with plasma of treated patients and HDs. Ex vivo treatment of PBMCs with rhIFN-alpha or poly(I.C) resulted in a remarkable up-regulation of IFN-alpha at the mRNA and protein level. In HCL, however the amounts of IFN-alpha protein remained less than in HD. Inhibition of IFN-alpha transcription was found after exposure of PBMCs to serum fron untreated patients. Finally, a reduced capacity to produce IFN-alpha was found within B- cell, T-cell, and monocyte compartments in HCL patients which could be enhanced by rhIFN-alpha. The results demonstrate the ability, of rhIFN-alpha to up-regulate the expression of IFN-alpha gene and protein production and suggest that priming the production of endogenous IFN-alpha is a critical step in the mechanism of action of rhIFN-alpha in HCL.","['Shehata, M', 'Schwarzmeier, J D', 'Nguyen, S T', 'Hilgarth, M', 'Berger, R', 'Hubmann, R', 'Kickmaier, S', 'Decker, T']","['Shehata M', 'Schwarzmeier JD', 'Nguyen ST', 'Hilgarth M', 'Berger R', 'Hubmann R', 'Kickmaier S', 'Decker T']","['University of Vienna, Clinic of Internal Medicine 1, Department of Hematology, L.

Two of them were found to have major hematological disorders. In both cases, the disorder was detected by preoperative blood cell counts and white cell differentiation. Case 1 was a 21-year-old woman patient with repaired right cleft lip. She was admitted for alveolar bone grafting and closure of oronasal fistula. Abnormal presentation of blast cells was found, and subsequent bone marrow study confirmed acute lymphocytic leukemia. Case 2 was a 26-year-old man with left secondary cleft lip nasal deformity scheduled to receive staged reconstructive operations. An elevated platelet count was found and subsequently confirmed to represent essential thrombocytosis. In both cases, reconstructive operations for the cleft-related deformities were performed.

Frequently, it is the major dose-limiting hematologic toxicity, especially in the treatment of potentially curable malignancies such as leukemia, lymphomas, and pediatric cancers. This is becoming increasingly important given the recent trend toward the use of dose-intensive combination chemotherapy regimens facilitated by supportive hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors to prevent chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia. The standard preventive measure against chemotherapy-induced depression of platelets in subsequent treatment cycles has been dose reduction and/or dose delay. However, follow-up data from studies in various populations of patients with cancer suggest a correlation between delivery of lower than intended doses and poor outcomes, including reduced disease-free periods and overall survival. Other consequences of thrombocytopenia include the need for platelet transfusions and subsequent exposure to the risk of numerous complications, including bacterial and viral infections; febrile, nonhemolytic transfusion reactions; and transfusion-induced immunosuppression. Furthermore, a large proportion of multitransfused patients become refractory to subsequent infusions. Refractoriness to platelet transfusions is quickly becoming more prominent. The availability of a platelet growth factor--recombinant human interleukin-11(rhIL-11, also known as oprelvekin [Neumega])--provides an effective means of preventing chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia and accelerating platelet recovery, thereby facilitating the administration of full doses of chemotherapy during subsequent cycles and avoiding the need for rescue with platelet transfusions.","['Cairo, M S']",['Cairo MS'],"[""Columbia University, Babies and Children's Hospital, New York, New York, USA. mc1319@columbia.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Oncology (Williston Park),"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",8712059,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Interleukin-11/*therapeutic use', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality', 'Opportunistic Infections/etiology', 'Platelet Transfusion/adverse effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced/*therapy']",,2000/10/18 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/18 11:00'],"['2000/10/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/18 11:00 [entrez]']",['175839 [pii]'],ppublish,Oncology (Williston Park). 2000 Sep;14(9 Suppl 8):21-31.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'HM5641GA6F (oprelvekin)']",,,62,,,,,,,,,

A concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of cell growth was observed that appears to be due to induction of apoptosis. Involvement of oxidative stress is indicated by a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular peroxides and a parallel decrease in total cellular glutathione; in addition, increased survival rates were observed in cells simultaneously treated with Tempol and the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Tempol did not affect the relative levels of Bax and Bcl2, whereas p21(WAF1/CIP1) was enhanced in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion; this effect was partially inhibited by N-acetylcysteine, was maintained for up to 8 h after Tempol removal, and seemed to depend on continuing protein synthesis. The increase in p21(WAF1/CIP1) was accompanied by a parallel accumulation of cells in the G(1) phase of the cycle and by a decrease in the 110 kDa form of pRb. Our results suggest that p53-independent induction of p21(WAF1/CIP1) mediates the antiproliferative effect of Tempol; on the basis of this observation, the nitroxide could be proposed as an useful adjunct to the treatment of p53-deficient tumors, which are often refractory to standard chemotherapy.","['Gariboldi, M B', 'Rimoldi, V', 'Supino, R', 'Favini, E', 'Monti, E']","['Gariboldi MB', 'Rimoldi V', 'Supino R', 'Favini E', 'Monti E']","['University of Insubria, Varese, Department of Structural and Functional Biology, Section of Pharmacology, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclic N-Oxides/*toxicity', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*metabolism', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Spin Labels', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2000/10/18 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/18 11:00'],"['2000/10/18 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/18 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0891-5849(00)00347-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0891-5849(00)00347-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2000 Oct 1;29(7):633-41. doi: 10.1016/s0891-5849(00)00347-6.,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclic N-Oxides)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Spin Labels)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'U78ZX2F65X (tempol)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We have demonstrated the physical association of Smad proteins with AML1 and AML1/ETO by immunoprecipitation and have mapped the region of interaction to the runt homology domain in these AML1 proteins. Using confocal microscopy, we demonstrated that AML1, and ETO and/or AML1/ETO, colocalize with Smads in the nucleus of t(8;21)-positive Kasumi-1 cells, in the presence but not the absence of TGF-beta1. Using transient transfection assays and a reporter gene construct that contains both Smad and AML1 consensus binding sequences, we demonstrated that overexpression of AML1B cooperates with TGF-beta1 in stimulating reporter gene activity, whereas AML1/ETO represses basal promoter activity and blocks the response to TGF-beta1.

Antigen recognized by A3 was around 80 kDa in molecular weight and was seen on the cytoplasmic membrane of MT-8 cells by immunoelectron microscopy. A3 reacted specifically with MT-8 cells, with another rat MFH-derived cell line (MT-9) and with their induced tumours in syngeneic rats, but not with other rat tumours such as fibrosarcoma, histiocytic sarcoma, malignant meningioma, uterine leiomyosarcoma, endometrial stromal sarcoma, mononuclear cell leukaemia and malignant schwannoma. These findings indicate that A3 has a high specificity for rat MFH cells. In fetuses on gestation days 15, 18 and 20 and in postnatal rats aged 1, 4 and 8 days, A3 reacted with primitive mesenchymal cells in visceral organs and around arteries and bronchi, as well as in the lamina propria of intestinal mucosa, renal interstitium, meninges and perineurium. There were no A3-positive connective tissue cells in organs or other sites in adult rats more than 10 weeks old. It is therefore likely that MFH cells share antigens with primitive mesenchymal cells, which may be multipotent for mesenchymal differentiation.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred five patients were treated: 100 in chronic phase (15 with cytogenetic clonal evolution) and five in accelerated phase. Their median age was 52 years; all had been treated unsuccessfully with IFNalpha; 94% were in late chronic phase; 43% had been exposed to ara-C and 11% had been exposed to HHT. Patients received HHT 2.5 mg/m(2) by continuous infusion daily for 5 days and ara-C 15mg/m(2) daily in two subcutaneous injections for 5 days every 4 weeks. The outcome of the 100 patients in chronic phase was compared with a previous study group of 73 patients treated with HHT alone. RESULTS: Overall, the complete hematologic response (CHR) rate in chronic phase was 72%; the cytogenetic response rate was 32% (major response, 15%; complete response, 5%). Toxicities were acceptable, mostly related to moderate diarrhea (3%), headaches (3%), cardiovascular events (3%),and myelosuppression-associated complications (3% to 14%). With a median follow-up period of 25 months, the estimated 4-year survival rate was 55%. Response rates were identical with HHT plus ara-C versus HHT alone, but the survival was significantly longer with the combination after accounting for differences in the study groups and by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: The combination regimen of HHT and ara-C is effective and safe in patients with CML who have experienced treatment failure with IFNalpha and needs to be investigated together with IFNalpha as part of front-line CML therapy. The addition of ara-C did not improve the response rates but may have improved survival, perhaps through suppression of clones related to disease transformation.","['Kantarjian, H M', 'Talpaz, M', 'Smith, T L', 'Cortes, J', 'Giles, F J', 'Rios, M B', 'Mallard, S', 'Gajewski, J', 'Murgo, A', 'Cheson, B', ""O'Brien, S""]","['Kantarjian HM', 'Talpaz M', 'Smith TL', 'Cortes J', 'Giles FJ', 'Rios MB', 'Mallard S', 'Gajewski J', 'Murgo A', 'Cheson B', ""O'Brien S""]","['Departments of Leukemia, Bioimmunotherapy,Biostatistics, and Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. hkantarj@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Harringtonines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",,2000/10/14 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/14 11:00'],"['2000/10/14 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/14 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.20.3513 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 Oct 15;18(20):3513-21. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.20.3513.,"['0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We examine a possible interaction between HER-2/neu or p53 expression and tamoxifen effectiveness in patients with ER-positive, node-positive disease treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil in a large adjuvant chemotherapy trial (Cancer and Leukemia Group B [CALGB] 8541). Tamoxifen assignment was not randomized-physician discretion was used for premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Trial protocol then specified assignment to postmenopausal women with ER-positive tumors, although not all took tamoxifen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CALGB 8541 assessed HER-2/neu expression in patients with ER-positive disease by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and amplification by differential polymerase chain reaction (PCR). IHC assessed expression of p53. Univariate and multivariate proportional hazards models assessed tamoxifen-HER-2/neu status interactions and tamoxifen-p53 status interactions. RESULTS: HER-2/neu status was available for 651 patients with ER-positive disease; 650, 608, and 353 patients were assessed by IHC, PCR, and FISH, respectively. Approximately one half received tamoxifen. Reduction in risk of disease recurrence or death resulting from tamoxifen was approximately 37% (32% with overexpression and 39% with normal expression of HER-2/neu; n = 155 by IHC). The tamoxifen-HER-2/neu status interaction was not significant in multivariate analysis of all three HER-2/neu assessment methods. Tamoxifen-p53 interaction did not significantly predict outcome. CONCLUSION: Disease-free and overall survival benefit of tamoxifen in patients with ER-positive, node-positive breast cancer does not depend on HER-2/neu or p53 status. Our data suggest that neither HER-2/neu nor p53 expression should be used to determine assignment of tamoxifen.","['Berry, D A', 'Muss, H B', 'Thor, A D', 'Dressler, L', 'Liu, E T', 'Broadwater, G', 'Budman, D R', 'Henderson, I C', 'Barcos, M', 'Hayes, D', 'Norton, L']","['Berry DA', 'Muss HB', 'Thor AD', 'Dressler L', 'Liu ET', 'Broadwater G', 'Budman DR', 'Henderson IC', 'Barcos M', 'Hayes D', 'Norton L']","['University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. dberry@odin.mdacc.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Middle Aged', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Postmenopause/physiology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Estrogen/*physiology', 'Tamoxifen/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis/*biosynthesis']",,2000/10/14 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/14 11:00'],"['2000/10/14 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/14 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.20.3471 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 Oct 15;18(20):3471-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.20.3471.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'CAF protocol']",,,,['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

In recombinant HSV-infected cells, IFN inhibited expression of beta-galactosidase from the immediate-early gene, ICP4, promoter. The extent of inhibition was dependent on IFN dose, IFN type, cell type, and multiplicity of infection (moi). IFN inhibited gene transcription, leading to a complete block in ICP4 promoter-driven gene expression in 90% of cells. The same IFN treatments resulted in an increase in the size and number of nuclear domain 10 (ND10) structures that stained positive by immunofluorescence for the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein. In cultures infected at low moi with a recombinant HSV producing ICP4 as a fusion protein with green fluorescence protein, the appearance of green fluorescence in the nucleus coincided with loss of PML-positive ND10 in the same nucleus, even in the rare ICP4-expressing IFN-treated cells. IFN-dependent inhibition was nearly complete when the immediate-early promoter was in the viral genome but was minimal when the promoter was stably integrated into the cellular genome. These data reveal that IFN can completely block viral gene expression in infected cells and that enhancement of the ND10 structure, which is the site of initiation of HSV replication, correlates with the block in viral gene expression.","['Taylor, J L', 'Unverrich, D', ""O'Brien, W J"", 'Wilcox, K W']","['Taylor JL', 'Unverrich D', ""O'Brien WJ"", 'Wilcox KW']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226, USA. jtaylor@mcw.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Drug Interactions', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Genes, Immediate-Early/physiology', 'Haplorhini', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Simplexvirus/*drug effects/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Vero Cells', 'beta-Galactosidase/biosynthesis/genetics']",,2000/10/14 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/14 11:00'],"['2000/10/14 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/14 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/10799900050151076 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000 Sep;20(9):805-15. doi: 10.1089/10799900050151076.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (herpes simplex virus, type 1 protein ICP4)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",,,,"['P01-EY01931/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI 17246/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-EY06990/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The combination of these agents also suppressed DNA-synthesis. In the present study, we investigated the suppression of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) activities resulting in G1 arrest in differentiated ML-1 cells. We show that treatment of ML-1 cells with ATRA plus GMCSF results in G1 arrest and suppression of CDK activities. Protein levels of the G1 CDKs were essentially unchanged during this time. However, we observed an increase in CDK2-bound p27 and CDK4-bound p18, and a decrease in CDK6-bound cyclin D3. These results suggest that complex regulation of CDKs play a key role in G1 arrest of ML-1 after treatment with ATRA and GM-CSF. We also showed that an increase in CDK2-bound p27 and CDK4-bound p18 are caused by treatment with ATRA and a decrease in CDK6-bound cyclin D3 is induced synergistically by treatment with both reagents. Furthermore, we propose that the changes in binding of p18 and cyclin D3 to CDKs are due to changes at the protein expression level and that the increase in p27 binding to CDK2 is due to a novel mechanism.","['Shimizu, T', 'Awai, N', 'Takeda, K']","['Shimizu T', 'Awai N', 'Takeda K']","['Department of Hygiene-chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Science University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*metabolism', '*Enzyme Inhibitors', 'G1 Phase/drug effects/physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Microfilament Proteins/metabolism', '*Muscle Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2000/10/13 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/13 11:00'],"['2000/10/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/13 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1203821 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Sep 21;19(40):4640-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203821.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CDKN2C protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tagln protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1, which infects from 15 to 25 million individuals world-wide, is highly endemic in certain areas such as south-western Japan, Central Africa, the Caribbean basin and some regions of South America, Melanesia and of the middle East (for example the Mashhad area of Iran). The three major modes of transmission for HTLV-1 infection are perinatal, sexual and by blood transfusion. Recent molecular studies on HTLV-1 have shown the existence of several molecular subtypes (genotypes). These are related to the geographical origin of the infected populations and not to the associated diseases. The virus has a very high genetic stability. Viral amplification via clonal expansion of infected cells, rather than by use of reverse transcription could explain this remarkable phenomenon which can be used as a molecular tool for gaining new insights into the origin, evolution and modes of dissemination of HTLV-1. Analyses of HTLV-1 and STLV-1 (the simian counterpart) viral strains from throughout the world suggest that four events are responsible for this pattern of dissemination: 1) the transmission in the wild of STLV-1 between simian species, 2) the transmission of STLV-1 to humans as exemplified by the high percentage of identity between STLV-1 strains from chimpanzees or from mandrills with some HTLV-1 strains present in inhabitants of Central Africa, 3) persistence of HTLV-1 over a long period of time (by sexual and perinatal transmissions) in remote populations, as seen in the Australo-Melanesian region and 4) a global distribution of HTLV-1 via large scale human migrations, e.g., the slave trade from Africa to the New World.","['Gessain, A', 'Mahieux, R']","['Gessain A', 'Mahieux R']","['Departement du sida et des retrovirus, Institut Pasteur, Paris. agessain@pasteur.fr']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Bull Soc Pathol Exot,Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique (1990),9212564,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Evolution', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*epidemiology/transmission/virology', '*Genetic Variation', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/transmission/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/classification/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Pan troglodytes/virology', 'Papio/virology', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/classification/*genetics']",,2000/10/13 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/13 11:00'],"['2000/10/13 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/13 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Soc Pathol Exot. 2000 Jul;93(3):163-71.,,,"Epidemiologie, origine et diversite genetique du retrovirus HTLV-1 et des retrovirus simiens apparentes a STLV-1.",66,,,,,,,,,

This cell line, designated B6A4C1, is deficient in both Fc epsilon RI-mediated degranulation and biosynthesis of several lipid raft components. Agents that bypass receptor-mediated Ca(2+) influx stimulate strong degranulation responses in these variant cells. Cross-linking of IgE-Fc epsilon RI on these cells stimulates robust tyrosine phosphorylation but fails to mobilize a sustained Ca(2+) response. Fc epsilon RI-mediated inositol phosphate production is not detectable in these cells, and failure of adenosine receptors to mobilize Ca(2+) suggests a general deficiency in stimulated phospholipase C activity. Antigen stimulation of phospholipases A(2) and D is also defective. Infection of B6A4C1 cells with vaccinia virus constructs expressing constitutively active Rho family members Cdc42 and Rac restores antigen-stimulated degranulation, and active Cdc42 (but not active Rac) restores ganglioside and GPI expression. The results support the hypothesis that activation of Cdc42 and/or Rac is critical for Fc epsilon RI-mediated signaling that leads to Ca(2+) mobilization and degranulation. Furthermore, they suggest that Cdc42 plays an important role in the biosynthesis and expression of certain components of lipid rafts.","['Field, K A', 'Apgar, J R', 'Hong-Geller, E', 'Siraganian, R P', 'Baird, B', 'Holowka, D']","['Field KA', 'Apgar JR', 'Hong-Geller E', 'Siraganian RP', 'Baird B', 'Holowka D']","['Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Immunoblotting', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', '*Lipid Metabolism', 'Mast Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/analysis/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism']",PMC15022,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1091/mbc.11.10.3661 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2000 Oct;11(10):3661-73. doi: 10.1091/mbc.11.10.3661.,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,"['R01 AI022449/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI22449/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI42244/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM42388/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

In the present study, we analyzed mutations induced by p-benzoquinone (p-BQ), a benzene metabolite, in human cells using a shuttle vector plasmid pMY189, and compared frequencies, types and spectra of the mutations with those of the mutations previously revealed in mouse cells using a similar plasmid pNY200. We found that p-BQ induces mutations in human and mouse cells at similar frequencies but with different types of mutagenesis. The proportion of tandem base mutations was significantly lower in human cells than in mouse cells. Most base substitutions were induced in G:C base pairs in both human and mouse cells. However, the proportion of G:C-->C :G transversion is significantly higher in human cells. These findings indicate that the p-BQ-induced DNA damage in human and mouse cells is processed in a different manner, and that extrapolation of mice findings on experimental benzene carcinogenesis to human cancer risk assessment should be conducted carefully.","['Nakayama, A', 'Koyoshi, S', 'Morisawa, S', 'Yagi, T']","['Nakayama A', 'Koyoshi S', 'Morisawa S', 'Yagi T']","['Department of Global Environment Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Yoshida-Hommachi, Sakyo-ku, 606-8501, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzoquinones/*toxicity', 'DNA', 'DNA Replication', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', '*Mutation', 'Plasmids']",,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']","['S1383571800000991 [pii]', '10.1016/s1383-5718(00)00099-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2000 Oct 31;470(2):147-53. doi: 10.1016/s1383-5718(00)00099-1.,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Mutagens)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

As the autografts are frequently contaminated with large numbers of tumor cells, we have prospectively investigated the feasibility and efficacy of ex vivo double purging of PBSC grafts in an open, nonrandomized, single-center phase I/II clinical study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients with poor-risk CLL underwent uniform stem cell mobilization with chemotherapy and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Double B-cell depletion of the harvested PBSC products was performed using immunomagnetic CD34(+) cell selection (Isolex300i Nexell, Irvine, CA) followed by a negative step with anti-CD19/20/23/37-labeled immunomagnetic beads. The purified PBSC were reinfused after myeloablative treatment with TBI/CY. RESULTS: A total of 25 separation runs was accomplished using collection products containing 3.4% (1.1-8.1) CD34(+) cells and 1.2% (0.1-42) CD19(+)CD5(+) CLL cells. After double selection, 33% (15-67) CD34(+) cells were recovered with a purity of 98.8% (89.1-99. 8). CLL cells were undetectable by high-resolution flow cytometry in 15 of 25 final products; median purging efficacy was 5 (4.1-6) log. The CD34(+) content of the 20 final grafts was 4.6 (2.2-6.5) x 10(6)/kg. Rapid and durable engraftment developed in all cases. With a median follow-up of 20 (6-29) months, 17 patients live in complete clinical remission, two have recurrent disease, and one patient died due to pulmonary embolism five months after transplant. Persistence of the leukemic clone on the molecular level was demonstrated by dot blotting with clone-specific CDR3 probes in an additional five patients. Serious or unexpected infectious complications did not occur. CONCLUSIONS: Positive/negative purging with the Isolex system allows preparation of highly purified CD34(+) fractions and up to six log of tumor cell depletion in patients with B-CLL and can be safety reinfused after myeloablative therapy without affecting hematopoietic engraftment.","['Dreger, P', 'Viehmann, K', 'von Neuhoff, N', 'Kruss, D', 'Glass, B', 'Kneba, M', 'Mitsky, P', 'Jopp, P', 'Rautenberg, P', 'Mills, B', 'Schmitz, N']","['Dreger P', 'Viehmann K', 'von Neuhoff N', 'Kruss D', 'Glass B', 'Kneba M', 'Mitsky P', 'Jopp P', 'Rautenberg P', 'Mills B', 'Schmitz N']","['Departments of Internal Medicine II, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany. p.dreger@med2.uni-kiel.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', '*B-Lymphocytes', '*Blood Component Removal', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(00)00524-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00524-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 Oct;28(10):1187-96. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00524-5.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

As underlying mechanisms, deregulated thrombopoietin receptor (c-mpl)-mediated signaling pathways have been suggested. This study therefore examined whether the impaired signaling in MDS and AML cells includes alterations of c-mpl itself or postsignaling events. METHODS: Bone marrow-derived CD34(+) cells from healthy donors, patients with MDS (RA, RAEB-T), and patients with AML after MDS were isolated by MACS. Expression of c-mpl cDNA was studied by RT-PCR. Thrombopoietin dependent activation of STAT proteins and MAP Kinase p42(erk-2)/44(erk-1) was analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: Both splicing isoforms of c-mpl (c-mpl-p and c-mpl-k) were expressed in all of the CD34(+) cells examined. Analysis of the c-mpl cDNA revealed no sequence abnormality. We show c-mpl dependent activation of the transcription factors STAT3 and STAT5 as well as MAP Kinase p42(erk-2)/44(erk-1) in CD34(+) cells from healthy individuals. Cells derived from RA patients revealed low basal levels of phosphorylated STAT3 and STAT5 molecules. This phosphorylation was enhanced by stimulation with recombinant thrombopoietin (PEG-rHuMGDF). STAT1 failed to be activated by PEG-rHuMGDF in CD34(+) cells from healthy donors as well as from patients with MDS. In RAEB-T and AML M7 the constitutive expression levels of STAT1, 3, 5, and MAPK were markedly upregulated, resulting in a strong activation of STAT3 and 5 by PEG-rHuMGDF. Despite its high expression, the level of MAPK phosphorylation was not increased in RA or RAEB-T compared to the normal control, and was completely undetectable in AML M7. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the defective megakaryopoiesis in MDS is not caused by a lack of c-mpl and that STAT3 and STAT5 may contribute to the malignant phenotype of the leukemic cells.","['Kalina, U', 'Hofmann, W K', 'Koschmieder, S', 'Wagner, S', 'Kauschat, D', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Ottmann, O G']","['Kalina U', 'Hofmann WK', 'Koschmieder S', 'Wagner S', 'Kauschat D', 'Hoelzer D', 'Ottmann OG']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Hospital, 60590, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.

Retroviral T-cell transduction requires ex vivo cell expansion, which is often achieved by IL-2 and anti-CD3 stimulation. Traditionally, culture media for cell expansion are supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) or human serum. While these sera promote cell growth and viability, they contain uncharacterized elements that may yield inconsistent results from batch to batch. Cell expansion in serum-free media would therefore be preferable. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared T-cell expansion rates in three commercially available serum-free culture media (X-VIVO 15, AIM-V, and Cellgro SCGM), with or without the addition of human serum (HS, 5%). We also aimed to evaluate how the in vitro expansion affected the composition of the various T-cell subsets. Buffy-coats from four healthy donors were expanded for 21 days. The media were compared to standard RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with HS (5%) or FBS (10%). For retroviral transductions, the LN vector carrying the neomycin- resistance gene was used in four additional donors. RESULTS: In our hands, X-VIVO 15 gave the highest rate of serum-free expansion (a median of 79-fold expansion, range 20-117). For serum-free expansion, activation with OKT3 for 21 days gave slightly higher expansion rates than a 5-day course (however, without statistical significance). When serum was added, this discrepancy was not seen. Cytokine analysis (IFN-gamma, IL-10, and IL-4) showed a distinct type1 cytokine pattern with elevated IFN-gamma levels during the whole period of culture. Flow cytometric analyses showed substantial inter-media, but also some inter-donor, variability in T-cell subset compositions. Transduction of cells with the LN vector and G418 selection resulted in a 14-fold increase (range 3-18) for serum-free X-VIVO 15 based cultures. Cell phenotypes remained unchanged by the transduction procedure as compared to nontransduced cells. CONCLUSION: Among the tested serum-free media, X-VIVO 15 has shown to best support the in vitro expansion of T cells, resulting in equal percentages of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells. These cells can easily be transduced and selected. There seem to be no significant benefits, regarding absolute cell numbers or T-cell subset compositions, with OKT3-stimulation for more than five days. The addition of low levels of HS increases the consistencies in the cell expansion rates for all media.","['Carlens, S', 'Gilljam, M', 'Remberger, M', 'Aschan, J', 'Christensson, B', 'Dilber, M S']","['Carlens S', 'Gilljam M', 'Remberger M', 'Aschan J', 'Christensson B', 'Dilber MS']","['Centre for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Huddinge University Hospital, and Departments of, Huddinge, Sweden. stefan.carlens@impi.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/analysis', 'Interleukin-10/analysis', 'Interleukin-4/analysis', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', '*Lymphocyte Activation', '*Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Time Factors', '*Transfection']",,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(00)00526-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00526-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 Oct;28(10):1137-46. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00526-9.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe the development of gelatin beads carrying anti-tumor monoclonal antibody (mAb) and anti-Fas mAb mimicking the TCR and FasL, respectively. We hypothesized that these antibody-coated beads can be therapeutically utilized for the elimination of tumor cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the cytotoxic activity of gelatin beads bearing CH11 (anti-Fas mAb) after incubation with several human leukemia cell lines. Cytotoxic activities were measured using colorimetric DNA fragmentation assay and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the cytotoxic effects of anti-Fas mAb were markedly enhanced by fixation on gelatin beads. Microscopic examination showed that the beads attached to the target cells and induced their apoptosis. These effects were enhanced further by adding tumor-specific mAb. These in vitro properties of the beads were well reconstituted in the peritoneal cavity of mice. CONCLUSION: Although antibody-coated gelatin beads lack several important properties of natural CTL, such as differentiation, proliferation, and the functions of adhesion molecules, they mimic well the targeting and cytotoxic functions of natural CTL. Our findings suggest that antibody-carrying gelatin beads may be the first step toward the development of artificial CTL and can be applied, for example, to artificial dendritic and stroma cells for the development of novel biotherapeutic approaches.","['Yokozawa, T', 'Miyamura, K', 'Fujino, R', 'Yonehara, S', 'Ueda, R', 'Tanimoto, M', 'Saito, H']","['Yokozawa T', 'Miyamura K', 'Fujino R', 'Yonehara S', 'Ueda R', 'Tanimoto M', 'Saito H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Apoptosis', 'CD13 Antigens/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', '*Gelatin', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', '*Microspheres', 'Peritoneal Cavity', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*immunology']",,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(00)00528-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00528-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 Oct;28(10):1129-36. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00528-2.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '9000-70-8 (Gelatin)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the roles of interleukin-6 and other gp130-dependent ligands on the proliferation of macrophage-lineage hemopoietic progenitor cells. METHODS: The responses of human and murine hemopoietic cells to combinations of cytokines involving interleukin-6 or related factors were assessed in short-term culture by clonogenic assay. RESULTS: Interleukin-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and ciliary neurotrophic factor inhibited formation of colonies stimulated by macrophage colony-stimulating factor. These effects were dose dependent and selective for macrophage-lineage precursors. Progenitors from murine peripheral blood were inhibited by 37-93% in cultures containing interleukin-6 (11 experiments; median, 68%). Macrophage progenitors from murine bone marrow were also inhibited by interleukin-6 but were less sensitive (seven experiments; median, 48%). In cultures costimulated with leukemia inhibitory factor, peripheral blood and bone marrow progenitors were inhibited by 82% and 58%, respectively. Ciliary neurotrophic factor inhibited macrophage colonies by 66%. Multilineage bone marrow colony formation was not affected. In cultures of human bone marrow cells stimulated with macrophage colony stimulating factor and stem cell factor, interleukin-6 inhibited colony formation by 51-74%. Bone marrow colonies stimulated by granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor were not inhibited by costimulation with interleukin-6.

We report the results of studies aimed at understanding the regulatory mechanisms controlling p45 gene expression in erythroid cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human p45 mRNAs have two alternative isoforms, aNF-E2 and fNF-E2, and these isoforms are transcribed from the alternative promoters. We investigated lineage-specific expression of both isomers in human erythroid and megakaryocytic cells by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or Northern blot analysis. For functional characterization of both promoters, plasmids in which reporter genes were placed under the control of a series of truncated or mutated promoter fragments were transfected to human hematopoietic cell lines. RESULTS: When CD34(+) cells isolated from human cord blood were induced to unilineage erythroid or megakaryocytic differentiation in liquid suspension culture, both transcripts, although barely detected at day 0, were induced in both erythroid and megakaryocytic cultures. fNF-E2 mRNA was found to be more abundant in erythroid cells than megakaryocytic cells at day 7 of culture. Although both isomers were expressed in human erythroid-megakaryocytic cell lines, megakaryocytic maturation with loss of erythroid phenotype induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) resulted in exclusive downregulation of fNF-E2, suggesting that fNF-E2 promoter is more erythroid specific. Functional analysis of fNF-E2 promoter showed that the promoter is active only in erythroid-megakaryocytic cells and that the double GATA site in the proximal region is necessary for its efficient activity. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that GATA proteins, which govern the differentiation of erythroid lineage cells, are required for full promoter activity of the p45 gene.","['Toki, T', 'Arai, K', 'Terui, K', 'Komatsu, N', 'Yokoyama, M', 'Katsuoka, F', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Ito, E']","['Toki T', 'Arai K', 'Terui K', 'Komatsu N', 'Yokoyama M', 'Katsuoka F', 'Yamamoto M', 'Ito E']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/chemistry', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Megakaryocytes/chemistry', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(00)00523-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00523-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 Oct;28(10):1113-9. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00523-3.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (NFE2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To that end, we examined biochemical features of 7D5-Cyt b binding and used the J404 phage display nonapeptide library to identify the bound epitope. 7D5 precipitated only heterodimeric gp91-p22phox and not individual or denatured Cyt b subunits from detergent extracts of human neutrophils and promyelocytic leukemia cells (gp91-PLB). Moreover, 7D5 precipitated precursor gp65-p22phox complexes from detergent extracts of the biosynthetically active gp91-PLB cells, demonstrating that complex carbohydrates were not required for epitope recognition. Epitope mimetics selected from the J404 phage display library by 7D5 demonstrated that (226)RIVRG(230) and (160)IKNP(163) regions of gp91phox were both bound by 7D5. These studies reveal specific information about Cyt b membrane topology and structure, namely that gp91phox residues (226)RIVRG(230) and (160)IKNP(163) are closely juxtaposed on extracytoplasmic domains and that predicted helices containing residues Gly(165)-Ile(190) and Ser(200)-Glu(225) are adjacent to each other in the membrane.","['Burritt, J B', 'DeLeo, F R', 'McDonald, C L', 'Prigge, J R', 'Dinauer, M C', 'Nakamura, M', 'Nauseef, W M', 'Jesaitis, A J']","['Burritt JB', 'DeLeo FR', 'McDonald CL', 'Prigge JR', 'Dinauer MC', 'Nakamura M', 'Nauseef WM', 'Jesaitis AJ']","['Department of Microbiology, Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana 59717, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Bacteriophages/*genetics', 'Cytochrome b Group/*chemistry/genetics/immunology', 'Dimerization', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', '*Epitope Mapping', 'Humans', '*NADPH Oxidases', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology', 'Precipitin Tests']",,2000/10/12 00:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2000/10/12 00:00'],"['2000/10/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M006236200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)46711-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Jan 19;276(3):2053-61. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M006236200.

Preclinical studies suggest that As(2)O(3) induces apoptosis and possibly differentiation in APL cells. Like APL cells, neuroblastoma (NB) cells are thought to be arrested at an early stage of differentiation, and cells of highly malignant tumors fail to undergo spontaneous maturation. Both APL and NB cells can respond with differentiation to retinoic acid (RA) treatment in vitro and probably also in vivo. For that reason we investigated the effect of As(2)O(3) alone and in combination with RA on NB cell lines. In vitro, the number of viable NB cells was reduced at As(2)O(3) concentrations around 1 microM after 72 h exposure. The IC50 in six different cell lines treated for 3 days was in the 1.5 to 5 microM concentration interval, the most sensitive being SK-N-BE(2) cells derived from a chemotherapy resistant tumor. The combined treatment with RA (1 and 3 microM) showed no consistent additional effect with regard to induced cell death. The effect of As(2)O(3) on NB cell number involved As(2)O(3)-induced apoptotic pathways (decreased expression of Bcl-2 and stimulation of caspase-3 activity) with no clear evidence of induced differentiation. The in vivo effect of As(2)O(3) on NB growth was also investigated in nude mice bearing tumors of xenografted NB cells. Although tumor growth was reduced by As(2)O(3) treatment, complete remission was not achieved at the concentrations tested. We suggest that As(2)O(3), in combination with existing treatment modalities, might be a treatment approach for high risk NB patients.","['Ora, I', 'Bondesson, L', 'Jonsson, C', 'Ljungberg, J', 'Porn-Ares, I', 'Garwicz, S', 'Pahlman, S']","['Ora I', 'Bondesson L', 'Jonsson C', 'Ljungberg J', 'Porn-Ares I', 'Garwicz S', 'Pahlman S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital MAS, Malmo, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neuroblastoma/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Tetrazolium Salts/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bbrc.2000.3651 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(00)93651-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2000 Oct 14;277(1):179-85. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2000.3651.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,

However, altered expression of this gene has been reported in cancer cells. In order to understand if p73 is involved in normal and malignant development of myeloid cells, we investigated the expression pattern of the different p73 isoforms in progenitor and mature normal myeloid cells as well as in cells derived from acute and chronic myeloid leukemias. The results show that expression of p73 is markedly enhanced during differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells and that leukemic blasts from patients show an increased expression of the shorter p73 isoforms (gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta). In particular the epsilon isoform is only expressed in leukemic cells and completely absent in mature myeloid cells. Altogether our data suggest that p73 is involved in myeloid differentiation and its altered expression is involved in leukemic degeneration.","['Tschan, M P', 'Grob, T J', 'Peters, U R', 'Laurenzi, V D', 'Huegli, B', 'Kreuzer, K A', 'Schmidt, C A', 'Melino, G', 'Fey, M F', 'Tobler, A', 'Cajot, J F']","['Tschan MP', 'Grob TJ', 'Peters UR', 'Laurenzi VD', 'Huegli B', 'Kreuzer KA', 'Schmidt CA', 'Melino G', 'Fey MF', 'Tobler A', 'Cajot JF']","['Department of Clinical Research, Institute of Medical Oncology, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bbrc.2000.3627 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(00)93627-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2000 Oct 14;277(1):62-5. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2000.3627.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,

Those peptides were arranged in such a way that permits one to obtain different combinations of chimeric peptides (M1-M2, M2-M1, M1-M3, and M3-M1). Two glycine residues were used as arm spacers for separating the two sequences. The antigenicity of these peptides was evaluated in an ultramicroenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (UMELISA) using sera of human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)-infected individuals (n = 24), while specificity was evaluated with anti-HTLV-II-positive samples (n = 11) and healthy blood donors (n = 25).

Phosphorylated pRb was detected to bind E2F-1 and E2F-3, which appears to be a major form of pRb complexes in actively cycling cells. TGFbeta1 significantly downregulated pRb-E2F-1 and pRb-E2F-3 complexes as a result of inhibition of E2F-1 and E2F-3. In contrast, complexes of E2F-4 with pRb and with p130 were increased markedly upon TGFbeta1 treatment, whereas p107 associated E2F-4 was dramatically decreased. In agreement with these results, p130-E2F-4 DNA binding activity was dominant in TGFbeta1 treated cells, whereas p107-E2F-4 DNA binding activity was only found in proliferating cells. Our data strongly suggest that inhibition of E2Fs and differential regulation of pRb family-E2F-4 complexes are linked to TGFbeta1-induced growth inhibition.

However, the physiological role of ROS is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that mast cell model rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells generate ROS in response to antigen and the calcium-ionophore A23187 via activation of diphenyleneiodonuim (DPI)-sensitive enzyme and that blockade of ROS generation by DPI suppresses histamine release induced by either stimulant. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125(FAK) and a 77-kDa protein coprecipitating specifically with the kinase occurred in parallel with the secretion, and blockade of ROS generation by DPI also suppressed the tyrosine phosphorylation of both proteins. These findings suggest that ROS generated by a flavoenzyme-dependent mechanism may be involved in histamine release through the pp125(FAK) pathway.","['Matsui, T', 'Suzuki, Y', 'Yamashita, K', 'Yoshimaru, T', 'Suzuki-Karasaki, M', 'Hayakawa, S', 'Yamaki, M', 'Shimizu, K']","['Matsui T', 'Suzuki Y', 'Yamashita K', 'Yoshimaru T', 'Suzuki-Karasaki M', 'Hayakawa S', 'Yamaki M', 'Shimizu K']","['Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, 173-8610, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Histamine/*metabolism', '*Histamine Release', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Onium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bbrc.2000.3545 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(00)93545-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2000 Sep 24;276(2):742-8. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2000.3545.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Onium Compounds)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '6HJ411TU98 (diphenyleneiodonium)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Ptk2 protein, rat)']",,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,

Our results indicate that the combined LacSwitch and Tet-Off systems may require cell growth for gene expression.","['Iwanaga, R', 'Ohtani, K', 'Nakamura, M']","['Iwanaga R', 'Ohtani K', 'Nakamura M']","['Human Gene Sciences Center, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', '*Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/physiology', 'Lactose/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tetracyclines']",,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bbrc.2000.3515 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(00)93515-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2000 Sep 24;276(2):546-52. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2000.3515.,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tetracyclines)', 'J2B2A4N98G (Lactose)']",,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,

A number of substances with neurotrophic effects have been shown to increase survival of motoneurons in vivo and in vitro. Here we have used semiquantitative in situ hybridization histochemistry to detect the regulation in motoneurons of mRNAs for receptors to ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) 1-42 days after the described three types of axon injury. After all types of injury, the mRNAs for GDNF receptors (GFRalpha-1 and c-RET) and the LIF receptor LIFR were distinctly (up to 300%) up-regulated in motoneurons. The CNTF receptor CNTFRalpha mRNA displayed only small changes, whereas the mRNA for membrane glycoprotein 130 (gp130), which is a critical receptor component for LIF and CNTF transduction, was profoundly down-regulated in motoneurons after ventral root avulsion. The BDNF full-length receptor trkB mRNA was up-regulated acutely after adult sciatic nerve lesion, whereas after ventral root avulsion trkB was down-regulated. The NT-3 receptor trkC mRNA was strongly down-regulated after ventral root avulsion. The results demonstrate that removal of peripheral nerve tissue from proximally lesioned motor axons induces profound down-regulations of mRNAs for critical components of receptors for CNTF, LIF, and NT-3 in affected motoneurons, but GDNF receptor mRNAs are up-regulated in the same situation. These results should be considered in relation to the extensive cell death among motoneurons after ventral root avulsion and should also be important for the design of therapeutical approaches in cases of motoneuron death.","['Hammarberg, H', 'Piehl, F', 'Risling, M', 'Cullheim, S']","['Hammarberg H', 'Piehl F', 'Risling M', 'Cullheim S']","['Department of Neuroscience, Nobels v. 12A, Karolinska Institute, S-171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.

To block BCR/ABL function, we created a unique tyrosine phosphatase by fusing the catalytic domain of SHP1 (SHP1c) to the ABL binding domain (ABD) of RIN1, an established binding partner and substrate for c-ABL and BCR/ABL. This fusion construct (ABD/SHP1c) binds to BCR/ABL in cells and functions as an active phosphatase. ABD/SHP1c effectively suppressed BCR/ABL function as judged by reductions in transformation of fibroblast cells, growth factor independence of hematopoietic cell lines, and proliferation of primary bone marrow cells. In addition, the leukemogenic properties of BCR/ABL in a murine model system were blocked by coexpression of ABD/SHP1c. Both the ""escort"" function provided by ABD and the inhibitor function provided by the phosphatase of SHP1c were necessary for effective BCR/ABL interference. Expression of ABD/SHP1c also reversed the transformed phenotype of K562, a human leukemia-derived cell line. These results have direct implications for leukemia therapeutics and suggest an approach to block aberrant signal transduction in other pathologies through the use of appropriately designed escort/inhibitors.","['Lim, Y M', 'Wong, S', 'Lau, G', 'Witte, O N', 'Colicelli, J']","['Lim YM', 'Wong S', 'Lau G', 'Witte ON', 'Colicelli J']","['Molecular Biology Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",PMC17324,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.210253497 [doi]', '210253497 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Oct 24;97(22):12233-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.210253497.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, mouse)']",,,,"['R01 CA056301/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 76204/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56301/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

By infection with retroviral vectors containing N- or B-tropic core and pantropic vesicular stomatitis virus-G envelope protein, we now demonstrate that cell lines derived from various mammalian species, including humans, have an Fv1-like retrovirus restriction function, preventing N-tropic vector infection. Like Fv1, restriction is directed at amino acid 110 of the viral capsid protein. In contrast to Fv1, the novel restriction is characterized by the absence of reverse-transcribed viral DNA.

DESIGN: Ecological correlation study. SETTING: The county of Ostergotland in Sweden. METHODS: Every child born in the county between 1979 and 1992 was mapped to the property centroid coordinates by linking addresses in the population and property registers. Population maps were overlaid with radon maps and exposure at birth and each subsequent year was quantified as high, normal, low or unknown. This was analysed with data from the tumour registry. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated using the age and sex specific rates for Sweden for the year 1995. RESULTS: 90 malignancies occurred among 53 146 children (498 887 person years) who formed the study population. SMRs for acute lymphatic leukaemia (ALL) among children born in high, normal and low risk areas were 1.43, 1.17 and 0.25 respectively. The relative risk for the normal risk group and high risk group as compared with the low risk group was 4.64 (95% CI 1.29, 28.26) and 5. 67 (95% CI 1.06, 42.27). The association between ALL and continued residence at normal or high risk areas showed a similar trend. No association between radon risk levels and any other malignancy was seen. CONCLUSION: Children born in and staying at areas where the risk from ground radon has been classified as low are less likely to develop ALL than those born in areas classified as normal and high risk.","['Kohli, S', 'Noorlind Brage, H', 'Lofman, O']","['Kohli S', 'Noorlind Brage H', 'Lofman O']","['Department of Medical Informatics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Public Health Centre, University Hospital, S-581 85, Linkoping, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Air Pollutants, Radioactive/*adverse effects', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Radon/*adverse effects', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",PMC1731593,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jech.54.11.822 [doi]'],ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 2000 Nov;54(11):822-6. doi: 10.1136/jech.54.11.822.,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Radioactive)', '0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', 'Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, for all of these cultivations expensive standard media containing 10% fetal calf serum are needed to obtain functional receptor. Here we report on the development of a serum-free production-scale process based on a stable transformed and highly productive human leukemia cell line K562 (1). Starting with K562-TSH-R cells growing in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum the cell line was adapted to serum-free medium. The adaptation medium was optimized in regards to amino acid and protein concentrations, since the use of unadjusted medium caused cell death after 2 days. The adapted cells were stable and could be cultivated without antibiotics for more than 50 cell doublings without losing their productivity. The obtained receptor showed improved TSH binding. The process development was based on cultivations in a 2-L bench-scale bioreactor. Cultivations in batch mode and chemostat mode and perfusion cultivation with the usage of an internal microfiltration device and a spin-filter device were compared. After process optimization a continuous process using spin-filter was set up and run in a 20 L-pilot-scale bioreactor.

DESIGN AND PATIENTS: A retrospective study of L5 vertebral body fractures was carried out using plain radiographs, CT, and/or MRI. Over a 5-year period, 51 patients with L5 vertebral body fractures were seen at our institution. Since L1 vertebral body fractures are common, 51 age- and gender-matched (20 men, 31 women; mean age 60 years) patients with L fractures were utilized as the control group. The frequency of neoplastic infiltration of the vertebrae was compared between these two populations to determine whether pathologic fracture was more frequent at L5. RESULTS: Twelve (24%) of the L5 fractures were pathologic compared with four (8%) of the L1 fractures (chi-square test, P<0.05). Neoplasm types included multiple myeloma (n=4), prostate (n=3), breast (n=2), lung (n=2), melanoma (n=2), bladder, colon, and leukemia (each n=1). CONCLUSION: Although most L5 fractures are not pathologic, there is an increased incidence of pathologic fractures in this location compared with L1.

A heterogeneous group containing an unusual form of splenic lymphoma.,523-33,"We reviewed our institutional experience with de novo CD5+, large B-cell lymphomas to determine whether they represent a distinct entity and are related to CD5+ small B-cell disorders. We identified 13 cases with multiparameter flow cytometry over a period of 58 months (5% of large B-cell lymphomas) in 7 females and 6 males. Three groups were identified. Group 1 (2 cases) had diffuse splenic red pulp involvement with a distinctive cordal pattern of infiltration, no other clinical evidence of mass disease, microscopic disseminated disease on further workup, and an identical immunoglobulin-negative immunophenotype. Group 2 cases (7 cases) were clinically and morphologically heterogeneous and had an immunophenotype resembling mantle cell lymphoma (FMC7-positive, CD23-). Group 3 (4 cases) had miscellaneous immunophenotypes, including one closely resembling chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cyclin D1 was positive in only 1 of 10 evaluable cases (group 2). We conclude that CD5+ diffuse large B-cell lymphomas are heterogeneous; most cases do not seem to be related to chronic lymphocytic leukemia or mantle cell lymphoma. However, we identified a subgroup of primary splenic CD5+ large B-cell lymphoma with diffuse red pulp involvement and believe this may represent a distinct clinicopathologic entity.","['Kroft, S H', 'Howard, M S', 'Picker, L J', 'Ansari, M Q', 'Aquino, D B', 'McKenna, R W']","['Kroft SH', 'Howard MS', 'Picker LJ', 'Ansari MQ', 'Aquino DB', 'McKenna RW']","['Dept of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75390-9073, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/classification/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Point Mutation', 'Splenic Neoplasms/classification/metabolism/*pathology']",,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1309/RM1Q-1T0B-WKQB-AF5A [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2000 Oct;114(4):523-33. doi: 10.1309/RM1Q-1T0B-WKQB-AF5A.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms by which PML exerts its pro-apoptotic function are still unknown. Here we show that PML acts as a transcriptional co-activator with p53. PML physically interacts with p53 both in vitro and in vivo and co-localizes with p53 in the PML nuclear body (PML-NB). The co-activatory role of PML depends on its ability to localize in the PML-NB. p53-dependent, DNA-damage-induced apoptosis, transcriptional activation by p53, the DNA-binding ability of p53, and the induction of p53 target genes such as Bax and p21 upon gamma-irradiation are all impaired in PML-/- primary cells. These results define a new PML-dependent, p53-regulatory pathway for apoptosis and shed new light on the function of PML in tumour suppression.","['Guo, A', 'Salomoni, P', 'Luo, J', 'Shih, A', 'Zhong, S', 'Gu, W', 'Pandolfi, P P']","['Guo A', 'Salomoni P', 'Luo J', 'Shih A', 'Zhong S', 'Gu W', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Department of Human Genetics and Molecular Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nat Cell Biol,Nature cell biology,100890575,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'DNA Damage', 'Gamma Rays', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/35036365 [doi]'],ppublish,Nat Cell Biol. 2000 Oct;2(10):730-6. doi: 10.1038/35036365.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",,,,"['CA 71692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

In some cases, mixed populations can be found and these are differentiated by antigenic expression patterns. DESIGN AND METHODS: We report the case of a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia whose relapse was classified as T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).

The presence of the P210(bcr-abl) rearrangement in CML cells has allowed highly sensitive detection of MRD by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, complete eradication of the leukemic clone may not be a necessary prerequisite for long-term remission or cure. This observation limits the value of qualitative PCR analysis for prediction of progressive disease and highlights the need to monitor the proliferative activity of the malignant clone in order to permit timely detection of impending relapse and, thus, early therapy. This article discusses the applicability of several molecular methods to the monitoring of treatment efficacy and early assessment of clonal expansion in patients with CML after BMT. It also presents guidelines for clinical use of PCR analyses and the most effective approaches to treat relapsed patients. INFORMATION SOURCES: The authors have been working in this field, both experimentally and at a clinical level, contributing original papers to peer-reviewed journals. The material examined in this review includes articles published in journals covered by MedLine and reviews from journals with a high impact factor. STATE OF THE ART AND PERSPECTIVES: In view of the very limited value of qualitative PCR in detecting CML patients destined to relapse after BMT, several investigators have developed molecular assays that enable the kinetics of MRD to be monitored over time (e.g. quantitative PCR for P210(bcr-abl), PCR analysis of whole blood/lineage-specific chimerism and qualitative PCR for P190(bcr-abl)). These molecular strategies closely trace the kinetics of leukemic regrowth. Disease evolution in relapsed patients is consistently characterized by the sequential detection of increasing P210(bcr-abl) transcript levels, increasing myeloid mixed chimerism and finally, P190(bcr-abl) positivity preceding cytogenetic relapse. A 10-fold or greater increase in the expression of P210(bcr-abl) confirmed by a minimum of three independent quantitative PCR analyses and/or a progressive increase in the percentage of host myeloid cells in three consecutive chimerism analyses and/or P190(bcr-abl) mRNA detection must be regarded as an indication of incipient disease progression and should provide a rationale for initiation of treatment. There are various approaches to the management of the patient who relapses. The first step, if possible, is to reduce or terminate immune suppression. If the patient is not receiving this therapy, he or she can be treated with hydroxyurea or interferon or can be offered a second transplant. However, infusion to the patient of lymphoid cells (DLI) collected from the original donor has the capacity to restore complete remission in 70-80% of cases. Currently, several strategies are being used to minimize the severity of graft-versus-host disease after DLI (optimization of transfused lymphocyte doses, modification of the transfused lymphocyte subsets, administration of lymphocytes in escalating doses or lymphocyte transfection with a suicide gene), to reduce the incidence of marrow aplasia (stem cell support) and to increase the rate of complete responses (cytokines associated with DLI, leukemia-reactive cytotoxic lymphocytes, tyrosine kinase inhibitors or pre-emptive DLI).","['Roman, J', 'Alvarez, M A', 'Torres, A']","['Roman J', 'Alvarez MA', 'Torres A']","['Hematology Department, Reina Sofia Hospital, Avda.

It carries an extremely poor prognosis. We report our experience of clinical findings, diagnostic procedures, treatment and outcome of mucormycosis diagnosed in neutropenic patients affected by hematologic neoplasms admitted to our Department. DESIGN AND METHODS: From November 1987 to July 1999 we observed 13 cases of Mucor. Their median age was 61 years (range 20-75), and they were predominantly in the aplastic post-chemotherapy period (12/13), affected by acute myeloid leukemia (11 cases ) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (2 cases). Six patients (all with leukemia) were receiving inductionEth consolidation therapy, 7 had progressive hematologic disease. At the onset of infection all patients were neutropenic (N < 0.5x10(9)/L). No patients had diabetes mellitus. Two patients had been receiving steroid therapy for 5 and 7 days. RESULTS: The lung was involved in all cases (13/13); disseminated disease was present in 8/13 patients. All cultures (blood, sputum, nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage) were negative. In 3 patients a histologic diagnosis was made in vivo: in 1 patient by percutaneous pulmonary biopsy, in 1 patient by pulmonary lobectomy, and in the last patient by percutaneous pulmonary biopsy confirmed by excision of a cerebellar abscess. In the remaining 10 cases diagnosis was made post-mortem. Five patients were not treated, 2 because of poor clinical condition and 3 because fungal infection was not suspected. Amphotericin B (1 mg/kg/day) was given empirically to 6 patients and 2 responded to treatment. The remaining 2 patients with neurologic symptoms at the onset of infection were treated with liposomal amphotericin, Ambisome, one with 3 and one with 5 mg/kg/day; of these two patients the first died in 4 days; the second, with both pulmonary and cerebellar localizations, was treated successfully with 5 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks and then with 3 mg/kg/day, and excision of a brain abscess at neutrophil recovery (total dose of Ambisome: 12,000 mg). The 3 surviving leukemic patients were able to complete subsequent consolidation therapy using amphotericin B or liposomal amphotericin as secondary prophylaxis during aplasia. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In neutropenic hematologic patients Mucor is rarely suspected. In our patients infection was often characterized by disseminated disease and a rapidly fatal course; only early aggressive amphotericin B (or Ambisome) treatment together with neutrophil recovery appeared to improve the outcome. Diagnosis is very important for programming antifungal therapy and secondary prophylaxis with amphotericin B, because Mucor is usually resistant to itraconazole.","['Nosari, A', 'Oreste, P', 'Montillo, M', 'Carrafiello, G', 'Draisci, M', 'Muti, G', 'Molteni, A', 'Morra, E']","['Nosari A', 'Oreste P', 'Montillo M', 'Carrafiello G', 'Draisci M', 'Muti G', 'Molteni A', 'Morra E']","['Department of Hematology, Niguarda Ca Granda Hospital, piazza Ospedale Maggiore 3, 20160 Milan, Italy. miccaimi@tin.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucormycosis/drug therapy/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Steroids/therapeutic use']",,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 Oct;85(10):1068-71.,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Steroids)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the event-free survival (EFS), transplant-related mortality (TRM) and the probability of relapse (PR) of patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for ALL conditioned with or without total body irradiation (TBI). DESIGN AND METHODS: The study sample consisted of 156 patients conditioned with regimens based on TBI (n=114) or on high doses of oral busulfan (BU) (n=42). Most of the BU group received phenytoin as prophylaxis for seizures. The median follow-up was 6 years. RESULTS: EFS at 6 years was 43% (95% CI 35%-51%) versus 22% (95% CI 10%-34%) in the TBI and BU subsets respectively (p=0.01). TRM at 18 months was 22% and 17% in the BU and TBI groups (p=0.24), respectively. At 3 years actuarial PR was 71% in the BU group and 47% in the TBI group (p=0.01). In the multivariable analysis, a worse EFS was associated with BU, relative risk (RR) 1.7; advanced disease versus 1st and 2nd complete remission (CR) at HCT, RR 2.5; absence of chronic graft-versus-host disease, RR 1.8; development of veno-occlusive disease RR 2.2 and shorter CR duration before transplant. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS. TBI was associated with a lower relapse rate and better EFS, even in patients in 1(st )and 2(nd) CR, than schemes based on high doses of busulfan. This suggests that conditioning regimens based on TBI should remain the standard method of preparative regimen for patients with ALL.","['Granados, E', 'de La Camara, R', 'Madero, L', 'Diaz, M A', 'Martin-Regueira, P', 'Steegmann, J L', 'Arranz, R', 'Figuera, A', 'Fernandez-Ranada, J M']","['Granados E', 'de La Camara R', 'Madero L', 'Diaz MA', 'Martin-Regueira P', 'Steegmann JL', 'Arranz R', 'Figuera A', 'Fernandez-Ranada JM']","['Haematology Department, Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, C/ Diego de Leon 62, 28006 Madrid, Spain. egranadosr@aehh.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anticonvulsants/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenytoin/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 Oct;85(10):1060-7.,"['0 (Anticonvulsants)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '6158TKW0C5 (Phenytoin)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Biologic and clinical features.,1024-31,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hepatosplenic gd T-cell lymphoma is a rare entity of peripheral T-cell lymphomas. We characterized in detail the first case of hepatosplenic gd -T-cell lymphoma following acute myeloid leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Hepatosplenic gd -T-cell lymphoma was diagnosed in a woman who had been in complete remission (CR) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) for two years. Improvement but no objective response of the disease was observed after various types of chemotherapy. CR was achieved after related donor stem cell transplantation. Thirteen months later relapse of hepatosplenic gd T-cell lymphoma was diagnosed. While being prepared for a second transplantation the patient developed meningeal lymphoma and died. The patient's lymphoma cells were studied by immunologic, functional and molecular techniques. RESULTS: Lymphoma cells expressed the gd T-cell receptor (TCR), CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, CD38, CD45, CD161 (NKR-P1), TIA and Ki67. Further analysis revealed expression of Vd1 and two distinct TCRg chains, Vg3 and Vg9, by the malignant cell clone. The clonality of the T-cells was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by sequencing of TCR Vg3, Vg9 and Vd1 junctional regions. Clone-specific PCR was negative at diagnosis of AML and was positive at all times during follow-up of the hepatosplenic gd T-cell lymphoma. The lymphoma cells mediated strong natural killer cell-like cytotoxic activity, possibly explained by expression of CD161 and a lack of killer inhibitory receptor. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Several so far undescribed features were observed in this case of hepatosplenic gd T-cell lymphoma, such as T-cell lymphoma following AML, expression of two distinct T-cell receptor g-chains, and an unexpected cytotoxic phenotype.","['Weidmann, E', 'Hinz, T', 'Klein, S', 'Schui, D K', 'Harder, S', 'Kriener, S', 'Kabelitz, D', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Mitrou, P S']","['Weidmann E', 'Hinz T', 'Klein S', 'Schui DK', 'Harder S', 'Kriener S', 'Kabelitz D', 'Hoelzer D', 'Mitrou PS']","['Department of Medicine III, Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt/M, Germany. e.weidmann@em.uni-frankfurt.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/pathology', '*Liver Neoplasms', '*Lymphoma, T-Cell/immunology', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'Pregnancy', '*Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic', '*Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta', '*Splenic Neoplasms']",,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 Oct;85(10):1024-31.,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Our purpose was to evaluate the efficacy of pipobroman (PB) in the long-term control of PV and to assess early and late events. DESIGN AND METHODS: From June 1975 to December 1997, 163 untreated patients with PV (median age 57 years, range 30-82) were treated with PB in a single Institute for a median follow-up of 120 months. The diagnosis was made according to the Polycythemia Vera Study Group criteria. PB was given at the dose of 1 mg/kg/day until hematologic response (hematocrit < 45% and platelets < 400x109/L) and of 0.3-0.6 mg/kg/day as maintenance therapy. RESULTS: Hematologic remission was achieved in 94% of patients in a median time of 13 weeks (range 6-48). Median overall survival was 215 months, with a standardized mortality ratio of 1.7. The cumulative risk of death was 11%, 22%, and 26% at 7, 10, and 12 years, respectively. The incidence of thrombotic events was 18.4x105 person-year and the cumulative risk was 6%, 11%, 16%, and 20% at 3, 7, 10, and 12 years respectively. Acute leukemia occurred in 11 patients, myelofibrosis in 7, and solid tumors in 11. The 10-year cumulative risk of leukemia, myelofibrosis, and solid tumors was 5%, 4%, and 8%, respectively. In the logistic analysis age over 65 (p = 0.0001) and thrombotic events at diagnosis (p = 0.001) were significantly correlated with a higher risk of death. Female gender (p = 0.02) and age over 65 (p = 0.01) significantly influenced the occurrence of thrombotic complications. Age was the only significant risk factor for leukemia (p = 0.04) and for solid tumors (p = 0.03), while the duration of PB treatment did not influence these risks. No significant risk factor was demonstrated for myelofibrosis. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates in a large series of patients, observed for a long period, that pipobroman is effective in the long-term control of PV. The risk of early thrombotic complications at 3 years is 6% and the 10-year risk of acute leukemia, late myelofibrosis, and solid tumors is 5%, 4%, and 8%, respectively. The duration of pipobroman treatment did not correlate with these events.","['Passamonti, F', 'Brusamolino, E', 'Lazzarino, M', 'Barate, C', 'Klersy, C', 'Orlandi, E', 'Canevari, A', 'Castelli, G', 'Merante, S', 'Bernasconi, C']","['Passamonti F', 'Brusamolino E', 'Lazzarino M', 'Barate C', 'Klersy C', 'Orlandi E', 'Canevari A', 'Castelli G', 'Merante S', 'Bernasconi C']","['Institute of Hematology, University of Pavia, Policlinico San Matteo IRCCS, Viale Golgi 19, 27100 Pavia, Italy. f.passamonti@smatteo.pv.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pipobroman/*administration & dosage', 'Polycythemia Vera/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 Oct;85(10):1011-8.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '6Q99RDT97R (Pipobroman)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To describe the occurrence of potentially work-related cancers among African American and Latino Workers, we conducted an epidemiologic study based on death certificate data. METHODS: Data were obtained from 21 states during 1985-1992. Directly adjusted proportionate mortality ratios (PMRs) and standardized mortality rate ratios (SRRs) for ages 20-64 years were computed for cancers of the lung, nasal cavity, pleura, and peritoneum, malignant melanoma and leukemia using the mortality data and population counts from the 1990 census. RESULTS: Proportionate mortality was generally low for both groups, but African Americans had higher than expected mortality rates for leukemia and cancers of the lung, nasal cavity, and peritoneum. Industry-specific analyses indicate excess leukemia among African American men in the rubber industry (PMR 2.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 - 3.35), Latino men in textile (PMR 2. 31, 95% CI 0.81 - 5.13) and wood industries (PMR 2.03, 95% CI 0.81 - 5.13), and Latino women in the chemical industry (PMR 2.18, 95% CI 0.59 - 8.10), among other findings. Excess cancer of the pleura and peritoneum was observed among workers with a variety of usual occupations, consistent with widespread exposure to asbestos.

METHODS: A total of 278 lymph nodes and 95 extranodal tissue specimens submitted over a 2-year period with complete histologic, FCI, and immunohistochemical (IH) data formed the basis of the study. RESULTS: The FCI data contributed significantly to or was consistent with the final tissue diagnosis in the majority (94%) of the tissue samples. There is no well-described utility of flow cytometry markers for Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) due to the usual scarcity of tumor cells in the final cell suspensions obtained from these tumors. However, the FCI data excluded non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and suggested the possible usefulness of CD15 and CD30 by FCI in HL. In addition, immunophenotypic data by FCI in combination with touch imprint cytomorphology was useful in excluding a diagnosis of NHL in cases of nonhematopoietic malignancies and was particularly useful in defining the following hematopoietic tumors and malignancies: thymoma, T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, leukemia cutis, and plasma cell dyscrasia. Thus, IH was not essential for the diagnosis in these latter cases and was performed in only two cases (one thymoma and one plasma cell dyscrasia). Of interest, FCI supported the diagnosis in 3 cases of Ewing's sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor by detection of CD56 on the surface of the malignant cell. Only 11% of NHL were ""negative"" by FCI (i.e., an aberrant T-cell or monoclonal B-cell population was not identified). Reasons for these discrepancies included partial tissue involvement by the NHL with sampling differences, T-cell rich or lymphohistiocytic-rich variants with a small population of monoclonal B cells, marked tumoral sclerosis, poor tumor preservation, and T-cell NHL without an aberrant immunophenotype. Only 60% of CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) were CD30+ by FCI. CONCLUSIONS: FCI data should always be correlated with light microscopy if no FCI abnormalities are detected; IH may need to be performed in selected cases. It is less necessary to perform microscopic examination of tissues when the FCI data are positive and indisputable. However, in selected cases in which FCI data is diagnostic, microscopic observations may provide additional information due to sampling.","['Dunphy, C H']",['Dunphy CH'],"['Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, St. Louis University Health Sciences Center, St. Louis, Missouri 63104, USA. dunphyc@slucare1.sluh.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['*Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/*immunology/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0320(20001015)42:5<296::AID-CYTO7>3.0.CO;2-X [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0320(20001015)42:5<296::aid-cyto7>3.0.co;2-x [doi]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 2000 Oct 15;42(5):296-306. doi: 10.1002/1097-0320(20001015)42:5<296::aid-cyto7>3.0.co;2-x.,,,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

The ALL-6 protocol of the Dutch Childhood Leukemia Study Group involved high-dose dexamethasone and methotrexate and no cranial irradiation. Therefore, we studied the long-term effects on bone mineral density (BMD), body composition, and growth in survivors of non-high-risk ALL treated with the ALL-6 protocol. PROCEDURE: Twenty-three subjects (12.2-25.4 years) participated in this cross-sectional study. Mean follow-up was 9.6 years (range 7.9-11.4 years). BMD of lumbar spine (LS) and total body (TB) and body composition were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry; results are expressed as standard deviation scores (SDS). Bone mineral apparent density (BMAD(LS)) was calculated to correct for bone size. A questionnaire was administered to determine physical activity, calcium intake, and medical history. RESULTS: Mean SDS for BMD(LS), BMD(TB), and BMAD(LS) were normal. None of the subjects had BMD below -2 SDS; one subject had BMAD(LS) below -2 SDS. Mean SDS for lean body mass, percentage fat, and height were not significantly different from zero. Calcium intake correlated positively with BMD. Nine subjects reported traumatic fractures (eight during or shortly after therapy). CONCLUSIONS: Ten years after ALL-6 treatment, no long-term side effects on height, BMD, or body composition were found in this small group of patients, despite high-dose dexamethasone and methotrexate. This study suggests that ALL treatment without cranial irradiation might not be associated with long-term side effects on growth and BMD.","['van der Sluis, I M', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, M M', 'Hahlen, K', 'Krenning, E P', 'de Muinck Keizer-Schrama, S M']","['van der Sluis IM', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Hahlen K', 'Krenning EP', 'de Muinck Keizer-Schrama SM']","[""Division of Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. vandesluis@alkg.azr.nl""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Body Composition', '*Body Height', '*Bone Density', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Survivors']",,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1096-911X(20001001)35:4<415::AID-MPO4>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]', '10.1002/1096-911x(20001001)35:4<415::aid-mpo4>3.0.co;2-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2000 Oct;35(4):415-20. doi: 10.1002/1096-911x(20001001)35:4<415::aid-mpo4>3.0.co;2-9.,,,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

About 11% of Caucasians have intermediate TPMT activity because of heterozygosity, and about 1 in 300 inherits TPMT deficiency as an autosomal codominant trait. If patients who have intermediate or deficient TPMT activity receive the standard dose of thiopurine medications, they can accumulate excessive thiopurine nucleotides in hematopoietic tissue, which could lead to severe and possibly fatal myelosuppression. There is very little information about TPMT genetic variation among Asian populations. We investigated the frequency of TPMT genetic variation among Thai children with acute leukemia. PROCEDURE: Fresh whole blood was obtained from 75 Thai children with acute leukemia at the time of remission. Genomic DNA was isolated from total peripheral white blood cells. We performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect 3 types of variant of the human TPMT gene. RESULTS: Among 75 patients, the frequency of heterozygotes for the TPMT gene among Thai children with acute leukemia was approximately 11%. However, the TPMT*3C was the only variant TPMT allele found among Thai children. This is different from the North American Caucasian populations, in which TPMT*3A is the predominant variant allele, and TPMT*3C is rare (approximately 5% of variant alleles). CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in the frequency of this genetic variation between Asian and North American Caucasian populations. Determination of the TPMT genotype by PCR method before antileukemic therapy is practical and may have clinical relevance. This knowledge could be applied towards organ transplant recipients who require these medications for immunosuppression.","['Hongeng, S', 'Sasanakul, W', 'Chuansumrit, A', 'Pakakasama, S', 'Chattananon, A', 'Hathirat, P']","['Hongeng S', 'Sasanakul W', 'Chuansumrit A', 'Pakakasama S', 'Chattananon A', 'Hathirat P']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. rashe@mahidol.ac.th']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asians/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', '*Gene Frequency', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*genetics', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*genetics', 'Thailand']",,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1096-911X(20001001)35:4<410::AID-MPO3>3.0.CO;2-R [pii]', '10.1002/1096-911x(20001001)35:4<410::aid-mpo3>3.0.co;2-r [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2000 Oct;35(4):410-4. doi: 10.1002/1096-911x(20001001)35:4<410::aid-mpo3>3.0.co;2-r.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

The optimal conditioning regimen is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the appropriate dosing of etoposide in combination with busulfan and cyclophosphamide in this setting. PROCEDURE: Twenty patients with a diagnosis of AML in first or second remission, or myelodysplasia scheduled for bone marrow transplantation, were included in this study. Patients received busulfan 640 mg/m(2) in 16 doses, cyclophosphamide 120 to 150 mg/kg in two doses, and etoposide from 40-60 mg/kg as a single dose. Extensive toxicity data was collected. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were evaluable for toxicity. Mucositis was seen in all patients. Four patients developed bacteremia and one patient died from overwhelming sepsis on day +3. Four patients developed moderate to severe skin toxicity. The major dose-limiting +3 toxicity was hepatic toxicity, which occurred in 14 of 19 patients. Eight patients developed clinical veno-occlusive disease, including three patients at dose level 4, two of whom had life-threatening disease. This hepatic toxicity defined the MTD of 640 mg/m(2) busulfan, 120 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide, and 60 mg/kg of etoposide. Overall, 9 of 20 patients enrolled in the study survive in remission, 8/14 allogeneic (median follow-up 44 months), and one of six autologous patients (follow-up, 54 months). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the combination of busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide at the doses defined above has activity in the treatment of children with high-risk AML/MDS undergoing allogeneic HSCT. Whether it offers an advantage over other conditioning regimens will require a randomized trial with a larger cohort of patients.","['Sandler, E S', 'Hagg, R', 'Coppes, M J', 'Mustafa, M M', 'Gamis, A', 'Kamani, N', 'Wall, D']","['Sandler ES', 'Hagg R', 'Coppes MJ', 'Mustafa MM', 'Gamis A', 'Kamani N', 'Wall D']","[""UT Southwestern Medical School and Children's Hospital of Dallas, Dallas, Texas, USA. esandler@nemours.org""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alberta', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Missouri', 'Texas', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1096-911X(20001001)35:4<403::AID-MPO2>3.0.CO;2-M [pii]', '10.1002/1096-911x(20001001)35:4<403::aid-mpo2>3.0.co;2-m [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2000 Oct;35(4):403-9. doi: 10.1002/1096-911x(20001001)35:4<403::aid-mpo2>3.0.co;2-m.,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

Monoclonal antibodies against fragment Ba and Bb inhibited the apoptotic activity of factor B. When the purified fragment Bb was used for apoptosis induction, only the anti-Bb antibody inhibited Bb-induced apoptosis, and not the anti-Ba antibody. The apoptosis-inducing activity was found to be enhanced under conditions facilitating the formation of Bb. Blocking TNF/TNFR or FasL/Fas interactions did not interfere with the factor B-induced apoptosis. CD11c (iC3bR) acts as the main subunit of a heterodimer binding to fragment Bb in the apoptosis pathway, and the factor B-derived fragment Bb was found to possess the previously unknown function of inducing apoptosis in leukemic cells through a suicide mechanism of myeloid lineage cells during the differentiation stage.","['Uwai, M', 'Terui, Y', 'Mishima, Y', 'Tomizuka, H', 'Ikeda, M', 'Itoh, T', 'Mori, M', 'Ueda, M', 'Inoue, R', 'Yamada, M', 'Hayasawa, H', 'Horiuchi, T', 'Niho, Y', 'Matsumoto, M', 'Ishizaka, Y', 'Ikeda, K', 'Ozawa, K', 'Hatake, K']","['Uwai M', 'Terui Y', 'Mishima Y', 'Tomizuka H', 'Ikeda M', 'Itoh T', 'Mori M', 'Ueda M', 'Inoue R', 'Yamada M', 'Hayasawa H', 'Horiuchi T', 'Niho Y', 'Matsumoto M', 'Ishizaka Y', 'Ikeda K', 'Ozawa K', 'Hatake K']","['Department of Hematology, Jichi Medical School, Kawachi, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Complement C3/pharmacology', 'Complement C3 Convertase, Alternative Pathway', 'Complement C3b/immunology/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Integrin alphaXbeta2/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia/pathology/physiopathology', 'Lymphoma/pathology/physiopathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Complement/physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/physiology', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-4652(200011)185:2<280::AID-JCP13>3.0.CO;2-L [pii]', '10.1002/1097-4652(200011)185:2<280::AID-JCP13>3.0.CO;2-L [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2000 Nov;185(2):280-92. doi: 10.1002/1097-4652(200011)185:2<280::AID-JCP13>3.0.CO;2-L.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Complement C3)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Integrin alphaXbeta2)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '80295-43-8 (Complement C3b)', 'EC 3.4.21.47 (Complement C3 Convertase, Alternative Pathway)']",,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

The complete open reading frame of one of the novel ESTs, named TIG-1, was obtained by screening K562 cell and placental cDNA libraries. The deduced open reading frame of the TIG-1 cDNA encodes for a glutamine repeat-rich protein with a predicted molecular weight of 63kDa. The predicted open reading frame also contains a consensus bipartite nuclear localization signal, though no specific DNA-binding domain is found. The corresponding TIG-1 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed. Placental tissue expresses the TIG-1 mRNA 200 times more than the lowest expressing tissues such as kidney and lung. There is also preferential TIG-1 mRNA expression in cells of bone-marrow lineage.In-vitro transcription/translation of the TIG-1 cDNA yielded a polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 97kDa. Using polyclonal antibodies obtained from a rabbit immunized with the carboxy-terminal portion of bacterially expressed TIG-1 protein, a polypeptide with molecular weight of 97kDa was identified by Western blot analyses of protein lysates obtained from K562 cells. Cotransfection assays of K562 cells, using a GAL4-TIG-1 fusion gene and GAL4 operator-CAT, indicate that the TIG-1 protein may have transcriptional regulatory activity when tethered to DNA. We hypothesize that this novel glutamine-rich protein participates in a protein complex that regulates gene transcription. It has been demonstrated by Naar et al.

In this study we show that ICP0 is required for the proteasome-dependent degradation of the ND10 protein Sp100 and, as with the other target proteins, the ICP0 RING finger domain is essential. Further, comparison of the kinetics and ICP0 domain requirements for the degradation of PMI and Sp100 suggests that a common mechanism is involved. Homologues of ICP0 are encoded by other members of the alphaherpesvirus family. These proteins show strong sequence homology to ICP0 within the RING finger domain but limited similarity elsewhere. Using transfection assays, we have shown that all the ICP0 homologues that we tested have significant effects on the immunofluorescence staining character of at least one of the proteins destabilized by ICP0, and by using a recombinant virus, we found that the equine herpesvirus ICP0 homologue induced the proteasome-dependent degradation of endogenous CENP-C and modified forms of PML and Sp100. However, in contrast to ICP0, the homologue proteins had no effect on the distribution of the ubiquitin-specific protease USP7 within the cell, consistent with their lack of a USP7 binding domain. We also found that ICP0 by itself could induce the abrogation of SUMO-1 conjugation and then the proteasome-dependent degradation of unmodified exogenous PML in transfected cells, thus demonstrating that other HSV-1 proteins are not required. Surprisingly, the ICP0 homologues were unable to cause these effects. Overall, these data suggest that the members of the ICP0 family of proteins may act via a similar mechanism or pathway involving their RING finger domain but that their intrinsic activities and effects on endogenous and exogenous proteins differ in detail.","['Parkinson, J', 'Everett, R D']","['Parkinson J', 'Everett RD']","['MRC Virology Unit, Glasgow G11 5JR, Scotland, United Kingdom. j.parkinson@vir.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Alphaherpesvirinae/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Autoantigens/chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Epitopes', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Immunoblotting', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multienzyme Complexes/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7', 'Ubiquitins/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",PMC102039,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.21.10006-10017.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Nov;74(21):10006-17. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.21.10006-10017.2000.,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The interaction between these determinants has not been extensively examined. Previously, we proposed that dimerization of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus genomic RNAs relies upon the concentration-dependent interactions of a conserved palindrome that is initiated by separate G-rich stretches (H. Ly, D. P. Nierlich, J. C. Olsen, and A. H. Kaplan, J. Virol. 73:7255-7261, 1999). The cooperative action of these two elements was examined using a combination of genetic and antisense approaches. Dimerization of RNA molecules carrying both the palindrome and G-rich sequences was completely inhibited by an oligonucleotide complementary to the palindrome; molecules lacking the palindrome could not dimerize in the presence of oligomers that hybridize to two G-rich sequences. The results of spontaneous dimerization experiments also demonstrated that RNA molecules lacking either of the two stretches of guanines dimerized much more slowly than the full-length molecule which includes the dimer linkage structure (DLS). However, the addition of an oligonucleotide complementary to the remaining stretch of guanines restored the kinetics of dimerization to wild-type levels. The ability of this oligomer to rescue the kinetics of dimerization was dependent on the presence of the palindrome, suggesting that interactions within the G-rich regions produce changes in the palindrome that allow dimerization to proceed with maximum efficiency. Further, unsuccessful attempts to produce heterodimers between constructs lacking various combinations of these elements indicate that the G-rich regions and the palindrome do not interact directly. Finally, we demonstrate that both of these elements are important in maintaining efficient viral replication. Modified antisense oligonucleotides targeting the DLS were found to reduce the level of viral vector titer production. The reduction in viral titer is due to a decrease in the efficiency of viral genomic RNA encapsidation. Overall, our data support a dynamic model of retroviral RNA dimerization in which discrete dimerization elements act in a concerted fashion.","['Ly, H', 'Nierlich, D P', 'Olsen, J C', 'Kaplan, A H']","['Ly H', 'Nierlich DP', 'Olsen JC', 'Kaplan AH']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Capsid/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Antisense/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Genome, Viral', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Viral/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Virion/genetics', 'Virus Replication']",PMC102031,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.21.9937-9945.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Nov;74(21):9937-45. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.21.9937-9945.2000.,"['0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,,['K11 AI01107/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Tax is believed to be involved in leukemogenesis because of its second function, immortalization of primary cells in vitro. These activities of Tax can be dissociated on the basis of point mutations within specific regions of the protein. For example, mutation of the phosphorylation sites at serines 106 and 293 abrogates immortalization potential in vitro but maintains transcriptional activity. This type of mutant is thus particularly useful for unraveling the role of Tax immortalization activity during leukemogenesis independently of viral replication. In this report, we describe the biological properties of BLV recombinant proviruses mutated in the Tax phosphorylation sites (BLVTax106+293). Titration of the proviral loads by semiquantitative PCR revealed that the BLV mutants propagated at wild-type levels in vivo. Furthermore, two animals (sheep 480 and 296) infected with BLVTax106+293 developed leukemia or lymphosarcoma after 16 and 36 months, respectively. These periods of time are within the normal range of latencies preceding the onset of pathogenesis induced by wild-type viruses. The phenotype of the mutant-infected cells was characteristic of a B lymphocyte (immunoglobulin M positive) expressing CD11b and CD5 (except at the final stage for the latter marker), a pattern that is typical of wild-type virus-infected target cells. Interestingly, the transformed B lymphocytes from sheep 480 also coexpressed the CD8 marker, a phenotype rarely observed in tumor biopsies from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. Finally, direct sequencing of the tax gene demonstrated that the leukemic cells did not harbor revertant proviruses. We conclude that viruses expressing a Tax mutant unable to transform primary cells in culture are still pathogenic in the sheep animal model. Our data thus provide a clear example of the discordant conclusions that can be drawn from in vitro immortalization assays and in vivo experiments. These observations could be of interest for other systems, such as the related human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, which currently lack animal models allowing the study of the leukemogenic process.","['Twizere, J C', 'Kerkhofs, P', 'Burny, A', 'Portetelle, D', 'Kettmann, R', 'Willems, L']","['Twizere JC', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Burny A', 'Portetelle D', 'Kettmann R', 'Willems L']","['Department of Applied Biochemistry and Biology, Faculty of Agronomy, Gembloux, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/pathology/*virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*physiology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sheep', 'Sheep Diseases/pathology/virology', 'Viral Load', 'Virus Replication']",PMC102026,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.21.9895-9902.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Nov;74(21):9895-902. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.21.9895-9902.2000.,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Tf-beta-galactosidase plasmid conjugate thus constructed was specifically transfected to human erythroleukemia cells (K562) via Tf-R without the aid of any lysosomotropic agents. The transfection efficiency of the conjugate was superior to those of lipofection (1% staining) and retroviral vector (5%) and slightly lower than that of adenovirus (70%). The high level of expression with our conjugate was confirmed using other tumor cells (M7609, TMK-1) whereas in normal diploid cells (HEL), which express low levels of Tf-R, expression was negligible. When GFP gene conjugates were systemically administered through the tail vein to nude mice subcutaneously inoculated with tumor, expression of GFP mRNA was found almost exclusively in tumors and to a much lesser extent in muscles, whereas GFP revealed by fluorescence microscopy was detected only in the former. To exploit a therapeutic applicability of this method, suicide gene therapy using Tf-HSV-TK gene conjugate for massively metastasized k562 tumors in severe combined immune-deficient mice was conducted, and a marked prolongation of survival and significant reduction of tumor burden were confirmed.

Co-repressors are coregulators that are recruited by DNA-bound transcriptional silencers and play essential roles in many pathways including differentiation, proliferation, programmed cell death, and cell cycle. Accordingly, it has been shown that aberrant interactions of co-repressors with transcriptional silencers provide the molecular basis of a variety of human diseases. Co-repressors mediate transcriptional silencing by mechanisms that include direct inhibition of the basal transcription machinery and recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes. Chromatin modification includes histone deacetylation, which is thought to lead to a compact chromatin structure to which the accessibility of transcriptional activators is impaired. In a general mechanistic view, the overall picture suggests that transcriptional silencers and co-repressors act in analogy to transcriptional activators and coactivators, but with the opposite effect leading to gene silencing. We provide a comprehensive overview of the currently known higher eukaryotic co-repressors, their mechanism of action, and their involvement in biological and pathophysiological pathways. We also show the different pathways that lead to the regulation of co-repressor-silencer complex formation.","['Burke, L J', 'Baniahmad, A']","['Burke LJ', 'Baniahmad A']","['Genetic Institute, Justus Liebig University, Heinrich Buff Ring 58-62, D-35392 Giessen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,IM,"['Chromatin/metabolism', '*Gene Silencing', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Models, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1096/fj.99-0943rev [doi]', '14/13/1876 [pii]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2000 Oct;14(13):1876-88. doi: 10.1096/fj.99-0943rev.,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,165,,,,,,,,,

The pressure profile of a shock wave indicates its energy content, and shock-wave propagation in tissue is associated with cellular displacement, leading to the development of cell deformation. In the present study, three different shock-wave sources were investigated; argon fluoride excimer laser, ruby laser, and shock tube. The duration of the pressure pulse of the shock tube was 100 times longer than the lasers. The uptake of two fluorophores, calcein (molecular weight: 622) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (molecular weight: 71,600), into HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells was investigated. The intracellular fluorescence was measured by a spectrofluorometer, and the cells were examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy. A single shock wave generated by the shock tube delivered both fluorophores into approximately 50% of the cells (p < 0.01), whereas shock waves from the lasers did not. The cell survival fraction was >0.95. Confocal microscopy showed that, in the case of calcein, there was a uniform fluorescence throughout the cell, whereas, in the case of FITC-dextran, the fluorescence was sometimes in the nucleus and at other times not. We conclude that the impulse of the shock wave (i.e., the pressure integrated over time), rather than the peak pressure, was a dominant factor for causing fluorophore uptake into living cells, and that shock waves might have changed the permeability of the nuclear membrane and transferred molecules directly into the nucleus.","['Kodama, T', 'Hamblin, M R', 'Doukas, A G']","['Kodama T', 'Hamblin MR', 'Doukas AG']","['Wellman Laboratories of Photomedicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Department of Dermatology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA. kodama@helix.mgh.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,IM,"['Biophysical Phenomena', 'Biophysics', 'Cytoplasm/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Dextrans/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Fluoresceins/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Fluorescent Dyes/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lasers', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Permeability', 'Pressure']",PMC1301074,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-3495(00)76432-0 [pii]', '10.1016/S0006-3495(00)76432-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 2000 Oct;79(4):1821-32. doi: 10.1016/S0006-3495(00)76432-0.,"['0 (Dextrans)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)', 'V0YM2B16TS (fluorexon)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In these cells TNFalpha triggered phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent PC hydrolysis within 4-8 min with concomitant production of both diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphocholine (P-chol). DAG and P-chol production was accompanied by extracellular-signal-related protein kinase-1 ('ERK-1') activation and DNA-synthesis stimulation. PC-PLC stimulation was followed by PI3K-independent PLD activation with concomitant phosphatidic acid (PA) production followed by PA-derived DAG accumulation and sustained nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. PLD/NF-kappaB signalling activation played no role in the TNFalpha proliferative effect and conferred no consistent protection of KG1a cells towards antileukaemic agents. Altogether these results suggest that, in KG1a cells, TNFalpha can stimulate in parallel PC-PLC and PLD, whose lipid products activate in turn mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) and NF-kappaB signalling respectively. Finally, our study suggests that PC-PLC, but not PLD, plays a role in the TNFalpha proliferative effect in immature myeloid cells.","['Plo, I', 'Lautier, D', 'Levade, T', 'Sekouri, H', 'Jaffrezou, J P', 'Laurent, G', 'Bettaieb, A']","['Plo I', 'Lautier D', 'Levade T', 'Sekouri H', 'Jaffrezou JP', 'Laurent G', 'Bettaieb A']","['INSERM E9910, Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse 31052, France. plo@icr.fnclcc.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Diglycerides/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidic Acids/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phospholipase D/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylcholine/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Type C Phospholipases/*metabolism']",PMC1221382,2000/10/12 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/12 11:00'],"['2000/10/12 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/12 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biochem J. 2000 Oct 15;351 Pt 2:459-67.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phosphatidic Acids)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, when the blastocyst enters the uterine cavity, it starts the complex signals that will drive embryo adhesion.

These integrins may be activated by the interleukin-1 system (IL-1). IL-1beta, expressed by the blastocyst, induces vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which, in turn, promotes angiogenesis and integrin expression in endometrial cells. The IL-1 system also triggers the expression of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) from T lymphocytes. Decidual natural killer (NK) lymphocytes interact with invading trophoblast to generate leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LIF induces uPA and gelatinase, enzymes which play a crucial role in trophoblastic invasion. Progesterone is a potent inhibitor of LIF, while oestrogen is a potent inducer. Oestrogen in serum reflects follicular IL-1beta level and correlates with the outcome of embryo transfer after in vitro fertilization (IVF). Progesterone induces nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in the decidua, and NO promotes local vasodilatation and uterine quiescenceMeasurement of placental protein 14 (PP14, glycodelin-A) in serum may be of value as a screening test for implantation potential. However, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) remains the most reliable predictor of successful implantation and pregnancy viability. An ovulation + 14 hCG level < 50 IU/l is often predictive of a non-viable outcome, while an ovulation + 21 hCG of < 200 IU/l always indicates a non-viable pregnancy. hCG secretion by invading trophoblast appears to be negatively modulated by endothelin-1 (ET-1) and prostaglandin F(2alpha)(PGF2alpha), while tissue growth factors and collagenases are positive modulators of hCG expression.ProalphaC, an inhibin pro-monomer, may have some value in monitoring corpus luteum function. Inhibin A, activin A and follistatin all rises throughout pregnancy and peak at 36 weeks of gestation. Relaxin is another ovarian hormone that may have a role in predicting implantation. Relaxin induces placental protein 14 (PP14, glycodelin-A) expression in a receptive endometrium, and measurement of serum PP14 may be of value as a screening test for implantation potential.","['Sunder, S', 'Lenton, E A']","['Sunder S', 'Lenton EA']","['1089 W.

However, evidence for bone-marrow-specific receptors or adhesion molecules expressed on myeloma cells is scanty. Initial myeloma expansion is thought to be due to IL-6 and/or related cytokines. Previous determinations of cytokine expression in bone marrow were performed on bone marrow stromal lines; these findings may not reflect the constitutive pattern of expression in situ. Intracytoplasmic staining for IL-6-like cytokines revealed constitutive expression of some factors in the bone marrow of normal mice, but not spleens. Spleens of myeloma-transplanted SCID mice expressed IL-6-like cytokines, indicative of induction of expression by myeloma. Some cytokines expressed in bone marrow induced myeloma proliferation in the presence of dexamethasone, demonstrating dependence of the myeloma on these cytokines. Our data imply that, rather than ""homing"" to bone marrow, myeloma cells proliferated within marrow cavities more than in other organs because of growth factors constitutively expressed by bone marrow cells. As myeloma progressed, we observed the induction of growth factor expression in spleen cells. Furthermore, because cytokines other than IL-6 may induce myeloma cell proliferation, therapy aimed at neutralizing IL-6 may not be the most effective method to treat this disease. These findings have implications for both the pathophysiology and therapy of multiple myeloma.","['Barton, B E', 'Murphy, T F']","['Barton BE', 'Murphy TF']","['Department of Surgery, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-New Jersey Medical School, 185 S.

We generated gp130 transgenic mice (TG) and examined the activation of signalling pathways downstream of gp130 in the hearts. The tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 was enhanced, the phosphorylation of STAT3 and ERK (extracellular signal regulated kinase) 1/2 was increased and induction of the beta-myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene was observed in TG hearts without significant phenotypic changes. Intravenous administration of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and ERK 1/2 and expression of c-fos and beta-MHC mRNAs in wild-type littermates' (WT) hearts. However, enhancement of STAT3 and ERK 1/2 phosphorylation or augmented mRNA expressions was not observed in TG hearts after LIF stimulation. Next, STAT-induced STAT inhibitor (SSI) mRNA expression was examined. The expression of SSI-1, SSI-2, and SSI-3 mRNAs was significantly augmented in TG hearts after LIF stimulation.

In contrast, dominantly inherited beta-thalassemia is frequently associated with nonsense mutations in the last exon. In this work, murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells were stably transfected with human beta-globin genes mutated within each of the 3 exons, namely at codons 15 (TGG-->TGA), 39 (C-->T), or 127 (C-->T). Primer extension analysis after erythroid differentiation induction showed codon 127 (C-->T) mRNA accumulated in the cytoplasm at approximately 20% of the normal mRNA level. Codon 39 (C-->T) mutation did not result in significant mRNA accumulation. Unexpectedly, codon 15 (TGG-->TGA) mRNA accumulated at approximately 90%. Concordant results were obtained when reticulocyte mRNA from 2 carriers for this mutation was studied. High mRNA accumulation of codon 15 nonsense-mutated gene was revealed to be independent of the type of nonsense mutation and the genomic background in which this mutation occurs. To investigate the effects of other nonsense mutations located in the first exon on the mRNA level, nonsense mutations at codons 5, 17, and 26 were also cloned and stably transfected into MEL cells. After erythroid differentiation induction, mRNAs with a mutation at codon 5 or 17 were detected at high levels, whereas the mutation at codon 26 led to low mRNA levels. These findings suggest that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay is not exclusively dependent on the localization of mutations relative to the 3'-most intron. Other factors may also contribute to determine the cytoplasmic nonsense-mutated mRNA level in erythroid cells.

AML was significantly more resistant than ALL to the following drugs, as noted by the median resistance: glucocorticoids (greater than 85-fold), vincristine (4.4-fold), L-asparaginase (6.9-fold), anthracyclines (1.8- to 3.4-fold), mitoxantrone (2.6-fold), etoposide (4.9-fold), platinum analogues (2.4- to 3.4-fold), ifosfamide (3.5-fold), and thiotepa (3.9-fold). For cytarabine and thiopurines, the median LC50 values (the drug concentration that kills 5% of the cells) were equal. Also, busulfan, amsacrine, teniposide, and vindesine showed no significant differences, but the numbers were smaller, and the median LC50 values were 1.3- to 5.2-fold higher in AML. None of the drugs demonstrated greater cytotoxicity in AML. FAB M5 was significantly more sensitive than FAB M4 to most drugs frequently used in AML, as indicated by the following ratios of median sensitivities: the anthracyclines (2.6- to 3.2-fold), mitoxantrone (12.5-fold), etoposide (8.7-fold), and cytarabine (2.9-fold). For etoposide and cytarabine (5.4- and 3.4-fold, respectively) FAB M5 was also significantly more sensitive than FAB M1/M2. FAB M5 was equally sensitive to L-asparaginase and vincristine as ALL. Only 15% of the AML samples were ""intermediately"" sensitive to glucocorticoids, mainly in FAB M1/M2. The poorer prognosis of childhood AML is related to resistance to a large number of drugs. Within AML, FAB M5 had a distinct resistance pattern. These resistance profiles may be helpful in the rational design of further treatment protocols.

Recent reports have shown that ATRA induces the expression of several interferon-regulated genes, including signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)1. To investigate the role of Stat1 activation in ATRA signaling, sublines were established for the human monoblastic cell line U-937 constitutively expressing wild-type or phosphorylation-defective Stat1, mutated in the conserved tyrosine 701 required for dimerization and nuclear translocation. Results showed that ATRA induction leads to activation of Stat1 by the phosphorylation of tyrosine 701 and subsequent nuclear translocation. Consistent with a functional importance of this activation, ectopic expression of Stat1(Y701F) suppressed ATRA-induced morphologic differentiation and expression of the monocytic surface markers CD11c and the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor. Moreover, ATRA-induced growth arrest in the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle was inhibited by phosphorylation-deficient Stat1. Taken together, these results indicate that Stat1 is a key mediator of ATRA-induced cell cycle arrest and differentiation of U-937 cells.

Recently, point mutations in the Runt domain of the AML1 gene have also been reported in leukemia patients. Observations for mutations of the Runt domain of the AML1 gene in bone marrow cells were made in 300 patients, including 131 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 94 with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 28 with blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 3 with atypical CML, 41 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 3 with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Forty-one of the patients had chromosome 21 abnormalities, including t(8;21) in 6 of the patients with AML, t(12;21) in 8 patients with ALL, acquired trisomy 21 in 17 patients, tetrasomy 21 in 7 patients, and constitutional trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) in 3 patients. A point mutation was found in 14 cases (4.7%), including 9 (22%) of the 41 patients with AML of the Mo type (MoAML) (none of them had detectable chromosome 21 rearrangement) and 5 (38%) of the 13 myeloid malignancies with acquired trisomy 21 (1 M1AML, 2 M2AML, 1 ET, and 1 atypical CML). In at least 8 of 9 mutated cases of MoAML, both AML alleles were mutated: 3 patients had different stop codon mutations of the 2 AML1 alleles, and 5 patients had the same missense or stop codon mutation in both AML1 alleles, which resulted in at least 3 of the patients having duplication of the mutated allele and deletion of the normal residual allele, as shown by FISH analysis and by comparing microsatellite analyses of several chromosome 21 markers on diagnosis and remission samples. In the remaining mutated cases, with acquired trisomy 21, a missense mutation of AML1, which involved 2 of the 3 copies of the AML1 gene, was found. Four of the 7 mutated cases could be reanalyzed in complete remission, and no AML1 mutation was found, showing that mutations were acquired in the leukemic clone. In conclusion, these findings confirm the possibility of mutations of the Runt domain of the AML1 gene in leukemias, mainly in MoAML and in myeloid malignancies with acquired trisomy 21. AML1 mutations, in MoAML, involved both alleles and probably lead to nonfunctional AML1 protein. As AML1 protein regulates the expression of the myeloperoxidase gene, the relationship between AML1 mutations and Mo phenotype in AML will have to be further explored.

The viral transactivator protein Tax plays a critical role in HTLV-I-induced transformation and apoptosis resistance by inducing I kappa B-alpha degradation, resulting in the activation of the NF-kappa Bpathway. In these HTLV-I-transformed cells, arsenic trioxide (As) and interferon (IFN)-alpha synergize to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We demonstrate that cell death induction is only partly dependent upon caspase activation and is not associated with modulation of bcl-2, bax, or p53 expression. However, combined As and IFN induce the degradation of Tax, associated with an up-regulation of I kappa B-alpha resulting in a sharp decrease in RelA DNA binding nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B complexes because of the cytoplasmic retention of RelA. Taken the role of Tax in HTLV-I-induced transformation, its down-regulation probably accounts for cell death induction through inactivation of the NF-kappa B pathway. Such specific targeting of the viral oncoprotein by As-IFN treatment, reminiscent of As targeting of promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor-alpha in acute promyelocytic leukemia, provides strong rational for combined As-IFN therapy in ATL patients.

Using a shear-based adhesion assay, a hematopoietic cell L-selectin ligand (HCLL) that is expressed on the hematopoietic cell line KG1a and on normal human hematopoietic progenitors was previously identified. To characterize the structural biology of HCLL and to define its relationship to PSGL-1, the effects of chemical and enzymatic treatments on HCLL activity of KG1a cells and membrane preparations were analyzed. Protease digestions and chemical treatments of KG1a cells and membranes indicated that HCLL is an integral membrane glycoprotein. Glycosidase digestions of membrane protein preparations and metabolic treatments of KG1a cells with glycosylation processing modifiers revealed that L-selectin binding determinants on HCLL are sialofucosylated structures presented on complex-type N-glycans. Adhesion assays and biochemical studies showed that this glycoprotein is also expressed on circulating blasts in native acute leukemias. HCLL is distinguishable from PSGL-1: (1) KG1a cells sorted for PSGL-1 expression had equivalent HCLL activity; (2) anti-PSGL-1 blocking antibodies and proteases known to eliminate L-selectin binding to PSGL-1 had no effect on HCLL binding activity of KG1a cells; (3) blasts from native leukemias with low expression of PSGL-1 and CD34 display high HCLL activity; and (4) despite high level expression of PSGL-1, HCLL activity was absent on HL60 cells. These data provide first evidence of a naturally expressed membrane L-selectin ligand expressing binding determinant(s) on an N-linked glycoconjugate. This novel ligand may help mediate L-selectin-dependent cell-cell adhesive interactions within the cytoarchitecture of the bone marrow microenvironment.

The mechanisms leading to cell cycle withdrawal were assessed in stable transfectants of murine erythroleukemia cells, in which the activities of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and CDK inhibitors (CDKIs) could be tightly regulated during differentiation. Cell cycle withdrawal of differentiating cells is mediated by induction of several CDKIs, thereby leading to inhibition of CDK2 and CDK4. Manipulation of CDK activity in differentiating cells demonstrates that the onset of cell cycle withdrawal can be either greatly accelerated or greatly delayed without affecting hemoglobin levels. Extending the proliferation of differentiating cells requires the synergistic action of CDK2 and CDK4. Importantly, CDK6 cannot substitute for CDK4 in this role, which demonstrates that the 2 cyclin D-dependent kinases are functionally different. The results show that differentiating hemoglobinized cells can be made to proliferate far beyond their normal capacity to divide.

The function of these proteins in the irreversible growth arrest associated with terminally differentiated cells is largely unknown. The function of Cip/Kip proteins p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1) during erythropoietin-induced terminal differentiation of primary erythroblasts isolated from the spleens of mice infected with the anemia-inducing strain of Friend virus was investigated. Both p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1) proteins were induced during erythroid differentiation, but only p27(Kip1) associated with the principal G(1) CDKs-cdk4, cdk6, and cdk2. The kinetics of binding of p27(Kip1) to CDK complexes was distinct in that p27(Kip1) associated primarily with cdk4 (and, to a lesser extent, cdk6) early in differentiation, followed by subsequent association with cdk2. Binding of p27(Kip1) to cdk4 had no apparent inhibitory effect on cdk4 kinase activity, whereas inhibition of cdk2 kinase activity was associated with p27(Kip1) binding, accumulation of hypo-phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein, and G(1) growth arrest. Inhibition of cdk4 kinase activity late in differentiation resulted from events other than p27(Kip1) binding or loss of cyclin D from the complex. The data demonstrate that p27(Kip1) differentially regulates the activity of cdk4 and cdk2 during terminal erythroid differentiation and suggests a switching mechanism whereby cdk4 functions to sequester p27(Kip1) until a specified time in differentiation when cdk2 kinase activity is targeted by p27(Kip1) to elicit G(1) growth arrest. Further, the data imply that p21(Cip1) may have a function independent of growth arrest during erythroid differentiation.

The transplant donor was an HLA-identical sibling (n = 35) or a ""matched"" unrelated volunteer (n = 31). Fifty-seven patients were transplanted in chronic phase, eight in accelerated phase, and one in second chronic phase. The recognition of relapse was based on precise molecular, cytogenetic, or hematologic criteria. The median interval from transplant to relapse was 12 months (range 3-85). The median interval from relapse to initiation of DLI was 9.4 months (range 1-70). Patients received DLI from their original transplant donors on a bulk-dose (n = 34) or on an escalating-dose (n = 32) regimen. Patients were monitored serially by hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular criteria. Molecular remission was defined by the finding of negative results by nested primer reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for BCR-ABL transcripts on two consecutive occasions, subject to satisfactory controls. Forty-four patients (67%) achieved molecular remission. Patients who had relapsed to advanced phase disease and patients with short intervals between transplant and relapse had significantly lower probabilities of achieving molecular remission. Of the 44 patients who achieved molecular remission, 4 reverted to a PCR-positive status at 15, 18, 37, and 87 weeks after remission. The probability of survival for patients who achieved molecular remission was significantly better than for those who failed to do so (95% versus 53% at 3 years post-DLI, P = .0001). We conclude that the majority of molecular remissions after DLI are durable, and thus the majority of responding patients may prove to have been cured.

Bone marrow aspirates (n = 629) were collected at the end of remission induction therapy and at 3 intervals thereafter. Detectable MRD (ie, > or = 0.01% leukemic mononuclear cells) at each time point was associated with a higher relapse rate (P < .001); patients with high levels of MRD at the end of the induction phase (> or = 1%) or at week 14 of continuation therapy (> or = 0.1%) had a particularly poor outcome. The predictive strength of MRD remained significant even after adjusting for adverse presenting features, excluding patients at very high or very low risk of relapse from the analysis, and considering levels of peripheral blood lymphoblasts at day 7 and day 10 of induction therapy. The incidence of relapse among patients with MRD at the end of the induction phase was 68% +/- 16% (SE) if they remained with MRD through week 14 of continuation therapy, compared with 7% +/- 7% if MRD became undetectable (P = .035). The persistence of MRD until week 32 was highly predictive of relapse (all 4 MRD(+) patients relapsed vs 2 of the 8 who converted to undetectable MRD status; P = .021). Sequential monitoring of MRD by the method described here provides highly significant, independent prognostic information in children with ALL. Recent improvements in this flow cytometric assay have made it applicable to more than 90% of all new patients.

These cells also express stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), a CXC chemokine that ordinarily is secreted by marrow stromal cells. Leukemia B cells attach to these blood-derived adherent cells, down-modulate their receptors for SDF-1 (CXCR4), and are protected from undergoing spontaneous apoptosis in vitro. Neutralizing antibodies to SDF-1 inhibit this effect. Moreover, the rapid deterioration in the survival of CLL B cells, when separated from such cells, is mitigated by exogenous SDF-1. This chemokine also results in the rapid down-modulation of CXCR4 and activation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein-kinase (ERK 1/2) by CLL B cells in vitro. It is concluded that the blood of patients with CLL contains cells that can differentiate into adherent nurse-like cells that protect leukemia cells from undergoing spontaneous apoptosis through an SDF-1-dependent mechanism. In addition to its recently recognized role in CLL B-cell migration, SDF-1-mediated CLL B-cell activation has to be considered a new mechanism involved in the microenvironmental regulation of CLL B-cell survival.

We compared gene transfer efficacy and transgene expression kinetics after transduction of hepatocarcinoma cell lines using enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing murine leukemia virus-derived retroviral vectors and HIV-derived lentiviral vectors. First, we showed that both retroviral and lentiviral vectors efficiently transduce cycling hepatocarcinoma cell lines in vitro. However, after cell cycle arrest, transduction efficacy remained the same for lentiviral vectors but it decreased by 80% for retroviral vectors. Second, we studied EGFP expression kinetics using lentiviral vectors expressing EGFP under the control of cytomegalovirus (CMV) or phosphoglycerolkinase (PGK) promoter. We show that the CMV promoter allows a stronger EGFP expression than the PGK promoter. However, in contrast to PGK-driven EGFP expression, which persists up to 2 months after transduction, CMV-driven EGFP expression rapidly decreased with time. This phenomenon is due to promoter silencing, and EGFP expression can be restored in transduced cells by using transcription activators such as interleukin-6 or phorbol myristate acetate/ionomycin and, to a lesser extent, the demethylating agent 5'-azacytidine. Altogether, our results suggest that lentiviral vectors, which allow efficient transduction of hepatocarcinoma cell lines with a strong and a sustained expression according to the promoter used, are promising tools for gene therapy of hepatocarcinomas.","['Gerolami, R', 'Uch, R', 'Jordier, F', 'Chapel, S', 'Bagnis, C', 'Brechot, C', 'Mannoni, P']","['Gerolami R', 'Uch R', 'Jordier F', 'Chapel S', 'Bagnis C', 'Brechot C', 'Mannoni P']","['Centre de Therapie Genique, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseilles, France. rgerolami@ap-hm.fr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,IM,"['Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HIV/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods', 'Transgenes/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2000/10/07 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/07 11:00'],"['2000/10/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/07 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cgt.7700225 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2000 Sep;7(9):1286-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.cgt.7700225.,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Because oxidative stress plays an important role in the process of apoptosis, we studied the effect of alpha-tocopheryl succinate (VES) on the fate of cultured human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60). The presence of fairly low concentrations of VES inhibited the growth and DNA synthesis of HL-60 cells, and also induced their apoptosis via a mechanism that was inhibited by z-VAD-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk), an inhibitor of pan-caspases. VES activated various types of caspases, including caspase-3, 6, 8, and 9, but not caspase-1. VES triggered the reaction leading to the cleavage of Bid, a member of the death agonist Bcl-2 family, and released cytochrome c (Cyt.c) from the mitochondria into the cytosol by a z-VAD-fmk-inhibitable mechanism. VES transiently increased the intracellular calcium level [Ca2+]i and stimulated the release of Cyt.c in the presence of inorganic phosphate (Pi). However, high concentrations of VES (approximately 100 microM) hardly induced swelling of isolated mitochondria but depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential by a cyclosporin A (CsA)-insensitive mechanism. These results indicate that VES-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells might be caused by activation of the caspase cascade coupled with modulation of mitochondrial membrane function.","['Yamamoto, S', 'Tamai, H', 'Ishisaka, R', 'Kanno, T', 'Arita, K', 'Kobuchi, H', 'Utsumi, K']","['Yamamoto S', 'Tamai H', 'Ishisaka R', 'Kanno T', 'Arita K', 'Kobuchi H', 'Utsumi K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Osaka Medical College, Takatsuki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Free Radic Res,Free radical research,9423872,IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tocopherols', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin E/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",,2000/10/07 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/07 11:00'],"['2000/10/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/07 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10715760000300941 [doi]'],ppublish,Free Radic Res. 2000 Oct;33(4):407-18. doi: 10.1080/10715760000300941.,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'R0ZB2556P8 (Tocopherols)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In our continuing studies on the role of membranes and lipid peroxidation in the induction of apoptosis, we investigated the effect of HNE on cultured human malignant immune system cells. Two cell lines were utilized; MOLT-4, a human T-cell leukemia cell line, and Reh, a human B-cell lymphoma cell line. A 10 min treatment with 0.01 mM HNE resulted in the apoptotic death, as determined by flow cytometric and morphological analyses, of both cell lines within 24 h. MOLT-4 cells exhibited the manifestations of impending apoptotic death much sooner than did Reh cells, indicating that MOLT-4 cells were more sensitive or not as efficient at detoxifying HNE than were Reh cells.

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Hospital wards in a provincial tertiary institution in the Western Cape (Department of Haematology, Groote Schuur Hospital). SUBJECTS: Twenty-eight hospitalised children with haematological malignancies (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) N = 4, acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) N = 13), or bone marrow failure syndromes (N = 11), who consecutively received autologous or allogeneic marrow grafts from HLA-identical siblings. OUTCOME MEASURES: Children (younger than 18 years) received allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplants. In the former group, two forms of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis were used. Conditioning with radiation-containing regimens was followed by stem cell product infusion after T-cell depletion (CAMPATH 1, ex vivo immunoglobulin G (IgG); rat anti CD52). Children with malignancies who received unfractionated grafts were myeloablated, mainly with busulfan 16 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg. Those affected by marrow failure were prepared with cyclophosphamide and antilymphocyte globulin. Median age at time of transplantation was 116 months (range 18-212 months). The main cause of death was disease recurrence (N = 5) and GVHD (N = 3). Twenty-one children survived, 11 of 16 in complete remission (CR) from malignancy. Nine of the eleven patients presenting with marrow failure and 1 patient with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) remained disease free at a median follow-up of 934 days (range 70-2,330 days). Significantly longer disease-free (P = 0.03) and overall survival (P = 0.05, Cox Mantel test) was experienced by those who received T-cell-depleted stem cell grafts. CONCLUSIONS: The strategy of T-cell depletion of bone marrow/blood stem cells from HLA-matched siblings for transplantation into children with blood disorders has been successful and cost effective. These favourable results are the consequence of rational co-operation between adult and paediatric transplant physicians.","['Roux, P', 'Novitzky, N']","['Roux P', 'Novitzky N']","['University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre, Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",South Africa,S Afr Med J,South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,0404520,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia, Aplastic/mortality/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fanconi Anemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'South Africa/epidemiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2000/10/07 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/07 11:00'],"['2000/10/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/07 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,S Afr Med J. 2000 Aug;90(8):804-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pharmacologic dosage of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) directly modulates PML-RAR alpha and its interaction with the nuclear receptor co-repressor complex, which restores the wild-type RAR alpha/RXR regulatory pathway and induces the transcriptional expression of downstream genes. Analysing gene expression profiles in APL cells before and after ATRA treatment represents a useful approach to identify genes whose functions are involved in this new cancer treatment.

Histological analysis revealed dramatic alterations in the synovium but not in synovium of knees treated with the control virus Ad-dl70 or knees treated with Adm-IL-6 encoding biologically active murine IL-6. AdmuOSM effects were characterized by increases in the synovial cell proliferation, infiltration of mononuclear cells, and increases in extracellular matrix deposition that were evident at day 4, but much more marked at days 7, 14, and 21 after administration. The synovium took on characteristics similar to pannus and appeared to contact and invade cartilage. Collectively, these results provide good evidence that OSM regulates synovial fibroblast function differently than other IL-6-type cytokines, and can induce a proliferative invasive phenotype of synovium in vivo in mice on overexpression. We suggest that OSM may contribute to pathology in arthritis.","['Langdon, C', 'Kerr, C', 'Hassen, M', 'Hara, T', 'Arsenault, A L', 'Richards, C D']","['Langdon C', 'Kerr C', 'Hassen M', 'Hara T', 'Arsenault AL', 'Richards CD']","['Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

Moreover, two different proliferation center growth patterns have been described with respect to reactive germinal centers. In this study, we evaluate the histological and immunophenotypic features of 13 cases of I-SLL and immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (VH) gene sequences from 10 cases. Immunophenotypic analyses indicate that cases showing either growth pattern have the same CD5-positive B cell phenotype typical of SLL or CLL. Sequence analysis revealed the use of VH, D, and J gene segments often found in CLL, although there may be more frequent use of J6. Similar to recent studies of CLL, there were approximately equal numbers of cases with either mutated or unmutated VH genes without evidence of ongoing mutation, consistent with I-SLL having either a naive or memory B cell origin. Interestingly, the mutational status of the I-SLL VH genes seemed to correlate with the two different histological growth patterns. These studies support the proposal that I-SLL represents SLL/CLL and suggest the recently proposed two types of CLL originating from either memory or naive B cells may have different histological patterns of growth in lymph nodes that show architectural preservation.","['Bahler, D W', 'Aguilera, N S', 'Chen, C C', 'Abbondanzo, S L', 'Swerdlow, S H']","['Bahler DW', 'Aguilera NS', 'Chen CC', 'Abbondanzo SL', 'Swerdlow SH']","['Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. bahlerdw@aruplab.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence/genetics', 'Base Sequence/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/*immunology/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data']",PMC1850170,2000/10/06 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/06 11:00'],"['2000/10/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/06 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)64620-2 [pii]', '10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64620-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2000 Oct;157(4):1063-70. doi: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64620-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the molecular mechanisms that regulate apoptosis has indicated that anticancer agents simultaneously activate several pathways that either positively or negatively regulate the death process. The main pathway from specific damage induced by the drug to apoptosis involves activation of caspases in the cytosol by pro-apoptotic molecules such as cytochrome c released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. At least in some cell types, anticancer drugs also upregulate the expression of death receptors and sensitize tumor cells to their cognate ligands. The Fas-mediated pathway could contribute to the early steps of drug-induced apoptosis while sensitization to the cytokine TRAIL could be used to amplify the response to cytotoxic drugs. The Bcl-2 family of proteins, that includes anti- and pro-apoptotic molecules, regulates cell sensitivity mainly at the mitochondrial level. Anticancer drugs modulate their expression (eg through p53-dependent gene transcription), their activity (eg by phosphorylating Bcl-2) and their subcellular localization (eg by inducing the translocation of specific BH3-only pro-apoptotic proteins). Very early after interacting with tumor cells, anticancer drugs also activate lipid-dependent signaling pathways that either increase or decrease cell ability to die by apoptosis. In addition, cytotoxic agents can activate protective pathways that involve activation of NFkappaB transcription factor, accumulation of heat shock proteins such as Hsp27 and activation of proteins involved in cell cycle regulation. This review discusses how modulation of the balance between noxious and protective signals that regulate drug-induced apoptosis could be used to improve the efficacy of current therapeutic regimens in hematological malignancies.","['Solary, E', 'Droin, N', 'Bettaieb, A', 'Corcos, L', 'Dimanche-Boitrel, M T', 'Garrido, C']","['Solary E', 'Droin N', 'Bettaieb A', 'Corcos L', 'Dimanche-Boitrel MT', 'Garrido C']","['INSERM Unite 517, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Humans']",,2000/10/06 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/06 11:00'],"['2000/10/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/06 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401902 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Oct;14(10):1833-49. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401902.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,222,,,,,,,,,

To address this issue we phenotyped 35 selected hematopoietic cell lines for the expression of CD4, CXCR4 and CCR5. We next evaluated the functionality of these chemokine receptors by calcium flux and chemotaxis assays, and by the ability of SDF-1, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta and RANTES to influence the growth of the cells expressing CXCR4 and/or CCR5. Lastly, we examined whether human hematopoietic cell lines may secrete some HIV-related chemokines, and whether endogenously secreted chemokines might interfere with the infectability. of hematopoietic cells by X4 and R5 HIV strains. These results demonstrate that: (1) HIV-related receptors are widely expressed on human hematopoietic cell lines; (2) stimulation of CXCR4 by SDF-1 induces calcium flux and chemotaxis in several hematopoietic cell lines more efficiently than stimulation of CCR5 by receptor-specific beta-chemokines; (3) chemokines do not regulate proliferation of the hematopoietic cells; and finally (4) infectability of the hematopoietic cells by HIV-1 may be auto-modulated by endogenously secreted chemokines.

Case matching was performed using the following criteria: age and beta2-microglobulin at diagnosis and disease status at the time of transplantation. Both cohorts were homogeneous in term of induction treatment and conditioning regimen. Patients were collected for CD34+ selection after priming with G-CSF alone.

Notably absent are the recurrent chromosome translocations which distinguish other hematopoietic neoplasms and serve as clues to underlying oncogene alterations. The paucity of neoplastic cells in HD biopsies hinders detailed chromosome analysis. As an alternative, we investigated a panel of well characterized cell lines by classical and molecular cytogenetics, using single-gene and subtelomeric probes, including three autologous HD examples (HDLM-1/2/3) analyzed by 'spectral karyotyping' - the first complete HD karyotype to be documented. Although complex, most rearrangements in HDLM cells arose in vivo and included few rare but many typical HD breakpoints, notably at the r(ibosomal)DNA regions. Two types of genomic rearrangement involving DNA repeats were conspicuous: insertion and genomic amplification/coamplification of rDNA-the first genomic rDNA rearrangements to be reported in a tumor cell, and the first example of multiple 'jumping translocations' (JT). Of four subtelomeric microsatellite repeats tested in HDLM cells, three exhibited interstitial sites at JT, of which two (at 5qter and 9pter) were respectively associated with deletion of the 5q31-32 myeloid region, and coamplification of a recently described HD-recurrent amplicon at 9p2 together with transcriptionally silent rDNA. Altogether, three out of four HD cell lines carried interstitial 9p subtelomeres and rDNA rearrangements. Taken together, these data suggest tumorigenic rearrangements may be facilitated by 'hitchhiking' along with mobile DNA repeat sequences which may target gene rearrangement at 9p in HD. Southern analysis of parallel rearrangements within rDNA intergenic spacers in HDLM cells highlighted several at, or near, retroposons. As well as validating HD cell lines as cytogenetic models, and resources for identifying genes rearranged in HD, our findings warrant further investigation of the roles of DNA repeat sequences, notably subtelomeric microsatellites, rDNA spacer sequences and retroposons as facilitators and markers of tumor-gene rearrangement.","['MacLeod, R A', 'Spitzer, D', 'Bar-Am, I', 'Sylvester, J E', 'Kaufmann, M', 'Wernich, A', 'Drexler, H G']","['MacLeod RA', 'Spitzer D', 'Bar-Am I', 'Sylvester JE', 'Kaufmann M', 'Wernich A', 'Drexler HG']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Ribosomal/*genetics', '*Gene Amplification', 'Hodgkin Disease/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', '*Telomere', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/10/06 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/06 11:00'],"['2000/10/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/06 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401894 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Oct;14(10):1803-14. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401894.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Ribosomal)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Daily fractionation of the oral schedule of etoposide led to a more than six-fold increase in cumulative MPE frequency over that observed with the same total, unfractionated dose, with the potency of the response increasing with serial exposure (r = 0.79).

When stimulated in agar cultures by GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF, IL-3, SCF, IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), IL-5 or IFNgamma, GB2 cells generated blast colonies or colonies of maturing granulocytes and macrophages. There was a striking similarity in colony types, relative colony numbers and maturation of colony cells to those formed by normal bone marrow cells in response to the same stimuli. GB2 blast colony-forming cells exhibited self-renewal as well as an ability to form granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming progeny, with evidence that a hierarchical sequence of clonogenic cells is generated in the cell line even after subcloning. Factor-specific maturation was clearly initiated by the action of the added growth factors.

LSCs have been documented for nearly all AML subtypes and have been phenotypically described as CD34+/CD38- or CD34+/HLA-DR-. Given the potentially critical role of these primitive cells in perpetuating leukemic disease, we sought to further investigate their molecular and cellular characteristics. Flow cytometric studies using primary AML tissue showed that the interleukin-3 receptor alpha chain (IL-3Ralpha or CD123) was strongly expressed in CD34+/CD38- cells (98 +/- 2% positive) from 16 of 18 primary specimens. Conversely, normal bone marrow derived CD34+/CD38- cells showed virtually no detectable expression of the CD123 antigen. To assess the functional role of IL-3Ralpha positive cells, purified CD34+/CD123+ leukemia cells were transplanted into immune deficient NOD/SCID mice. These experiments showed that CD123+ cells were competent to establish and maintain leukemic populations in vivo. To begin to elucidate a biological role for CD123 in leukemia, primary AML samples were analyzed with respect to signal transduction activity in the MAPK, Akt, and Stat5 pathways. Phosphorylation was not detected in response to IL-3 stimulation, thereby suggesting CD123 is not active in conventional IL-3-mediated signaling. Collectively, these data indicate that CD123 represents a unique marker for primitive leukemic stem cells. Given the strong expression of this receptor on LSCs, we propose that targeting of CD123 may be a promising strategy for the preferential ablation of AML cells.","['Jordan, C T', 'Upchurch, D', 'Szilvassy, S J', 'Guzman, M L', 'Howard, D S', 'Pettigrew, A L', 'Meyerrose, T', 'Rossi, R', 'Grimes, B', 'Rizzieri, D A', 'Luger, S M', 'Phillips, G L']","['Jordan CT', 'Upchurch D', 'Szilvassy SJ', 'Guzman ML', 'Howard DS', 'Pettigrew AL', 'Meyerrose T', 'Rossi R', 'Grimes B', 'Rizzieri DA', 'Luger SM', 'Phillips GL']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington 40536-0093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Stem Cells/immunology/*metabolism']",,2000/10/06 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/06 11:00'],"['2000/10/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/06 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401903 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Oct;14(10):1777-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401903.,"['0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In 20% of patients with AML the receptor has small internal tandem duplications of the juxtamembrane region which appear to contitutively activate the receptor. To investigate whether FLT3 activation could play a role in leukemia, we generated a constitutively activated FLT3 by fusing its cytoplasmic domain to the helix-loop-helix domain of TEL in analogy to the fusion that occurs with TEL-PDGFR in CMML. In vitro translation assays demonstrated oligomerization and intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the TEL-FLT3 chimeric receptor. Constitutively activated TEL-FLT3 conferred IL-3 independence and long-term proliferation to transfected Ba/F3 cells. Immunoblot analyses showed that JAK 2, STAT 3, STAT 5a, STAT 5b and CBL were tyrosine-phosphorylated in TEL-FLT3 expressing Ba/F3 cells in the absence of IL-3. These data suggest a possible role for the JAK/STAT pathway in FLT3 signaling. Transplantation of TEL-FLT3 expressing Ba/F3 cells into syngeneic mice caused mortality in all mice by 3 weeks after injection. Histopathologic analysis demonstrated a massive infiltration of mononuclear cells in the liver, spleen and bone marrow.

The clinical features of t(3;5)-positive myeloid disorders suggest that this chimeric protein is involved in dysregulation of progenitor cells with the capability to differentiate into multiple lineages. So far, involvement of wild-type MLF1 in hematopoiesis or in leukemogenesis has not been fully investigated. In the present study, 65 patients with AML and 44 patients with MDS were tested for the expression of MLF1 using the quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. A significantly higher level of MLF1 expression (ratio of MLF1/beta-actin mRNA >0.4) was readily detected in seven of 65 patients with de novo AML, three of 12 with post-MDS AML and seven of 44 with MDS, but not in any patients with ALL (n = 18). According to the FAB classification, high levels of MLF1 were found in patients with relatively immature subtypes of AML (M1, M2, M6 and M7) and high risk MDS (RAEB and RAEB-T). These findings indicate that the pattern of MLF1 expression is identical to the clinical morphology appearing in the t(3;5)-positive myeloid disorders and is correlated to the MDS-associated AML and transformation phase of MDS in t(3;5)-negative myeloid disorders. A CD34+ population of normal bone marrow cells preferentially expressed MLF1 with obviously decreasing levels of expression during maturation. Therefore, MLF1 normally functions in multi-potent progenitor cells and its dysregulation may take part in leukemogenesis from MDS.","['Matsumoto, N', 'Yoneda-Kato, N', 'Iguchi, T', 'Kishimoto, Y', 'Kyo, T', 'Sawada, H', 'Tatsumi, E', 'Fukuhara, S']","['Matsumoto N', 'Yoneda-Kato N', 'Iguchi T', 'Kishimoto Y', 'Kyo T', 'Sawada H', 'Tatsumi E', 'Fukuhara S']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Kansai Medical University, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2000/10/06 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/06 11:00'],"['2000/10/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/06 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401897 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Oct;14(10):1757-65. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401897.,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MLF1 protein, human)', '0 (Mlf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinically achievable concentrations of As2O3 induce apoptosis in NB4, an APL cell line, in vitro. Here, to study the mechanism of As2O3-induced apoptosis, we established an As2O3-resistant subline, NB4/As. Growth of NB4/As was inhibited by 50% after 2 day-treatment (IC50) at 1.6 microM As2O3, whereas IC50 of NB4 was 0.3 microM. Degradation of PML-RARalpha and change of the PML-subcellular localization were similarly induced by As2O3 in NB4 and NB4/As, suggesting that their contribution to apoptosis is small. Treatment with 1 microM As2O3 induced the activation of caspase 3 as well as a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (deltapsim) in NB4 but not in NB4/As. Caspase 8 and Bid were also activated by As2O3 in NB4 but not in NB4/As. In NB4, an inhibitor of caspase 8 blocked not only the activation of caspase 3 but also the loss of deltapsim. Neither cell line expressed CD95/Fas, and agonistic anti-Fas antibody (CH-11) failed to cause apoptosis. Neither antagonistic anti-CD95/Fas antibody nor anti-Fas ligand antibodies influenced the As2O3-induced apoptosis. NB4/As had a higher concentration of intracellular glutathione (GSH) than NB4 (96 vs 32 nmol/mg). Reduction of the GSH level by buthionine sulfoxide (BSO) completely restored the sensitivity to As2O3 in NB4/As. Furthermore, caspase activation and the loss of deltapsim were recovered by combination treatment with BSO. These findings suggest that the As2O3 treatment activates caspase 8 in a CD95-independent but GSH concentration-dependent manner. In combination with BSO, As2O3 might be applied to therapy of leukemia/cancers which are insensitive to the clinically achievable concentrations of As2O3.","['Kitamura, K', 'Minami, Y', 'Yamamoto, K', 'Akao, Y', 'Kiyoi, H', 'Saito, H', 'Naoe, T']","['Kitamura K', 'Minami Y', 'Yamamoto K', 'Akao Y', 'Kiyoi H', 'Saito H', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/immunology']",,2000/10/06 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/06 11:00'],"['2000/10/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/06 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401900 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Oct;14(10):1743-50. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401900.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

For the aggressive lymphomas, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival for cases with disruption of either p16INK4a or the ARF-p53 pathway was not different from cases with retention of both pathways (5 year survival 45% vs 35%; P= 0.85), suggesting that selective inactivation of one of the pathways does not significantly influence overall survival. By contrast, the 5-year survival was only 7% for cases with concurrent disruption of p16INK4a and the ARF-p53 pathway vs 38% for cases with retention of one or both pathways (P = 0.005). Similar results were obtained when the analysis was confined to diffuse large B cell lymphomas (P= 0.019). On stepwise multivariate regression analysis including factors from the international prognostic index, concurrent disruption of p16INK4a and the ARF-p53 pathway was an independent negative prognostic factor in NHL with aggressive histology (P = 0.006). Our results suggest that the compound status of the p16INK4a and ARF-p53 pathways is a major determinant of outcome in NHL.","['Gronbaek, K', 'de Nully Brown, P', 'Moller, M B', 'Nedergaard, T', 'Ralfkiaer, E', 'Moller, P', 'Zeuthen, J', 'Guldberg, P']","['Gronbaek K', 'de Nully Brown P', 'Moller MB', 'Nedergaard T', 'Ralfkiaer E', 'Moller P', 'Zeuthen J', 'Guldberg P']","['Department of Tumor Cell Biology, Institute of Cancer Biology, Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['ADP-Ribosylation Factors/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Gene Deletion', '*Genes, p16', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Survival Analysis']",,2000/10/06 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/06 11:00'],"['2000/10/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/06 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401901 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Oct;14(10):1727-35. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401901.,['EC 3.6.5.2 (ADP-Ribosylation Factors)'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Detailed analysis of VH genes has revealed the clonal relationship between switch variants expressed by the bone marrow plasma cell and myeloma progenitors in the marrow and peripheral blood. Regarding VH usage, a bias was found against the V4-34 gene encoding antibodies with cold agglutinin specificity (anti-I/i), thus explaining in part the absence of autoimmune phenomena in myeloma compared to other B cell lymphoproliferative disorders. However, in some studies a substantial number of cases analyzed were carrying the rearranged Humkappav325 Vkapppa gene, known to be over utilized by B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia clones and possessing autoantibody binding activity. VH genes accumulate somatic hypermutations following a distribution compatible with antigen selection, but with no intraclonal heterogeneity. The analysis of Vkappa genes indicates a bias in usage of Vkappa family members; somatic hypermutation, in line with antigen selection, of the expressed Vkappa genes is higher than any other B cell lymphoid disorder. Similar conclusions were reached for Vlambda genes; in this case, the analysis raises the controversial issue of N nucleotide insertion at Vlambda-Jlambda junctions, apparently as a result of TdT activity. A complementary imprint of antigen selection as evidenced by somatic hypermutation of either the VH or VL clonogenic genes has been observed. The absence of ongoing somatic mutations in either VH or VL genes gives rise to the notion that the cell of origin in myeloma is a post-germinal center memory B cell.","['Kosmas, C', 'Stamatopoulos, K', 'Stavroyianni, N', 'Zoi, K', 'Belessi, C', 'Viniou, N', 'Kollia, P', 'Yataganas, X']","['Kosmas C', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Stavroyianni N', 'Zoi K', 'Belessi C', 'Viniou N', 'Kollia P', 'Yataganas X']","['First Department of Medicine, Athens University School of Medicine, Laikon General Hospital, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/immunology/therapeutic use', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology/pathology']",,2000/10/06 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/06 11:00'],"['2000/10/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/06 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401908 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Oct;14(10):1718-26. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401908.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)']",,,93,,,,,,,,,

Our laboratory has previously isolated from human cells a DNA replication complex, termed the DNA synthesome, which is fully competent to orchestrate, in vitro, all of the reactions required to efficiently and faithfully replicate DNA. Using this system and the active metabolite of ara-C, ara-CTP, we demonstrated that the human DNA synthesome can efficiently incorporate ara-CTP into internucleotide positions of newly replicated DNA in vitro mimicking results obtained using intact cells and isolated nuclei. We then hypothesized that DNA polymerase auxiliary proteins, present within the DNA synthesome, may aid in incorporating this nucleotide analog into DNA. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we utilized three distinct multiprotein complexes each of which contained human DNA polymerase alpha and examined with standard in vitro polymerase assays the effectiveness of ara-C in inhibiting various aspects of their polymerase function. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: These polymerase-mediated elongation assays, which included ara-CTP- or ara-C-containing primers in the reaction mixture, showed that the rate of DNA elongation in the presence of ara-CTP was significantly enhanced when the DNA polymerase was associated with its auxiliary proteins, and that the elongation resulted in the formation of internucleotide ara-CMP. Nevertheless, the enhanced activities resulting from the association of these auxiliary proteins with polymerase alpha did not fully account for the remarkable efficiency with which the DNA synthesome incorporated ara-C into internucleotide positions during DNA replication.","['Wills, P W', 'Hickey, R', 'Malkas, L']","['Wills PW', 'Hickey R', 'Malkas L']","['University of Maryland School of Medicine, Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'DNA Polymerase I/*metabolism', 'DNA Primase/metabolism', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/drug effects/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Multienzyme Complexes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Tritium']",,2000/10/06 11:00,2000/10/14 11:01,['2000/10/06 11:00'],"['2000/10/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/14 11:01 [medline]', '2000/10/06 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800000119 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2000;46(3):193-203. doi: 10.1007/s002800000119.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Primase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA synthesome)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase I)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,['R01-CA57350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

We compared the relation between childhood ALL and wire codes and direct measurements of magnetic fields in subjects who participated in all phases of the study with the relation in all subjects, including those who declined to allow access inside the home. We found that the odds ratio for ALL among those living in homes with very high current configurations increased by 23% when 107 ""partial participants"" were excluded. We found similar, but slightly smaller, increases in the odds ratios when we performed the same comparisons using direct measurements of magnetic fields, excluding subjects who allowed only a measurement outside the front door. ""Partial participants"" tended to be characterized by lower socioeconomic status than subjects who participated fully, suggesting possible selection bias. We also examined the relation between a large number of potential confounding variables and both proxy and direct measurements of magnetic fields. Univariate adjustment for individual variables changed the odds ratio for ALL by less than 8%, while simultaneous adjustment for several factors reduced the estimate by a maximum of 15%. We conclude that while confounding alone is unlikely to be an important source of bias in our own and previous studies of magnetic fields, selection bias may be more of a concern, particularly in light of the generally low response rates among controls in case-control studies.","['Hatch, E E', 'Kleinerman, R A', 'Linet, M S', 'Tarone, R E', 'Kaune, W T', 'Auvinen, A', 'Baris, D', 'Robison, L L', 'Wacholder, S']","['Hatch EE', 'Kleinerman RA', 'Linet MS', 'Tarone RE', 'Kaune WT', 'Auvinen A', 'Baris D', 'Robison LL', 'Wacholder S']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Epidemiology,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",9009644,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Electric Wiring/*standards', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Housing', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Selection Bias', 'Social Class']",,2000/10/06 11:00,2000/10/21 11:01,['2000/10/06 11:00'],"['2000/10/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '2000/10/06 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001648-200003000-00019 [doi]'],ppublish,Epidemiology. 2000 Mar;11(2):189-98. doi: 10.1097/00001648-200003000-00019.,,,,,"['R01-CA4805/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10-CA13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Using job titles, we classified workers into high, moderate, low, and background RF exposure groups. A total of 195,775 workers contributed 2.7 million person-years during the 1976-1996 period. Using external comparisons, the standardized mortality ratios for RF-exposed workers were 0.53 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.21-1.09] and 0.54 (95% CI = 0.33-0.83) for central nervous system/brain cancers and all lymphomas/leukemias. Rate ratios calculated from Poisson regression models based on internal comparisons were near 1.0 for brain cancers and below 1.0 for all lymphomas and leukemias. These findings were consistent across cumulative, peak, and usual exposure classifications. We did not observe higher risk with increased exposure duration or latency.

Here we report on such changes in the chicken embryo. Lithium chloride (0.6 mM), applied in ovo 60 h after incubation, markedly delayed the heart rate increase observed from ED2.5 to ED5, and induced the brain expression of a new chicken gene cETO from ED7 to ED15. At the same time the overall developmental dynamics and embryo survival, or the expression of chicken gephyrin were not significantly affected. Furthermore, lithium treatment (0.3 mM, 48 h after incubation) abolished the difference in neuronal number between ED12 ciliary ganglia developing in the presence or absence of postganglionic target muscles. We show that cETO is a close homologue of the human transcription factor MTG8/ETO; named after its location on chromosome 8, and participation in chromosomal translocation 8;21 in myeloid leukemia. The mRNA and protein levels of ETO and gephyrin had a parallel course in chicken brain development suggesting that the expression of both genes is regulated mainly at the level of gene transcription. However, the patterns of expression were markedly different. ETO peaked at ED7 and decreased five-fold at ED15. In contrast, gephyrin levels increased five-fold from ED7 to ED15. We propose that the induction of ETO expression, in concert with lithium-induced upregulation of other genes, such as PEBP2beta and bcl-2, is participating in the neuroprotective effect of chronic lithium treatment.","['Ikonomov, O C', 'Petrov, T', 'Soden, K', 'Shisheva, A', 'Manji, H K']","['Ikonomov OC', 'Petrov T', 'Soden K', 'Shisheva A', 'Manji HK']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pathophysiology, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences, Wayne State University, School of Medicine, 4237 Scott Hall, 540 E.

Subsequent exposure of ara-C-pretreated U937 cells (1 microM; 6 hr) to UCN-01 (300 nM; 24 hr) resulted in marked potentiation of pro-caspase-3 and -9 cleavage/activation, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase degradation, diminished mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi(m)), enhanced cytochrome c release, reduction in the S-phase fraction, and induction of classic apoptotic morphologic features. Enforced expression of full-length Bcl-2 significantly protected cells (at 24 hr) from ara-C/UCN-01-induced caspase activation and apoptosis, but was ineffective in preventing loss of Deltapsi(m) and cytochrome c release. Ectopic expression of a Bcl-2 N-terminal phosphorylation loop-deleted protein (Bcl-2Delta(32-80)) was more potent than its full-length counterpart in blocking drug-induced loss of Deltapsi(m, ) caspase activation, and apoptotic morphology, but not cytochrome c release. Examination of cells at later intervals revealed that ectopic expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-2Delta(32-80) could only delay, but not prevent, mitochondrial damage, caspase activation, and cell death induced by ara-C/UCN-01 treatment. Despite their initial ability to inhibit apoptosis, neither full-length nor truncated Bcl-2 protein restored clonogenic potential to drug-treated cells. These findings indicate that subsequent exposure of ara-C-pretreated human leukemia cells to UCN-01 potently triggers mitochondrial damage and apoptosis, and that these events are postponed but not prevented by ectopic expression of Bcl-2 or its phosphorylation loop-deleted counterpart.","['Tang, L', 'Boise, L H', 'Dent, P', 'Grant, S']","['Tang L', 'Boise LH', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Microbiology, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism/physiology', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives', 'U937 Cells']",,2000/10/06 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/06 11:00'],"['2000/10/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/06 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(00)00463-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00463-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2000 Nov 15;60(10):1445-56. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00463-9.,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",,,,"['CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 72955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 77141/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

Causes of death were obtained from death certificates or, more recently, through NDI Plus. Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMR) were computed and tests of homogeneity were performed to detect differences in mortality among causes. Poisson models were used to estimate risks using an internal comparison group.RESULTS: Significantly low SMRs were observed for all causes (0.76), all cancers (0.82), and diseases of circulatory system (0.69). Compared to U.S. women, the risk for breast cancer mortality bordered around unity (SMR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94-1.09). However, relative to all other cancers, breast cancer mortality was significantly increased (RSMR 1.24, p < 0.01). Elevated risk for breast cancer was associated with certification before 1940 (SMR 1.55, 95% CI 1.24-1.91), and duration of certification of 20-29 (SMR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06-1.37) and 30+ years (SMR 1.77, 95% CI 1.54-2.02). A 35% increase in leukemia risk was evident for women certified for a duration of 20-29 years and a 36% increase among women certified for 30+ years. Poisson analysis revealed a significant increase in breast cancer risk with increasing number of years certified among women first certified before 1940 (p < 0.001) and during 1940-49 (p = 0.05) compared to women first certified in 1950 or later.CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings of this study suggest increased breast cancer risk associated with occupational radiation exposures prior to 1950 and with long-term cumulative exposures.

The present study is the first analysis of leukemia risk among the residents of downwind settlements exposed to radioactive fallout from atmospheric nuclear weapon tests (1949-1963) and followed up from 1960 to 1998.METHODS: Within the cohort of 10,000 exposed subjects a case-control study was nested, including 22 leukaemia cases (except chronic lymphoid leukemia) and 132 controls individually (1:6 ratio) matched by birth year and sex. Leukemia deaths were identified by death certificates and diagnoses were verified by hospital records. The individual dose including internal and external exposure assessment was estimated according to the residency and age at exposure. All odds ratios were adjusted for ethnicity (Russian or Kazakh) as an independent variable.RESULTS: The median dose of exposure for all subjects was 0.89 Sv ranging from 0.01 to 5.71 Sv. A nearly two-fold increased risk of leukemia was found (OR = 1.91; 95% CI = 0.38 to 9.67) for persons exposed to doses of >2.0 Sv as compared to those exposed to <0.5 Sv, but no increase in risk with the dose was found for those exposed to doses lower than 2 Sv. Detailed evaluation of dose-response showed an excess relative risk for leukemia of 10% per 1 Sv of additional exposure.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that there is an increased risk of leukemia among those exposed to >2 SV as compared to those exposed to <0.5 Sv, but this could have been a chance finding due to the small number of cases and low statistical power.","['Abylkassimova', 'Gusev', 'Grosche', 'Bauer', 'Kreuzer', 'Trott']","['Abylkassimova Z', 'Gusev B', 'Grosche B', 'Bauer S', 'Kreuzer M', 'Trott K']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, Institute for Radiation Medicine and Ecology, Semipalatinsk, Kazakhstan, and BfS Institute for Radiation Hygiene, Munich, Germany']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Epidemiol,Annals of epidemiology,9100013,,,,2000/10/06 00:00,2000/10/06 00:01,['2000/10/06 00:00'],"['2000/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '2000/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1047-2797(00)00136-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s1047-2797(00)00136-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Epidemiol. 2000 Oct 1;10(7):479. doi: 10.1016/s1047-2797(00)00136-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vaccine consisted of heat-sized capsular polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) coupled to diptheria toxoid (PRP-D). Children with odd birth dates received four doses of the vaccine at the ages of 3, 4, 6, and 14 months; children with even birth dates received only one dose, at the age of 24 months. The numbers of boys and girls with even and odd birth dates during the window of eligibility who remained alive during the follow-up period were obtained from the Finnish Population Registry. Numbers of leukemia cases diagnosed through 1996 among children with even and odd birth dates during the window of eligibility were obtained from the Finnish Cancer Registry. Poisson regression analysis of leukaemia incidence rates was conducted using the number of cases as the outcome variable and the natural logarithm of number of children at risk as an offset term. For comparison of the early and late vaccination groups, a binary variable based on odd or even date of birth was used.RESULTS: Among the 114,000 subjects, a total of 77 cases of childhood leukaemia were diagnosed: 33 in the early-vaccination group and 44 in the late-vaccination group. The incidence of childhood leukaemia was lower in the early-vaccination group (relative risk 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.46-1.13) than in the late-vaccination group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that early vaccination against Hib may reduce the incidence of childhood leukaemia, but confirmatory studies are needed.","['Groves', 'Auvinen', 'Hakulinen']","['Groves F', 'Auvinen A', 'Hakulinen T']","['Department of Biometry and Epidemiology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Epidemiol,Annals of epidemiology,9100013,,,,2000/10/06 00:00,2000/10/06 00:01,['2000/10/06 00:00'],"['2000/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '2000/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1047-2797(00)00110-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s1047-2797(00)00110-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Epidemiol. 2000 Oct 1;10(7):474. doi: 10.1016/s1047-2797(00)00110-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of HER2 activity can reduce tumor growth, which led to the development of Herceptin, an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (MAb) that is already in clinical use. However, the objective response rate to Herceptin monotherapy is quite low. HER2 activity can also be inhibited by the highly cytotoxic antibiotic geldanamycin (GA). However, GA is not used clinically because of its adverse toxicity. Our purpose was to enhance the inhibitory activity of anti-HER2 MAb by coupling it to GA. METHODS: We synthesized 17-(3-aminopropylamino)GA (17-APA-GA) and conjugated it to the anti-HER2 MAb e21, to form e21 : GA. The noninternalizing anti-HER2 MAb AE1 was used as a control. Internalization assays and western blot analyses were used to determine whether the anti-HER2 MAbs and their immunoconjugates were internalized into HER2-expressing cells and reduced HER2 levels. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: The immunoconjugate e21 : GA inhibited the proliferation of HER2-overexpressing cell lines better than unconjugated e21 (concentration required for 50% inhibition = 40 versus 1650 microg/mL, respectively). At 15 microg/mL, e21 : GA reduced HER2 levels by 86% within 16 hours, whereas unconjugated e21, 17-APA-GA, or AE1 : GA reduced HER2 levels by only 20%. These effects were not caused by release of 17-APA-GA from the immunoconjugate because immunoconjugates containing [(3)H]GA were stable in serum at 37 degrees C. Furthermore, e21 : GA did not significantly inhibit proliferation of the adult T-cell leukemia cell line HuT102, which is HER2 negative yet highly sensitive to GA. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that conjugating GA to internalizing MAbs enhances the inhibitory effect of the MAbs.

Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana grow most of the spring and durum wheat produced in the United States. More than 90% of spring and durum wheat is treated with chlorophenoxy herbicides, in contrast to treatment of approximately 30% of winter wheat. In this ecologic study I used wheat acreage as a surrogate for exposure to chlorophenoxy herbicides. I investigated the association of chlorophenoxy herbicides with cancer mortality during 1980-1989 for selected counties based on level of agriculture ([greater and equal to] 20%) and rural population ([greater and equal to] 50%). Age-standardized cancer mortality rates were determined for grouped counties based on tertiles of wheat acreage per county or for individual counties for frequently occurring cancers. The cancer sites that showed positive trends of increasing cancer mortality with increasing wheat acreage were esophagus, stomach, rectum, pancreas, larynx, prostate, kidney and ureter, brain, thyroid, bone, and all cancers (men) and oral cavity and tongue, esophagus, stomach, liver and gall bladder and bile ducts, pancreas, cervix, ovary, bladder, and other urinary organs, and all cancers (women). Rare cancers in men and women and cancers in boys and girls were studied by comparing counties above and below the median of wheat acreage per county. There was increased mortality for cancer of the nose and eye in both men and women, brain and leukemia in both boys and girls, and all cancers in boys. These results suggest an association between cancer mortality and wheat acreage in counties of these four states.","['Schreinemachers, D M']",['Schreinemachers DM'],"['National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, USA. schreinemachers.dina@epa.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Agriculture', 'Child', 'Chlorophenols/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Herbicides/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/*mortality', 'Triticum', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC2556929,2000/10/06 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/06 11:00'],"['2000/10/06 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/06 11:00 [entrez]']","['sc271_5_1835 [pii]', '10.1289/ehp.00108873 [doi]']",ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2000 Sep;108(9):873-81. doi: 10.1289/ehp.00108873.,"['0 (Chlorophenols)', '0 (Herbicides)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of caffeine on cell cycle were examined using these cells. During the culture of 80 MPa-treated MEL cells at atmospheric pressure, the cells arrested in the G2 phase, and cyclin B and hyperphosphorylated p34(cdc2) were accumulated. Namely, maturation promoting factor (MPF) composed of p34(cdc2) and cyclin B was inactive. However, upon exposure to caffeine, these cells entered prematurely into mitosis by activating MPF. Caffeine-induced premature mitosis was suppressed by butyrolactone I and orthovanadate. On the other hand, APH-treated MEL cells, which were not exposed to 80 MPa, were not so sensitive to caffeine-induced premature mitosis despite cyclin B accumulation. In this case, dephosphorylation of p34(cdc2) was not induced by caffeine. Interestingly, caffeine-induced premature mitosis in the 80 MPa-treated cells was also suppressed by APH. These results suggest that the premature mitosis of 80 MPa-treated MEL cells by caffeine is induced by active MPF, and that APH-sensitive molecules such as DNA polymerase may also play an important role in the checkpoint that controls the transition from G2 to M phase.","['Matsumoto, M', 'Yamaguchi, T', 'Nakazono, K', 'Fukumaki, Y', 'Terada, S']","['Matsumoto M', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Nakazono K', 'Fukumaki Y', 'Terada S']","['Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, 814-0180, Japan. takeo@fukuoka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn J Physiol,The Japanese journal of physiology,2985184R,IM,"['Animals', 'Aphidicolin/pharmacology', '*Atmospheric Pressure', 'Caffeine/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects/physiology', 'G2 Phase/drug effects/physiology', '*Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mitosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'S Phase/drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/enzymology']",,2000/10/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/04 11:00'],"['2000/10/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/04 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.2170/jjphysiol.50.329 [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Physiol. 2000 Jun;50(3):329-36. doi: 10.2170/jjphysiol.50.329.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the changes in channel function remain to be defined. In the present work, inside-out patch experiments were employed to elucidate the role of submembranous actin dynamics in the control of sodium channels in human myeloid leukemia K562 cells. We found that the application of cytochalasin D to the cytoplasmic surface of membrane fragments resulted in activation of non-voltage-gated sodium channels of 12 picosiemens conductance. Similar effects could be evoked by addition of the actin-severing protein gelsolin to the bath cytosol-like solution containing 1 microm [Ca(2+)](i). The sodium channel activity induced by disassembly of submembranous microfilaments with cytochalasin D or gelsolin could be abolished by intact actin added to the bath cytosol-like solution in the presence of 1 mm MgCl(2) to induce actin polymerization. In the absence of MgCl(2), addition of intact actin did not abolish the channel activity. Moreover, the sodium currents were unaffected by heat-inactivated actin or by actin whose polymerizability was strongly reduced by cleavage with specific Escherichia coli A2 protease ECP32. Thus, the inhibitory effect of actin on channel activity was observed only under conditions promoting rapid polymerization. Taken together, our data show that sodium channels are directly controlled by dynamic assembly and disassembly of submembranous F-actin.","['Negulyaev, Y A', 'Khaitlina, S Y', 'Hinssen, H', 'Shumilina, E V', 'Vedernikova, E A']","['Negulyaev YA', 'Khaitlina SY', 'Hinssen H', 'Shumilina EV', 'Vedernikova EA']","['Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences, 4 Tikhoretsky Avenue, St. Petersburg 194064, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Actins/*metabolism', 'Cytochalasin D/pharmacology', 'Gelsolin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Polymers/metabolism', 'Sodium Channels/*physiology']",,2000/10/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/04 11:00'],"['2000/10/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/04 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M008219200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)55619-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Dec 29;275(52):40933-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M008219200.,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Gelsolin)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Sodium Channels)', '22144-77-0 (Cytochalasin D)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, hardly any differences in signal transduction initiated by these cytokines are known. In the present study, we demonstrate that oncostatin M (OSM), but not IL-6 or leukemia inhibitory factor, induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the Shc isoforms p52 and p66 and their association with Grb2. Concomitantly, OSM turns out to be a stronger activator of ERK1/2 MAPKs. Shc is recruited to the OSM receptor (OSMR), but not to gp130. Binding involves Tyr(861) of the OSMR, located within a consensus binding sequence for the Shc PTB domain. Moreover, Tyr(861) is essential for activation of ERK1/2 and for full activation of the alpha(2)-macroglobulin promoter, but not for an exclusively STAT-responsive promoter. This study therefore provides evidence for qualitative differential signaling mechanisms exerted by IL-6-type cytokines.","['Hermanns, H M', 'Radtke, S', 'Schaper, F', 'Heinrich, P C', 'Behrmann, I']","['Hermanns HM', 'Radtke S', 'Schaper F', 'Heinrich PC', 'Behrmann I']","['Institut fur Biochemie, Universitatsklinikum der Rheinisch-Westfalischen Technischen Hochschule Aachen, Pauwelsstr. 30, 52074 Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', '*Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Dimerization', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytokine/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', 'Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins', '*Signal Transduction', 'Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1', 'Tyrosine/physiology', 'alpha-Macroglobulins/genetics']",,2000/10/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/04 11:00'],"['2000/10/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/04 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M005408200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)55595-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Dec 29;275(52):40742-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M005408200.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (Grb2 protein, rat)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '0 (Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Shc1 protein, rat)', '0 (Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1)', '0 (alpha-Macroglobulins)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that HL60 cells acidified upon exposure to C2 but not C5. The intracellular drop in pH and caspase activation were dependent upon hydrogen peroxide production, and were inhibited by scavengers of hydrogen peroxide. On the contrary, caspase inhibitors did not block hydrogen peroxide production. In turn, increased intracellular hydrogen peroxide concentration was downstream of superoxide anion produced within 2 h of exposure to C2. Inhibitor of NADPH oxidase diphenyleneiodonium neither inhibited superoxide production nor caspase activation triggered by C2. However, exposure of purified mitochondria to C2 resulted in significantly increased superoxide production. Furthermore, cytochrome C release from isolated mitochondria induced by C2 was completely inhibited in the presence of scavengers of hydrogen peroxide. Contrarily, scavenging hydrogen peroxide had no effect on the cyclosporin A-sensitive mitochondrial permeability transition induced by C5. Our data suggest a scenario where drug-induced hydrogen peroxide production induces intracellular acidification and release of cytochrome C, independent of the inner membrane pore, thereby creating an intracellular environment permissive for caspase activation.","['Hirpara, J L', 'Clement, M V', 'Pervaiz, S']","['Hirpara JL', 'Clement MV', 'Pervaiz S']","['Department of Physiology, National University of Singapore, Singapore 119260.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', '*Ion Channels', 'Light', 'Membrane Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore', 'NADPH Oxidases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Pyrimidinones/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Superoxides/metabolism']",,2000/10/04 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/10/04 11:00'],"['2000/10/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/04 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M004687200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)44266-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Jan 5;276(1):514-21. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M004687200.,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,['J Biol Chem. 2014 Apr 11;289(15):10269.

To study the mechanism of tissue-specific tumor development by RET with a MEN2A (cysteine 634-->arginine) mutation, we generated transgenic mice by introducing the RET-MEN2A gene fused to Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat. Expression of the transgene and its product was detected at variable levels in a variety of tissues including thyroid, heart, liver, colon, parotid gland, and brain. All of 29 mice analyzed developed thyroid C-cell hyperplasia or medullary carcinoma, accompanying high levels of serum calcitonin. In addition, development of mammary or parotid gland adenocarcinoma was observed in one-half of the transgenic mice. RET dimerization and its complex formation with Shc and Grb2 adaptor proteins were detected in tumor tissues. Unexpectedly, no tumor formation was found in other tissues despite RET-MEN2A expression where RET dimerization was undetectable.

For both marrow and blood, the logarithmic mean of the number of leukemic cells fell by approximately four orders of magnitude during the first 2 weeks, one order of magnitude during the third week, and not at all during the last two weeks of induction treatment. For marrow, the median of the fraction of leukemic cells in each patient that survived per week of treatment was 0.008 for the first 2 weeks, 0.12 for the third week, and 1.4 for the last 2 weeks; for blood, the corresponding figures were 0.003, 0.14, and 0.69, respectively. In individual patients, the results for marrow and blood showed good correlation. The biphasic decline of leukemic cell number suggests that most leukemic cells were sensitive to treatment and were rapidly killed, leaving behind a minor but substantial population of drug-resistant cells. The most likely explanation for this phenomenon is that these resistant cells were already present at diagnosis, their resistance having originated from genetic or epigenetic mutations during prior growth of the leukemic clone.","['Brisco, M J', 'Sykes, P J', 'Dolman, G', 'Hughes, E', 'Neoh, S H', 'Peng, L', 'Snell, L E', 'Toogood, I R', 'Rice, M S', 'Morley, A A']","['Brisco MJ', 'Sykes PJ', 'Dolman G', 'Hughes E', 'Neoh SH', 'Peng L', 'Snell LE', 'Toogood IR', 'Rice MS', 'Morley AA']","['Department of Hematology and Genetic Pathology, Flinders University of South Australia and Flinders Medical Center, Bedford Park, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Remission Induction']",,2000/10/04 11:00,2000/10/21 11:01,['2000/10/04 11:00'],"['2000/10/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '2000/10/04 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Sep 15;60(18):5092-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Children of all ages displayed considerable accuracy for event details, and accuracy increased with age. Overall recall accuracy for event details and emotional responses was similar. Recall among children given oral Versed was similar to that among children not given Versed. Finally, higher distress predicted greater exaggerations in negative memory 1 week later (although controlling for age weakened this relationship); moreover, greater exaggerations in negative memory predicted higher distress at a subsequent LP.

As much of the pathology can be attributed to high affinity autoantibodies and/or their immune complexes, some of the genes may exert effects in the process of emergence, escape from tolerance mechanisms, activation, clonal expansion, differentiation, class switching and affinity maturation of self-reactive B cells. A number of growth and differentiation factors and signaling molecules, including positive and negative regulators, are involved in this process. Genetic variations associated with functional deficits in some of such molecules can be involved in the susceptibility for SLE. As is the case with SLE, hereditary factors play significant roles in the pathogenesis of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Patients with B-CLL or their family members frequently have immunological abnormalities, including those associated with SLE. It is suggested that certain genetically determined regulatory abnormalities of B cells may be a crossroad between B-CLL and SLE. A thorough understanding of the genetic pathways in B cell abnormalities leading to either SLE or B-CLL is expected to shed light on their association. New Zealand mouse strains are pertinent laboratory models for these studies. Chromosomal locations of several major genetic loci for abnormal proliferation, differentiation and maturation of B cells and relevant candidate genes, located in close proximity to these intervals and potentially related to the SLE pathogenesis, have been identified in these mice. Further studies make for a wider knowledge and understanding of the pathogenesis of SLE and related B-cell malignancy.","['Hirose, S', 'Jiang, Y', 'Hamano, Y', 'Shirai, T']","['Hirose S', 'Jiang Y', 'Hamano Y', 'Shirai T']","['Department of Pathology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. sacchi@med.juntendo.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Int Rev Immunol,International reviews of immunology,8712260,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Genetic Linkage', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics', 'Hypergammaglobulinemia/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NZB', 'Multigene Family', 'Receptors, IgG/genetics']",,2000/10/04 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/04 11:00'],"['2000/10/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/04 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08830180009055505 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Rev Immunol. 2000;19(4-5):389-421. doi: 10.3109/08830180009055505.,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",,,151,,,,,,,,,

CASE: An 8-month-old male presented with an abdominal swelling, bilateral cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy and enlarged left epididymis. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed a space-occupying lesion in the liver and bilateral enlargement of the kidneys. FNA smears from the right kidney and right submandibular lymph node showed numerous blast cells. Since rare blast cells were positive for myeloperoxidase, a cytodiagnosis of involvement by acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was made. However, following the hematologic diagnosis of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (M7) from peripheral blood and bone marrow smear examination, FNA smears were reviewed. There were cytoplasmic blebs or protrusions in the blast cells and cytologic features suggestive of their differentiation toward micro-megakaryocytes and megakaryocytes. There was also evidence of shedding of platelets, including numerous giant platelets. The reviewed FNA cytodiagnosis was suggestive of AML (M7). CONCLUSION: Extramedullary involvement by acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (M7) can be suspected based on cytomorphologic features in FNA smears.","['Das, D K', 'Shome, D K', 'Garg, A', 'Bhatt, N C', 'Rath, B']","['Das DK', 'Shome DK', 'Garg A', 'Bhatt NC', 'Rath B']","['Institute of Cytology and Preventive Oncology, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,IM,"['Biopsy, Needle', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kidney/pathology', 'Kidney Diseases/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Male']",,2000/10/04 11:00,2000/10/21 11:01,['2000/10/04 11:00'],"['2000/10/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '2000/10/04 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000328568 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Cytol. 2000 Sep-Oct;44(5):819-23. doi: 10.1159/000328568.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In other tissues, oncostatin M (OSM), a potent inducer of epithelial antiproteases, has also been shown to interact with IL-1beta to stimulate PGE(2) release. However, whether OSM interacts with pro-inflammatory cytokines and proteases in the production of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids and NO from airway epithelium is unknown. The effect of OSM and the related cytokine leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) on PGE(2) and NO production by the respiratory epithelial cell line, A549 in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as protease-rich house dust mite (HDM) fractions and a protease-deficient rye grass pollen extract was examined by immunohistochemistry, cell culture, ELISA and enzyme-immunoassay. Cells treated with a mixture of IL-1beta, IFNgamma and LPS for 48 h produced a 9 fold increase in PGE(2) and a 3 fold increase in NO levels (both P<0.05). Both OSM and LIF were without effect. However, OSM added together with the cytokine mixture synergistically enhanced PGE(2) production (22 fold, P<0.05). OSM also synergistically enhanced PGE(2) production in response to a cysteine protease-enriched, but not serine protease-enriched HDM fraction (P<0.05). Rye grass extract, neither alone nor in combination with OSM, induced PGE(2) or NO production, although it did induce the release of GM-CSF. These observations suggest that OSM is an important co-factor in the release of PGE(2) and NO from respiratory epithelial cells and may play a role in defense against exogenous proteases such as those derived from HDM.","['Knight, D A', 'Asokananthan, N', 'Watkins, D N', 'Misso, N L', 'Thompson, P J', 'Stewart, G A']","['Knight DA', 'Asokananthan N', 'Watkins DN', 'Misso NL', 'Thompson PJ', 'Stewart GA']","['Asthma & Allergy Research Institute, University of Western Australia, Nedlands, Western Australia. dknight@cyllene.uwa.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dinoprostone/*metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Endopeptidases/*pharmacology', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lolium/chemistry', 'Lung/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Mites/enzymology', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Pollen/chemistry', 'Receptors, Cytokine/analysis', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M']",PMC1572366,2000/10/04 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/10/04 11:00'],"['2000/10/04 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/04 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjp.0703612 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2000 Oct;131(3):465-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0703612.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This ""open circuit voltage"" (V(OC)) will cause ""contact current"" to flow in a person who touches the appliance and completes an electrical circuit to ground. This paper presents data suggesting that contact current due to V(OC) is an exposure that may explain the reported associations of residential magnetic fields with childhood leukemia. Our analysis is based on a computer model of a 40 house (single-unit, detached dwelling) neighborhood with electrical service that is representative of US grounding practices. The analysis was motivated by recent research suggesting that the physical location of power lines in the backyard, in contrast to the street, may be relevant to a relationship of power lines with childhood leukemia. In the model, the highest magnetic field levels and V(OC)s were both associated with backyard lines, and the highest V(OC)s were also associated with long ground paths in the residence. Across the entire neighborhood, magnetic field exposure was highly correlated with V(OC) (r = 0.93). Dosimetric modeling indicates that, compared to a very high residential level of a uniform horizontal magnetic field (10 mu T) or a vertical electric field (100 V/m), a modest level of contact current (approximately 18 mu A) leads to considerably greater induced electric fields (> 1 mV/m) averaged across tissue, such as bone marrow and heart.

We have previously described an unusual case of CD5+ B cell lymphoma characterized by cycles of leukemic phase alternating with spontaneous remission. In the present study, we examined the involvement of apoptosis-related proteins in the progression of this cyclic lymphoma ex vivo. During the leukemic phases, the clonal cells were activated blasts expressing elevated levels of wild-type (wt) p53, Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), and Bax, while Bak expression increased during the decline of lymphocytosis. Bax heterodimerized with Bcl-2 but not with Bcl-x(L). The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2/Bax heterodimers peaked during early leukemic phases and declined during regression. The elevation in Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L) and Bax expression during early leukemic phases seems to result from cell activation since a similar increase was induced by activating the remission phase leukemic cells in culture. The data suggest that wt p53, Bcl-x(L), and Bcl-2/Bax heterodimers support the accumulation of activated leukemic cells during the leukemic phases, while Bax and Bak may be involved in their decline during regression.","['Aizman, I', 'Many, A', 'Peller, S', 'Ramot, B', 'Kaufmann, Y']","['Aizman I', 'Many A', 'Peller S', 'Ramot B', 'Kaufmann Y']","['Institute of Hematology, Chaim Sheba Medical Center Tel-Hashomer, and Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Stromal Cells', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2000/10/03 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/03 11:00'],"['2000/10/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/03 11:00 [entrez]']","['41046 [pii]', '10.1159/000041046 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2000;103(4):177-85. doi: 10.1159/000041046.,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",,,,,"['Copyright 2000 S.

One hundred and thirty-seven cases, previously diagnosed and sub-typed according to the Kiel classification and characterized by immunophenotyping, were included in the study. The M-1 subunit ribonucleotide reductase (M1-R-R), Ki-67 and p53 antigens were detected using monoclonal antibodies on stored cytospin preparations. There was a good correlation (r = 0.72) between Ki-67 and M1-R-R positive cell fraction in both high and low grade lymphomas. High-grade lymphomas had a median percentage of M1-R-R/MIB-1 positive cells of 53.0/73.0 for lymphoblastic, 61.0/52.0 for immunoblastic and 33.5/41.0 for centroblastic lymphomas, respectively. In low grade lymphomas figures of median percentage of M1-R-R/MIB-1 were 9.0/15.0 for centroblastic/centrocytic, 11.0/9.5 for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, 16.0/27.0 for centrocytic and 12.0/9.0 for immunocytomas, respectively. The median percentages of M1-R-R/MIB-1 for high and low grade lymphomas were 37.0/50.5 and 11.0/12.0, respectively. In the p53 positive cases the proliferation rate as measured by staining for M1-R-R and MIB-1 was higher than in p53 negative cases, but the difference was not statistically significant. The results show that cytospin material obtained by fine needle aspiration and stored at -70 degrees C for years can be used reliably for both peroxidase-avidin-biotin and three-step alkaline phosphatase immunocytochemical staining. In addition, proliferation fraction determined by M1-R-R monoclonal antibody staining correlates well with that measured by an established marker for cell proliferation, the Ki-67 antibody. However, the proliferation fraction as measured by the two antibodies differs in the various subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma which indicates that they may contribute different prognostic information.","['Sviatoha, V', 'Tani, E', 'Rassidakis, G', 'Tribukait, B', 'Kleina, R', 'Skoog, L']","['Sviatoha V', 'Tani E', 'Rassidakis G', 'Tribukait B', 'Kleina R', 'Skoog L']","['Department of General Pathology, Latvian Centre of Pathology, Latvian, Medical Academy, Riga.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytopathology,Cytopathology : official journal of the British Society for Clinical Cytology,9010345,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Ki-67 Antigen/*analysis', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Subunits', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*analysis']",,2000/10/03 11:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2000/10/03 11:00'],"['2000/10/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/03 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2303.2000.00234.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cytopathology. 2000 Oct;11(5):290-301. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2303.2000.00234.x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, until recently, analysis for CD10 has generally required fresh or frozen tissue. 56C6 is a monoclonal antibody that is now commercially available for the detection of CD10 in routinely processed paraffin-embedded tissue. Immunoperoxidase stains for CD10 on paraffin-embedded bone marrow core biopsy specimens (B5-fixed, decalcified) and marrow aspirate clots (formalin-fixed) were compared with flow cytometric immunophenotyping for CD10 on fresh cell suspensions in 20 cases of AML and in 30 cases of ALL. CD10 detection by immunohistochemistry agreed with CD10 by flow cytometry in 98% (49 of 50) of acute leukemias. The results matched in 100% (20 of 20) of AML. Five percent (1 of 20) of AMLs expressed CD10. Two of the AMLs with monocytoid differentiation were interpreted as negative for CD10 by flow cytometry, although these had nonspecific dim immunofluorescence for multiple markers, including CD10, and these cases were negative by immunohistochemistry. CD10 detection by immunohistochemistry agreed with CD10 by flow cytometry in 97% (29 of 30) of ALL. Eighty-four percent (21 of 25) of B-precursor ALL and 40% (2/5) of T-lineage ALL expressed CD10 by immunohistochemistry. In 1 case of B-precursor ALL, CD10 was dimly positive in 24% of the blasts by flow cytometry but negative by immunohistochemistry.

The active O2- production and low SOD activity in cancer cells may render the malignant cells highly dependent on SOD for survival and sensitive to inhibition of SOD. Here we report that certain oestrogen derivatives selectively kill human leukaemia cells but not normal lymphocytes. Using complementary DNA microarray and biochemical approaches, we identify SOD as a target of this drug action and show that chemical modifications at the 2-carbon (2-OH, 2-OCH3) of the derivatives are essential for SOD inhibition and for apoptosis induction. Inhibition of SOD causes accumulation of cellular O2- and leads to free-radical-mediated damage to mitochondrial membranes, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and apoptosis of the cancer cells. Our results indicate that targeting SOD may be a promising approach to the selective killing of cancer cells, and that mechanism-based combinations of SOD inhibitors with free-radical-producing agents may have clinical applications.","['Huang, P', 'Feng, L', 'Oldham, E A', 'Keating, M J', 'Plunkett, W']","['Huang P', 'Feng L', 'Oldham EA', 'Keating MJ', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA. phuang@notes.mdacc.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['2-Methoxyestradiol', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Superoxide Dismutase/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/10/03 11:00,2000/10/21 11:01,['2000/10/03 11:00'],"['2000/10/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '2000/10/03 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/35030140 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 2000 Sep 21;407(6802):390-5. doi: 10.1038/35030140.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '6I2QW73SR5 (2-Methoxyestradiol)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",['Nature. 2000 Sep 21;407(6802):309-11.

Slides of routinely prepared benign and malignant lymphoid tissues were viewed in the SEM. The location of prominent populations of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes was verified by immunocytochemical staining respectively with CD3 and CD20 antisera. Benign tissues, including infant thymus and adult hyperplastic lymph node, were compared with malignant lymphomas of T-cell and B-cell types. The SEM appearance of benign B and T lymphocytes is compared utilizing the backscattered electron (BSE) mode and secondary electron (SE) mode in adult hyperplastic lymph node and infant thymus, respectively. The BSE and SE modes reveal that the sectioned T-lymphocyte nucleus has a more complex configuration than that of the B lymphocyte. T lymphocytes appear more discrete and separated one from another, while B lymphocytes exhibit close cellular association to form a syncytial array. These features are noted also in malignant lymphomas of B-lymphocyte and T-lymphocyte types, respectively. The SEM can distinguish between B and T lymphocytes by studying the differences in nuclear and chiefly the cell to cell appearances. The syncytial configuration of B lymphocytes may reflect prominent expression of cell adhesion molecules, e.g., ICAM-1, as noted in the literature.","['Terzakis, J A']",['Terzakis JA'],"['Kalvin Electron Microscope Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ultrastruct Pathol,Ultrastructural pathology,8002867,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology/ultrastructure', '*Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'T-Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Thymus Gland/ultrastructure']",,2000/10/03 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/03 11:00'],"['2000/10/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/03 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/01913120050176653 [doi]'],ppublish,Ultrastruct Pathol. 2000 Jul-Aug;24(4):205-9. doi: 10.1080/01913120050176653.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have reported previously that the mutagen-hypersensitive thymidine kinase (TK)-deficient Friend erythroleukemia (FEL) cells (subclones 707BUF and 707BUE), have a more than sixfold increase in the dCTP:dTTP pool ratio when compared to that of wild-type, TK-positive (TK(+)) clone 707 cells. In this study we present the results of an investigation of the effect of the dCTP:dTTP pool imbalance on the accuracy of DNA replication within 707BUF cells. We examined the spontaneous mutation spectra occurring at the adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (aprt) locus within clone 707 (TK(+)) and 707BUF (TK(-)) FEL cells. Mutations recovered at the aprt locus in FEL cells comprised: base substitutions (43:73), frameshifts (14:13.5), and deletions (43:13.5) [clone 707 (TK(+)):707BUF (TK(-)), respectively, expressed as percentages]. A comparison of the mutation spectra obtained for the two cell lines did not reveal any significant increase in misincorporation of dCTP, the nucleotide in excess, in 707BUF (TK(-)) cells, during DNA replication synthesis. These data suggest that the dCTP:dTTP pool imbalance does not alter the fidelity of DNA replication synthesis in 707BUF (TK(-)) FEL cells. Rather, the predominance of GC --> AT transitions (53%) in the 707BUF (TK(-)) spectrum may reflect a reduced efficiency of repair by uracil DNA glycosylase of uracil residues within these cells.","['Hyland, P L', 'Keegan, A L', 'Curran, M D', 'Middleton, D', 'McKenna, P G', 'Barnett, Y A']","['Hyland PL', 'Keegan AL', 'Curran MD', 'Middleton D', 'McKenna PG', 'Barnett YA']","[""School of Clinical Dentistry, The Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast, Northern Ireland.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Environ Mol Mutagen,Environmental and molecular mutagenesis,8800109,IM,"['Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics', 'Animals', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'DNA Replication/*genetics', 'Deoxycytosine Nucleotides/genetics/*metabolism', 'Exons', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Thymidine Kinase/deficiency/genetics', 'Thymine Nucleotides/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/10/03 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/03 11:00'],"['2000/10/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/03 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1098-2280(2000)36:2<87::AID-EM2>3.0.CO;2-A [pii]', '10.1002/1098-2280(2000)36:2<87::aid-em2>3.0.co;2-a [doi]']",ppublish,Environ Mol Mutagen. 2000;36(2):87-96. doi: 10.1002/1098-2280(2000)36:2<87::aid-em2>3.0.co;2-a.,"['0 (Deoxycytosine Nucleotides)', '0 (Thymine Nucleotides)', ""2056-98-6 (2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate)"", 'EC 2.4.2.7 (Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', ""QOP4K539MU (thymidine 5'-triphosphate)""]",,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors undertook a case review of the M. D. Anderson experience with ANFH occurring in CML patients who were managed with interferon-alpha-based therapy. MEDLINE (from 1966 to November 1999) and CancerLit (from 1983 to November 1999) searches were conducted to identify cases of avascular necrosis (AVN) associated with either CML or interferon-alpha. RESULTS: Three patients with ANFH were identified from the authors' experience. No common features related to the disease or therapy were seen among them, except for the presence of thrombocytosis and loss of response. A literature review revealed seven cases of ANFH associated with CML with or without interferon-alpha-based therapy. ANFH was not reported in association with interferon-alpha use for indications other than the treatment of patients with CML. CONCLUSIONS: ANFH may be the result of an interaction between CML and interferon-alpha therapy. ANFH that occurs in patients with CML who are treated with interferon-alpha should be recognized for treatment implications. Thrombocytosis with consequent microvascular thrombi and avascular necrosis manifesting in susceptible vascular or weight-bearing areas (e.g., the femoral head) may be an associated finding along with loss of response to interferon-alpha therapy.","['Kozuch, P', 'Talpaz, M', 'Faderl, S', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Freireich, E J', 'Kantarjian, H']","['Kozuch P', 'Talpaz M', 'Faderl S', ""O'Brien S"", 'Freireich EJ', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, the University of Texas M.

In an attempt to evaluate the effect of interferon-alpha (IFNalpha), the authors measured serum CD44 (sCD44) and sCD54 in 22 low grade NHL and 14 CLL patients. METHODS: Twenty-six patients fulfilling the criteria for therapy received daily doses of 3 x10(6) IU IFNalpha-2a. Ten patients not requiring therapy also were observed for the same period. Fasting sera were collected at baseline and in 4 monthly intervals from all patients including the IFNalpha-treated (Group 1) and the untreated group (Group 2). RESULTS: Higher baseline sCD44 values were observed in Group 1 as compared with the Group 2 patients (P = 0.057). Within Group 1, patients were further divided between those who responded to IFNalpha, referred to as responders, and those who did not respond to IFNalpha, known as nonresponders. Responders showed a gradual decrease in sCD44 starting at the 4th month until the 12th month (P = 0.003, P = 0.002, and P = 0.01). Neither a difference in baseline nor an IFNalpha effect on the sCD54 levels could be shown. Soluble CD44 levels between responders and nonresponders were not different at the baseline but were significantly lower in responders, starting at month 4 and continuing throughout the therapy period (P = 0.04, P = 0.017, and P = 0.043). This decrease did not accompany a leukocyte or lactate dehydrogenase decrease and was not correlated with an early disappearance of the clinical findings. Similarly, after treatment, the sCD44 values of Group 1 were lower than the Group 2 levels at months 4 and 8 (P = 0.007 and P = 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Soluble CD44, but not sCD54, can be used for monitoring therapy in patients with low grade NHL and CLL who have received IFNalpha, and for deciding whether further IFN therapy is necessary for those patients who have not responded to IFNalpha over a previous 12-month period.","['Beksac, M', 'Arat, M', 'Akan, H', 'Koc, H', 'Ilhan, O', 'Ozcan, M']","['Beksac M', 'Arat M', 'Akan H', 'Koc H', 'Ilhan O', 'Ozcan M']","['Ankara University, School of Medicine, Ibni Sina Hospital, Department of Hematology, Sihhiye, Ankara, Turkey. mbeksac@ato.org.tr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*analysis', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2000/10/03 11:00,2000/10/21 11:01,['2000/10/03 11:00'],"['2000/10/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '2000/10/03 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(20001001)89:7<1474::AID-CNCR9>3.0.CO;2-C [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2000 Oct 1;89(7):1474-81.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We wanted to study the expression of interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) in various hematologic disorders, especially chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and its association with response to interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) treatment in CML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples from various hematopoietic cell lines, different leukemia patients (70 CML, 29 acute myeloid leukemia [AML], 10 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [CMMoL], 10 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 10 chronic lymphoid leukemia patients), and 33 healthy volunteers were monitored for IRF4 expression by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Then, with a focus on CML, the IRF4 level was determined in sorted cell subpopulations from CML patients and healthy volunteers and in in vitro-stimulated CML cells. Furthermore, IRF4 expression was compared in the CML samples taken before IFN-alpha therapy and in 47 additional CML samples taken during IFN-alpha therapy. IRF4 expression was then correlated with cytogenetic response to IFN-alpha. RESULTS: IRF4 expression was significantly impaired in CML, AML, and CMMoL samples. The downregulation of IRF4 in CML samples was predominantly found in T cells. In CML patients during IFN-alpha therapy, a significant increase in IRF4 levels was detected, and this was also observed in sorted T cells from CML patients. The increase seen during IFN-alpha therapy was not due to different blood counts. In regard to the cytogenetic response with IFN-alpha, a good response was associated with high IRF4 expression. CONCLUSION: IRF4 expression is downregulated in T cells of CML patients, and its increase is associated with a good response to IFN-alpha therapy. These data suggest IRF4 expression as a useful marker to monitor, if not predict, response to IFN-alpha in CML.","['Schmidt, M', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Konig-Merediz, S A', 'Brendel, C', 'Proba, J', 'Hoppe, G J', 'Wittig, B', 'Ehninger, G', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Neubauer, A']","['Schmidt M', 'Hochhaus A', 'Konig-Merediz SA', 'Brendel C', 'Proba J', 'Hoppe GJ', 'Wittig B', 'Ehninger G', 'Hehlmann R', 'Neubauer A']","['Zentrum fur Innere Medizin, Abteilung Hamatologie/Onkologie/Immunologie, Klinikum der Philipps-Universitat Marburg, Marburg.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/blood/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/drug therapy/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/drug therapy/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/blood/drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Monocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/blood/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/blood/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/10/03 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/10/03 11:00'],"['2000/10/03 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/10/03 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.19.3331 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 Oct 1;18(19):3331-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.19.3331.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of p56(dok-2) in biological functions of cells is not clear. We found that transcription of the p56(dok-2) gene in macrophages was increased markedly in response to cytokines such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), granulocyte/macrophage-CSF and interleukin-3 (IL-3). Forced expression of p56(dok-2) inhibited M-CSF-, granulocyte-CSF-, IL-3- and stem cell factor-induced proliferation of myeloid leukemia cells, M-NFS-60. The p56(dok-2)-overexpressing cells showed an impaired induction of c-myc but not of c-jun, junB or c-fos when stimulated with M-CSF. Consistent with these results, the peritoneal cavity of the hairless (hr/hr) strain of mutant mice, whose cells expressed less p56(dok-2) than wild-type mice, contained more macrophages than that of +/hr mice. Moreover, the inhibition of endogenous p56(dok-2) expression in macrophage-like tumor cells, J774A.1, by stable expression of antisense p56(dok-2) mRNA accelerated cell proliferation. The study identifies a novel role for p56(dok-2) as a molecule that negatively regulates signal transduction and cell proliferation mediated by cytokines in a feedback loop.","['Suzu, S', 'Tanaka-Douzono, M', 'Nomaguchi, K', 'Yamada, M', 'Hayasawa, H', 'Kimura, F', 'Motoyoshi, K']","['Suzu S', 'Tanaka-Douzono M', 'Nomaguchi K', 'Yamada M', 'Hayasawa H', 'Kimura F', 'Motoyoshi K']","['Biochemical Research Laboratory, Morinaga Milk Industry Co.

The relative incidence of these subtypes of malignant lymphoma is also known to differ according to geographic location. In order to clarify the current status of malignant lymphomas in Japan and the relative incidences of their subtypes, 3194 patients were classified according to the new World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Among these were 3025 cases (94.71%) of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (2189 cases (68.53%) of B-cell lymphoma, 796 cases (24.92%) of T-cell lymphoma) and 141 cases (4.41%) of Hodgkin's lymphoma. The incidences of the major subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were 33.34% for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 8.45% for marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type, 8.05% for plasma cell myeloma, 7.45% for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), 6.7% for follicular lymphoma, 6.67% for peripheral T-cell lymphoma of unspecified type, 2.79% for mantle cell lymphoma, 2.6% for nasal and nasal-type T/NK cell lymphoma, 2.35% for angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, and 2.35% for precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, in decreasing order. The other subtypes comprised less than 2%, mainly precursor T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (1.72%), anaplastic large-cell lymphoma of T- and null-cell types (1.53%), and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (1.31%). The incidence of ATLL was influenced by its high percentage (19.20%) in the south-western Japanese island, Kyushu, an endemic area of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), but which appeared to be lower than that in a previous study. The nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity types of Hodgkin's disease occupied 1.78% and 1.63%, respectively.

Likewise, higher levels of virus-specific CTLs were also observed in transiently viraemic cats which recovered following exposure to FeLV. In cats that controlled their infection, recognition of Gag/Pro antigens was significantly higher than the recognition of Env antigens.

However, its non-leukaemic features remain unclear. We therefore investigated the morphological and immunophenotypic features of this lymphoma. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four cases with aggressive NK cell lymphoma were morphologically and immunohistochemically studied. All cases followed an aggressive course with death occurring within about 3 months of initial presentation. In these cases, the neoplastic cells disseminated throughout systemic lymph nodes and invaded various tissues and organs. The lymphoma cells were large cells showing nuclear irregularity and a pattern of sinusoidal invasion in lymph nodes. Apoptosis and coagulation necrosis were both frequently observed. Haemophagocytosis was observed in all cases. Neoplastic cells in paraffin-embedded tissue specimens from these patients had CD3(CD3epsilon)+ CD56(123C3)+ granzyme+ TIA-1+ EBERT+ CD43(MT1)- CD45RO(UCHL-1)- CD57(Leu7)- CD20(L26)- phenotypes. In the two cases where tissue was available for immunohistochemical study in frozen sections, neoplastic cells showed CD56(Leu19)+ perforin+ Fas ligand(FasL)+ CD2(Leu5b)- CD3(Leu4)- CD4(Leu3)- CD5(Leu1)- CD7(Leu9)- CD8(Leu2)- betaF1- TCRdelta1- phenotypes. CD16(Leu11b) was positive in one case. CONCLUSIONS: : Natural killer cell lymphomas appear to represent a non-leukaemic counterpart of aggressive natural killer cell leukaemia, a relationship similar to that in adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma.

Based on semiquantitative evaluations of the number of megakaryocytes and the content of fibres, various histological subtypes have been postulated. However, little information exists on whether these groups represent stable categories of the different classification systems and whether therapeutic regimes exert any influence on the putative shift of histological patterns. METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective clinicopathological study was performed on 396 bone marrow biopsies derived from 173 patients. There were at least two representative trephines taken at diagnosis and at median intervals of 16 months. Processing of the specimens involved immunostaining with CD61 (megakaryopoiesis) and Ret40f (erythropoiesis) and Gomori's silver impregnation technique. Based on morphometric analysis and in accordance with the general appearance of bone marrow histology three different histological subtypes were distinguished. These consisted of a granulocytic (51 patients), a predominantly megakaryocytic (73 patients) and a myelofibrotic pattern (49 patients). Follow-up biopsies revealed that a significant transition of histological groups occurred and that, independently of treatment modalities, the myelofibrotic category was associated with an unfavourable prognosis. Of the 124 patients without myelofibrosis at onset, 42% later transformed into the myelofibrotic subtype. However, these patients showed no prevalence of either a pre-existing granulocytic or megakaryocytic growth. Myelofibrotic changes were significantly associated with interferon (IFN) and busulfan (BU) therapy. On the other hand, a transition of a myelofibrotic into a nonfibrotic subtype was detectable in 17 of the 49 patients under study and related to hydroxyurea (HU) treatment.

CD95, a direct inducer of apoptosis, was present in the large and septal bile ducts, but rarely in the interlobular bile ducts.

METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective study of cases from the Royal London Hospital yielded a total of 31 secondary neoplasms involving the testis: 14 at postmortem examination and 17 surgical specimens. Nine cases were leukaemias: six acute lymphoblastic and two acute myeloid leukaemias in children, and one chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in an adult. The commonest primary sites of metastases to the testis were prostate (six cases), stomach (five cases) and lung (three cases). There were two malignant melanomas and isolated examples of metastases from the adrenal gland (neuroblastoma), cerebellum (medulloblastoma), soft tissue (alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma), pancreas and rectum. Of the metastases from solid tumours, 12 involved the right testis only, three involved the left and four were bilateral. In seven of these cases there were multiple testicular nodules, in seven there was a single mass, and in the rest there was diffuse involvement. Secondary neoplasms represented 4.6% of all testicular neoplasms at autopsy, and 1.6% in surgical specimens. There were five secondary penile neoplasms: two each from the pancreas and prostate and one from the bladder. Two neoplasms metastatic to the spermatic cord, both from a gastric primary, were included in the series. CONCLUSIONS: Secondary neoplasms of the testis occur with a frequency comparable to other sites in the genitourinary tract, and metastases to the spermatic cord, epididymis, and penis, are rare in comparison. Disseminated neoplasms rarely present initially at this site and are histologically distinctive in adults, but in children they must be distinguished from primary small round blue cell tumours.","['Dutt, N', 'Bates, A W', 'Baithun, S I']","['Dutt N', 'Bates AW', 'Baithun SI']","['Department of Histopathology and Morbid Anatomy, Institute of Pathology, The Royal London Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*secondary', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Genital Neoplasms, Male/*secondary', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Penile Neoplasms/secondary', 'Penis/pathology', 'Testicular Neoplasms/secondary', 'Testis/pathology']",,2000/09/30 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/30 11:00'],"['2000/09/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/30 11:00 [entrez]']","['his983 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2559.2000.00983.x [doi]']",ppublish,Histopathology. 2000 Oct;37(4):323-31. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2559.2000.00983.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous observation of overexpression of the PML in hormone-sensitive normal tissues and malignant solid tumours, including the thyroid, led to this analysis of the PML expression in various thyroid neoplasms to characterize the importance of the PML in thyroid carcinogenesis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 106 thyroid neoplasms after antigen retrieval by microwave. Immunoblotting was done with fresh frozen tissues in a few tumours. The PML was strongly expressed in all papillary carcinomas in diffuse or ball-shaped patterns. In the follicular neoplasms, the PML expression was variable, but there was no significant difference between adenomas and carcinomas. In the medullary carcinomas, the PML expression was either not detectable or was lower than in non-neoplastic thyroids. Quantitatively different expression of the PML in various thyroid neoplasms was confirmed by immunoblotting. CONCLUSION: A significant difference of the PML expression according to the type of thyroid neoplasms suggests that the PML is important in papillary thyroid carcinomas, and furthermore, that PML expression may be used in differential diagnosis of thyroid neoplasms.","['Yu, E', 'Lee, K W', 'Lee, H J']","['Yu E', 'Lee KW', 'Lee HJ']","['Department of Pathology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Seoul, Korea. esyu@www.amc.seoul.kr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Adenoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Medullary/metabolism/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Papillary/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Thyroid Gland/chemistry/pathology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2000/09/30 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/30 11:00'],"['2000/09/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/30 11:00 [entrez]']","['his1004 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2559.2000.01004.x [doi]']",ppublish,Histopathology. 2000 Oct;37(4):302-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2559.2000.01004.x.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the therapeutic success of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) PR inhibitors, the proteinase (PR) of HTLV-1 is a potential target for chemotherapy. To facilitate the design of potent inhibitors, the subsite specificity of HTLV-1 PR was characterized and compared to that of HIV-1 PR. Two sets of substrates were used that contained single amino-acid substitutions in peptides representing naturally occurring cleavage sites in HIV-1 and HTLV-1. The original HIV-1 matrix/capsid cleavage site substrate and most of its substituted peptides were not hydrolyzed by the HTLV-1 enzyme, except for those with hydrophobic residues at the P4 and P2 positions. On the other hand, most of the peptides representing the HTLV-1 capsid/nucleocapsid cleavage site were substrates of both enzymes. A large difference in the specificity of HTLV-1 and HIV-1 proteinases was demonstrated by kinetic measurements, particularly with regard to the S4 and S2 subsites, whereas the S1 subsite appeared to be more conserved. A molecular model of the HTLV-1 PR in complex with this substrate was built, based on the crystal structure of the S9 mutant of Rous sarcoma virus PR, in order to understand the molecular basis of the enzyme specificity. Based on the kinetics of shortened analogs of the HTLV-1 substrate and on analysis of the modeled complex of HTLV-1 PR with substrate, the substrate binding site of the HTLV-1 PR appeared to be more extended than that of HIV-1 PR. Kinetic results also suggested that the cleavage site between the capsid and nucleocapsid protein of HTLV-1 is evolutionarily optimized for rapid hydrolysis.","['Tozser, J', 'Zahuczky, G', 'Bagossi, P', 'Louis, J M', 'Copeland, T D', 'Oroszlan, S', 'Harrison, R W', 'Weber, I T']","['Tozser J', 'Zahuczky G', 'Bagossi P', 'Louis JM', 'Copeland TD', 'Oroszlan S', 'Harrison RW', 'Weber IT']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Hungary. tozser@indi.biochem.dote.hu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/enzymology', 'HIV Protease/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Substrate Specificity']",,2000/09/30 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/30 11:00'],"['2000/09/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/30 11:00 [entrez]']","['ejb1714 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01714.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 2000 Oct;267(20):6287-95. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01714.x.,"['0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (HIV Protease)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (HTLV-1 protease)']",,,,"['R01 GM062920/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AI4380/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'TW01001/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Risk factors associated with delayed platelet engraftment after autologous HSCT included use of marrow rather than peripheral blood as the source of stem cells, being transplanted for acute myeloid leukemia rather than other diseases, positive patient serology for cytomegalovirus and the presence of infection post-transplant before engraftment. Risk factors associated with delayed platelet engraftment after allogeneic marrow transplantation included unrelated as opposed to related donor transplants, being transplanted for diseases other than chronic myelogenous leukemia, increased age, onset of acute graft-versus-host disease (AGVHD), male gender, the administration of methotrexate for GVHD prophylaxis and the presence of infection before engraftment. Delayed platelet recovery is associated with decreased survival after both autologous and allogeneic transplants. Management of delayed platelet recovery by transfusion of blood products requires significant medical resources and is of some risk to the patients. Further development of new strategies may safely reduce the need for blood products.

Studies in thrombocytopenic patients with myelodysplasia, aplastic anemia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, as well as selected platelet and stem cell donors, are also of interest. It is unclear, however, whether patients with impaired marrow function can benefit from further exogenous stimulation, and side effects must be very carefully monitored in studies with normal donors.","['Schiffer, C A']",['Schiffer CA'],"['Wayne State University School of Medicine, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['Humans', 'Thrombocytopenia/*drug therapy', 'Thrombopoietin/*therapeutic use']",,2000/09/30 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/30 11:00'],"['2000/09/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/30 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530160728 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1998;16 Suppl 2:249-53. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530160728.,['9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)'],,,32,,,,,,,,,

Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a newly characterized hematopoietic growth factor which regulates the production of multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells as well as platelets. To evaluate the possibility that an abnormality in TPO-mediated signal transduction might be involved in the pathogenesis of PV, we examined TPO-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation using platelets as a surrogate model system. Platelets were isolated from the blood of patients with PV as well as from patients with other chronic myeloproliferative disorders and control subjects. Impaired TPO-mediated platelet protein tyrosine phosphorylation was a consistent observation in patients with PV as well as those with idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF), in contrast to patients with essential thrombocytosis, chronic myelogenous leukemia, secondary erythrocytosis, iron deficiency anemia, hemochromatosis, or normal volunteers. Thrombin-mediated platelet protein tyrosine phosphorylation was intact in PV platelets as was expression of the appropriate tyrosine kinases and their cognate substrates. However, expression of the platelet TPO receptor, Mpl, as determined by immunoblotting, chemical crosslinking or flow cytometry was markedly reduced or absent in 34 of 34 PV patients and also in 13 of 14 IMF patients. Impaired TPO-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation in PV and IMF platelets was uniformly associated with markedly reduced or absent expression of Mpl. We conclude that reduced expression of Mpl is a phenotypic characteristic of platelets from patients with PV and IMF. The abnormality appears to distinguish PV from other forms of erythrocytosis and may be involved in the platelet function defect associated with PV.","['Moliterno, A R', 'Siebel, K E', 'Sun, A Y', 'Hankins, W D', 'Spivak, J L']","['Moliterno AR', 'Siebel KE', 'Sun AY', 'Hankins WD', 'Spivak JL']","['Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['Blood Platelets/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet Aggregation/drug effects/physiology', 'Polycythemia Vera/*blood/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/blood', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Radioligand Assay', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Thrombopoietin/*blood', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",,2000/09/30 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/30 11:00'],"['2000/09/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/30 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530160721 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1998;16 Suppl 2:185-92. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530160721.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",,,,['R01-HL58589/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

We additionally demonstrated here, in a series of patients suffering from malignant diseases, that the graft content in CD34+ 38- cells is individually a more sensitive indicator of the earliest, as well as the latest post-ABCT trilineage hematopoietic recovery than the colony-forming units-granulocyte-macrophage and even the total CD34+ cell content. This suggests that the CD34+ 38- cell population is itself subdivided into two more subsets, one being already lineage-committed and responsible for short-term engraftment, the other containing only very primitive hematopoietic cells responsible for sustained engraftment. Strong arguments favor the probability that these subsets correspond to HLA-DR+ and DR cells, respectively. We also defined an optimal threshold value of 0.05 x 10(6) CD34+ 38- cells/kg of the patient's body weight (b.w.) above which a rapid and sustained trilineage engraftment safely occurs. In fact, infusion of lower numbers of cells seems to have a more significant impact on long-term compared to short-term neutrophil recovery and on platelet kinetics engraftment. We additionally looked for the eventual influence on engraftment time of the type of disease, and of post-ABCT administration of hematopoietic growth factors (HGF). When the type of disease appeared to have no influence on the engraftment time, posttransplant HGF administration significantly reduced the time to trilineage engraftment in patients transplanted with < 0.05 x 10(6) CD34+ 38- cells, thus justifying it in case of reinfusion of low numbers of CD34+ 38- cells. On the other hand, the administration of HGF after infusion of more than 0.05 x 10(6) CD34+ 38- cells/kg b.w. did not hasten more, or only very little, the engraftment time, thus becoming not only unprofitable for the patients but costly as well.","['Henon, P', 'Sovalat, H', 'Bourderont, D', 'Ojeda-Uribe, M', 'Arkam, Y', 'Wunder, E', 'Raidot, J P', 'Husseini, F', 'Audhuy, B']","['Henon P', 'Sovalat H', 'Bourderont D', 'Ojeda-Uribe M', 'Arkam Y', 'Wunder E', 'Raidot JP', 'Husseini F', 'Audhuy B']","['Institut de Recherche en Hematologie et Transfusion, Hopitaux de Mulhouse, Colmar, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antigens, CD34/blood', 'Antigens, Differentiation/blood', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Lymphoma/blood/therapy', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/therapy', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/blood', 'Neoplasms/*blood/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,2000/09/30 11:00,2000/10/21 11:01,['2000/09/30 11:00'],"['2000/09/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/30 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530160814 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1998;16 Suppl 1:113-22. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530160814.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Such cell populations are routinely quantified using standard in vitro colony-forming cell (CFC) assays. The excessive production of leukemic CFC that is seen in most CML patients at diagnosis may be explained at least in part by their increased proliferative activity. An anomalous cycling behavior in vivo has also been found to extend to more primitive CML progenitor populations detectable as long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC). Although the molecular basis of these changes in CML progenitor regulation is not fully understood at the level of the primitive CFC compartment, a selective inability of CML progenitors to be inhibited by certain -C-C-type chemokines has been demonstrated. Failure of the CML stem cell compartment to expand in vivo at the same rate as later progenitor cell types may be explained by their unique additional possession of an intrinsically upregulated probability of differentiation. Such a mechanism would be consistent with the observed loss of LTC-IC activity by CML cells incubated in vitro under conditions that sustain or expand normal LTC-IC populations. Initial clinical studies undertaken at our center established the feasibility of exploiting the differential behavior of primitive normal and CML cells in vitro as a potential purging strategy for reducing the leukemic stem cell content of CML marrow autografts. The results of a larger, second trial now in progress on a group of unselected patients are encouraging. Future studies of nonobese diabetic/severe-combined immunodeficiency mice engrafted with CML cells should provide another useful preclinical model for evaluating treatments that may more effectively eradicate the neoplastic clone in vivo.","['Eaves, A C', 'Barnett, M J', 'Ponchio, L', 'Cashman, J D', 'Petzer, A L', 'Eaves, C J']","['Eaves AC', 'Barnett MJ', 'Ponchio L', 'Cashman JD', 'Petzer AL', 'Eaves CJ']","['Terry Fox Laboratory and Division of Hematology, British Columbia Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['Animals', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Reference Values', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,2000/09/30 11:00,2000/10/21 11:01,['2000/09/30 11:00'],"['2000/09/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2000/10/21 11:01 [medline]', '2000/09/30 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530160809 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 1998;16 Suppl 1:77-83; discussion 89. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530160809.,,,,26,,,,,,,,,

We show here that in insect cells the mammalian homolog of EXD, PBX1A, shows a similar dependence on the HTH homologs MEIS1, 2, and 3 and the MEIS-like protein PREP1. Paradoxically, removal of residues N-terminal to the PBX1A HD abolishes interactions with MEIS/PREP but allows nuclear accumulation of PBX1A. We use deletion mapping and fusion to green fluorescent protein to map two cooperative nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in the PBX HD. The results of DNA-binding assays and pull-down experiments are consistent with a model whereby the PBX N-terminus binds to the HD and masks the two NLSs. In support of the model, a mutation in the PBX HD that disrupts contact with the N-terminus leads to constitutive nuclear localization. The HD mutation also increases sensitivity to protease digestion, consistent with a change in conformation. We propose that MEIS family proteins induce a conformational change in PBX that unmasks the NLS, leading to nuclear localization and increased DNA-binding activity. Consistent with this, PBX1 is nuclear only where Meis1 is expressed in the mouse limb bud.","['Saleh, M', 'Huang, H', 'Green, N C', 'Featherstone, M S']","['Saleh M', 'Huang H', 'Green NC', 'Featherstone MS']","['McGill Cancer Centre, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, H3G 1Y6, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA Probes/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drosophila', 'Embryo, Mammalian/metabolism', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Luminescent Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Localization Signals', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",,2000/09/30 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/30 11:00'],"['2000/09/30 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/30 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/excr.2000.5010 [doi]', 'S0014-4827(00)95010-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2000 Oct 10;260(1):105-15. doi: 10.1006/excr.2000.5010.,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Pknox1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,

These studies were prompted by the observation that the energetics of vinca alkaloid-induced tubulin spiral polymers, or spiraling potential, is inversely related to their clinical dosage and are aimed at the long-term goal of developing the ability to predict the cytotoxic and antineoplastic properties of antimitotic drugs. We demonstrate here that vinca-induced tubulin-spiraling potential is significantly correlated with cytotoxicity against L1210 cells. This is consistent with the size of spirals formed being proportional to the relaxation time for polymer redistribution, the lifetime of cell retention, and effects on microtubule ends and dynamics. Spiraling potential also correlates with calculated but not measured partition coefficients. Surprisingly, spiraling potential does not correlate with the ability to inhibit microtubule formation with purified tubulin or microtubule protein. For the set of C-20' modified compounds studied, the largest inhibitory effects on spiraling potential and cytotoxicity are caused by multiple sites of halogen (-F, -Cl) substitution with the introduction of increased rigidity in the ring. This suggests the C-20' position interacts with a hydrogen bond acceptor or an electrophilic region on the protein that electrostatically disfavors halogen substitutions. These studies are discussed in terms of the cellular mode of action of antimitotic drugs, particularly the importance of microtubule dynamics during mitosis and the factors that regulate those dynamics.","['Lobert, S', 'Fahy, J', 'Hill, B T', 'Duflos, A', 'Etievant, C', 'Correia, J J']","['Lobert S', 'Fahy J', 'Hill BT', 'Duflos A', 'Etievant C', 'Correia JJ']","['School of Nursing and Department of Biochemistry, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, Mississippi 39216, USA. slobert@son.umsmed.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Dimerization', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Microtubules/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tubulin/*metabolism', 'Tubulin Modulators', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology', 'Vinblastine/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Vinca Alkaloids/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Vinorelbine']",,2000/09/29 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/29 11:00'],"['2000/09/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/29 11:00 [entrez]']","['bi001038r [pii]', '10.1021/bi001038r [doi]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 2000 Oct 3;39(39):12053-62. doi: 10.1021/bi001038r.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)', '5BF646324K (vinflunine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'Q6C979R91Y (Vinorelbine)']",,,,['NR04780/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Because of the correlation of hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification, the ability of extracellular inorganic phosphate levels to regulate human aortic smooth muscle cell (HSMC) culture mineralization in vitro was examined. HSMCs cultured in media containing normal physiological levels of inorganic phosphate (1.4 mmol/L) did not mineralize. In contrast, HSMCs cultured in media containing phosphate levels comparable to those seen in hyperphosphatemic individuals (>1.4 mmol/L) showed dose-dependent increases in mineral deposition. Mechanistic studies revealed that elevated phosphate treatment of HSMCs also enhanced the expression of the osteoblastic differentiation markers osteocalcin and Cbfa-1. The effects of elevated phosphate on HSMCs were mediated by a sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter (NPC), as indicated by the ability of the specific NPC inhibitor phosphonoformic acid, to dose dependently inhibit phosphate-induced calcium deposition as well as osteocalcin and Cbfa-1 gene expression. With the use of polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot analyses, the NPC in HSMCs was identified as Pit-1 (Glvr-1), a member of the novel type III NPCs. These data suggest that elevated phosphate may directly stimulate HSMCs to undergo phenotypic changes that predispose to calcification and offer a novel explanation of the phenomenon of vascular calcification under hyperphosphatemic conditions.

Primary cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were stimulated with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LIF sequentially activated Raf-1, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and p90(RSK). We used PD-98059 (a specific MEK inhibitor), AG-490 (a JAK2 inhibitor), and wortmannin (a PI3-K inhibitor) to confirm that this cascade was independent of the JAK/STAT and PI3-K/p70 S6 kinase (S6K) pathways. PD-98059, AG-490, and wortmannin suppressed the LIF-induced increase in [(3)H]phenylalanine uptake by 54.7, 21.5, and 25.6%, respectively, and inhibited the increase in cell area by 61.2, 42.8, and 39.2%, respectively. Reorganization of myofilaments was predominantly suppressed by AG-490. LIF-induced expression of c-fos, brain natriuretic peptide, and skeletal alpha-actin mRNA was markedly suppressed by PD-98059 and moderately suppressed by wortmannin and AG-490. Atrial natriuretic peptide was significantly suppressed by AG-490. These findings indicate that this pathway is critically involved in protein synthesis, induction of c-fos, brain natriuretic peptide, and skeletal alpha-actin expression and is partially involved in myofilament reorganization and atrial natriuretic peptide induction in gp130-mediated cardiac hypertrophy.","['Kodama, H', 'Fukuda, K', 'Pan, J', 'Sano, M', 'Takahashi, T', 'Kato, T', 'Makino, S', 'Manabe, T', 'Murata, M', 'Ogawa, S']","['Kodama H', 'Fukuda K', 'Pan J', 'Sano M', 'Takahashi T', 'Kato T', 'Makino S', 'Manabe T', 'Murata M', 'Ogawa S']","['Cardiopulmonary Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Where's the evidence?,R139-54,"Twenty years ago concerns were raised that exposure to power frequency (or extremely low frequency (ELF)) electromagnetic fields (EMFs) may be associated with an increased risk of cancer or other health hazards. Subsequently no associations have been shown between laboratory magnetic field exposures and carcinogenesis in either animal or cellular models. Indeed, studies have demonstrated that magnetic fields are not associated with cancer. However, the puzzle remains that the results of some epidemiological studies may be interpreted as suggesting that living close to high-voltage transmission (HVT) lines appears to increase slightly the risk of childhood leukaemia. Alternatively, these results could result from small biases and errors in individual studies, which might not necessarily be the same in each study. The nature of the epidemiological studies (power-line, wire code, magnetic field or appliance based) appears to determine whether and how the EMFs associated with HVT lines might be a risk factor. It is possible that a simple association with either magnetic or electric field exposure may not be the whole answer, and an alternative mechanism is always a possibility. Although the interpretation of the available evidence by most expert bodies has led them to conclude that exposure to power frequency electric and magnetic fields is not a human health hazard, a working group under the auspices of the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) concluded that there was a possible low risk associated with certain exposures to ELF magnetic fields. NIEHS itself interpreted the finding as insufficient to warrant aggressive regulatory concern but stated that, because virtually everyone is routinely exposed to ELF EMFs, passive regulatory action is warranted, such as a continued emphasis on educating both the public and the regulated community on means aimed at reducing exposures. These analyses, conclusions and advice are not contradicted by subsequent studies, and therefore the conclusion of the World Health Organisation that further research is needed seems valid.","['Preece, A W', 'Hand, J W', 'Clarke, R N', 'Stewart, A']","['Preece AW', 'Hand JW', 'Clarke RN', 'Stewart A']","['Bristol Oncology Centre, University of Bristol, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Phys Med Biol,Physics in medicine and biology,0401220,IM,"['*Electromagnetic Fields/adverse effects', '*Health', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",,2000/09/29 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/29 11:00'],"['2000/09/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/29 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1088/0031-9155/45/9/201 [doi]'],ppublish,Phys Med Biol. 2000 Sep;45(9):R139-54. doi: 10.1088/0031-9155/45/9/201.,,,,65,,,,,,,,,

Age, sex, peripheral lymphoctes, hemoglobin, platelet count, Binet's stage, total tumor mass (TTM) and AgNOR pattern at diagnosis were assessed in 57 patients and compared with the time from diagnosis until patients fulfilled the criteria to start chemotherapy. In univariate Cox regression, Binet's stage, hemoglobin, number of peripheral lymphocytes, TTM and the percentage of lymphocytes containing one AgNOR cluster (circulating proliferative fraction) had predictive value. In the multivariate Cox model, only TTM and the percentage of cells with one AgNOR cluster were independent factors predicting the duration of the stable phase. Repetition of these analyses in 500 data sets created by bootstrap resampling confirmed the results. Summing up the percentage of lymphocytes with an AgNOR cluster and the TTM value, a simple prognostic index could be created to give information about the duration of the stable phase in CLL.","['Metze, K', 'Lobo, A M', 'Lorand-Metze, I']","['Metze K', 'Lobo AM', 'Lorand-Metze I']","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, State University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Nucleolus Organizer Region/*ultrastructure', 'Prognosis']",,2000/09/29 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/29 11:00'],"['2000/09/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/29 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0215(20000920)89:5<440::AID-IJC7>3.0.CO;2-U [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0215(20000920)89:5<440::aid-ijc7>3.0.co;2-u [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2000 Sep 20;89(5):440-3. doi: 10.1002/1097-0215(20000920)89:5<440::aid-ijc7>3.0.co;2-u.,,,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

During the 3.5 years' follow-up, HTLV-1 skin disease progressed to cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. When infection was passed to several naive rabbits, progressive paraparesis due to myelopathic neurodegeneration, analogous to HTLV-associated myelopathy, resulted in one of 4 transfusion recipients. Similar proviral loads were detected in the two diseases, regardless of stage of progression or tissue compartment of infection. Complete proviral sequences obtained from the donor and affected recipient aligned identically with each other and with the inoculated virus clone. Existence of disparate pathogenic outcomes following infectious transmission further extends the analogy of using rabbits to model human infection and disease. Although the experimental outcomes shown are limited by numbers of animals affected, they mimic the infrequency of HTLV-1 disease and authenticate epidemiological evidence of virus sequence stability regardless of disease phenotype. The findings suggest that further investigation of a possible role for HTLV-1 in some forms of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is warranted.","['Kindt, T J', 'Said, W A', 'Bowers, F S', 'Mahana, W', 'Zhao, T M', 'Simpson, R M']","['Kindt TJ', 'Said WA', 'Bowers FS', 'Mahana W', 'Zhao TM', 'Simpson RM']","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, NIH Twinbrook Facility, Rockville, MD 20852, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Microbes Infect,Microbes and infection,100883508,IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications/pathology/virology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology/*virology', 'Paraparesis/virology', 'Rabbits', 'Skin Neoplasms/pathology/*virology', 'Spinal Cord Diseases/pathology/*virology', 'Viral Load', 'Virus Integration']",,2000/09/29 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/29 11:00'],"['2000/09/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/29 11:00 [entrez]']","['S1286-4579(00)01268-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s1286-4579(00)01268-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Microbes Infect. 2000 Aug;2(10):1139-46. doi: 10.1016/s1286-4579(00)01268-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have demonstrated previously that nonmyeloablative conditioning for primary allogeneic transplants from both sibling and unrelated donors results in minimal transplant-related toxicity and excellent stem cell engraftment. This study explores the possibility of using nonmyeloablative conditioning to minimize transplant-related toxicity in patients who have undergone second allogeneic transplants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve high-risk, heavily treated patients-five with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML); five with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL); one with Burkitt's lymphoma, and one with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-underwent second allogeneic nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST) from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donors, 29 (median) (range 3-57) months following their first transplantation procedure. The conditioning consisted of fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) daily for 6 days, busulfan 4 mg/kg daily for 2 days, and anti-T-lymphocyte globulin 10 mg/kg daily for 4 days. Anti-graft-vs-host disease (anti-GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine A alone, 3 mg/kg. RESULTS: Engraftment was observed in all recipients, with complete and stable chimerism. None of the patients developed veno-occlusive disease of the liver or multi-organ failure. Five very high-risk patients with NHL (n = 3), Burkitt's lymphoma (n = 1), and AML (n = 1) relapsed 2 to 6 months post-transplant, and four of them died. Six patients appear to be disease-free after median follow-up of 23 months. One additional patient died from grade IV hemorrhagic cystitis. Actuarial survival and disease-free survival at 34 months are 56% and 50% respectively, with 95% confidence interval (25-78%). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that nonmyeloablative conditioning significantly reduces transplant-related toxicity, thus making a second transplant feasible.","['Nagler, A', 'Or, R', 'Naparstek, E', 'Varadi, G', 'Slavin, S']","['Nagler A', 'Or R', 'Naparstek E', 'Varadi G', 'Slavin S']","['The Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation & The Cancer Immunotherapy & Immunobiology Research Center, Hadassah University Hospital, The Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Medicine, Jerusalem, Israel.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The protein was purified to homogeneity from acute myeloid leukemia cells and was subjected to peptide digestion and amino acid sequencing. Identified sequences were used to screen a bone marrow cDNA library in search of matching transcripts. The protein was further studied in different cells and tissues by examination of protease inhibitors and harsh lytic conditions and during apoptosis in HL-60 cells. RESULTS: We found that the apparent bone marrow specific protein is a 47 kD proteolytic cleavage product of PSF, an essential pre-mRNA splicing factor. PSF is completely cleaved to p47 during lysis of immature myeloid cells due to potent proteolytic activity found in these cells but is rare in other cells and tissues. Furthermore, p47 is abundant in intact normal and tumor myeloid cells while in other cell types it is undetectable. The cleavage of PSF is accompanied by digestion of the PTB splicing regulator but not other proteins tested. In contrast, during apoptosis PTB is degraded while PSF remains intact. CONCLUSIONS: The bone marrow 47 kD protein is a fragment constituting the N-terminal, protease-resistant half of the splicing factor PSF. Proteolytic degradation of PSF specifically occurs in intact myeloid cells and this process is enhanced upon myeloid cell lysis.","['Shav-Tal, Y', 'Lee, B', 'Bar-Haim, S', 'Vandekerckhove, J', 'Zipori, D']","['Shav-Tal Y', 'Lee B', 'Bar-Haim S', 'Vandekerckhove J', 'Zipori D']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cells/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'PTB-Associated Splicing Factor', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleoproteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2000/09/29 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/29 11:00'],"['2000/09/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/29 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X00005105 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00510-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 Sep;28(9):1029-38. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00510-5.,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PTB-Associated Splicing Factor)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '139076-35-0 (Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, we set out to find differences in the modes of proliferative and apoptotic responses to TNF- alpha. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We screened a panel of acute myeloid leukemia-derived cell lines for TNF- alpha-responsiveness. In two lines (OCI-AML-1, OCI-AML-11), TNF- alpha acted as an apoptotic agent; in others (HU-3, M-07e, TF-1), it had the opposite effect, preventing apoptosis and inducing proliferation. Direct and indirect signaling mechanisms, including NF-kappaB activation and cytokine synthesis, were analyzed. RESULTS: All cell lines tested expressed TNF- alpha receptors I and II and responded to TNF- alpha by upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1. In contrast to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), TNF- alpha did not activate the MAP kinase and p70S6 kinase pathways. Nevertheless, inhibitors of these pathways clearly reduced the TNF-alpha-induced cell growth, indicating that TNF- alpha-proliferative cells produced a growth factor that induced proliferation upon stimulation of the above pathways. Anti-GM-CSF antibodies inhibited the TNF-alpha-induced growth, suggesting the presence of an autocrine loop for cell proliferation mediated by GM-CSF. Supporting this notion, TNF-alpha-induced upregulation of GM-CSF mRNA levels and protein secretion in the TNF-alpha-proliferative, but not in the TNF-alpha-apoptotic cell lines. CONCLUSION: These data identify GM-CSF synthesis as an early and essential step in TNF- alpha-induced proliferation. We show for the first time that TNF-alpha-treated cell lines producing no or only minimal amounts of GM-CSF demonstrate an apoptotic phenotype, while cell lines with high GM-CSF expression rates can escape from growth arrest or even apoptosis. In this context, we discuss arguments pointing at NF-kappaB as regulator of GM-CSF synthesis and thus indirectly as regulator for the escape of TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis.","['Quentmeier, H', 'Dirks, W G', 'Fleckenstein, D', 'Zaborski, M', 'Drexler, H G']","['Quentmeier H', 'Dirks WG', 'Fleckenstein D', 'Zaborski M', 'Drexler HG']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany. hqu@dsmz.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/drug effects/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cells/drug effects', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Up-Regulation']",,2000/09/29 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/29 11:00'],"['2000/09/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/29 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(00)00516-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00516-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 Sep;28(9):1008-15. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00516-6.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",,,,,,,,,,,['Exp Hematol 2000 Dec;28(12):1490'],

In the development of combinations, several aspects are often overlooked: (1) possible metabolic and biological interactions between drugs, (2) scheduling, and (3) different pharmacokinetic profiles. Antimetabolites are used widely in chemotherapy combinations for treatment of various leukemias and solid tumors. Ideally, the combination of two or more agents should be more effective than each agent separately (synergism), although additive and even antagonistic combinations may result in a higher therapeutic efficacy in the clinic. The median-drug effect analysis method is one of the most widely used methods for in vitro evaluation of combinations. Several examples of classical effective antimetabolite-(anti)metabolite combinations are discussed, such as that of methotrexate with 6-mercaptopurine or leucovorin in (childhood) leukemia and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) with leucovorin in colon cancer. More recent combinations include treatment of acute-myeloid leukemia with fludarabine and arabinosylcytosine. Other combinations, currently frequently used in the treatment of solid malignancies, include an antimetabolite with a DNA-damaging agent, such as gemcitabine with cisplatin and 5FU with the cisplatin analog oxaliplatin. The combination of 5FU and the topoisomerase inhibitor irinotecan is based on decreased repair of irinotecan-induced DNA damage. These combinations may increase induction of apoptosis. The latter combinations have dramatically changed the treatment of incurable cancers, such as lung and colon cancer, and have demonstrated that rationally designed drug combinations offer new possibilities to treat solid malignancies.","['Peters, G J', 'van der Wilt, C L', 'van Moorsel, C J', 'Kroep, J R', 'Bergman, A M', 'Ackland, S P']","['Peters GJ', 'van der Wilt CL', 'van Moorsel CJ', 'Kroep JR', 'Bergman AM', 'Ackland SP']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital Vrije Universiteit, P.O.

Even though POD function remains elusive, the integrity, topology, and molecular composition of these nuclear compartments have been associated with certain human diseases, including cancer, autoimmunity, neurodegenerative disorders, and viral propagation. At the molecular level, PML protein has been shown to be a coactivator of nuclear hormone receptors, whereas its oncogenic counterpart PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha, which promotes POD disaggregation, has been found to activate activator protein-1 transcription in a retinoic acid-dependent manner. Recently, we demonstrated that the CREB-binding protein (CBP) associates with PML protein in vitro and is recruited to the PODs in vivo in a signal-dependent manner. In exploring the consequence of this association, we proposed that POD nuclear bodies are regulatory cellular domains where proteins such as the CBP and CBP-interacting molecules may be activated or inactivated to coordinate signal-activated cellular response. This paper discusses the association of PML nuclear bodies with transcription control and underscores the pharmacological aspects of such an observation.","['Doucas, V']",['Doucas V'],"['Department of Genetics and Microbiology, University of Geneve Medical School, CH-1211 4 Geneva, Switzerland. doucas7@etu.unige.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Compartmentation/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Signal Transduction', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,2000/09/29 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/29 11:00'],"['2000/09/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/29 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(00)00413-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00413-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2000 Oct 15;60(8):1197-201. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00413-5.,['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)'],,,41,,,,,,,,,

The growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) adaptor when complexed with Sos (Son of sevenless), the exchange factor of Ras, conveys the signal induced by tyrosine kinase-activated receptor to Ras by recruiting Sos to the membrane, allowing activation of Ras. This review shows how it is possible to stop the Ras-deregulated signaling pathway to obtain potential antitumor agents. Grb2 protein is comprised of one SH2 surrounded by two SH3 domains and interacts by means of its Src homology (SH2) domain with phosphotyrosine residues of target proteins such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor or the Shc adaptor. By means of its SH3 domains, Grb2 recognizes proline-rich sequences of Sos, leading to Ras activation. Inhibitors of SH2 and SH3 domains were designed with the aim of interrupting Grb2 recognition. On the one hand, using structural data and molecular modeling, peptide dimers or ""peptidimers"", made up of two proline-rich sequences from Sos linked by an optimized spacer, were developed. On the other, using the structure of the Grb2 SH2 domain complexed with a phosphotyrosine (pTyr)-containing peptide and molecular modeling studies, a series of N-protected tripeptides containing two phosphotyrosine or mimetic residues, with one pTyr sterically constrained, were devised. These compounds show very high affinities for Grb2 in vitro. They have been targeted into cells showing selective antiproliferative activity on tumor cells. These results suggest that inhibiting SH2 or SH3 domains of signaling proteins might provide antitumor agents.","['Garbay, C', 'Liu, W Q', 'Vidal, M', 'Roques, B P']","['Garbay C', 'Liu WQ', 'Vidal M', 'Roques BP']","['Departement de Pharmacochimie Moleculaire et Structurale, U266 INSERM, UMR 8600 CNRS, UFR des Sciences Pharmaceutiques et Biologiques, 75270 Paris Cedex 06, France.

Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B)-dependent gene expression and apoptosis play crucial roles in numerous cellular processes, and defects in their regulation may contribute to a variety of diseases including inflammation and cancer. Although there has recently been tremendous progress in our understanding of the signaling pathways that lead to NF-kappa B activation and apoptosis, signaling mechanisms that negatively regulate these processes are only partially understood. This review deals with the zinc finger protein A20, which has been characterized as a dual inhibitor of NF-kappa B activation and apoptosis. Its inducible expression by a wide variety of stimuli, including cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and CD40, as well as bacterial and viral products such as lipopolysaccharide, Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1, and human T-cell leukemia virus type I Tax, suggests that it is involved in the negative feedback regulation of signaling. We will discuss the possible underlying mechanisms, placing emphasis on the role of several A20-binding proteins that have recently been described. Moreover, evidence is presented that A20 and A20-binding proteins are potential novel therapeutic tools in the treatment of a variety of diseases.","['Beyaert, R', 'Heyninck, K', 'Van Huffel, S']","['Beyaert R', 'Heyninck K', 'Van Huffel S']","['Unit of Molecular Signal Transduction in Inflammation, Department of Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium. rudi@dmb.rug.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['14-3-3 Proteins', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/metabolism/physiology']",,2000/09/29 11:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/09/29 11:00'],"['2000/09/29 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/09/29 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(00)00404-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00404-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2000 Oct 15;60(8):1143-51. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00404-4.,"['0 (14-3-3 Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1)', 'EC 1.14.16.2 (Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (TNFAIP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3)']",,,77,,,,,,,,,

Stem cell factor (SCF) stimulates proliferation of UT-7/Epo only transiently, for three to five days. An investigation of the signal transduction pathways activated by these cytokines in UT-7/Epo cells may identify those signals specifically required for sustained growth. Proliferation assays demonstrate that SCF generates a substantial growth response in UT-7/Epo cells; however, the cells do not multiply or survive past five to seven days. While Epo induces the activation of JAK2 and STAT5, SCF stimulation shows no activation of JAK2 or STATs 1, 3, or 5. The activation of MAPK (p42/44) by SCF was transient, lasting only 30 min, in contrast to Epo, which stimulated phosphorylation of p42/44 for up to 2 h. The expression of the early response genes c-fos, egr1, and cytokine-inducible SH2 protein (CIS) in response to SCF or Epo stimulation demonstrated that the transient expression of p42/44 correlated with the transient expression of c-fos and egr1. In addition, CIS was activated by Epo but not SCF. These data indicate that EpoR, JAK2, and STAT5 activation are not required for the initiation of proliferation of these erythroid cells, that the transient activation of p42/44 correlates with the transient gene expression of c-fos and egr1, and sustained expression of c-fos and egr1 as seen in UT-7/Epo cells continuously grown in Epo may be necessary for long-term proliferation.","['Erickson-Miller, C L', 'Pelus, L M', 'Lord, K A']","['Erickson-Miller CL', 'Pelus LM', 'Lord KA']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Host Defense, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA.
