Although 83%, 87%, 88%, and 96% of the blasts from these patients reacted with T-11, only one patient demonstrated a small percentage of heat-stable E rosettes (5%). Antibody 9.6, which also reacts with the E rosette-associated antigen, was tested on blasts from two of the T-11-positive patients and was also strongly reactive (96% and 98%). Dual staining of blasts from these two patients demonstrated a small number of cells that simultaneously expressed the E rosette-associated antigen and myeloid-associated cytochemistries (myeloperoxidase [MPO] and Sudan black B). Additionally, leukemic blasts were identified that simultaneously expressed the E rosette-associated antigen and contained Auer rods. Antibody OKT-11 immunoprecipitated a 48,100-dalton glycoprotein from these leukemic blasts that is similar in molecular weight to that previously determined for the T cell surface protein (Tp50), thus providing strong evidence that this molecule can be found in some cases of AML. Because cells simultaneously expressing both the E rosette-associated antigen and MPO were identified, it would appear likely that leukemic blasts with only the E rosette-associated antigen or only MPO arose from the same progenitor. Our findings further demonstrate that the epitopes identified by antibodies OKT-11, T-11, and 9.6 are not always associated with, or sufficient for, 37 degrees C E rosette formation and can be found on blasts from patients with AML.","['Mirro, J', 'Antoun, G R', 'Zipf, T F', 'Melvin, S', 'Stass, S']","['Mirro J', 'Antoun GR', 'Zipf TF', 'Melvin S', 'Stass S']",['eng'],"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05584014/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenotype', '*Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83681-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 Feb;65(2):363-7.,,,,,,,,

Several immunologic parameters (number of total and T circulating lymphocytes and their surface membrane immunoglobulin [Smlg] phenotypes and levels of serum Ig) were evaluated with the aim of identifying a biologic marker of prognostic relevance. In this series of persons, Binet staging confirmed its usefulness as a prognostic index (P less than .001). With regard to Smlg, they were mu-type in 41 cases (53.9%), mu-type plus delta-type in 29 cases (38.2%), alpha-type in one case, and not detectable in five cases. No correlations were found between clinical stage and immunoglobulin phenotype, although all but one patient in stage C showed mu-type Smlg alone. On analyzing the survival curves of our patients according to different Smlg phenotypes, we found that patients with only mu-type Smlg had a poorer prognosis (P less than .05) than those with mu-type plus delta-type; this difference was even more significant (P less than .01) in patients in stage A, whereas there were no statistical differences in those in stages B and C. Because the appearance of surface heavy chain of delta-type could be an expression of cell maturation, these results suggest that in B-CLL the presence of phenotypically more mature leukemic cells may correlate with better clinical prognosis, particularly in the early phase of the disease.","['Baldini, L', 'Mozzana, R', 'Cortelezzi, A', 'Neri, A', 'Radaelli, F', 'Cesana, B', 'Maiolo, A T', 'Polli, E E']","['Baldini L', 'Mozzana R', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Neri A', 'Radaelli F', 'Cesana B', 'Maiolo AT', 'Polli EE']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/analysis', 'Immunoglobulins/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83677-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 Feb;65(2):340-4.,,,,,,,,

Several but not all of the cell lines tested were IL-2 receptor positive. The cells constitutively expressing IL-2 receptors at their surface could not be stimulated to secrete IL-2. Cell producing and secreting IL-2 did not express detectable amounts of IL-2 receptors at their surface. It has been demonstrated that proliferation of the leukaemic cells was independent of exogenous IL-2. The monoclonal anti-IL-2 receptor antibody AMT-13 inhibited IL-2 dependent proliferation of activated normal T-lymphocytes but failed to inhibit the growth of IL-2 receptor expressing leukaemic cells.

L22 was expressed on a minor subpopulation of B cells in human lymphoid tissues and in the peripheral blood. These B cells associated with L22 were resting small B cells mainly located in the mantle zone of lymphoid follicles, most of which also expressed IgM and IgD on their cell membrane. This antigen was absent from all cultured hemopoietic cell lines including B cell-derived cell lines as well as from all human B cell malignancies, except for B cell-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia and hairy cell leukemia. L23 and L24, on the other hand, existed on approximately two-third of B cells in blood and lymphoid tissues. These L23 and L24 antigens were expressed largely on small lymphocytes located in the mantle zone of lymphoid follicles and to a lesser extent on large blastic cells within lymphoid germinal centers. L23 and L24, like L22, seem to disappear from B cells during their differentiation into antibody-secreting cells, because they were not expressed on normal and neo-plastic plasma cells. This is additionally confirmed by the observation that L23 and L24 were expressed little or not at all on pokeweed mitogen-activated and Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells, and were absent from some of B cell malignancies that have been thought to correspond to the later stages of B cell development. Although L23, but not L22 and L24, was faintly expressed on mature granulocytes and monocytes, none of L22, L23, or L24 existed on human thymus and T cells. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that L23 and L24 were different molecular species consisting of a single glycoprotein with m.w. of 205,000 and 145,000, respectively.

Deficiency of medium isoleucine in the presence of serine rapidly decreased protein synthesis and insulin binding to intact cells. Supplementation of deficient media with serine or isoleucine had no effect on total insulin receptor numbers measured in solubilized cell preparations. Increased insulin binding following serine exposure was seen with binding assays at both 4 and 37 degrees C. Dissociation experiments to quantitate intracellular ligand after 37 degrees C binding assays showed increased in both surface binding and intracellular [125I]insulin accumulation.

Ultrastructurally and cytochemically, approximately 30% of the cells possessed myeloid features. The cells were strongly positive for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. They were HLA-DR positive and expressed surface antigens characteristic for B lineage cells, including those detected by anti-B4, BA-1, BA-2, and PI153/3. Immunoglobulin gene analysis revealed rearrangements of the heavy chain and kappa chain genes. The cells lacked the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen and antigenic markers characteristic of T lineage cells. The cells reacted with the myeloid antibody 1G10 but not with other myeloid monoclonal antibodies. Treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate induced a monocyte-like phenotype demonstrated by cytochemical, functional, immunologic, and electron microscopic studies.

A cloned hybridoma line (KSH.4.13.6) that was specifically cytolytic in the presence of activated rat spleen cell supernatant fluid (rat Con A SN) lost activity when transferred to normal medium. However, a cytolytic activity could be reinduced by culturing KSH.4.13.6 cells in medium containing rat Con A SN or secondary mixed leukocyte culture SN. By using various sources of SN, it was found that cytolytic induction required two different factors. PMA-induced EL-4 SN and SN from antigen-activated cloned T cells, neither of which were capable of inducing cytolytic activity alone, were able to synergize in the cytolytic induction of KSH.4.13.6 IFN-gamma and IL 1 failed to induce cytolytic activity even in the presence of EL-4 SN. Furthermore, this hybridoma produced macrophage activating factor (MAF) upon culture in rat Con A SN, although MAF production could not be induced by either specific antigen or lectins. The kinetics of induction and loss of cytolytic activity mediated by rat Con A SN were similar to those of the induction of MAF production. However, EL-4 SN, which by itself was incapable of inducing cytolytic activity, was able to induce MAF production in the KSH.4.13.6 hybrid to an extent similar to that induced by rat Con A SN. These results suggest that the induction of cytolytic activity and of MAF production in this cloned hybridoma cell line are regulated by different mechanisms. Such a functionally inducible T cell hybrid may provide a tool for biochemical and molecular analysis of T cell function and regulation, and of the characterization of cytokines required for CTL differentiation.","['Kanagawa, O', 'Chiller, J M']","['Kanagawa O', 'Chiller JM']",['eng'],['AI-19066/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Macrophage-Activating Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Hybridomas/*immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/immunology', 'Lymphokines/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Macrophage-Activating Factors', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymoma/immunology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/immunology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Jan;134(1):397-403.,,,,,,,,

When primary rat hepatocytes were incubated with tritium labeled MoDNM and CNMoDNM and their DNA was purified and enzymatically hydrolized, the formation of DNA-adducts could be demonstrated by the HPLC chromatography of the resulting mononucleoside mixtures. The parent compound, daunomycin (DNM), also formed covalent adducts with hepatocyte DNA, but to a lesser extent. These findings correlate well with earlier observations that MoDNM and CNMoDNM are potent inducers of DNA-repair in primary rat hepatocytes, whereas DNM is only weakly active in this regard. Alkaline elution studies were performed with L 1210 mouse leukemia cells and V79 Chinese hamster fibroblasts. The cyanomorpholinyl derivatives showed dose-dependent DNA crosslinking activities in both cell lines at concentrations greater than or equal to 5 nMol/l. The formation of crosslinks began a few minutes after treatment of the cells and reached a maximum after 1 hr. In contrast, MoDNM, at concentrations of up to 10 muMol/l, had only a limited capacity to induce single strand breaks in L 1210 cells but did not induce DNA-crosslinks. In addition, chromosomal aberrations (chromatid breaks and translocations) were induced by the treatment of Friend and L 1210 leukemia cells with CNMoADM at concentrations between 0.07-0.6 nMol/l. At higher doses, chromosome clumping was observed. These results indicate that the high capacity of MoDNM, CNMoDNM and CNMoADM to induce DNA repair in primary rat hepatocytes is due to the formation of covalent adducts with DNA. The cyanomorpholino compounds have alkylating capacities also in cell lines such as L 1210 and V79, whereas MoDNM requires rat hepatocytes for activation. The ready formation of DNA crosslinks and chromosomal aberrations could be responsible for the high cytotoxicity of these compounds.","['Westendorf, J', 'Groth, G', 'Steinheider, G', 'Marquardt, H']","['Westendorf J', 'Groth G', 'Steinheider G', 'Marquardt H']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Biol Toxicol,Cell biology and toxicology,8506639,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', ""79867-78-0 (3'-(4-morpholinyl)-3'-deaminodaunorubicin)"", '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', ""88254-07-3 (3'-deamino-3'-(3-cyano-4-morpholinyl)doxorubicin)"", '89164-74-9 (cyanomorpholinodaunomycin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA/*drug effects', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Liver/drug effects', 'Rats']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00717794 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biol Toxicol. 1985 Jan;1(2):87-101. doi: 10.1007/BF00717794.,,,"['Department of Toxicology, Medical School, University of Hamburg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",,,,,

Desacetylduclauxin significantly inhibited the state 3 respiration without causing uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria.

What is probable is the cooperation of a number of antigen-independent, relatively weakly cytotoxic or possibly only cytostatic humoral and cellular effects, including nutritional immunity, tumor necrosis factor, certain cytokines, and the cytotoxic effects mediated by macrophages, NK cells, NK-like cells, and certain stimulated T-cells. One question remaining to be solved is why these antigen-independent effects do not attack normal cells. A number of plausible hypotheses are discussed. The hypothetical surveillance system is modulated both by traditional cancer treatment and by attempts at immunomodulation. Radiotherapy reduced the T-helper cell function for almost a decade, but not those of macrophages or NK cells. T-cell changes have no prognostic implication, supporting, perhaps, the suggestion of a major role for macrophages and NK cells. Cyclic adjuvant chemotherapy reduces the peripheral lymphocyte population and several lymphocyte functions but not NK activity. Most of the parameters were normalized some years following treatment, but NK activity remained elevated and Th/Ts cell ratio was still decreased. This might possibly be taken to support the surveillance role of NK cells. Bestatin increases the frequency of lymphocytes forming rosettes with sheep red blood cells (but not their mitogenic responses), enhances NK activity, and augments the phagocytic capacity of granulocytes and monocytes (but not their cytotoxic activity). Improved survival with Bestatin treatment following chemotherapy has been observed in patients with melanoma Stages 1b and II and in patients with acute nonlymphatic leukemia, where BCG also seems active, although possibly only in patient groups with less than 49% complete remissions.","['Reizenstein, P', 'Ogier, C', 'Blomgren, H', 'Petrini, B', 'Wasserman, J']","['Reizenstein P', 'Ogier C', 'Blomgren H', 'Petrini B', 'Wasserman J']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Adv Immun Cancer Ther,Advances in immunity and cancer therapy,8601071,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Cellular/drug effects/radiation effects', '*Immunologic Surveillance/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4612-5068-5_1 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Immun Cancer Ther. 1985;1:1-28. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4612-5068-5_1.,,,,154,,,,

Multi-CSF has an extremely broad haemopoietic specificity, GM-CSF stimulates all granulocyte and macrophage progenitor cells and G-CSF and M-CSF have actions essentially restricted to the granulocyte or macrophage cell lineages, respectively. They are each, however, required for cell survival, proliferation, differentiation and mature cell activation within the cell lineages they act on. They each exert their actions through specific high-affinity cell surface receptors which show no direct cross reactivity with each other and which are structurally distinct. However, at physiological temperatures the CSF's show a specific pattern of receptor co-down-modulation which might reflect their cell lineage specificities. A major defect in myeloid leukaemias is a block to differentiation so that cell divisions result in self-renewal of the leukaemic stem cells rather than terminal differentiation to non-dividing cells. In murine models such a defect does not result in malignancy until it is accompanied by autonomy from external CSF growth control but in human myeloid leukaemias there is no evidence for autonomy from CSF growth control and CSF's may play a permissive role in the emergence of myeloid leukaemias. The possibility of using CSF's to override the differentiation block in leukaemias and cause suppression of leukaemic growth by differentiation induction has been examined for the action of G-CSF on murine leukaemic WEHI-3B D+ cells. G-CSF induces differentiation in these cells, strongly suppresses cell divisions leading to self-renewal and increases the survival time of mice injected with treated cells. The possible importance of this factor in cell differentiation is indicated by the loss of G-CSF receptors in a differentiation-defective mutant of WEHI-3B, the conservation of G-CSF and its receptor from mouse to man and the observation that all primary human myeloid leukaemias exhibit specific receptors for this factor.","['Nicola, N A', 'Metcalf, D']","['Nicola NA', 'Metcalf D']",['eng'],"['CA-22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Surv,Cancer surveys,8218015,['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*physiology', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*physiopathology', 'Macrophages/cytology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Surv. 1985;4(4):789-815.,,,"['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",106,,,,

Part of the problem may be technical, but difficulties also ensue because benign reactive lymphoid hyperplasias may coexist with extranodal lymphomas, and because extranodal lymphomas may be focal, exhibit cellular polymorphism, and be cytologically mature. Awareness of the histologic exceptions, combined with prudent application of the conventional criteria, should improve the accuracy of diagnosis of extranodal lymphocytic infiltrates.","['Burke, J S']",['Burke JS'],['eng'],"['CA-09308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-18044/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Semin Diagn Pathol,Seminars in diagnostic pathology,8502262,,IM,"['Biopsy', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia/diagnosis/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/pathology']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Semin Diagn Pathol. 1985 Aug;2(3):152-62.,,,,32,,,,

In part, this has been due to the failure to recognize the existence of primary, extranodal, well-differentiated, small lymphocytic (WDL) lymphoma unassociated with systemic lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the presence of pseudofollicular proliferation centers within WDL lymphoma, and the existence of intermediate differentiated and mantle zone lymphomas that contain residual, atrophic, benign-appearing germinal centers. More recently, the determination of the mono- or polyclonality of extranodal lymphoid infiltrates has given us a new perspective on these lesions.

Most patients have generalized lymphadenopathy, and about 40 per cent have skin lesions with maculopapular erythema, purpura, urticaria, or exfoliative erythroderma. Lymph-node biopsy specimens demonstrate the most characteristic histopathologic features: extensive effacement of lymph nodal architecture; a pleomorphic population of immunoblasts, plasma cells, lymphocytes, and eosinophils; interstitial deposits of eosinophilic material; and prominent vascular proliferation, with ""arborization"" of small vessels. The pathogenesis of angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy is still unknown, but its histopathologic features and laboratory findings strongly suggest that it is an immunologically mediated disorder. Some clinical and laboratory evidence supports the possibility that angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy is a benign reactive or proliferative process, whereas other studies suggest that it might be a malignant disease. In some patients, it can develop into immunoblastic sarcoma or other types of malignant lymphoma or leukemia.

These reflect the various steps of lymphocyte differentiation including maturation from the pre-B lymphocyte to the well-differentiated B2 lymphocyte or plasma cell in the peripheral blood.

The Ann Arbor staging system is not applicable to cutaneous B-cell lymphoma; therefore, a TNM staging system has been proposed. The diagnosis of cutaneous B-cell lymphoma is based primarily on cytomorphologic features. Differentiation of cutaneous B-cell lymphoma from pseudolymphoma of the skin cannot be based on a single criterion; a spectrum of characteristic features must be evaluated. Analysis of the infiltrating cells in cutaneous B-cell lymphoma using monoclonal antibodies demonstrates that the proliferation of the neoplastic clone is accompanied by a mixture of accessory cells of various origins, including T cells, macrophages, and dendritic reticulum cells. As in nodal B-cell lymphomas, several factors may be involved in the generation of cutaneous B-cell lymphoma, including persistent antigenic stimulation and loss of regulatory mechanisms for lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation in conjunction with environmental and other factors.","['Burg, G', 'Kaudewitz, P', 'Klepzig, K', 'Przybilla, B', 'Braun-Falco, O']","['Burg G', 'Kaudewitz P', 'Klepzig K', 'Przybilla B', 'Braun-Falco O']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Dermatol Clin,Dermatologic clinics,8300886,,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/classification/etiology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Skin Neoplasms/etiology/*pathology']",1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Dermatol Clin. 1985 Oct;3(4):689-704.,,,,50,,,,

In the other 24 patients with a normal ultrasonic picture of the splenic parenchyma five biopsies were pathological (3 cases of hairy-cell leukaemia, 1 of Gaucher's disease and 1 of Hodgkin's disease). Side-effects were: slight to moderate pain (16/32 patients) and bleeding requiring transfusion (4/32 patients). In one of these patients splenectomy was performed because of the bleeding. Two of the patients with bleeding complications suffered from hairy-cell leukaemia.

It is one of the anthracyclines with the lowest cardiotoxicity, it is not mutagenic and it stimulates differentiation of tumour cells. The therapeutic index of aclarubicin (efficacy related to toxicity) is higher than that of doxorubicin and daunorubicin, using a proper dose schedule. Single dose therapy of aclarubicin shows only marginal efficacy, whereas multiple divided dose therapy exhibits efficacy comparable to that of doxorubicin and daunorubicin. Thus for clinical trials two dose schedules were designed: 25 mg/m2/day, days 1-7 for acute leukaemia; and 30 mg/m2/day, days 1-4 for solid tumours. Aclarubicin was shown to be highly active in acute leukaemia with 58% complete remissions in first relapse of AML. Good results were also seen in acute leukaemia in combination with cytosine arabinoside and thioguanine. In clinical trials with breast cancer and thyroid cancer the efficacy was in the same range as would be expected for doxorubicin, but side-effects were markedly reduced. Anorexia, mild nausea and infrequent vomiting were observed. Myelosuppression was common but dose reduction was not necessary. There was no alopecia and no congestive heart failure.","['Rothig, H J', 'Kraemer, H P', 'Sedlacek, H H']","['Rothig HJ', 'Kraemer HP', 'Sedlacek HH']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Drugs Exp Clin Res,Drugs under experimental and clinical research,7802135,"['0 (Naphthacenes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Naphthacenes/administration & dosage/therapeutic use']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Drugs Exp Clin Res. 1985;11(2):123-5.,,,,,,,,

It represents a key metabolic site at which specific inhibitors have been directed as potential antitumor agents. Several different classes of ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors have been generated and studied. Because of the nature of the DNA polymerase reaction in which all four dNTPs are required, the initial velocity vs dNTP concentration curve gives sigmoidal rather than hyperbolic kinetics. As a result, a 50 per cent decrease in ribonucleotide reductase activity causes a decrease in DNA polymerase activity of 75 per cent or greater depending on the ratio of [dNTP] to its Km. This has been demonstrated with theoretical calculations, actual DNA polymerase determinations and precursor studies in intact tumor cells. The structural requirements for a compound to serve as a specific inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, either as the non-heme iron or effector-binding subunit, are stringent. Each protein subunit comprising the active enzyme can be specifically and independently inhibited. When combinations of agents, each directed at one of the subunits of ribonucleotide reductase, are used, strong synergistic inhibition of L1210 cell growth and synergistic cytotoxicity result.","['Cory, J G', 'Carter, G L']","['Cory JG', 'Carter GL']",['eng'],"['CA 27398/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 27572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Quinolines)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytidine/metabolism', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Guanosine/metabolism', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(85)90088-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1985;24:385-401. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(85)90088-3.,,,,,,,,

For example, a circulating granulocyte in the peripheral blood has an approximate half-life of 7 h (Cartwright, Athens & Wintrobe, 1964; Dancey, Dubelbeiss, Harker & Finch, 1976) whilst the lifetime of an erythrocyte is approximately 120 days (Wickramasinghe & Weatherall, 1982). This constant 'death' of mature functional haemopoietic cells means that new blood cells must replace those that are removed. The process of haemopoiesis provides the mature functional blood cells to replace those lost as a consequence of performing their biological functions (e.g. lymphocytes and macrophages in the immune response) or through apparent old age and breakdown (e.g. erythrocytes that are 110-120 days old). The major questions that we are required to answer about this process are 'where do all these new cells come from?', 'what regulates their production?' and 'how is this mechanism of control lost in haemopoietic disorders such as leukaemia, hyperproliferative diseases and anaemias?'. Recent work in the field of haemopoiesis has given some clues to the answers to the questions, which provide an intriguing insight into not only haemopoiesis itself but the possible lesions associated with the various blood disorders.","['Dexter, T M', 'Whetton, A D', 'Spooncer, E', 'Heyworth, C', 'Simmons, P']","['Dexter TM', 'Whetton AD', 'Spooncer E', 'Heyworth C', 'Simmons P']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Cell Sci Suppl,Journal of cell science.

It offers 10-30% apparent cures for patients with acute leukemia who have relapsed at least once, and for those with chronic myelocytic leukemia in blast crisis. Although still somewhat controversial, it appears to be the treatment of choice for patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia in first chemotherapy induced remission, and for those with chronic myelogenous leukemia in the chronic phase since approximately 50-60% of these patients experience long-term, disease-free survival. Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia grafted in second or subsequent remission may expect a 30% ""cure"" of their disease. Marrow grafting is the only effective treatment for many patients with inherited immunologic deficiencies and certain genetic storage diseases.

Marrow transplantation is being explored for the therapy of patients with lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, preleukemia, multiple myeloma, hairy cell leukemia, small cell lung cancer, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer and neuroblastoma.

A sibling sharing one genetic haplotype is today our next choice of donor (67% survival) faring better than other relatives (50% survival), providing total body irradiation (of the thymus) has been avoided. The latter, without increasing the attack rate (64%) of GvHD more than doubles the deaths (57% as against 27%) attributable to it. Rejection is avoided by (a) suicide of host responders to donor buffy coat; (b) Cyclosporin-A; (c) displacement induction; (d) a higher dose of marrow. Prevention of GvHD is essential, using either Cyclosporin-A or removing donor T-cells from marrow prior to infusion or, probably better, both. Autoblast immunisation should be further explored. Tolerization seems an active process, easier in the very young, and nonirradiation of the thymus is believed important. An assay to assess tolerization (to guide cessation of immunosuppressive measures) is badly needed. Selection of a donor whose lymphocytes can deal with intracellular infections of the host's fibroblasts is now possible. The required increased immunosuppressive measures appear to increase the risk of leukemic relapse, and perhaps should be first improved in the more cost-effective fields of inborn error transplants.","['Hobbs, J R', 'Williamson, S', 'Chambers, J D', 'James, D C', 'Joshi, R', 'Shaw, P', 'Hugh-Jones, K']","['Hobbs JR', 'Williamson S', 'Chambers JD', 'James DC', 'Joshi R', 'Shaw P', 'Hugh-Jones K']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Tokai J Exp Clin Med,The Tokai journal of experimental and clinical medicine,7704186,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporins/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/mortality', '*Haploidy', 'Histocompatibility Testing/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Lymphokines/immunology', 'Neoplasms/immunology/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology/physiology', 'Time Factors', '*Tissue Donors']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tokai J Exp Clin Med. 1985 Jun;10(2-3):207-14.,,,,,,,,

SD involves in addition to a scheduled intake of tablets, microbiological surveillance, personal hygiene and an intact hemostasis, and optimal results can be obtained given the help of the patients' compliance.

Such data suggest that allogeneic BMT is acceptable as a very promising form of treatment for acute leukemia in Japan.","['Masaoka, T', 'Shibata, H', 'Nakamura, H', 'Inoue, T']","['Masaoka T', 'Shibata H', 'Nakamura H', 'Inoue T']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Tokai J Exp Clin Med,The Tokai journal of experimental and clinical medicine,7704186,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclosporins/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tokai J Exp Clin Med. 1985 Jun;10(2-3):139-46.,,,,,,,,

Currently CyA is given as a continuous infusion for 3-4 weeks, followed by an oral once-daily-therapy for one year. The daily dose is adjusted depending on the serum creatinine. Patients with acute GvHD during CyA therapy are treated with high dose bolus-steroid therapy. 83 patients with leukemia were treated in these 5 years. All were conditioned with 2 X 60 mg/kg Cyclophosphamide and 10 Gy total body irradiation. 78 had an HLA-identical, 5 an HLA-haploidentical family donor. The median age is 28 years (5-42 y). 20 patients had AML in 1. CR, 9 patients AML not in 1. CR (2nd, 3rd CR or relapse), 11 ALL in 1. CR, 19 not in 1. CR, 20 CML in chronic and 4 CML in accelerated phase. 40 patients are actually alive, well and without any signs of their disease; 9 are living in relapse. Major cause of death is relapse and GvHD. CyA does not reduce the incidence, it does reduce the severity of GvHD. The only long-term side-effects of bone marrow transplantation seen are cataracts and sterility. The major factors influencing outcome is the time of transplant. 31/51 patients transplanted in 1. CR or in chronic phase of CML are alive compared to only 9/32 transplanted in later stages. We conclude that bone marrow transplantation should be performed early in the disease and that CyA eases the procedure.","['Gratwohl, A']",['Gratwohl A'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Japan,Tokai J Exp Clin Med,The Tokai journal of experimental and clinical medicine,7704186,['0 (Cyclosporins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/drug therapy/therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cataract/complications', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclosporins/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality', 'Graft vs Host Reaction/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infertility/complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Switzerland', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tokai J Exp Clin Med. 1985 Jun;10(2-3):127-32.,,,,,,,,

Pathogenesis, etiology, and diagnosis.",90-9,"Granulocytopenia is the major factor predisposing cancer patients to infection, chiefly by bacteria. Most of the infections are caused by gram-negative aerobic organisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella sp) that arise from endogenous gastrointestinal, mucosal, or cutaneous flora (often modified by hospital-acquired pathogens). Some fungi (Candida sp and Aspergillus sp) are also likely to invade granulocytopenic patients. The next most important factor predisposing cancer patients to infection is alteration of anatomic barriers. Mucosal and skin protection is compromised by tumors, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgical diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and intravenous lines and other devices. The pathogens found in cases of altered anatomical barriers are similar to those encountered in patients with granulocytopenia, which is a major cause of alteration of anatomical barriers. The third factor predisposing patients to serious bacterial and nonbacterial infections is immunosuppression, especially in patients with lymphomas, multiple myelomas, and chronic lymphatic leukemia. The pathogens isolated in these patients include Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella sp, Brucella sp, Mycobacterium sp, and Nocardia asteroides, although P aeruginosa and staphylococci may be found as well. Viruses (herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and vaccinia), parasites, fungi, and Pneumocystis carinii and Toxoplasma gondii are involved in many infections in these patients, in whom cell-mediated immunity is impaired. In neutropenic patients, antimicrobial or antifungal therapy should be instituted before the microbiological diagnosis is made; in immunosuppressed patients, therapy is optimally guided by a specific microbiological diagnosis.","['Klastersky, J']",['Klastersky J'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Ther,Clinical therapeutics,7706726,,IM,"['Agranulocytosis/*complications', 'Bacterial Infections/diagnosis/*etiology/microbiology', 'Escherichia coli Infections/etiology', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/adverse effects', 'Klebsiella Infections/etiology', 'Mycoses/etiology', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Neutropenia/complications/etiology', 'Pseudomonas Infections/etiology', 'Virus Diseases/etiology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Ther. 1985;8(1):90-9.,,,,,,,,

Because some of these substances are known or suspected carcinogens, the epidemiologic literature regarding cancer risks concerning farmers has been reviewed. Farmers had consistent deficits for cancers of the colon, rectum, liver, and nose. The deficits for cancer of the lung and bladder were particularly striking, presumably due to less frequent use of tobacco among farmers than among people in many other occupational groups. Malignancies frequently showing excesses among farmers included Hodgkin's disease, leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and cancers of the lip, stomach, prostate, skin (nonmelanotic), brain, and connective tissues. The etiologic factors that may contribute to these excesses in the agricultural environment have not been identified. Detailed, analytic epidemiologic studies that incorporate environmental and biochemical monitoring are needed to clarify these associations.","['Blair, A', 'Malker, H', 'Cantor, K P', 'Burmeister, L', 'Wiklund, K']","['Blair A', 'Malker H', 'Cantor KP', 'Burmeister L', 'Wiklund K']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Finland,Scand J Work Environ Health,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",7511540,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', ""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology"", 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Risk', 'Sarcoma/epidemiology', 'Skin Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/epidemiology']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['2208 [pii]', '10.5271/sjweh.2208 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Work Environ Health. 1985 Dec;11(6):397-407. doi: 10.5271/sjweh.2208.,,,,98,,,,

The GTGO-AD procedure, described in earlier studies, involves glutaraldehyde (G) fixation of suspended cells, followed by tannic acid (T)--guanidine hydrochloride (G) treatment of substrate-attached cells, immersion in osmium tetroxide (O), and subsequent air drying (from absolute Freon 113) of dehydrated cells. Both air-dried and critical point dried GTGO-treated cells from patients with lymphocytic, monocytic and hairy cell leukemias, displayed excellent preservation of their surface microvilli and/or ruffles with minimal cell shrinkage. Generally, only two types of hairy cells were identified: (i) cells displaying areas of ruffles alongside areas of clustered microvilli, and (ii) cells showing microvilli scattered among ruffles. Peripheral blood hairy cells showed the same features as those isolated from the spleens involved with HCL and consistently exhibited both ruffles and microvilli. In all studied cases, cells displaying only ruffles or microvilli were not frequently encountered, although ruffled cells with very short and delicate microvilli, and villous cells with small ruffles were seen. Hairy cells, kept in culture for up to 7 days, displayed extreme polarization of their microprojections and very active surfaces, with elongated microvilli and broad-based ruffles. In the light of these results, it is clear that GTGO-AD has much to offer in determining the surface features of circulating and cultured hairy cells and other types of leukemic cells.","['Gamliel, H', 'Golomb, H M', 'Gurfel, D', 'Hiraoka, A', 'Rosner, M C', 'Polliack, A']","['Gamliel H', 'Golomb HM', 'Gurfel D', 'Hiraoka A', 'Rosner MC', 'Polliack A']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Scan Electron Microsc,Scanning electron microscopy,0371617,,IM,"['Cell Membrane/ultrastructure', 'Histological Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning/methods', 'Monocytes/cytology/ultrastructure']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Scan Electron Microsc. 1985;(Pt 4):1665-78.,,,,,,,,

No difference was evident among postmenopausal patients in overall response rate and duration of responses between T-CAF and CAF (52% vs 50% respectively). Similarly no difference was shown among premenopausal patients, response rates being 63% with T-CAF and 60% with CAF.

The ratio of major to minor was found to depend not only upon the inducer tested (as reported previously by others), but also upon the concentration of the inducer and the time of exposure to the inducer as well as the specific cell line of MEL cells studied. At concentrations required for optimal induction of differentiation, certain agents led to the accumulation of predominantly Hb major, but suboptimal concentrations of the same inducers led to predominantly Hb minor accumulation. After a relatively short induction time (2 da) utilizing a given inducer either the level of Hb minor was higher than that of Hb major or the levels of the two Hb's were approximately equal, but after longer induction periods (3-7 da) Hb major was more abundant than Hb minor. In addition, it was found that the three proteases tested induced predominantly Hb minor. The addition of suboptimal concentrations of low molecular weight inducers acted synergistically with a given protease to produce a high yield of Hb-containing cells. When these agents were added singly they induced relatively low Hb major/Hb minor ratios, but when a low molecular weight inducer was added together with a protease in a ""synergistic"" combination, elevated ratios were induced. The proportions of hemoglobin types induced in MEL cells may be related in part to the intensity of the induction response. In view of these data, classifications of inducers based solely on the ratios of Hb types produced must be guarded.","['Scher, W', 'Scher, B M', 'Hellinger, N', 'Waxman, S']","['Scher W', 'Scher BM', 'Hellinger N', 'Waxman S']",['eng'],['CA 37874/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Hemoglobin,Hemoglobin,7705865,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Growth Substances/classification/*pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis/classification', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*blood', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptide Hydrolases/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/03630268508997039 [doi]'],ppublish,Hemoglobin. 1985;9(6):577-96. doi: 10.3109/03630268508997039.,,,,,,,,

This subline (KE37-R) bears a t(8;14) (q24;q11) translocation, and the breakpoint on the resulting chromosome 8q+ has been located at the 3' end of the third c-myc exon. Three molecular clones were isolated by screening the library with a c-myc exon 3 probe, and one of them (lambda K40) was analyzed in detail. It contains a 15-kb insert consisting of 4.5 kb of sequence from chromosome 8 (e.g., downstream of c-myc exon 3) and sequences from chromosome 14. The origin of these latter sequences was established by hybridizing DNA from chromosomes sorted by flow cytometry to a lambda K40 subclone containing only chromosome 14 presumptive sequences and by Southern blot analysis of rodent X human somatic hybrid cell DNA with the same probe. No cross-hybridization was found between the lambda K40 clone and a cDNA clone for the alpha chain T-cell receptor gene which is also located in 14q11. A preliminary survey of DNAs from human T-cell malignancies with a probe corresponding to chromosome 14 sequences of lambda K40 clone revealed for some of them restriction patterns different from those of the germ line DNA.

The incidence within each category of malignancy varies substantially but in most series represents less than 2% of the population. While there is a considerable variety of glomerular lesions, a number of general statements may be made. In Hodgkin's disease and other lymphomas, the most common lesion is minimal lesion nephrotic syndrome, reflecting possibly an anomaly of T cell function. Amyloidosis which used to be the commonest lesion has nearly disappeared. On the other hand, in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia a large proportion of glomerular lesions fall into the category of proliferative glomerulonephritis. In carcinoma the vast majority of glomerular lesions with proteinuria or the nephrotic syndrome are due to membranous glomerulonephritis. This suggests either a local alteration of fixed glomerular antigens, or localization of tumor antigens planted in the glomeruli leading to the formation of local immunocomplexes.

The donor may be a healthy identical twin, a family member or even an unrelated person. Selection is made on the basis of human leukocyte antigen tissue typing. Intensive chemoradiotherapy is used to suppress patients' immune systems to facilitate engraftment and destroy diseased marrow. Transfusion of platelets, erythrocytes and granulocytes (or all of these), antibiotic coverage and protection from infection are necessary during the pancytopenic period. Use of a Hickman catheter facilitates maintenance of adequate nutritional intake and provides easy access for drawing blood and intravenous administration. Survival rates vary considerably depending on a patient's disease, clinical state and age. Patients with aplastic anemia transplanted early in the course of their disease have a survival rate of approximately 80%. Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia are usually transplanted in a second or subsequent remission and have a survival rate of 25% to 40%. Patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia in remission have survivals ranging from 45% to 70%.

Antibody 17-9H3 was demonstrated to bind to the cell membranes of transfectants and leukemia cells but not normal 3T3 cells in an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Fresh human leukemias, cultured leukemia lines and normal hemopoietic cells were examined with immunoperoxidase staining techniques to determine the specificity of 17-9H3.

Based on its antitumor activity against two i.p. implanted murine tumors, the B16 melanoma, and the P388 leukemia, it was brought into clinical trials by the National Cancer Institute. Recent studies on its cytotoxic action have related its antitumor activity with its ability to bifunctionally intercalate with double stranded DNA. Toxicologic studies were carried out in CDF1 mice and beagle dogs using intravenous injections. For the mice studies the dose ranges were 288-692 mcg/kg (864-2076 mcg/m2) by single bolus, and 112-254 mcg/kg/day (336-762 mcg/m2/day) for five consecutive days. In the dog, dose ranges studied were 8.9-89.4 mcg/kg (178-1788 mcg/m2) by single bolus, and 3.4-33.5 mcg/kg/day (68-670 mcg/m2/day) for five consecutive days. The major toxic effects were found in the gastrointestinal, hepatic, and lymphoreticular systems. These were reversible at all but the highest dose, in dogs that had been treated for five consecutive days. Phase I clinical trials using various intravenous schedules were sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. Nausea, vomiting, reversible liver enzyme abnormalities, and allergic reactions were the most common toxicities encountered. Based on results from these studies, the National Cancer Institute has recently begun phase II trials in a broad range of diseases. These trials will further characterize echinomycin's toxic effects and its antitumor activity.","['Foster, B J', 'Clagett-Carr, K', 'Shoemaker, D D', 'Suffness, M', 'Plowman, J', 'Trissel, L A', 'Grieshaber, C K', 'Leyland-Jones, B']","['Foster BJ', 'Clagett-Carr K', 'Shoemaker DD', 'Suffness M', 'Plowman J', 'Trissel LA', 'Grieshaber CK', 'Leyland-Jones B']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Quinoxalines)', '512-64-1 (Echinomycin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Dogs', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Echinomycin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Quinoxalines/*therapeutic use']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00170766 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1985;3(4):403-10. doi: 10.1007/BF00170766.,,,,20,,,,

Controlled trials comparing post-grafting therapy using methotrexate or cyclosporine have shown no difference in long-term survival, although cyclosporine reduces the incidence of mucositis and is associated with somewhat earlier engraftment. Observations in the canine model indicating efficacy of a combination of a brief course of methotrexate with the cyclosporine regimen are now being tested in patients, with early results indicating a reduction in GvHD and an improved survival. In both species, failure to administer immunosuppression after grafting is associated with a high incidence of acute GvHD and an adverse effect on survival. Removal of donor T cells from the marrow inoculum may reduce the incidence of acute GvHD but at the price of a higher likelihood of subsequent graft failure. Studies of canine and human chimeras are in agreement with murine data indicating a principal role for T cells in the pathogenic mechanism of GvHD. Chimera lymphocytes (of donor origin) from dogs and patients with acute GvHD proliferate in response to previously stored host cells, and lymphocytes cytotoxic to host target cells are seen in patients with GvHD. Our observations indicate a direct, rather than an indirect, role for T cells since lymphocytes from donors sensitized to chimeric skin grafts can cause lethal GvHD when infused into stable chimeric recipients. ""Specific"" suppressor cells may play a role in maintaining stable graft-host tolerance while ""nonspecific"" suppressor cells may be responsible for the impaired immune defenses in patients with chronic GvHD. Chronic GvHD, which resembles systemic collagen vascular disease, occurs in approximately 40% of matched recipients, particularly following acute GvHD, and is more frequent in older patients. Efforts to treat both acute and chronic GvHD with steroids, antithymocyte globulin, cyclosporine and azathioprine are only partially and unpredictably effective. Data in dogs pointed out the feasibility of transplants from partially matched related donors or matched unrelated donors, an approach that is now being actively pursued in human patients. Marrow transplants from HLA-partially matched family members resulted in a higher incidence of acute GvHD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Storb, R', 'Thomas, E D']","['Storb R', 'Thomas ED']",['eng'],"['CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30924/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dogs', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology/physiopathology/therapy', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-065x.1985.tb01160.x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 1985 Dec;88:215-38. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-065x.1985.tb01160.x.,,,,64,,,,

Inhibitory effects of BCG have also been reported, particularly for relatively high doses. Because the cell wall of Mycobacterium bovis BCG contains a high proportion of lipids, the possibility was considered that these lipids may modulate NK activity. A total lipid fraction was extracted from Mycobacterium bovis BCG and used for the lipid modulation of NK effector and target cells. Treatment of effector or target cells resulted in decreased membrane fluidity and decreased NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in both cases. Pretreatment of target cells did not affect the binding between target and effector cells, as shown in the single cell assay, whereas pretreatment of effectors resulted in inhibition of conjugation. It was further demonstrated that treatment of target cells which were first programmed for lysis protected these cells from subsequent lysis during the killer cell independent lysis stage. The results of this study suggest that adverse effects of BCG treatment on immune functions may be mediated by BCG derived lipids.","['Roozemond, R C', 'Halperin, M', 'Das, P K']","['Roozemond RC', 'Halperin M', 'Das PK']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,['0 (Lipids)'],IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/*drug effects', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Lipids/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Fluidity/drug effects', '*Mycobacterium bovis']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1985 Dec;62(3):482-90.,PMC1577470,,,,,,,

Bone marrow transplantation overcomes the marrow toxicity problem, but it is not protective to other organs. Extensive animal studies have been carried out in the mouse, the rat, rhesus monkeys, and dogs to delineate the dose-limiting toxicity of cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) (CY) therapy. Studies in the dog have shown 100 mg/kg of CY to be lethal with supportive care alone. Dogs given this dose followed by stored autologous marrow recovered after a period of profound pancytopenia and severe gastrointestinal toxicity. This dose of CY also permitted allogeneic engraftment in the dog. Monkeys given up to 200 mg/kg of CY have uneventful hematopoietic recovery, but doses of 240 mg/kg were generally fatal even when stored autologous marrow was infused. Cardiac toxicity was the limiting factor. CY 180 mg/kg was not lethal and permitted successful allogeneic marrow engraftment. CY is successfully used for conditioning leukemia or aplastic anemia patients for bone marrow transplantation. Patients with severe aplastic anemia are conditioned with CY 50 mg/kg on each of four days followed by allogeneic marrow transplantation. Patients undergoing transplantation before transfusion have a long-term survival rate of about 80%. Patients with genetic disorders of the marrow generally have a normocellular or hypercellular marrow, and the preparative regimen must include destruction of the abnormal marrow as well as immunosuppression sufficient to permit engraftment. Patients with thalassemia are treated with dimethylbusulfan 5 mg/kg or busulfan 14 mg/kg followed by CY 50 mg/kg on each of four days. Approximately 100 thalassemia patients have been treated, with a survival rate of approximately 75%. For patients with leukemia, radiotherapy is generally added to the CY conditioning regimen. In the early Seattle studies, 1,000 rad total body irradiation was combined with CY 60 mg/kg on each of two days. There were many early deaths, but some long-term survivors are alive and well 5 to 13 years later. Current regimens involve fractionated total body irradiation and various post-grafting immunosuppressive regimens designed to prevent graft-v-host disease. Complications and problems of current regimens are discussed, and future goals for marrow transplantation are presented.","['Thomas, E D']",['Thomas ED'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclophosphamide/*toxicity', 'Dogs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0093-7754(85)90101-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1985 Dec;12(4 Suppl 6):15-20.,,,,30,,,,

These organisms were responsible for disease in the preantibiotic era but at a much lower frequency than at present, and fatality rates were generally high. Bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Serratia, now relatively commonly involved in infection, rarely, if ever, caused disease before antibiotics became available. Although often present in surgical wounds, these organisms clearly were colonizers rather than pathogens. It is clear that the use of potent antimicrobial agents has been responsible for a general decrease in the fatality rates associated with gram-negative bacterial infections. However, it is evident that their use has been involved in the development of potentially lethal complications not seen in the past. Factors presently recognized as playing important roles in the problems associated with the treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections are the increasing number of older and sometimes debilitated patients and the longer survival of individuals with tumors or leukemia who, because of immunosuppression due to disease or treatment, are highly susceptible to invasion by almost any organism. Factors that have increased the magnitude of the problem of treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections include an increasing frequency of bacterial resistance to one or more antibiotics and a tendency of physicians to use more than one drug, sometimes as many as three or four, to treat gram-negative bacterial infections, especially in immunosuppressed people. Such polypharmacy is responsible for the development of suprainfections, some of which are caused by organisms very difficult to eradicate.","['Weinstein, L']",['Weinstein L'],['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",United States,Rev Infect Dis,Reviews of infectious diseases,7905878,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/*etiology/history', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria/drug effects', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Intestines/microbiology']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/clinids/7.supplement_4.s538 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Infect Dis. 1985 Nov-Dec;7 Suppl 4:S538-44. doi: 10.1093/clinids/7.supplement_4.s538.,,,,,,,,

The origin and morphological identity of such progenitor cells is not yet known and the question, whether there is a single pluripotent haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) or a variety of stem cells each with a capacity of self-replication and maintenance is still unresolved [37]. Although progress has been made in segregating [43, 47, 49, 64] various progenitor cells from one another and functional assays [11, 17, 42] have significantly promoted the study of haemopoietic precursor cells, morphological investigations were less rewarding. Even after enrichment, the morphology of haemopoietic stem- and colony-forming cells only remained hypothetical, 'candidate stem cells' [3], because their precursor cell qualities could not be deduced from their morphology, but only retrospectively, and statistically from their function, i.e. in vitro colony-formation or in-vivo haemopoietic reconstitution from an enriched cell suspension [58]. We postulate from our studies on semi-thin sections of undecalcified BM from healthy human fetuses, normal adults and patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL) that the endosteal cells are the precursors of all haematopoietic cells in the bone marrow and are also capable of transformation into either stromal (fibroblast-like cells) or bone-related cells (osteoblasts and osteoclasts).","['Islam, A']",['Islam A'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Endothelium/cytology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(85)90130-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(85)90130-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1985;9(11):1415-32. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(85)90130-4.,,,,66,,,,

Firstly, the number of leukemic cells which--after intravenous transfer--cause death from leukemia in 50% of the recipient rats proved to be 24.7 cells. Secondly, it appeared that the regrowth of leukemic cells in rats heavily pretreated with high-dose cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation was significantly hampered as compared with non-pretreated controls as judged by survival times (37 and 31 days, respectively after 10(3) BNML cells i.v.). The most likely explanation is treatment-induced damage to the microenvironment. Differences in patterns of lodging of infused leukemic cells were ruled out by comparing the uptake of 51Cr-labeled BNML cells in various organs. Finally, extrapolated from the available rat data on log leukemic cell kill induced by high-dose chemoradiotherapy, an hypothesis is presented relating the total tumor load in man to the clinical outcome of autologous bone marrow transplantation.

This L25 antigen was expressed on most B-lineage cells but not other cell types including thymocytes, T cells, granulocytes and monocytes. Thus, L25 existed on the majority of normal B cells present in the blood and lymphoid tissues, on cultured cell lines derived from normal and malignant B cells, and on neoplastic cells isolated from patients with B cell-derived malignancies. Though L25 was persistently expressed on B cells until 7 days after their activation with pokeweed mitogen (PWM), neither normal nor neoplastic plasma cells expressed L25. Moreover, L25 was present on cultured as well as freshly isolated leukaemic cells with common acute lymphatic leukaemia (CALL) antigen, which have been thought to correspond to the early B-cell ontogeny. Besides pan-B cell reactivity of TB1-4D5 antibody, it apparently cross-reacted with so-called dendritic or interdigitating cells located in the thymic-dependent areas of peripheral lymphoid organs, which have been presumably ascribed to those associated with accessory-cell function. Functional studies showed that anti-L25 (TB1-4D5) antibody had inhibitory effect on induction of immunoglobulin synthesis by PWM-stimulated B cells.","['Ishii, Y', 'Takami, T', 'Kokai, Y', 'Yuasa, H', 'Fujimoto, J', 'Takei, T', 'Kikuchi, K']","['Ishii Y', 'Takami T', 'Kokai Y', 'Yuasa H', 'Fujimoto J', 'Takei T', 'Kikuchi K']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*immunology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1985 Sep;61(3):624-32.,PMC1577279,,,,,,,

The results have been compared with microbial mammalian cell cytotoxicity, DNA binding affinity and acridine base strength (pKa). Compounds containing strong electron donor substituents on the acridine ring, and which have a high acridine pKa, show minimal frameshift mutagenicity but are strong inducers of petite yeast mutants. Conversely, some compounds which have a high DNA binding constant but a significant proportion of uncharged form at neutral pH, show high frameshift mutagenicity but minimal induction of petite mutants. It is hypothesised that this inverse relationship arises from the presence of trans-membrane drug transport mechanisms which act to exclude some compounds, particularly strongly basic compounds from the cytoplasm and to concentrate them in mitochondria.","['Baguley, B C', 'Ferguson, L R']","['Baguley BC', 'Ferguson LR']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Mutagens)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Aminoacridines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Mutagenicity Tests/methods', 'Mutagens', '*Mutation', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*drug effects', 'Salmonella typhimurium/*drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1985/12/31 00:00,1985/12/31 00:01,['1985/12/31 00:00'],"['1985/12/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/31 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/31 00:00 [entrez]']","['0009-2797(85)90002-X [pii]', '10.1016/0009-2797(85)90002-x [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 1985 Dec 31;56(2-3):145-55. doi: 10.1016/0009-2797(85)90002-x.,,,,,,,,

These decreases precede decreased expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene and its protein product. Phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate, which can mimic diacylglycerol, blocked differentiation without reversing the decrease in phosphatidylinositol metabolite levels. Two synthetic diacylglycerols, L-alpha-1-oleoyl-2-acetoyl-sn-3-glycerol and sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol, also blocked differentiation and commitment.

In this study, the authors examined paraffin-embedded tissue sections obtained from 38 patients with previously well-characterized T-cell neoplasms for the presence of the Leu-M1 antigen. The cases comprised a spectrum of T-cell malignancies and were divided into four broad clinicopathologic groups: lymphoblastic lymphoma/ leukemias (6), mature T-cell leukemias (3), peripheral T-cell lymphomas (11), and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (18), which included both mycosis fungoides and nonmycosis fungoides types. The neoplastic T cells in 19 patients (50%) expressed the Leu-M1 antigen. The proportion of Leu-M1-positive cells and the immunostaining pattern varied greatly among these cases but correlated with mature, postthymic stages of T-cell differentiation and activation. Of particular significance was the observation that the more pleomorphic neoplastic T cells, including Reed-Sternberg-like cells, exhibited an intense cytoplasmic and membranous staining pattern which was often indistinguishable from the immunostaining pattern observed in Hodgkin's disease. The authors conclude that Leu-M1 is not a specific immunodiagnostic marker of Hodgkin's disease and has limited value in distinguishing Hodgkin's disease from T-cell neoplasms which stimulate Hodgkin's disease morphologically.","['Wieczorek, R', 'Burke, J S', 'Knowles, D M 2nd']","['Wieczorek R', 'Burke JS', 'Knowles DM 2nd']",['eng'],['EY03357/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Mycosis Fungoides/diagnosis/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1985 Dec;121(3):374-80.,PMC1887921,,,,,,,

This enzyme is composed of two nonidentical protein subunits which can be specifically and independently inhibited. Combinations of drugs directed at the effector-binding and non-heme iron subunits of ribonucleotide reductase resulted in the synergistic inhibition of L1210 cell growth and synergistic L1210 cell kill. These combinations included dAdo/EHNA/IMPY/Desferal; dAdo/EHNA/hydroxyurea/Desferal (the EHNA was required to protect dAdo from deamination while Desferal modulated the effects of IMPY or hydroxyurea); 2-F-araA/IMPY/Desferal and 2-F-2'-dAdo/IMPY/Desferal (EHNA was not required to protect 2-F-araA or 2-F-2'-dAdo from deamination); and dGuo/8-AGuo/IMPY/Desferal (8-AGuo was required to protect dGuo from phosphorolysis). Although thymidine alone inhibited L1210 cell growth, it was not possible to potentiate the effects of thymidine with the pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitors, acyclothymidine, 5-chlorouracil and 2,6-dihydroxypyridine. Combinations of drugs directed at the ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase sites were studied for their effects on L1210 cell growth. With these combinations, no synergistic inhibition of L1210 cell growth was observed. The combinations of aphidicolin and IMPY/Desferal and aphidicolin and dAdo/EHNA inhibited L1210 cell growth in an additive manner; the combinations of IMPY/Desferal and BuAU or IMPY/Desferal and BuPdG resulted in antagonistic inhibition of L1210 cell growth. From these results it is clear that combination chemotherapy directed at independent sites of the same key target enzyme can result in strong synergistic inhibition of cell growth and cytotoxicity offering a clear therapeutic advantage. In contrast, the combinations directed at sequential key enzymes (e.g. ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase) did not result in synergistic inhibition of cell growth.

These data were not remarkably different from those in previous studies using 10 Gy of TBI administered as a single dose. Thirty patients were randomized to receive methotrexate (MTX) and 26 to receive cyclosporine (CSP) as postgrafting prophylaxis for acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The probability of developing significant acute GVHD by day 100 post-transplant was 71% for patients in the MTX group and 45% for patients in the CSP group (p less than 0.05). The probability of relapse was 37% for patients in the MTX group and 70% for patients in the CSP group (p less than 0.05). Transplant-related deaths were more frequent in the MTX group and leukemic deaths were more frequent in the CSP group although this may have been related to an uneven distribution of high-risk patients. Long-term disease-free survival was comparable. Patients in the MTX group had more severe mucositis, more alveolar pneumonias and possibly more deaths due to complications of acute and chronic GVHD. Patients in the CSP group had a higher incidence of hypertension, neurological complications and renal dysfunction.","['Irle, C', 'Deeg, H J', 'Buckner, C D', 'Kennedy, M', 'Clift, R', 'Storb, R', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Beatty, P', 'Bensinger, W', 'Doney, K']","['Irle C', 'Deeg HJ', 'Buckner CD', 'Kennedy M', 'Clift R', 'Storb R', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Beatty P', 'Bensinger W', 'Doney K', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclosporins/*therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Kidney Diseases/etiology', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Liver Diseases/etiology', 'Methotrexate/*therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Vascular Diseases/etiology', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(85)90153-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1985;9(10):1255-61. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(85)90153-5.,,,,,,,,

Leukemia occurred in only three of 2,068 patients treated by operation alone. The cumulative risk was 0.06% after 10 years in those free of metastases or a second primary tumor, and 0.27% in those with tumor. Thus, leukemia is not an important factor in the natural history of breast cancer. Five of 646 women receiving postoperative regional radiation developed leukemia, an overall risk of 1.39 +/- .49% at 10 years. Twenty-seven cases of leukemia (0.5%) and seven of myeloproliferative syndrome (0.1%) were recorded in 5,299 patients who received L-phenylalanine mustard (L-PAM)-containing regimens. The maximum cumulative risk of leukemia in chemotherapy recipients (leukemia of any type and myeloproliferative syndrome) was 1.68 +/- .33% at 10 years following operation. The risk excluding those with myeloproliferative syndrome was 1.29 +/- .28%. The risk of leukemia in patients free of metastases or a second primary was 1.11 +/- .30% at 10 years, and when combined with myeloproliferative syndrome, it was 1.54 +/- .36%; risks not significantly greater than observed following radiation (P = .58 and .29). No cases of leukemia were observed during the 2 years of chemotherapy and none have occurred after the seventh postoperative year. Comparisons with the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results tumor registries (SEER) data indicate an increased relative risk of acute myelogenous leukemia following postoperative regional radiation (P less than .01) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P less than .001). The findings indicate that hematologic disorders are side effects of both radiation and alkylating agents used in the adjuvant treatment of primary breast cancer. The risk of such events is lower than that reported following treatment of other solid tumors and hematologic malignancies by chemotherapy. The benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer exceeds the risk of leukemia. Since chemotherapy is not uniformly beneficial, efforts should be directed toward identifying responders so that only those who will benefit are exposed to the risk.","['Fisher, B', 'Rockette, H', 'Fisher, E R', 'Wickerham, D L', 'Redmond, C', 'Brown, A']","['Fisher B', 'Rockette H', 'Fisher ER', 'Wickerham DL', 'Redmond C', 'Brown A']",['eng'],"['NCI-U10-CA-12027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NCI-U10-CA-34211/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/blood/*etiology/pathology', 'Mastectomy/methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/etiology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/therapy', 'Random Allocation', 'Registries', 'Risk']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1985.3.12.1640 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1985 Dec;3(12):1640-58. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1985.3.12.1640.,,,,,,,,

Two hundred forty-two patients were in a 1978 pilot study and 334 patients were in a 1982 randomized study. Ages were between 15 and 78 years (median, 48). The uniform remission induction therapy in both studies consisted of one to two courses of a 9-day combination of 6-thioguanine (TG) with cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C) and daunorubicin (DNR) [TAD9]. The timing and sequencing of TAD9 was designed according to cell kinetic effects of ARA-C. A complete remission (CR) was achieved in 65% (70% and 61%, respectively) of patients within a median of 33 days, and in 68% of responders after only one course. The CR rate in patients 60 to 78 years of age was 51% (66% and 39%, respectively). In the 1978 pilot study, different protocols of post-remission treatment were applied at the different centers: monthly 5-day maintenance, TAD9 consolidation, both consolidation and maintenance, or no further therapy. The group receiving treatment during CR showed 24% probability of remissions at 4 years v 0% probability of remissions in the untreated group. Between the different post-remission protocols, no significant differences were observed. Remission duration was not influenced by age, WBC, or morphologic cell type, but was longer in patients achieving CR within 30 days (P = .017). In the subsequent 1982 study, 145 patients in CR were randomized for TAD9 consolidation with or without monthly maintenance. The updated life-table analysis revealed a predicted rate of continuous remission at 2 1/2 years of 30% for the maintenance and 17% for the nonmaintenance arm (P = .003). These results of response and remission duration in adult patients of all ages support the validity of intensified induction therapy and of consequent myelosuppressive treatment in remission.","['Buchner, T', 'Urbanitz, D', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Ruhl, H', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Fischer, J', 'Aul, H C', 'Vaupel, H A', 'Kuse, R', 'Zeile, G']","['Buchner T', 'Urbanitz D', 'Hiddemann W', 'Ruhl H', 'Ludwig WD', 'Fischer J', 'Aul HC', 'Vaupel HA', 'Kuse R', 'Zeile G', 'et al.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Germany, West', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Random Allocation', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Time Factors']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1985.3.12.1583 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1985 Dec;3(12):1583-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1985.3.12.1583.,,,,,,,,

These were screened for the production of P. haemolytica soluble antigens by a colony enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay blot method with a rabbit antiserum raised against the soluble antigens. The clones producing P. haemolytica soluble antigens were then analyzed for the production of the leukotoxin by a cytotoxicity assay with cells from a bovine leukemia-derived B-lymphocyte cell line as the target cells. Positive clones were identified, and subsequent restriction analysis of the recombinant plasmids showed that the same 6.3 kilobase pairs of insert DNA was cloned in either of the two orientations into the plasmid vector pBR322. One of the clones was selected for further characterization of the leukotoxin as produced in E. coli. Tests for heat lability and target cell species specificity with canine, porcine, and human peripheral blood lymphocytes indicated that the activity of the cloned leukotoxin was identical to that of the P. haemolytica leukotoxin. Furthermore, the E. coli-produced leukotoxin was also neutralized by bovine or rabbit antiserum known to have antitoxic activity. When cellular proteins from the E. coli clones were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis, a 100,000-dalton protein was identified which corresponded to one of the soluble antigens found in the leukotoxic culture supernatant of P. haemolytica.

Treatment has been based upon appreciation of rapid tumour growth kinetics and has consisted of high-dose fractionated cyclophosphamide courses, vincristine, adriamycin and infusions of cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) with intrathecal chemotherapy. The first 12 patients (1979-1981) received, in addition, superfractionated radiotherapy (twice a day) to the involved field (22.5 Gy) and the craniospinal axis (18 Gy). Since January 1981, radiation therapy has been omitted, and subsequent patients have received the same agents as above plus high doses of methotrexate coordinated with the escalating doses of Ara-C infusions. Toxicity has consisted mainly of universal, severe but reversible haematopoietic suppression with attendant febrile episodes. Complete-remission rate for all 29 patients has been 86%, with three early failures due to progressive disease and one death from infection. Overall disease-free survival for children with stage III disease has been excellent (78%). Initial involvement of central nervous system (CNS) and/or marrow is grave: none of three patients with stage IV lymphoma and only one of eight with B-ALL is surviving off therapy without evidence of disease, suggesting a need for alternative therapies for these cases.

The most remarkable differences in these parameters were seen with respect to CFU-BL. Unirradiated and irradiated RF/J mice produced over three times as many CFU-BL as CAF1 mice. Tremendously expanded lymphoid progenitor cell compartments in the RF/J mice may reflect the presence of numerically increased sensitive targets subject to radiation-induced damage and transformation.

Even if in vitro assays provide relevant data, for some tumors, variable levels of stem-cell origin, differentiation, tumor heterogeneity, or self renewal may be more important than cytotoxicity to proliferating cells. Although ANLL has been used here frequently as a model, it may not be the most appropriate tumor for study. Unlike many cancers, in ANLL, primary drug resistance is unusual, and in relapse, secondary drug resistance is usually incomplete. It has been suggested that in vitro drug sensitivity predicts remissions for patients who do not die of infection or remain aplastic during induction therapy. However, for the majority of patients, this argument acknowledges the overriding importance of biologic variables other than in vitro drug cytotoxicity. For rapidly growing tumors, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, rapid emergence of drug resistance related to disease burden may be the most important response determinant. Perhaps in other tumors, in vitro drug sensitivity will be an independent variable of overriding importance. To determine the role of in vitro drug testing, trials examining in vitro drug sensitivity must meet stringent criteria. The assays should use well-defined and reproducible cultures and drug exposures. The trials must be large enough, contain homogenously treated patients, and use carefully defined response and survival endpoints. Decision rules derived from such trials must be further tested by prospective evaluation. Investigators conducting these trials must be prepared to search for important in vitro results reflecting tumor biology and to analyze in vitro drug sensitivity as only one continuous variable determining in vivo responses. Such trials will be difficult to conduct and expensive. In the final analysis, in vitro assays may find their most important roles as preclinical drug screens and models for in vitro drug resistance. Further insights into molecular genetics of malignant transformation and drug resistance may make such assays obsolete, but for the present, they provide important insights into tumor variability and mechanisms of drug response.","['Taetle, R', 'Koziol, J A']","['Taetle R', 'Koziol JA']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Growth Substances)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1040-8428(85)80015-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s1040-8428(85)80015-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 1985;4(2):169-201. doi: 10.1016/s1040-8428(85)80015-9.,,,,185,,,,

In vitro, a human T-cell leukemia line (JM) was cultured in the presence of different concentrations of eluates made from the catheters. The cytotoxicity of the eluates was assessed from their ability to inhibit DNA synthesis measured by incorporation of 3H-thymidine. In vivo, two methods were used. Strips of catheters were implanted into the rabbit dorsal muscle and pieces of catheters were implanted into the rat peritoneal cavity. After four days, the foreign body reaction, type of inflammation and necrosis were quantified macroscopically and by light microscopy. The results of the in vitro cytotoxicity test were correlated with those of in vivo methods. The rat peritoneal implantation test correlated better with the cell culture test (P less than 0.01) than with the rabbit muscle implantation test (P less than 0.05). Based on the clinical experience of urethral stricture complications caused by urinary catheters, catheters yielding eluate which at 30% dilution inhibited 50% DNA synthesis were regarded as toxic.

The actuarial death rate for this population was 5% during the first year after diagnosis, 12% during the second year, and averaged 22.5% per year during the next eight years. Multivariable regression analysis of features recorded in nearly all cases indicated that sex, spleen size, hematocrit, platelet count, and percentage of circulating blasts were significant prognostic indicators. Analyses of additional data available in 113 to 421 cases suggested that serum lactic dehydrogenase activity, percentage of blasts in marrow, nucleated RBCs in blood, and percentage of basophils plus eosinophils might also provide useful prognostic information. A Cox model, generated with five variables representing features recorded regularly (the first five listed), permitted segregation of these patients into three groups with significantly different survival patterns. The high-risk group exhibited an actuarial mortality of 30% during the first two years after diagnosis and an annual risk of 30% thereafter. In contrast, the most favorable group had a two-year actuarial mortality of 9% and an average risk thereafter of 17% per year, with a median survival of 5 1/2 years. We conclude that it should be possible to classify potential candidates for bone marrow transplantation according to risk with conventional therapy.

AML-CFUs considered as representatives of the leukemia precursor cell compartment were phenotyped for cell surface markers by use of eight monoclonal antibodies directed against myeloid differentiation antigens and the Ia antigen. Thus, specifically depleted (in complement-dependent lysis) or selected (in fluorescence-activated cell sorting), cells were inoculated into colony culture. We report here that AML-CFU surface phenotypes showed considerable variability among the seven patients with AML studied. The clonogenic cells were heterogeneous with regard to the antigen density on the cell surface and represented a distinct population among the leukemias. The immunophenotypes of AML-CFU did not differ as a consequence of variations of colony techniques, ie, the use of different stimulatory materials. The marrow and blood, as shown in four subjects, contained AML-CFU of identical maturation stages. In addition, the direct cellular offspring of AML-CFUs were phenotyped. This was done by analyzing the colonies produced in culture, and it was apparent that their antigenic markers were compatible with later stages of differentiation. For example, AML-CFUs in all patients were granulocytic antigen B4.3-negative, whereas their colony progeny contained significant numbers of B4.3-positive cells. This direct evidence indicating that progenitors and descendant cells in AML are identified by distinct maturation features corroborates the concept that the heterogeneous cellular structure of human AML is a reflection of the apparent differentiation capabilities of the precursors. The fact that the differentiation markers of the leukemia are variably expressed or even lacking on AML-CFUs has clinical importance in the immunodiagnosis of residual leukemia and in immunoseparation of leukemia from autologous bone marrow grafts.","['Lowenberg, B', 'Bauman, J G']","['Lowenberg B', 'Bauman JG']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation', 'Clone Cells', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/genetics', 'Leukocytes/*classification/immunology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Phenotype']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)80950-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 Dec;66(6):1225-32.,,,,,,,,

The atypical cells appeared to belong to the T-lineage demonstrating OKT11 positivity, E-rosette formation, tartrate-sensitive acid phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase activity, and consistent negativity for cytoplasmic and/or surface monoclonal immunoglobulins. However, they failed to stain for other T-lymphocyte-associated antigens, such as those defined by OKT3, OKT4, OKT6, OKT8, OKT9, OKT10, Leu-2a and Leu-3a monoclonal antibodies, and did not express a definite alpha-naphthyl-acetate esterase pattern. Additional studies including phagocytosis tests and a series of monoclonal antibodies against phagocytic and natural killer cell associated antigens were all negative. No HTLV-I related sequences were found in either the cells infiltrating the skin or in circulating lymphocytes.

Although other organisms have been shown to cause fungal infections in patients with acute leukemia, only Candida and Aspergillus species are discussed formally in terms of diagnosis and therapy.","['Holleran, W M', 'Wilbur, J R', 'DeGregorio, M W']","['Holleran WM', 'Wilbur JR', 'DeGregorio MW']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Rev Infect Dis,Reviews of infectious diseases,7905878,['7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Administration, Oral', 'Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Fever/complications/drug therapy', 'Granulocytes/transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy/therapy', 'Mycoses/complications/*drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Neutropenia/complications/drug therapy']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/clinids/7.5.619 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Infect Dis. 1985 Sep-Oct;7(5):619-24. doi: 10.1093/clinids/7.5.619.,,,,40,,,,

One clone, pM1-11, contains all three exons of human c-myc. The second clone, pM4-10, represents a relatively rare transcript that initiated in the first intron and includes the coding exons 2 and 3. The cDNA insert in pM1-11 was used to express the human c-myc protein in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Insertion of the coding sequences in exons 2 and 3 into the appropriate expression vectors yielded detectable c-myc protein in Escherichia coli lacking the Lon protease and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae upon induction. The protein produced in E. coli has an apparent size of 60 kDa and appears to be unmodified, as it is identical in size to the protein synthesized in an in vitro system. In contrast, yeast cells synthesize two myc proteins, of 60 kDa and 62 kDa. The difference in apparent molecular mass between the two proteins appears to be due, in part, to phosphorylation. Subcellular fractionation of yeast cells showed that the c-myc phosphoprotein is located predominantly in the nuclear fraction.","['Miyamoto, C', 'Chizzonite, R', 'Crowl, R', 'Rupprecht, K', 'Kramer, R', 'Schaber, M', 'Kumar, G', 'Poonian, M', 'Ju, G']","['Miyamoto C', 'Chizzonite R', 'Crowl R', 'Rupprecht K', 'Kramer R', 'Schaber M', 'Kumar G', 'Poonian M', 'Ju G']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/genetics', 'Escherichia coli/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*genetics', 'Species Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.21.7232 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Nov;82(21):7232-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.21.7232.,PMC390823,,,,,,,

Sixty-three patients with acute leukemia were studied during the induction phase of chemotherapy; 28 patients with solid tumors who were starting intensive chemotherapy were also enrolled and treated for 2 months. There was no significant difference in the frequency of febrile episodes between the 43 children receiving trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and the 48 receiving placebo. However, when the group of 74 children who experienced granulocytopenia (absolute granulocyte count less than 500/microL) was analyzed separately, significant reductions in the frequencies of confirmed bacteremia (2.6% v 20.0%, P = .02) and febrile episodes (35.9% v 65.7%, P = .01) were observed in the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole group. Furthermore, life table analysis showed that children with leukemia receiving trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole had significantly more days without fever and without bacteremia. No benefits from prophylaxis were recognized in the subgroup with solid tumors. Although the frequency of oral thrush was greater (P = .02) in the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole group (25.6%) than in the placebo group (6.3%), invasive fungal infection did not occur. Although the mean duration of granulocytopenia was greater among those receiving trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (13.7 v 9.0 days, P = .05), this did not appear to increase the overall risk for bacterial infection. These data suggest that trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole reduces the frequency of bacteremia and febrile episodes in granulocytopenic children undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia.","['Kovatch, A L', 'Wald, E R', 'Albo, V C', 'Prin, W', 'Orlando, S J', 'Wollman, M R', 'Phebus, C K', 'Shapiro, E D']","['Kovatch AL', 'Wald ER', 'Albo VC', 'Prin W', 'Orlando SJ', 'Wollman MR', 'Phebus CK', 'Shapiro ED']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)', 'AN164J8Y0X (Trimethoprim)', 'JE42381TNV (Sulfamethoxazole)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Infective Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Combinations/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Random Allocation', 'Sulfamethoxazole/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Trimethoprim/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pediatrics. 1985 Nov;76(5):754-60.,,,,,,,,

Regarding acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (ANLL) exposure to ionizing radiation is a well-documented risk factor. According to several recent studies exposure to strong electromagnetic fields may be suspected to be of etiologic importance for ANLL. There is evidence that occupational handling of benzene is a risk factor and other organic solvents may also be leukaemogenic. Occupational exposure to petrol products has been proposed to be a risk factor although the hazardous substances have not yet been defined. Results of cytogenetic studies in ANLL suggest that exposure to certain environmental agents may be associated with relatively specific clonal chromosome aberrations. These results are of interest because it has been proposed that chromosomal rearrangements may play a role in the activation of cellular oncogens. Exposure in utero to ionizing radiation has been proposed to be a risk factor for acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) in children. Unlike ANLL there seems at present to be little evidence that ALL is related to exposure to some chemicals. Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) may follow exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation whereas such exposure seems to be of insignificant importance for the development of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). According to some studies an abnormally high incidence of CLL may be found among farmers in the USA. These results have not been confirmed in Scandinavian studies. There seems to be little evidence that CML or CLL are related to occupational handling of some chemicals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS),"['Brandt, L']",['Brandt L'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother,Medical oncology and tumor pharmacotherapy,8405039,"['0 (Gasoline)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Benzene/adverse effects', 'Cattle', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Electromagnetic Phenomena', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Gasoline/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02934774 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother. 1985;2(1):7-10. doi: 10.1007/BF02934774.,,,,35,,,,

Clinical stages IA and II2A received three courses of mechlorethamine, Oncovin, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) and supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy (40 Gy), and no laparotomy was performed. Clinical stages II3+A and IIB received either six cycles of MOPP (H 72), three cycles of MOPP, or three cycles of CCNU, vinblastine, procarbazine, and prednisone (CVPP) (H 77) and subsequently had a laparotomy followed by supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy and a lumboaortic field if results of laparotomy were positive. Patients without evidence of mediastinal involvement did not have mediastinal radiotherapy. At the completion of therapy, the disease in 70 of 72 patients was in complete remission (one failure, one death during treatment). Eight patients relapsed (in situ, 1; marginal, 1; nonirradiated subdiaphragmatic area, 6) after three to 57 months of complete remission (median 20 months); one patient died after relapse. There were three deaths after complete remission of the disease (infection, two; acute nonlymphocytic leukemia [ANLL], one). As of June 1984 the median follow-up was 82 months (range, 49 to 145 months), the actuarial probabilities for survival and freedom from relapse for all patients being 91.6% and 87.6%, respectively. There was no statistical difference according to clinical stage, age (greater than 15 or less than 15 years), sex, or number of cycles of chemotherapy (six or three). Bone growth defects related to radiotherapy were reduced particularly in the 29 patients who did not receive mediastinal radiotherapy. None of these patients had a mediastinal relapse.

Kinetics of cell spreading and elongation were studied using computerized image analysis and SEM. In contrast to 745 A cells, FN-sensitive clones (referred to as FF clones) showed elaborate MT networks when observed by immunofluorescent staining as well as by TEM. A good correlation was found between the degree of spreading and elongation of FF cells and the degree and cellular distribution of their MT. The highest concentration of MT networks oriented parallel to the main cellular axis was observed in very elongated FF cells. The majority of MT in interphase FF cells radiated from the centrosomes; some MT apparently originated from the nuclear membranes. TEM showed the existence of morphological differences between centrosomes of 745 A and FF cells. The characteristic ultrastructure of the centrosomes of FF cells was maintained in trypsinized cells, even if such FF cells lost MT's and acquired a spherical morphology. FF cells, treated with a wide spectrum of MT-disrupting agents, promptly acquired a rounded morphology with rapid dissolution of polymerized tubulin. Removal of MT-disrupting agents from the culture medium rapidly restored a flattened morphology with concurrent regeneration of MT's. During recovery from MT-disrupting agents, FF cells showed increased numbers of centrosomes per cell. We conclude that MT networks cooperate in the attachment, spreading and elongation of FF cells isolated from FLC. Moreover, we hypothesize the existence in FF cells of a variant form of centrosomes as compared with those of 745 A cells.","['Benedetto, A', 'Amici, C', 'Djaczenko, W', 'Zaniratti, S', 'Elia, G']","['Benedetto A', 'Amici C', 'Djaczenko W', 'Zaniratti S', 'Elia G']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Cytochalasins)', '0 (Tubulin)', '22144-77-0 (Cytochalasin D)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'Cold Temperature', 'Cytochalasin D', 'Cytochalasins/pharmacology', 'Cytoskeleton/drug effects', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microtubules/analysis/*ultrastructure', 'Tubulin/analysis/immunology']",1985/11/15 00:00,1985/11/15 00:01,['1985/11/15 00:00'],"['1985/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910360513 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1985 Nov 15;36(5):591-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910360513.,,,,,,,,

The descriptive work has demonstrated consistent differences in the incidence rates of these cancers by anatomic site, age, race, and gender. It is clear that the various forms of cancer during childhood have distinctive patterns of occurrence. To a large extent, the characteristic population distributions of these diseases may represent differences in the underlying etiologic processes. Analytic studies of cancer during childhood have addressed possible genetic and environmental risk factors for these diseases. Single gene mutations, as manifested through autosomal recessive or dominant inheritance, have been shown to predispose to cancers of children. Some of the children affected by these syndromes also exhibit specific chromosomal abnormalities. The demonstration of cancers induced by transplacental exposure to diethylstilbestrol has confirmed the speculation that the prenatal environment may influence subsequent carcinogenesis. Although possible leukemogenic effects of intrauterine diagnostic irradiation remain controversial, the issue may become unimportant clinically as prenatal irradiation is replaced by other diagnostic modalities (194). To date, studies of prenatal ultrasound have provided no evidence of an overall excess of subsequent malignancies. Postnatal exposure to high doses of irradiation is known to produce considerable excesses of leukemias and other cancers. At present, there are insufficient data available to reach a firm conclusion on the possible carcinogenic effects of exposure during childhood to low doses of irradiation, fringe magnetic fields, or chemicals. The evaluation of parental occupations as risk factors for cancer in children will require more detailed characterization of the timing, duration, and intensity of exposures. The many unresolved questions about the epidemiology of cancer in children will provide challenging areas for future investigation. In contemplating such research, care must be taken to avoid the shortcomings of earlier studies. As a general rule, because of sample size limitations, the unconfirmed risk factors for cancer in children are those with threefold excess risk or less. Therefore, it is essential that future investigations have sufficient statistical power to detect even modest associations. That is, studies with small sample sizes, which are likely to lead to inconclusive results on these putative risk factors, should be avoided. There are several possible resources available for conducting large epidemiological studies of cancer in children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Greenberg, R S', 'Shuster, J L Jr']","['Greenberg RS', 'Shuster JL Jr']",['eng'],"['N01-CN-55429/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CN-61027/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Epidemiol Rev,Epidemiologic reviews,7910703,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Asia', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Racial Groups', 'Seasons', 'Sex Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'United States']",1985/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.epirev.a036284 [doi]'],ppublish,Epidemiol Rev. 1985;7:22-48. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.epirev.a036284.,,,,194,,,,

The relatively benign chronic phase invariably deteriorates to a refractory and rapidly fatal terminal phase. This terminal stage has been found to have two major subtypes as defined by morphologic, cytochemical, immunologic, and enzymatic criteria--myeloblastoid and lymphoblastoid. Aggressive combination chemotherapy has achieved minimal improvement in survival once the terminal phase has begun, perhaps because only Ph1-positive stem cells remain to repopulate the marrow at this stage. Bone marrow transplantation has also been unsuccessful as therapy for the terminal phase, possibly because the patients are too debilitated to tolerate transplantation once the terminal phase has begun. Combination chemotherapy has been applied in an effort to eliminate the Ph1 chromosome-containing clone during the chronic phase. This goal has not yet been consistently achieved. Chemotherapy has also not been able to delay the onset of the terminal phase nor to prolong survival. Even in those patients in whom the Ph1 chromosome-containing clone has been eliminated, relapse to the chronic phase with return of the Ph1 chromosome has generally occurred within a brief period of time. Bone marrow transplantation during the chronic phase may hold the promise of true cure for CML, with permanent elimination of the malignant clone. However, the chronic phase can be unpredictably long and patients in the chronic phase often have few, if any symptoms. Therefore, there has been a reluctance to employ drastic therapy during the chronic phase. Techniques to predict the transformation to the terminal phase prior to overt morphologic or clinical conversion are now being developed. It may be possible in the future to attempt HLA-matched sibling donor bone marrow transplantation at the earliest signs of transformation from the chronic to the terminal phase. In this manner, optimal survival might be achieved by allowing patients to be maintained in the chronic phase for as long as possible prior to the initiation of aggressive therapy. Until this is routinely possible, continued research designed to improve the therapy of the terminal phase must be pursued. These attempts are likely to include the development and evaluation of new chemotherapeutic agents, novel methods of administration of existing drugs to better exploit their pharmacokinetics (for example, continuous infusion), and the utilization of newly described treatment approaches (such as the use of ""differentiating"" agents in an attempt to prevent progression to blastic transformation).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Allen, S L', 'Coleman, M']","['Allen SL', 'Coleman M']",['eng'],"['CA 07968/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL07029/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,['EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Body Temperature', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Platelet Count', 'Prognosis', 'Splenectomy']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/07357908509039811 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Invest. 1985;3(5):491-503. doi: 10.3109/07357908509039811.,,,,,,,,

The cytochemical T score, was obtained from typical AP, BGLU, and ANAE reactivity. The same was done for the cytochemical non-T score and macrophage (Mo) score. All patients received cyclosporine A (CyA) for graft-v-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis. In univariate analysis there was no significant correlation between the proportion of E rosettes, OKT3-, OKT8-, DR-, and BT5/9-positive cells, and GvHD. The first three showed instead a positive correlation with time from transplant: E rosettes (P = .02), OKT3 (P = .01), and OKT8 (P = .003). In contrast, a significant negative correlation was found in univariate analysis, between the cytochemical T score and GvHD (P = .0001), and a positive correlation between non-T score and GvHD (P = .0008), as well as between the Mo score and GvHD (P = .03). There was no influence of time from transplant on the T (P = .8), non-T (P = .8), or Mo score (P = .4). In multivariate analysis comparing E rosettes, OKT3, T score, non-T score, GvHD, and time from BMT, the only variable associated with GvHD was the T score (P less than .05).

Significantly more patients with CIF in serum had infections compared to the group with normal susceptibility to infections. The combination of low Ig levels and CIF in serum discriminated even better between the infection-prone and non-infection-prone patients. CIF in serum was not correlated to tumour cell mass - estimated by Rai clinical staging - tumour progression or deoxythymidine kinase, S-TK, an enzyme that may reflect proliferating cells.

Thus the composition of different series of patients varies considerably. Furthermore, the outcome of treatment is recorded in different ways. Uniformity in the diagnostic categories entered would reduce the variance in survival between different trials: for example, trials in myelomatosis should exclude patients with monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance, non-progressive or indolent myeloma, extramedullary plasmacytoma, and plasma-cell leukaemia. The subdivision into simple prognostic groupings such as those proposed by the Medical Research Council is helpful in interpreting the survival patterns in different trials in which the proportions of patients in different prognostic groups are likely to vary.

(Formula: see text) Fig. 2. HMBA-mediated cellular and molecular changes during induced MELC terminal erythroid differentiation. See text for detailed discussion. HMBA-induced differentiation is accompanied by an acceleration of transcription at the alpha 1 and beta maj globin loci. MELC are virus-transformed cells blocked in erythroid lineage development. MELC have acquired a pattern of DNA hypomethylation, nuclease sensitivity, and partially disrupted nucleosome configuration of the chromatin containing the transcriptionally inactive alpha 1 and beta maj globin domains, which distinguish them from the domains of nonerythroid transcribed genes, e.g. immunoglobulin or albumin, or ribosomal RNA genes which are actively transcribed in uninduced cells. HMBA-mediated MELC differentiation is associated with changes in chromatin configuration, characterized by an increased disruption of the nucleosome structure across the structural nucleotide sequences of alpha 1 and beta maj globin genes and the appearance of nuclease hypersensitive sites 5' upstream from the alpha 1 and beta maj genes. The alteration in chromatin structure appears to precede increased transcription of these genes. Inducer-mediated loss of proliferative capacity involves a complex multistep process during which the cells accumulate factor(s), probably mRNA(s), required for the synthesis of proteins which are, in turn, required for expression of the commitment process and activation of globin gene transcription. Characterization of these genes whose expression is modulated in HMBA-induced commitment to terminal cell division is in process.","['Marks, P A', 'Sheffery, M', 'Rifkind, R A']","['Marks PA', 'Sheffery M', 'Rifkind RA']",['eng'],"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P0 CA-31768/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Chromatin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/analysis', 'DNA/analysis', 'DNA Replication', 'Erythroblasts/cytology', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Methylation', 'Models, Genetic', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1985;191:185-203.,,,,64,,,,

However, the doses needed equal or exceed the tolerance of vital organs at risk. Thus precision and reliability of treatment are required. A new concept of TBI is introduced, combining a patient translation whole-body irradiation technique with the beam-zone method for individual treatment planning. The patient rests first in the prone, then in the supine position on a specially constructed flat couch and is moved horizontally with a preset constant velocity, completely through a vertical 60Co beam, twice for PA/AP TBI. This technique enlarges the useful beam size, improves the photon fluence uniformity, and reduces the depth-dose inhomogeneity. In translation irradiation, the product of velocity and integrated dose is the significant measurement. This velocity-dose product can be described sufficiently as a function of the local thickness and the local effective field size. Using the beam-zone method, calculation and checking of the dose at reference points in homogeneous, inhomogeneous, or shielded regions is simplified and reduces to taking dose measurements at the center of equivalent square phantoms. Since April 1983, about 20 leukemia patients received TBI by this individually planned translation-irradiation technique. A dose homogeneity within +/- 7% is achieved in the entire body.","['Quast, U']",['Quast U'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Med Phys,Medical physics,0425746,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*radiotherapy', 'Models, Anatomic', 'Radiotherapy/instrumentation/methods', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/instrumentation/methods']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1118/1.595677 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Phys. 1985 Sep-Oct;12(5):567-74. doi: 10.1118/1.595677.,,,,,,,,

Less well appreciated, however, is the progression of such pancreatitis in some patients to pseudocyst formation and the possible necessity for surgical management. Two adolescent girls who developed pancreatic pseudocysts while being treated with L-asparaginase are described in this report. Both were being treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia for periods of 18 and 4 months, respectively, prior to the onset of pancreatitis. Both were in remission of their leukemic disease when typical clinical and laboratory manifestations of acute pancreatitis developed. In one girl, a pancreatic pseudocyst became apparent 2 weeks following the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and in the other girl, this complication developed over a period of 8 weeks. The usual nonsurgical management of pancreatitis over protracted periods of time was ineffective in the treatment of the pseudocysts.

All cell samples showed a clonal B-cell population. More blood lymphocytes than lymph node cells expressed the monoclonal SmIg (mu or gamma, p = 0.04; kappa or lambda, p less than 0.01), and T-cells were more frequent in lymph nodes (p = 0.01), where the T helper/suppressor ratio was higher.

We found that irradiated layers from normal long-term marrow cultures supported granulopoiesis in normal allogeneic marrow cells. This effect, manifested by increased CFU-C production, was amplified when the irradiated layers were overlaid with normal allogeneic marrow initially depleted of these stem cells with cytotoxic anti-Ia (HLA-DR) antibodies. In contrast, there was no regeneration of CFU-C from normal marrow depleted of these progenitors after incubation with irradiated layers from chronic myelogenous leukemia cultures or with passaged marrow fibroblasts.

This application can be divided into two general categories: practical and theoretical. The practical applications reside in utilizing karyotypic changes, particularly in leukemias and lymphomas, not only for diagnostic purposes but also for predicting response to therapy and prognosis. This is especially evident in the various acute nonlymphocytic leukemias and in most of the acute lymphoblastic leukemias. Thus, a definite correlation exists between the cytogenetic findings and the various clinical, laboratory, and cytologic parameters of most of the leukemias. Undoubtedly, these leukemias will ultimately be classified and defined more in terms of their cytogenetic aspects than any other. Though the application in lymphoma is not at the same level as that in leukemia, developments in that field certainly indicate a similar utilization of the cytogenetic findings in these diseases. The presence or absence of a Ph1 chromosome in a chronic myelocytic leukemia has been utilized widely, not only in the diagnosis but also in the predictability of response; the cytogenetic findings have also been utilized in predicting the blastic phase of disease. The list of specific chromosome changes in various solid tumors is of a lesser number, but significant developments indicate that the applicability of chromosome changes in these diseases will, also, be established in the near future. The application of chromosome findings to theoretical aspects of malignancy has assumed an important place recently in the demonstration that so-called oncogenes (or proto-oncogenes) are located or associated with areas of human chromosomes in which breaks and translocations are involved. Thus, it appears that chromosome changes in human malignancy, once their specificity is established, are important parameters in the clinical and theoretical aspects of the disease. A discussion will also be given on primary vs. secondary chromosome changes and their significance in the biology and behavior of the malignancy.","['Sandberg, A A']",['Sandberg AA'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci,Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,8914816,['0 (Heterochromatin)'],IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosome Fragility', 'Female', 'Heterochromatin/ultrastructure', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Oncogenes', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10408368509165844 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci. 1985;22(3):219-74. doi: 10.3109/10408368509165844.,,,,155,,,,

Forskolin increased basal adenylate cyclase activity maximally 2-fold at 100 microM. However, adenylate cyclase activity stimulated via the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein, Ns, by fluoride and the stable GTP analog, guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), was inhibited by forskolin. Half-maximal and maximal inhibition occurred at about 1 and 10 microM forskolin, respectively. The inhibition occurred without an apparent lag phase, whereas the enzyme stimulation by forskolin was preceded by a considerable lag period. The inhibition was not affected by treating intact cells or membranes with pertussis toxin and proteolytic enzymes, respectively, which have been shown in other cell types to prevent adenylate cyclase inhibition mediated by the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory component, Ni. The forskolin inhibition of the stable GTP analog-activated adenylate cyclase was impaired by increasing the Mg2+ concentration and was reversed into a stimulation by Mn2+. Under optimal inhibitory conditions, forskolin even decreased basal adenylate cyclase activity. Finally, forskolin largely reduced the apparent affinity of the rat basophilic leukemia cell adenylate cyclase for its substrate, MgATP, which reduction resulted in an apparent inhibition at low MgATP concentrations and a loss of the inhibition at higher MgATP concentrations. The data indicate that forskolin can cause both stimulation and inhibition of adenylate cyclase and, furthermore, they suggest that the inhibition may not be mediated by the Ni protein, but may be caused by a direct action of forskolin at the adenylate cyclase catalytic moiety.","['Jakobs, K H', 'Watanabe, Y']","['Jakobs KH', 'Watanabe Y']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Adenylyl Cyclase Inhibitors)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",IM,"['Adenylyl Cyclase Inhibitors', 'Adenylyl Cyclases/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Basophils/enzymology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Colforsin/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)"", 'Guanosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology']",1985/09/30 00:00,1985/09/30 00:01,['1985/09/30 00:00'],"['1985/09/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/30 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(85)90006-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(85)90006-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1985 Sep 30;846(3):356-63. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(85)90006-0.,,,,,,,,

Malignant cell differentiation as a potential therapeutic approach.,293-302,"Most drugs available for cancer chemotherapy exert their effects through cytodestruction. Although significant advances have been attained with these cytotoxic agents in several malignant diseases, response is often accompanied by significant morbidity and many common malignant tumours respond poorly to existing cytotoxic therapy. Development of chemotherapeutic agents with non-cytodestructive actions appears desirable. Considerable evidence exists which indicates that (a) the malignant state is not irreversible and represents a disease of altered maturation, and (b) some experimental tumour systems can be induced by chemical agents to differentiate to mature end-stage cells with no proliferative potential. Thus, it is conceivable that therapeutic agents can be developed which convert cancer cells to benign forms. To study the phenomenon of blocked maturation, squamous carcinoma SqCC/Y1 cells were employed in culture. Using this system it was possible to demonstrate that physiological levels of retinoic acid and epidermal growth factor were capable of preventing the differentiation of these malignant keratinocytes into a mature tissue-like structure. The terminal differentiation caused by certain antineoplastic agents was investigated in HL-60 promyelocytic leukaemia cells to provide information on the mechanism by which chemotherapeutic agents induce cells to by-pass a maturation block. The anthracyclines aclacinomycin A and marcellomycin were potent inhibitors of N-glycosidically linked glycoprotein biosynthesis and transferrin receptor activity, and active inducers of maturation; temporal studies suggested that the biochemical effects were associated with the differentiation process. 6-Thioguanine produced cytotoxicity in parental cells by forming analog nucleotide. In hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase negative HL-60 cells the 6-thiopurine initiated maturation; this action was due to the free base (and possibly the deoxyribonucleoside), a finding which separated termination of proliferation due to cytotoxicity from that caused by maturation.","['Sartorelli, A C']",['Sartorelli AC'],['eng'],"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-08341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28852/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Naphthacenes/pharmacology', 'Thioguanine/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1985.193 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1985 Sep;52(3):293-302. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1985.193.,PMC1977206,,,105,,,,

Excessive proliferation of mature cells leads to an overproduction of terminally differentiated blood cells (chronic MPD). Inability of cells to mature results in the accumulation of poorly differentiated blast cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow (acute MPD). Because the lesion appears to be at the level of the hematopoietic stem cell, all cell lines in the bone marrow may be affected. Diagnosis depends upon the accurate identification of neoplastic cells and the absence of other diseases associated with bone marrow hyperplasia. The prognosis for chronic MPD is guarded, whereas for acute MPD it is grave. Accurate identification of these disorders in animals is important.

Low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) and extracorporeal, or mediastinal, radiotherapy did not appear to be superior to chemotherapy in most trials. Only the fractionated low-dose (600-800 rad) splenic irradiation was found to induce a long-lasting decrease of the lymphocyte count and a decrease in bone marrow infiltration in a significant proportion of cases, without any noticeable haematological toxicity. But new data is recently emerging; stratification of CLL in various subgroups, better understanding of the role of the normal T-cell subsets, better knowledge of the interaction between irradiation and haematopoiesis, and of the radiosensitivity of the various lymphocyte subpopulations. Thus one can now reconsider the possible role radiotherapy, and particularly splenic irradiation, can play as an alternative treatment to chemotherapy for CLL. Haematological toxicity is still limiting the use of TBI. The spleen irradiation avoids this drawback. Recent data suggest that this splenic irradiation could be efficient by means of several mechanisms; the successive destruction, fraction after fraction, of the part of the malignant lymphocyte clone present in the spleen is likely to be the main therapeutic explanation, with the knowledge that the lower the differentiation of the malignant clone, the more efficacious the irradiation. But in parallel, the destruction of the large subset of T-suppressors which is constantly present in the spleen may account for the improvement of the peripheral blood count after splenic irradiation, and possibly for a direct effect towards the malignant clone. With respect to these new data, splenic irradiation clearly needs further clinical evaluation in the treatment of CLL.","['Paule, B', 'Cosset, J M', 'Le Bourgeois, J P']","['Paule B', 'Cosset JM', 'Le Bourgeois JP']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Ireland,Radiother Oncol,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,8407192,,IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*radiotherapy', 'Leukocyte Count/radiation effects', 'Lymphocytes/radiation effects', 'Mediastinum/radiation effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Spleen/radiation effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification', 'Thymus Gland/radiation effects', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0167-8140(85)80061-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-8140(85)80061-x [doi]']",ppublish,Radiother Oncol. 1985 Aug;4(1):45-54. doi: 10.1016/s0167-8140(85)80061-x.,,,,79,,,,

In a study of the acceptable limits of HLA incompatibility, 105 consecutive patients with hematologic cancers who received marrow grafts from haploidentical donors (study group) were compared with 728 similar patients concurrently receiving grafts from HLA genotypically identical siblings (control group). The unshared haplotypes differed variably: 12 were phenotypically but not genotypically identical for HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-D; 63 differed at one locus (A, B, or D); 24 at two loci; and 6 at three. A higher proportion of study patients had delayed engraftment, granulocytopenia, or graft rejection. Acute graft versus host disease occurred earlier and with greater frequency in study patients.

The numeric abnormalities included 4 types of monosomy, 10 trisomies, and a near-haploid category. We determined the relative frequency for each of these anomalies in our practice by reviewing the results of 1,228 consecutive specimens studied between 1979 and 1984 in which a chromosomally abnormal clone was found; 61% of these specimens had one or more of the selected anomalies. The three most common translocations were 9;22 translocations (378 specimens), 8;21 translocations (15 specimens), and unbalanced abnormalities derived from 1;7 translocations (13 specimens).

The electrically fused cells became spherical after switching off the dielectrophoretic field. Fusion between a cell vitally stained with Janus Green and that with Neutral Red resulted in the homokaryon with a mixed color. Intracellular potentials simultaneously recorded from the two cells located on both sides of the homokaryon were identical. The fusion efficiency was remarkably dependent upon temperature, displaying a discontinuity at about 11 degrees C in the Arrhenius plot. The extracellular application of phospholipase-A2 or -C suppressed the fusion yield. Thus, it appears that the phospholipid domains play a crucial role in the electric pulse-induced cell fusion. Treatment of the cells with proteolytic enzymes markedly enhanced the fusion yield, presumably due to removing the glycocalix and/or giving rise to fusion-potent, protein-free lipid domains. The presence of millimolar concentrations of divalent cations (irrespective of Mg2+ or Ca2+) as well as of micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ (but not Mg2+) was prerequisite to the resealing of membranes suffered from electrical breakdown upon exposure to electric pulses. In addition, extracellular Ca2+ (but not Mg2+) ions at more than micromolar concentrations were indispensable for the cell fusion.","['Ohno-Shosaku, T', 'Okada, Y']","['Ohno-Shosaku T', 'Okada Y']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Membr Biol,The Journal of membrane biology,0211301,"['EC 3.1.- (Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Fusion/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrophoresis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L5178/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Peptide Hydrolases/pharmacology', 'Phospholipases/pharmacology', 'Temperature', 'Thermodynamics']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01871522 [doi]'],ppublish,J Membr Biol. 1985;85(3):269-80. doi: 10.1007/BF01871522.,,,,,,,,

The identity of the influx route has been established by the following observations: (A) Phthalate influx is competitively inhibited by methotrexate and the inhibition constant (Ki) is comparable to the Kt for half-maximal influx of methotrexate: (B) Various anions inhibit the influx of phthalate and methotrexate with comparable Ki values; (C) The influx of phthalate and methotrexate both fluctuate in parallel with changes in the anionic composition of the external medium; and (D) A specific covalent inhibitor of the methotrexate transport system (NHS-methotrexate) also blocks the transport of phthalate. In contrast, the efflux of phthalate does not occur via the methotrexate influx carrier, but rather by two separate processes which can be distinguished by their sensitivities to bromosulfophthalein. Efflux via the bromosulfophthalein-sensitive route constitutes 75% of total efflux and is enhanced by glucose and inhibited by oligomycin. The inability of phthalate to exit via the methotrexate influx carrier is due to competing intracellular anions which prevent phthalate from interacting with the methotrexate binding site at the inner membrane surface.","['Henderson, G B', 'Zevely, E M']","['Henderson GB', 'Zevely EM']",['eng'],['CA23970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Membr Biol,The Journal of membrane biology,0211301,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Oligomycins)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Phthalic Acids)', '0C2P5QKL36 (Sulfobromophthalein)', '6O7F7IX66E (phthalic acid)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'Q57971654Y (Thiamine Pyrophosphate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Glucose/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oligomycins/pharmacology', 'Phosphates/pharmacology', 'Phthalic Acids/*metabolism', 'Radioisotope Dilution Technique', 'Sulfobromophthalein/pharmacology', 'Thiamine Pyrophosphate/pharmacology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01871521 [doi]'],ppublish,J Membr Biol. 1985;85(3):263-8. doi: 10.1007/BF01871521.,,,,,,,,

The induction of B cell differentiation into Ig-secreting cells by B151-TRF was specifically inhibited by addition of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc) to culture. Such inhibition appeared to be attributed to the interference of GalNAc in the interaction of TRF with its receptor, because absorption of TRF activity with B cells was notably inhibited by the presence of GalNAc. To substantiate this point further, we established binding assay of B151-TRF molecule to the receptor on B cells by using 125I-labeled TRF fraction enriched by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and gel filtration. The results revealed that the binding of 125I-TRF molecule to the B cells was almost completely blocked by GalNAc. Moreover, the existence of GalNAc residue(s) on B151-TRF molecule was evidenced by the facts that 1) the TRF activity was eluted from lectin gels with specificity for GalNAc as revealed by the functional assay, and 2) the 125I-TRF molecule specifically bound to such lectin gels. Thus, the GalNAc residue(s) on B151-TRF molecule plays an important role in binding of TRF molecule to the receptor and in the stimulation of B cells.

It reacted specifically with a membrane antigen expressed on T and B lymphoblastoid cell lines, a subpopulation of normal thymocytes and bone marrow lymphocytes, lymphocytes from a subset of patients with non-B, non-T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and epithelial stem cells. The latter reactivity was especially striking in the skin, where only basal epidermal keratinocytes and epidermal appendages, including eccrine sweat glands, sebaceous glands and hair follicles, stained positively. A human epidermoid carcinoma cell line was also stained by EL-1. Suprabasilar keratinocytes and acellular keratin did not stain. However, in vitro proliferating fetal lung fibroblasts stained positively. Membrane immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that the antigen recognized by antibody EL-1 is a single protein of molecular weight 105 kilodaltons which did not change with exhaustive chemical reduction. Metabolic radiolabeling studies demonstrated that this protein is synthesized by the cell and not merely taken up from the culture medium.

Three isovolaemic plasma exchanges carried out using a continuous-flow technique were required to reduce this titre to undetectable levels. Neither these procedures nor pretransplantation conditioning of the patient with 60 mg/kg or cyclophosphamide on two consecutive days resulted in overt haemolysis. However, a single identical plasmapheresis 12 hours after completing the second dose of the alkylating agent resulted in profound intravascular haemolysis requiring red cell transfusion. Subsequent studies in five patients receiving the same cyclophosphamide regimen demonstrated that red cell life span, when measured with radiochromium, was reduced from a normal of 25-35 days to a median of 11.5 days. Further studies in the same five patients carried out simultaneously demonstrated that red cell fragility, when assessed in vitro with osmotic or mechanical stress, was marginally increased but became clearly abnormal in only one individual. These doses of cyclophosphamide may result in accelerated but subclinical red cell destruction, and plasma exchange in this period may be associated with rapid intravascular haemolysis.

While this poses no problem to a recipient of marrow from an ABO-compatible donor, it clearly represents a serious risk of intravascular hemolysis for the recipient of an ABO-incompatible marrow. Thus, there is a need for removing incompatible erythrocytes from the marrow preparation. We removed erythrocytes from the marrow preparations by automated centrifugation. The erythrocyte-depleted marrow (EDM) contained a mean of 5 ml erythrocytes, representing an average reduction of 98%. The mean mononuclear cell recovery was 88%, resulting in a mean infusion of 0.6 X 10(8) cells/Kg of recipient's body weight in a final average volume of 155 ml. EDM was infused into 22 ABO-incompatible marrow recipients (21 patients with hematologic malignancies and one patient with aplastic anemia) without clinical evidence of hemolysis. The isohemagglutinin titers of recipients ranged from 4 to 4096 and were not lowered prior to infusion. Engraftment (i.e., recovery of peripheral leukocyte and platelet counts) and incidence of graft versus host disease were similar to those observed in recipients of ABO-compatible marrow transplantation. Erythrocyte engraftment was significantly delayed in only one patient who had a high isohemagglutinin titer. The post-transplantation red cell requirement was increased in EDM recipients: 9 units compared to 6 units in ABO-compatible bone marrow transplanted patients with neither hemolysis nor interference with successful engraftment.","['Sniecinski, I', 'Henry, S', 'Ritchey, B', 'Branch, D R', 'Blume, K G']","['Sniecinski I', 'Henry S', 'Ritchey B', 'Branch DR', 'Blume KG']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Apher,Journal of clinical apheresis,8216305,['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)'],IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/*immunology', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Blood Group Incompatibility/*prevention & control', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Centrifugation', '*Erythrocytes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jca.2920020305 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Apher. 1985;2(3):231-4. doi: 10.1002/jca.2920020305.,,,,,,,,

In the first, complete remission rates and survival were inferior to a group treated on the same regimen in London, suggesting population differences, possibly on the basis of late referral and poor nutritional status. In the second study the addition of the epipodophyllotoxin VP16-213 to conventional doses of doxorubicin and cytosine arabinoside improved complete remission rate and median duration of survival. In the third study this induction programme was unchanged and short duration of intensification was compared with an extended period, but no statistically significant difference was demonstrated. In the fourth study, which is currently active, the role of the epipodophyllotoxin VP16-213 (Cape Town Regimen/CTR III) was compared with the same two agents in combination with thioguanine (DAT), but to date no difference in remission rate or survival is evident. Four conclusions are supported by data from these studies. First, the addition of VP16-213 to doxorubicin and cytosine arabinoside improves complete remission rate, prolongs median duration of complete remission and survival, with shortening of the time taken to achieve this status in our population. Second, evidence to date shows no advantage for the DAT programme containing thioguanine over CTR III in which this latter agent is replaced by the epipodophyllotoxin VP16-213.

These improved results have been due to the combination of cytosar and an anthracycline in RI programs. The current major question is whether or not ""consolidation"" therapy has improved long-term disease-free survival. Our current results, covering the decade 1970-1980 and using more and more intensive RC programs, do not demonstrate an increase in the percentage of long-term survivors. The results from 1980 to 1982 are encouraging, but must be tempered by the fact that late relapses of adult ANLL are becoming more frequent and 2-year follow-up is much too short an evaluation period. In addition, the prolonged survival in program D may be due to the more intensive RI program and not at all related to the RC. At the present time, our experience lends no support to the theory that more intensive RC programs meaningfully prolong long-term survival.","['Rosenthal, D S', 'Emerson, S E', 'Rappeport, J M', 'Moloney, W C', 'Handin, R I']","['Rosenthal DS', 'Emerson SE', 'Rappeport JM', 'Moloney WC', 'Handin RI']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Haematol Blood Transfus,Haematology and blood transfusion,101169459,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-70385-0_9 [doi]'],ppublish,Haematol Blood Transfus. 1985;29:44-7. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-70385-0_9.,,,,,,,,

In this paper evidence that immune effectors are important for this effect is discussed. Injection of retinoic acid (RA) into mice before challenge with allogeneic or syngeneic tumour cells results in a strong increase in cell-mediated cytotoxicity specific for the respective tumour. This stimulation appears to be due to effects taking place before or during the induction phase rather than the effector phase of cell-mediated cytolysis. The effector cells responsible for cytotoxicity express the Thy 1 antigen, are H-2 specific and are therefore T killer cells. The induction of T cell-mediated cytotoxicity requires the participation of the lymphokine interleukin 2 (IL-2). The possibility was tested that RA directly or indirectly influences the production of IL-2 and thereby stimulates the induction of T killer cells. Results indeed show that RA-injected mice display an increased capacity to produce IL-2 upon stimulation of their splenocytes in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. It appears therefore that RA has an effect on T cells that are destined to produce IL-2 upon antigenic challenge. Since IL-2 plays a role not only in the induction of specific cytotoxic T cells but also in the induction of natural killer (NK) cells, RA was also tested in a model system in which NK cells appear to play an important protective role. Results showed that split-dose irradiated mice that lose their NK activity and subsequently develop leukaemia can be protected from leukaemogenesis either by reconstitution with NK cells or by injection with RA. The question of whether this effect is due to stimulation of immune effectors or is a direct effect on the preleukaemic cells is discussed.","['Dennert, G']",['Dennert G'],['eng'],"['CA 37706/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 39501/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Ciba Found Symp,Ciba Foundation symposium,0356636,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/9780470720943.ch8 [doi]'],ppublish,Ciba Found Symp. 1985;113:117-31. doi: 10.1002/9780470720943.ch8.,,,,20,,,,

DNA-protein and DNA interstrand cross-links are formed in cells exposed to either CBDCA or DDP. However, in comparison to DDP peak levels of these lesions occur 6 to 12 h later in CBDCA treated cells. Cytotoxicity studies reveal that CBDCA is 45 times less potent than DDP to L1210 cells when compared on a molar basis. The decreased cytotoxicity of CBDCA and the 12 h delay in peak cross-linking when compared to DDP is interpreted as a decreased reactivity of the intact CBDCA towards the DNA.

Survival of ANLL cells growing in liquid cultures was even more variable after anti-Ia+ complement treatment (28%-227% of control). The presence of Ia-like antigens did not distinguish ANLL cells responding to PHA-conditioned medium from those responding to CSF in either colony or liquid culture. Dose-response curves for ANLL cells in liquid culture were similar before and after treatment with anti-Ia+ complement.

More recently, investigators have made use immunotherapeutically of T-lymphocytes nonspecifically activated in vitro by a number of agents, including lymphokines, lectins, and autologous and allogeneic tumor cells. The limitations for the investigational use of these highly specialized and ""educated"" lymphocytes have been the inability to generate sufficient numbers of cells in vitro for adoptive transfer experiments and to sustain their growth over long periods of time. While marked success has been demonstrated over the years in tumor-bearing animal models, the feasibility of such work in humans has been greatly improved by the experimental expansion and maintenance of immune lymphocytes (those exposed to antigenic challenge) in vitro using either highly purified or recombinant, interleukin 2. As a result, large numbers of lymphocytes can successfully be infused into patients, and whole body scans can show migration of these labeled cells to the lung, liver, and spleen. The use of nontoxic, nonspecific activated ""killer"" lymphocytes is an innovative approach with enormous potential.

The observed rates of protein synthesis inactivation correlated with target antigen expression detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Of the four ITs, T101-ricin (T101-R) exhibited the fastest rate of inactivation, followed in order by G3.7-ricin, TA-1-ricin, and 35.1-ricin. At concentrations greater than 300 ng/mL, a cocktail containing an equimolar amount of all four ITs (referred to as the four-IT cocktail) exhibited kinetics that were as fast or faster than those of T101-R. The long-term cytotoxic effects of individual ITs and the four-IT cocktail were evaluated using a sensitive clonogenic assay. Each IT was specifically cytotoxic and inhibited 1 to 4 logs of clonogenic leukemic cells at doses (300 to 600 ng/mL) that can be used clinically. The four-IT cocktail was highly cytotoxic; a concentration of 300 ng/mL inhibited greater than 4 logs of leukemic cells while sparing the majority of committed (CFU-GM, CFU-E) and pluripotent (CFU-GEMM) hematopoietic stem cells. The determination of both short-term kinetics of protein synthesis inactivation and longer-term inhibition of clonogenic growth allowed new insight into cell killing by IT. Our results suggest that ITs continue to act on clonogenic target cells for a period of three to five days. Interestingly, the four-IT cocktail was not as potent against clonogenic leukemic cells as T101-R alone, although it exhibited kinetics of protein synthesis inhibition that were as fast as those of T101-R alone. This finding suggests that internalized ITs may differ in the length of time they remain active within the cell. Our results also demonstrate the importance of using several different assays to evaluate IT reagents.","['Stong, R C', 'Uckun, F', 'Youle, R J', 'Kersey, J H', 'Vallera, D A']","['Stong RC', 'Uckun F', 'Youle RJ', 'Kersey JH', 'Vallera DA']",['eng'],"['CA-31618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Line', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Ricin/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85504-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 Sep;66(3):627-35.,,,,,,,,

This is true despite the fact that the use of such combinations has a number of potential disadvantages, including (1) antibiotic antagonism; (2) an increased incidence of toxicity; (3) the emergence of multi-resistant organisms; (4) promotion of a false sense of security; and (5) increased expense. The reasons generally given for the use of such combinations include (1) antimicrobial synergism, (2) suppression of antimicrobial resistance, (3) decreased toxicity, and (4) broader coverage. Although there are clearly some situations in which synergistic combinations have been shown to be useful (such as in the treatment of enterococcal endocarditis and severe Pseudomonas infections), the use of combination therapy to reduce the emergence of resistance (excluding the treatment of mycobacterial infections and of infections in which rifampin is used) or to reduce toxicity has not met with widespread success. Indeed, most combinations are used simply to broaden the spectrum of antimicrobial coverage. The development of new penicillins and cephalosporins with broader spectra of activity has raised the distinct possibility that these drugs could be used as single agents for the treatment of most serious infections. Although comparative studies performed to date suggest that the new broad-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins may be useful as single agents in the treatment of infections in a variety of clinical situations in which combinations are now commonly employed, additional studies enrolling greater numbers of patients are necessary to determine whether these agents can replace combination therapy. The use of single-drug therapy in the management of febrile episodes and documented infections in neutropenic patients remains problematic because of the greater likelihood of infections with organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in which case combination therapy is often required. Earlier studies have clearly documented that combinations of antibiotics that are synergistic are more effective in treating bacteremias and other serious infections in neutropenic patients than are combinations that have failed to demonstrate synergism. Because of the increased activity of some of the newer drugs, such as ceftazidime, against P. aeruginosa it is possible that such agents could be used as monotherapy for patients with severe neutropenia. This possibility is an attractive one, but it should be studied carefully to make certain that it will not be associated with significant failure due to the emergence of resistant organisms.","['Moellering, R C Jr']",['Moellering RC Jr'],['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,['0 (Cephalosporins)'],IM,"['Abdomen', 'Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy', 'Cephalosporins/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Endometritis/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Neoplasms/complications']",1985/08/09 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1985/08/09 00:00'],"['1985/08/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1985/08/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(85)90269-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(85)90269-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1985 Aug 9;79(2A):104-9. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(85)90269-4.,,,,,,,,

The periods tested were pretransplant, and 1-3, 4-6, 7-12 and more than 12 months posttransplant. The determination consisted of lymphocyte counts; lymphocyte surface marking using OKT3, OKT4, and OKT8 antibodies; and determination of adherent cells, lysozymes and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against chicken red blood cells, human red blood cells, and CEM cells. Natural killer cells were determined against K562 target cells. Lymphoblastic responses were tested after stimulation with pokeweed mitogen (PWM), concanavalin-A (Con-A), and phytohemagglutinin (PHA). We found that the progression in the leukemic state (first remission, second remission, and relapse), prior to transplantation was paralleled by a decrease in T4 lymphocytes (976/microliter +/- 462; 411/microliter +/- 222; 372/microliter +/- 419; P = .04). There was a lack of helper cells and an inverted T4:T8 ratio beyond one year posttransplant independent of graft-versus-host disease status.

Results of this study showed the following: of the 15 patients who remained in remission during the period of the study, 13 showed no abnormal increase in reactivity with CAMAL-1 (2 patients did show increased levels of reactivity over time); of the four patients relapsing but surviving within this period with ANLL, all showed elevated numbers of cells reactive with CAMAL-1 as long as 3 months prior to relapse (the two relapsing patients who had acute undifferentiated leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia did not show elevations of CAMAL-1-reactive cells); of the 14 patients dying during this time of causes other than leukemia, none had elevated levels of CAMAL-1-reactive cells--and, of 4 patients dying in relapse, all had extremely elevated levels of CAMAL-1-reactive cells as long as 4 months prior to relapse.

In addition, several human T-cell lymphoma-leukaemia virus I-transformed T-cell lines were explored for their capacity to produce factor(s) able to suppress IgE synthesis in the U-266 cell line, and four out of 25 cell lines could be shown to do this in a constitutive manner.

A higher proportion of effector-target conjugates was observed in the presence of human serum. In similar experiments lysis of 1301, Rael, and P3HR-1 cells was unaltered. All cell lines activated the alternative pathway of complement but they varied in the expression of receptors for complement component 3 (C3) and in the ability to fix the C3 cleavage products on their membrane. The enhancement of lysis in the presence of human serum occurred only with those cells that bound C3. This characteristic was correlated to the expression of C3 receptors. Analysis of the nature of the deposited C3 was performed with Raji cells. Raji cells exposed to human serum bound C3b as indicated by the immunoadherence test. The C3b was further processed to C3bi, because the immunoadherence declined with time and conjugate formation increased with Daudi cells, which carry the C3 receptors CR2 and CR3. This suggests that in the lytic assay lymphocytes with C3bi receptors are recruited in the presence of human serum.

Cyclic alternating chemotherapy during remission, and induction of remission and survival of elderly patients].",160-4,"Twenty-five institutions are participating in the AML-6-trial designed to improve remission incidence and to delay the time of relapse. Therefore, an intensive cyclic therapy is employed early after achievement of remission using either the same drugs of the induction regimen or rotating combinations of alternative drugs, e.g. AMSA, 5-AZA and HD-araC. So far, 266 patients entered the trial. The overall C.R. rate is 71%. 58 patients are randomized to 'maintenance' arm I, 54 to arm II, 79/112 patients are still being studied. Toxicity was in 7% and 3% respectively a reason to interrupt the study during induction or 'maintenance'. Since the intensity of modern protocols for remission induction of AML presents a major problem in elderly patients due to toxicity, and since most studies indicate low remission rates with an increasing death rate in this age group, the AML-7-study was initiated to prospectively compare survival and quality of life of two different therapeutic strategies: immediate intensive remission induction versus supportive care, 'wait and see' policy, and palliative cytoreduction with hydroxyurea and ara C when necessary.

For CR maintenance 40 patients were eligible for randomization according to the study protocol: cyclic chemotherapy (CT) alone vs. chemoimmunotherapy (CIT: plus allogeneic Neuraminidase-treated blasts in high dosage). 5 CR patients, induced identically in Essen, were randomized additionally. Evaluating all patients randomized there is only a marginally beneficial effect of CIT (21 patients) compared to CT (24 patients) concerning median survival (1020+ vs. 612 days) and relapse-free survival (494 vs. 380 days) until now. For patients receiving more than 2 cycles of maintenance therapy, however, CIT prolongs relapse-free survival significantly (930+ vs. 409 days; p = 0,02); that is also true for remission duration. This suggests that only repeated application of blasts may induce an immune response leading to a biologically relevant antileukemic effect.","['Urbanitz, D', 'Pielken, H J', 'Koch, P', 'Buchner, T', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Heinecke, A', 'Wendt, F', 'Maschmeier, G', 'van de Loo, J']","['Urbanitz D', 'Pielken HJ', 'Koch P', 'Buchner T', 'Hiddemann W', 'Heinecke A', 'Wendt F', 'Maschmeier G', 'van de Loo J']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'CT protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Random Allocation', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000215644 [doi]'],ppublish,Onkologie. 1985 Jun;8(3):157-9. doi: 10.1159/000215644.,,,,,,,,

Among 35 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), specific insulin binding ranged from 0.09 to 14.8% per 10(6) blasts. A lower level of insulin binding was correlated with T-cell surface markers (P less than 0.003), higher hemoglobin level (P less than 0.005), presence of a mediastinal mass (P less than 0.01), lower glucocorticoid receptor level (P less than 0.02), higher platelet count (P less than 0.04), age less than 2 or greater than 10 yr (P less than 0.05), white blood cell count greater than or equal to 100 X 10(3)/mm3 (P less than 0.06) and higher labeling index (P less than 0.07). It was not correlated with the presence of central-nervous-system disease, FAB classification, or sex. With a follow-up of 24 to 33 + months, insulin binding was not correlated with treatment outcome. Six patients with relapsed ALL and three with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia showed insulin binding levels similar to those in newly diagnosed ALL patients. Blasts from one patient with B-cell ALL and one with chronic myelogenous leukemia were characterized by lower insulin binding, while lymphoblasts from a patient with T-cell lymphoma bound insulin at marginally detectable levels. In vitro studies with IM-9, NALM-1 and NALM-16 cell lines showed that changes in insulin binding caused by dexamethasone treatment were not correlated with hormone-induced cell death.

Infection of W/Wv mice of the spleen focus-forming virus-susceptible genotype Fv-2ss (DBA/2) or Fv-2rs (BD2F1) with Rauscher leukemia virus (RLV) restored the spleen colony-forming capacity of the stem cells. The resulting spleen colonies had normal size and cellularity; the frequency of and ratio between granulocyte-macrophage and erythroid progenitor cells were also normal, without excessive production of erythroid cells. The frequency of spleen colony-forming units (CFU-S) appeared to be strongly reduced in W/Wv mice. The seeding fraction of RLV-infected W/Wv stem cells in the recipient spleens did not differ from that of uninfected or RLV-infected +/+ stem cells. At equivalent numbers of CFU-S, spleen suspensions of RLV-infected W/Wv mice were equally effective as +/+ control suspensions in protecting irradiated mice from death due to bone marrow failure. Thus the number of CFU-S observed appeared to be predictive for the number of W/Wv cells required for effective radioprotection. In irradiated W/Wv mice that received transplants of RLV-infected W/Wv cells, circulating erythrocyte numbers approached those of control mice; the erythrocytes were of normal size, in contrast to the macrocytic red cells of untreated W/Wv mice. The reduced frequency of CFU-S in RLV-infected W/Wv mice can be readily explained by a reduced self-replicating capacity, attributable to the W/Wv genes, which was not reconstituted by infection with RLV.

The use of anthracyclines did not prolong bone marrow recovery, with both groups demonstrating adequate granulocyte and platelet counts about four weeks after beginning treatment. Forty-one (53%) of the total 78 patients achieved a complete remission.

Cells of the HL-60 human promyelocytic cell line, when cultured in the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol), express a surface protein of approximately 50 to 55 kilodaltons (Kd) which was immunoprecipitated with the AML-2-23 MoAb. Furthermore, after 2 days of exposure to calcitriol, HL-60 cells began to release My23 into culture medium, as determined by the ability of culture supernatant from these cells to block the binding of AML-2-23 to myeloid cells. My23 release was almost totally inhibited by incubation of cells at 4 degrees C, and was partially blocked by treatment of cells with cycloheximide or tunicamycin. The culture supernatant blocking factor, soluble My23, was identified as a 45 to 50 Kd protein by Western blot/immune overlay, using AML-2-23 and an 125I-labeled second antibody. My23, which was affinity-purified from culture supernatant, retained the ability to block AML-2-23 binding to myeloid cells. The affinity-purified antigen migrated on SDS-PAGE as a diffuse band in the m.w. range of 44 to 52 Kd. On treatment with endoglycosidase, the apparent m.w. of My23 decreased to approximately 40,000, indicating the presence of carbohydrate residues on My23. Serum from mice immunized with the purified antigen reacted with the same spectrum of myeloid cells as AML-2-23 MoAb, reacted with the My23 soluble protein in immunoblots, and competed with AML-2-23 for binding to myeloid cells. Binding of this antiserum to myeloid cells was blocked by cell supernatant from both monocytes and calcitriol-treated HL-60 cells, suggesting, along with results from m.w. determinations of the two preparations, that the soluble and cell surface forms of My23 are similar. Moreover, based on our finding that human plasma specifically inhibits the binding of AML-2-23 to myeloid cells, My23 may also be released in vivo. The enhanced expression of My23 on activated and more mature myeloid cells and its shedding or secretion by these cells is consistent with a functional role for My23.","['Maliszewski, C R', 'Ball, E D', 'Graziano, R F', 'Fanger, M W']","['Maliszewski CR', 'Ball ED', 'Graziano RF', 'Fanger MW']",['eng'],"['AI19053/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31918/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Blood Proteins/immunology', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Granulocytes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Neuraminidase', 'Peptide Hydrolases']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Sep;135(3):1929-36.,,,,,,,,

Aliquots of medium plus serum were incubated for various times with levels of protease sufficient to induce approximately 50% of the cells to the B+ state. Cells were added to protease-pretreated serum either before or after inactivation of the protease. In all cases, enzymatically active protease had to be present with the cells to induce B+ cells to form. Serum and other components of the medium pretreated with protease were inactive. Mouse erythroleukemia cells grown in the absence of serum were also induced by proteases to form B+ cells.

It is therefore of great concern to assess the quantitative cancer risk of exposure to radiations of different quality and to obtain information on the dose-response relationships for carcinogenesis. Tissues in the human with a high sensitivity for cancer induction include the bone marrow, the lung, the thyroid and the breast in women. If the revised dosimetry estimates for the Japanese survivors of the atomic bomb explosions are correct, there is no useful data base left to derive r.b.e. values for human carcinogenesis. As a consequence, it will be necessary to rely on results obtained in biological systems, including experimental animals, for these estimates. With respect to radiation protection, the following aspects of experimental studies on radiation carcinogenesis are of relevance: Assessment of the nature of dose-response relationships. Determination of the relative biological effectiveness of radiations of different quality. Effects of fractionation or protraction of the dose on tumour development. For the analysis of tumour data in animals, specific approaches have to be applied which correct for competing risks. These methods include actuarial estimates, non-parametric models and analytical models. The dose-response curves for radiation-induced cancers in different tissues vary in shape. This is exemplified by studies on myeloid leukaemia in mice and mammary neoplasms in different rat strains. The results on radiation carcinogenesis in animal models clearly indicate that the highest r.b.e. values are observed for neutrons with energies between 0.5 and 1 MeV. On the basis of such results it might be concluded that the maximum quality factor of 10 for neutrons should be increased. Based on current evidence, an increase by a factor of 2 to 3 seems more realistic than a tenfold rise. The diversity of dose-response relationships point to different mechanisms involved in the induction of different tumours in various species and even in different strains of the same species.","['Broerse, J J', 'Hennen, L A', 'van Zwieten, M J']","['Broerse JJ', 'Hennen LA', 'van Zwieten MJ']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Int J Radiat Biol Relat Stud Phys Chem Med,"International journal of radiation biology and related studies in physics, chemistry, and medicine",0374725,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/etiology', 'Adenofibroma/etiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/radiation effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Dogs', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Fast Neutrons', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/etiology', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/etiology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', '*Radiation Protection', 'Rats', 'Relative Biological Effectiveness']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09553008514551171 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol Relat Stud Phys Chem Med. 1985 Aug;48(2):167-87. doi: 10.1080/09553008514551171.,,,,49,,,,

Such antigens, which are capable of eliciting specific transplantation resistance in histocompatible mice, have been previously detected by in vivo and in vitro cell-mediated immune responses. In the present report we address the question of the humoral antibody response to a chemically xenogenized lymphoma. Histocompatible mice were given several injections of live cells of the xenogenized tumor. Ten days after each immunization, pooled sera from different animals were analyzed for Ab content by means of flow microfluorometry analysis and CEL-ISA assay. The results reveal that antibodies of both IgG and IgM classes capable of binding the xenogenized tumor can already be detected after one single sensitization. However, the Ab titer gradually increases through subsequent immunizations, reaching a peak level after 3-4 injections at a time when most of the humoral response is made up of antibodies of IgG class. The specificity of the anti-xenogenized tumor hyperimmune sera was subsequently investigated by its reaction with the parental, non-xenogenized line and with normal tissue cells of the same or allogeneic haplotypes. The data obtained point out that cross-reactivity with the parental line could be completely removed by absorption of the hyperimmune sera on parental cells, which removed most of the IgM antibodies. Moreover, the presence of an excess of anti-parental antibodies on the xenogenized tumor cells does not prevent the subsequent binding of the hyperimmune absorbed serum, thus indicating that the novel determinant(s) recognized on xenogenized cells are not spatially related to those shared with the original parental tumor. In addition, the hyperimmune absorbed serum does not cross-react with normal hemopoietic or lymphoid cells of the same (H-2d) or allogeneic H-2b and H-2k haplotypes. Furthermore, no alien histocompatibility antigens of H-2b or H-2k haplotypes could be detected on the xenogenized tumor cell surface. Taken together, these data provide evidence that chemical xenogenization of a murine lymphoma leads to the appearance of novel determinant(s) detectable by specific antibodies.","['Romani, L', 'Puccetti, P', 'Fioretti, M C', 'Mage, M G']","['Romani L', 'Puccetti P', 'Fioretti MC', 'Mage MG']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Complement System Proteins/physiology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dacarbazine', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Haploidy', 'Immunoglobulin G/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Leukemia L5178/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains']",1985/08/15 00:00,1985/08/15 00:01,['1985/08/15 00:00'],"['1985/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910360215 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1985 Aug 15;36(2):225-31. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910360215.,,,,,,,,

The role of initial bimodal therapy (RT and chemotherapy [CT]) and the use of CT in patients who suffer relapse after initial treatment with RT alone are reviewed. On the basis of prognostic factors, subgroups of patients for whom bimodal therapy is recommended, including those with a bulky mediastinal mass, have now been identified. Although treatment is highly successful, debilitating consequences of RT and CT, such as infertility, infection and second malignant diseases, remain.

One case of MF had a cytotoxic/suppressor (T4- T8+ 3A1+) phenotype; one with frequent blastic cells showed only weak expression of T4 antigen; 2 cases of SS were T11-. Tumor cells infiltrating the skin expressed 3Al antigen in 44% and cellular activation antigens Ia and/or Tac in 78% of patients with MF/SS. No consistent phenotypic differences were found between ATL cells from ATLV (HTLV) antibody-positive patients and tumor cells of patients with MF/SS who lacked this antibody. In contrast, a group of nonepidermotropic T-cell lymphomas showed phenotypic differences from MF/SS and ATL in all but 1 case. These cases were distinguished by the frequent absence of T3, T4, and Leu 1 antigens in 3 large-cell lymphomas; frequent expression of Ki-1 antigen, a Hodgkin's disease-associated antigen, in 2 cases with RS-like cells; and an immature thymocyte phenotype in lymphoblastic lymphoma.

The Dade method gave quantitative results closely approaching the stated amount of fibrinogen. The SCT using Sigma reagents gave higher ""fibrinogen"" values, while the CBC reagents gave markedly lower ""fibrinogen"" values. The TWT detected only 25% of the fibrinogen standard. Detection of FSP following plasmin digestion of fibrinogen varied considerably for each test. The TWT, insensitive to most of the native fibrinogen, detected most of the FSP following only 15 minutes of plasmin digestion. In contrast, both assays relying on the SCT were completely negative after 24 hours of plasmin digestion. All four methods yielded FSP titers of less than 10 micrograms/mL in 97 (78.2%) of 124 blood samples from normal donors. The SCT Sigma reagents consistently gave results of less than 10 micrograms/mL in all normal donors. No instance of an FSP value greater than 40 micrograms/mL was noted for the 124 normal donors. Of the 696 patient blood samples tested, the Dade assay gave the highest or equally highest (with respect to another FSP method) value in 604 (87%) cases; the Sigma SCT did so in 360 (52%); the TWT in 316 (45%); and the CBC assay in 184 (26%) cases. The Dade test classified the largest number of blood samples, 328 (47.1%), in the greater than 10 less than 40 micrograms/mL titer category; however, the proportion of cases (32.2%) in which this test yielded values greater than 40 micrograms/mL was about the same as those produced by the Sigma SCT (29.9%) and TWT products (25.8%). Thus, with the exception of the normal (less than 10 micrograms/mL) and the suspicious (10-40 micrograms/mL) range, all three methods (Dade, Sigma, and TWT) are comparable in their abilities to detect abnormal levels of FSP. In the normal range, the Dade method will yield results that are frequently in the suspicious range. The CBC was noticeably inferior in detecting both suspicious and frankly abnormal values of FSP. Eight patients with acute leukemia were monitored sequentially with FSP and fibrinopeptide A (FpA) assays during their first course of chemotherapy. In all instances, elevated FpA levels correlated with elevated FSP values, as determined by the Dade, Sigma, or TWT assays.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Drewinko, B', 'Surgeon, J', 'Cobb, P', 'Callahan, L', 'Schmidt, D', 'Bollinger, P', 'Trujillo, J M']","['Drewinko B', 'Surgeon J', 'Cobb P', 'Callahan L', 'Schmidt D', 'Bollinger P', 'Trujillo JM']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products)', '0 (Reagent Kits, Diagnostic)', '25422-31-5 (Fibrinopeptide A)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)']",IM,"['Agglutination Tests', 'Blood Coagulation Tests/*methods', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products/*analysis', 'Fibrinogen/standards', 'Fibrinopeptide A/analysis', 'Humans', 'Latex Fixation Tests', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Reagent Kits, Diagnostic', 'Staphylococcus aureus']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/84.1.58 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1985 Jul;84(1):58-66. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/84.1.58.,,,,,,,,

Xylene.,165-83,"The commercial product ""mixed xylenes"" (a technical product generally containing approximately 40% m-xylene and 20% each of o-xylene, p-xylene and ethylbenzene, as well as small quantities of toluene) analogously to toluene is an agent of major chemical and occupational significance. It is produced in very large quantities and is extensively employed in a broad spectrum of applications, primarily as a solvent for which its use is increasing as a ""safe"" replacement for benzene, and in gasoline as part of the BTX component (benzene-toluene-xylene); xylenes are also frequently used in the rubber industry with other solvents such as toluene and benzene. As individual isomers they are extensively employed in the synthesis of synthetic agents, for example phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid and dimethylterephthalate, which have very broad applications in the further preparation of phthalate ester plasticizers and components of polyester fiber, film and fabricated items. There is a broad potential for exposure both to industrial workers in the production and use of the xylenes and to the general public (via vehicle exhausts, consumer products, etc). Compared with benzene and toluene, very much less is known of the human health hazards, particularly the chronic effects of xylenes, either as mixed xylenes, as individual isomers or in admixture with other alkylbenzenes. It is of importance to note that coal-based solvents (e.g., xylene) have been suggested to be possible potent lymphocytic leukemogens, such as benzene, in a limited study of the relationship between lymphocytic leukemia and exposures to benzene and other solvents in the rubber industry. Available animal data on the carcinogenicity of xylene(s) are inadequate to permit an evaluation. Mixed xylenes are currently being investigated in a chronic bioassay by the National Toxicology Program. In limited studies thus far, the individual isomers have not been found genotoxic when tested in a number of short-term tests.","['Fishbein, L']",['Fishbein L'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Sci Total Environ,The Science of the total environment,0330500,"['0 (Gasoline)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Teratogens)', '0 (Xylenes)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Biotransformation', 'Gasoline/poisoning', 'Humans', 'Isomerism', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens', 'Mutation', 'Occupational Diseases/etiology', 'Risk', 'Salmonella typhimurium/drug effects', 'Teratogens', 'Xylenes/metabolism/pharmacology/*poisoning']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0048-9697(85)90039-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0048-9697(85)90039-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Total Environ. 1985 May;43(1-2):165-83. doi: 10.1016/0048-9697(85)90039-7.,,,,,,,,

Blood was distributed into three bottles, one containing Schaedler Broth and the others tryptic soy broth (TS). We tried to compare two different blind subculture systems: conventional subculture (CS) onto Petri dishes chocolate agar and a coated agar slide (slide) attached onto the TS bottle, thus the blood culture broth can be subcultured by tipping the bottle. The first subculture was performed at the same time for both bottles after a mean time of incubation of 12,4 hours (st. dev. 3.3 hours). There was no statistically significant difference for the recovery of pathogens, 30 with the slide and 29 with CS. Among the 30 slide positive blood cultures, six: 4 pseudomonas, 2 streptococcus, were detected by direct observation of colonies before any evidence of broth disturbance. When comparison was made according to the detection observed with the first, second or third subculture, a slight advantage was obtained with CS since 72.4% of them were positive with the first subculture versus 60% with the slide. During the first round of evaluation an higher contamination rate was observed with the slide 6.4% versus 2% for CS. The great majority of contaminated bottles were collected in one of the three hematology subunits.

The proposed molecular mechanism is that trimethylsilylmethanediazohydroxide is produced by hydrolytic activation of TMS-MNU and undergoes a nucleophilic cleavage of the Si--CH2 chemical bond at a high rate to form methanediazohydroxide (the reactive intermediate of MNU) which, in turn, methylates the informational biopolymer leading to mutagenesis.","['Hakura, A', 'Kohda, K', 'Kawazoe, Y']","['Hakura A', 'Kohda K', 'Kawazoe Y']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '0 (Trimethylsilyl Compounds)', '39482-21-8 (N-trimethylsilylmethyl-N-nitrosourea)', '684-93-5 (Methylnitrosourea)', 'Z4152N8IUI (Silicon)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Escherichia coli/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Lung', 'Methylnitrosourea/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests/methods', '*Mutagens', '*Mutation', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/*toxicity', 'Salmonella typhimurium/drug effects', 'Silicon/*toxicity', 'Trimethylsilyl Compounds/pharmacology/*toxicity']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-1218(85)90053-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1218(85)90053-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1985 Jul;157(1):87-93. doi: 10.1016/0165-1218(85)90053-9.,,,,,,,,

In a multivariate analysis, factors significantly related to increased survival were marrow remission at transplant (p less than 0.007) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (p less than 0.005). Factors associated with increased relapse were marrow relapse at transplant (p less than 0.002) and absence of significant graft-versus-host disease (p less than 0.004).

Our results, obtained with a time-dependent covariate model and a matching technique, indicate a 2 to 3.5-fold increase in the risk of hematologic relapse or death among patients who experienced an isolated CNS relapse compared with similar patients (matched for leukocyte count and length of complete remission) who remained free of CNS involvement. Of the 107 children with an initial isolated CNS relapse, 89 (83%) have died or have had a subsequent relapse. There was no detectable difference in the rate of hematologic relapse or death after a CNS relapse between patients who had received preventive therapy and those who had not.

In contrast, lymphoid cells in samples from nine cases of B cell neoplasia were positive for B cell antigen and HLA-DR. In a further four B cell neoplasms most lymphoid cells were reactive T cells. Two cases of T cell lymphoid leukaemia could also be characterised by immunocytochemical staining, both being classified as T helper cell neoplasms.

Of 23 patients with proven or probable candidiasis, 16 had mannan levels in serum greater than the mean + 2 standard deviations (0.46 ng/ml) for the 15 controls. In 16 patients with invasive candidiasis and positive blood cultures for the Candida spp., only 13 had elevated levels of at least one of the three markers. The arabinitol/creatinine ratio, the mannose level, and the mannan level became elevated an average of 4 days before, 1 day before, and on the same day that the blood cultures were drawn, respectively. Conversely, mannan was detected in the sera of six of seven patients with invasive candidiasis and negative blood cultures. We conclude that the best approach to diagnosing invasive candidiasis involves obtaining blood cultures and carrying out serial assays for mannan in serum.","['de Repentigny, L', 'Marr, L D', 'Keller, J W', 'Carter, A W', 'Kuykendall, R J', 'Kaufman, L', 'Reiss, E']","['de Repentigny L', 'Marr LD', 'Keller JW', 'Carter AW', 'Kuykendall RJ', 'Kaufman L', 'Reiss E']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,"['0 (Mannans)', '0 (Sugar Alcohols)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)', 'YFV05Y57M9 (arabitol)']",IM,"['Candidiasis/blood/complications/*diagnosis', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Mannans/blood', 'Mannose/blood', 'Sugar Alcohols/blood']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jcm.21.6.972-979.1985 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 1985 Jun;21(6):972-9. doi: 10.1128/jcm.21.6.972-979.1985.,PMC271829,,,,,,,

Resistance to one drug is often associated with cross-resistance to other anticancer agents. This is commonly seen with the ""natural product"" anticancer drugs such as the Vinca alkaloids and anthracyclines. In experimental systems, specific changes in plasma membranes characterize this ""multiple drug resistance."" The most prominent of these is the enhanced expression in several systems of high-molecular-weight glycoproteins ranging from Mr approximately equal to 150,000 to approximately equal to 180,000, the amount of which has been shown to be related to the degree of drug resistance. We report here the production of three monoclonal antibodies that bind preferentially to the surfaces of cultured human leukemic lymphoblasts resistant to the Vinca alkaloid vinblastine. Each antibody recognizes a surface membrane glycoprotein with molecular weights of 180,000 to 210,000. Additionally, two of the antibodies also recognize a second surface glycoprotein with molecular weights of either approximately equal to 155,000 or approximately equal to 130,000. All of these glycoproteins are overexpressed in the alkaloid-resistant cells. While a Mr approximately equal to 180,000 protein has been shown to be associated with multiple drug resistance, the other two glycoproteins have not been described previously in these cells.

However, relatively low numbers of tumours become clinically manifest. This discrepancy has initially led to the hypothesis that the great majority of these potential tumors is killed by immune surveillance mechanisms. After some time, however, serious objections were raised against this function of the immune system. When the interest in immune surveillance faded away, investigators started to study natural resistance against the de novo arising tumor cells. In this paper the data on natural resistance (and immune surveillance) are reviewed. These data lead to the conclusion than an efficient natural resistance that could kill many de novo arising tumor cells is lacking. Taken together the data suggest that no tumors arise when immune surveillance and/or natural resistance are absent. This implies that tumor cells probably do not arise frequently. Acceptance of this conclusion leads to a reappraisal of the role of immune surveillance and natural resistance against tumor cells. This reappraisal will mean a shift from the hypothesized failsafe mechanisms to mechanisms that may or may not kill rarely arising tumor cells, depending for instance on the antigenicity of the tumor cells and their sensitivity to tumoricidal mechanisms.","['Den Otter, W']",['Den Otter W'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,['0 (Immunoglobulin M)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn/immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'Female', 'Fetus/cytology/immunology', 'Granulocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Mast Cells/immunology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Neoplasms/immunology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Pregnancy']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00199220 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1985;19(3):159-62. doi: 10.1007/BF00199220.,,,,48,,,,

As a rule, the deletion is interstitial; the distal breakpoint by conventional techniques is usually in band q32, the proximal breakpoints in q12 or q14. Variant breakpoints occur in less than 10% of all cases. As the sole anomaly, 5q- is characteristically found in refractory anemia with or without excess of blasts. It can occur as the sole anomaly in de novo or secondary acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, but is usually accompanied in those disorders by other chromosome changes that are also nonrandomly distributed. In addition, it can be found in lymphoproliferative disorders, and occasionally, also in solid tumors. The 5q- myelodysplastic syndrome typically occurs in older age groups, particularly in females. Characteristic features are macrocytic anemia, normal or elevated platelets in the presence of megakaryocytic anomalies, and a mild clinical course. In cases with 5q- only, transformation into ANLL occurs rarely. Additional chromosome anomalies and male sex are prognostically unfavorable signs. Sex ratio is also at the disadvantage of females in de novo 5q- ANLL, and the latter disorder can occur without being preceded by a myelodysplastic phase. A myelodysplastic phase usually precedes 5q- secondary leukemia, in males as well as in females, and additional chromosome anomalies, especially of chromosome #7, are almost invariably present in those cases. We conclude that 5q- is the most frequently occurring single chromosome anomaly in secondary leukemia. Furthermore, the resemblance between de novo and secondary 5q- MDS and ANLL is striking; clinically, as well as cytogenetically, they are indistinguishable, suggesting that all de novo cases may be due to environmental (chemical) carcinogens. Response to treatment and prognosis are very poor with current therapeutic regimens in de novo as well as in secondary 5q- ANLL. Morphologically, these ANLLs fall into all FAB categories. There is considerable evidence to show that the 5q- anomaly occurs in a myeloid precursor stem cell. The occasional occurrence in lymphoid malignancies, of B cell as well as T cell type, suggests that, as in Ph-positive disorders, a common progenitor stem cell may be affected in 5q- also. The 5q- lymphoid malignancies, however, are much more rare; it is not clear at the present time whether or not a 5q- counterpart of Ph-positive ALL exists, and mixed lymphoid-myeloid 5q- disorders have not yet been documented.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Van den Berghe, H', 'Vermaelen, K', 'Mecucci, C', 'Barbieri, D', 'Tricot, G']","['Van den Berghe H', 'Vermaelen K', 'Mecucci C', 'Barbieri D', 'Tricot G']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/genetics', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, 4-5', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Oncogenes', 'Sex Factors', 'Stem Cells/pathology']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(85)90016-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(85)90016-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1985 Jul;17(3):189-255. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(85)90016-0.,,,,80,,,,

Effect of intensive therapy and prognostic factors.,632-41,"Eighty-seven adult patients who had achieved bone marrow remission of leukemia developed one or more episodes of meningeal leukemia. Multiple patient characteristics were examined for their effect on probability of achieving complete remission from meningeal disease and for their effect on duration of meningeal remission. Presence of obtundation (P less than 0.01) or other symptoms of meningeal disease (P = 0.02) were associated with a low remission induction rate. Other factors which tended (P = 0.06-0.20) to be associated with low remission induction rates included high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure, absence of splenomegaly at initial diagnosis, high peripheral blood leukocyte count (WBC) at the episode of marrow disease most recently preceding the meningeal disease, and use of only one as opposed to two or more intrathecal drugs as treatment. Factors associated with long duration of meningeal remissions included diagnosis (AML greater than acute undifferentiated leukemia greater than ALL, P = 0.05), absence of symptoms (P = 0.04), low CSF WBC (P = 0.01), rapid attainment of meningeal remission (P = 0.01), rapid attainment of initial bone marrow remission (P = 0.02), and long duration of initial bone marrow remission (P less than 0.01). Absence of cranial or peripheral neuropathies, low CSF protein and opening pressure, and short time interval between diagnosis of marrow and meningeal disease also tended (P = 0.06-0.20) to be associated with long meningeal remissions. Patients treated according to an intensive protocol utilizing cranial irradiation and triple drug treatment via an Ommaya reservoir had substantially longer meningeal remissions than did patients treated with less intensive therapy (P = 0.01).

A clinical and pathologic analysis of 109 cases.,553-61,"A total of 109 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) was analyzed to determine the clinical and pathologic features of the five recently defined French-American-British Cooperative Group (FAB) subtypes, and to assess the utility of this classification system in predicting survival, evolution to acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), and cause of death. All patients with MDS presented with anemia; additional cytopenias were present in patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation to ANLL (RAEB/Tr). Thirty-two patients received some form of antileukemic therapy for MDS. ANLL developed in 16 of the 77 remaining untreated patients, including 18% (2/11), 0% (0/21), 22% (5/23), 33% (2/6), and 44% (7/16) of patients with refractory anemia (RA), refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS), RAEB, CMML, and RAEB/Tr, respectively (P = 0.02). The FAB subtype was highly predictive of survival with median survivals ranging from 71 months for RARS to 5 months for RAEB/Tr (P = less than 0.0001). Patients with RAEB, CMML, and RAEB/Tr frequently died of direct consequences of MDS, while patients with RA and especially RARS generally survived or died from unrelated disorders (P = less than 0.0001). MDS encompass a spectrum of disorders. RA and RARS, are relatively indolent and often do not lead to the patient's demise. RAEB, CMML, and RAEB/Tr are aggressive disorders which are often responsible for the patient's death whether or not actual progression to overt leukemia occurs. FAB subtype predicts survival, evolution to ANLL, and cause of death, although the five morphologic subtypes appear to separate into only two disease groups, especially with regard to survival and cause of death.","['Foucar, K', 'Langdon, R M 2nd', 'Armitage, J O', 'Olson, D B', 'Carroll, T J Jr']","['Foucar K', 'Langdon RM 2nd', 'Armitage JO', 'Olson DB', 'Carroll TJ Jr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Male', 'Preleukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Prognosis']",1985/08/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19850801)56:3<553::aid-cncr2820560323>3.0.co;2-q [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1985 Aug 1;56(3):553-61. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19850801)56:3<553::aid-cncr2820560323>3.0.co;2-q.,,,,,,,,

Its reactivity with 105 samples of fresh leukaemic cells and 13 cell lines was measured by indirect fluorescence and peroxidase staining to define in more detail which stages of differentiation it recognizes. It was found to bind to cells from virtually all cases of lymphoid leukaemia (B cell CLL, T cell ALL, cALL and the few examples of HCL, PLL, Sezary syndrome and CGL in lymphoid blast crisis). The single case of cALL in relapse and four of six cases of null ALL were negative. Binding to non-lymphoid leukaemia cells (AML, AMML, AMoL, APL, AEL and CGL in blast crisis) was weaker or undetectable. Binding to established lymphoid cell lines was generally weak compared with fresh cells but some lines (MOLT4, DAUDI and X308) expressed adequate amounts of antigen to be lysed by CAMPATH-1 with human complement. Because CAMPATH-1 is very effective at killing lymphocytes in the presence of human complement, it has been used for removal of T cells in allogeneic transplants.

Twenty patients (aged 25 +/- 9 years) had bone-marrow transplantation (BMT) from their HLA-MLC identical sibling donors for treatment of aplastic anaemia (four), acute leukaemia in remission (13) or chronic myelogenous leukaemia (three). These 20 patients received (OKT3-pred-MTX) on days 8-22 post-transplant. Results of this group are compared to those of 19 concurrent patients (aged 26 +/- 12 years) who received ATG-pred-MTX on days 8-22 post-transplant. On the first day of treatment, 20/20 OKT3 patients and 18/19 ATG patients were febrile. Within 24 h of the first dose of OKT3, 6/20 patients experienced dyspnoea or chest pain and 3/20 patients developed diarrhoea. No further adverse effects were seen after the second dose of OKT3 and no late adverse effects were attributed to this drug. Time to engraftment (means 25 d) was not statistically significantly different in the two prophylactic groups. Acute GvHD was diagnosed in 14 of 20 patients who received OKT3-pred-MTX and in eight of 19 patients who received ATG-pred-MTX (P = 0.06).

Differentiation of HL-60 cells to macrophages, induced by dihydroxyvitamin D3 or phorbol esters, was also associated with a decrease in HL-ILP production. Glucose consumption by the cells in the early log phase was closely related with HL-ILP production, and HL-ILP was found to stimulate glucose consumption by HL-60 cells. Production of HL-ILP was dependent on glucose concentrations in the culture medium and glucose concentrations higher than 1mg/d1 suppressed the release of HL-ILP.

At about the same time, IARC (1982) published estimates of quantitative cancer risk associated with industrial chemicals. Benzene was one of the two chemicals selected by IARC for its risk estimation. This paper presents a summary of these assessments along with new study results demonstrating adverse effects on bone marrow and peripheral blood cells as a result of low-level benzene exposure. Mathematical extrapolations based on epidemiologic studies are consistent with a finding of significant risk of dying from leukemia under the current occupational permissible exposure limit of 10 ppm. Although a significant reduction of risk could be expected to be achieved by reducing exposure to 1 ppm, a significant risk may still remain. The uncertainty of the dose-response projections rests on the underlying estimates of relative risk of death from leukemia, the estimates of benzene exposure (dose), and the appropriateness of the mathematical model. Recent findings in experimental animals demonstrate chromosomal damage to bone marrow cells, significant depression of the bone marrow, and disturbances of immune system function as a result of less than 1 week of exposure to the current permissible benzene exposure limit of 10 ppm. This was the lowest dose tested. These experimental findings provide further evidence of a potentially significant risk of bone marrow proliferative cancer (leukemia) as a result of low-dose benzene exposure.","['Infante, P F', 'White, M C']","['Infante PF', 'White MC']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants, Occupational/*adverse effects', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Risk']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.4700070507 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1985;7(5-6):403-13. doi: 10.1002/ajim.4700070507.,,,,31,,,,

This assay monitors the change in absorbance at 600 nm (due to light scattering) of a suspension of human red blood cells as a function of time. The rate of cell lysis, delta A600/delta t, can be expressed as the number of cells lysed per minute, which facilitates the determination of kinetic constants. Using this procedure we observed that the cytolytic activity exerted by various peroxidases in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and a halide ion proceeds in at least two stages. During the first stage no lysis occurs, but scanning electron microscopy showed that alterations in the target cell membrane take place. During the second stage the target cells lyse, resulting in a simultaneous release of metabolites and macromolecules. We conclude that the lytic action of peroxidases is directed toward the target cell membrane, which appears to acquire an increased rigidity and subsequently disintegrates.","['McFaul, S J', 'Stuyt, E L', 'Everse, J']","['McFaul SJ', 'Stuyt EL', 'Everse J']",['eng'],['CA32715/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

Children receiving TMP-SMX had fewer episodes of bacteremia (0 vs. 5) and otitis media (3 vs. 18). The geometric mean of the neutrophil nadir was 172 in the TMP-SMX group and 287 in controls. However, no increased delay or dose reduction of chemotherapy was observed in the TMP-SMX treated patients. Five patients who received TMP-SMX developed Gram-negative rods resistant to TMP-SMX on surveillance stool cultures. We conclude that TMP-SMX prophylaxis decreased certain bacterial infections in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia without causing clinically significant toxicity. The emergence of Gram-negative rods resistant to TMP-SMX in treated patients suggests that TMP-SMX prophylaxis should be restricted to patients who are at high risk for developing a bacterial infection or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.","['Goorin, A M', 'Hershey, B J', 'Levin, M J', 'Siber, G R', 'Gelber, R D', 'Flynn, K', 'Lew, M', 'Beckett, K', 'Blanding, P', 'Sallan, S E']","['Goorin AM', 'Hershey BJ', 'Levin MJ', 'Siber GR', 'Gelber RD', 'Flynn K', 'Lew M', 'Beckett K', 'Blanding P', 'Sallan SE']",['eng'],['CA 19589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pediatr Infect Dis,Pediatric infectious disease,8209468,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Suspensions)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)', 'AN164J8Y0X (Trimethoprim)', 'JE42381TNV (Sulfamethoxazole)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Bacterial Infections/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Combinations/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*complications', 'Male', 'Random Allocation', 'Sulfamethoxazole/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Suspensions', 'Trimethoprim/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00006454-198505000-00012 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis. 1985 May-Jun;4(3):265-9. doi: 10.1097/00006454-198505000-00012.,,,,,,,,

Expectedly, the majority of these specimens expressed antigens known to be expressed on lymphoid, and not myeloid malignancies. These included the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA), the p32 B-cell associated antigen, and T-cell associated antigens. Leukemic cells from the 8 remaining patients expressed antigens known to be present on both myeloid and lymphoid leukemias. These included HLA/DR, and the antigens identified by BA-1 and BA-2. Cells from 2 of these 8 patients reacted with antibodies that define antigens present on normal and malignant myeloid cells. Both specimens reacted with 1G10, an anti-granulocyte antibody, and one reacted with 5F1 which reacts with monocytes, nucleated red blood cells, megakaryocytes and platelets. One of these patients relapsed while receiving ALL therapy, and the morphology of her leukemic cells became characteristic of acute monocytic leukemia (AMoL). The second patient failed ALL therapy but responded to standard acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) therapy, clearing her peripheral blasts. Thus these studies confirm that cell surface phenotyping with monoclonal antibodies can recognize ALL cells that express myeloid rather than lymphoid associated antigens and demonstrate that the malignant cells display a clinical behavior consistent with the diagnosis of ANLL.","['Dinndorf, P A', 'Benjamin, D', 'Ridgway, D', 'Bernstein, I D']","['Dinndorf PA', 'Benjamin D', 'Ridgway D', 'Bernstein ID']",['eng'],"['CA09351/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens/immunology', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Granulocytes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Male', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(85)90004-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(85)90004-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1985;9(4):449-61. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(85)90004-9.,,,,,,,,

Preliminary studies have suggested antitumor activity in several neoplastic diseases. We treated 49 patients with relapsed or resistant acute leukemia with escalating doses of homoharringtonine administered by continuous infusion. Three dose levels were examined: 5 mg/m2 for seven days, 7 mg/m2 for seven days, and 5 mg/m2 for nine days. Of 28 patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia who received cumulative doses of 45 to 49 mg/m2, seven patients (25%) achieved complete remission. Four of these remissions occurred in a subset of ten patients previously resistant to two or more induction attempts with conventional chemotherapy. There were no remissions in three patients with secondary leukemia or in seven patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Reversible hypotension, fluid retention, diarrhea, and tumor lysis syndrome were the major toxic effects of this treatment. Our results indicate that homoharringtonine is an effective new drug for the treatment of acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia and that this drug does not share cross-resistance with conventional antileukemic agents.

The problem of treatment-related malignancies has added to that interest and has contributed to the understanding of carcinogenesis. Prolonged survival of patients with previously lethal diseases is now allowing the expression of long-term toxicities of the intensive therapies being used in many disease settings. Although the oncogenic potential of the various alkylating agents may not be equivalent, they have all been implicated as causing cancer in man. Procarbazine also appears to be highly carcinogenic in man. The intensity of treatment (duration and total dose) is a significant factor in the carcinogenesis of these agents. The dose-response relationship between radiation and cancer induction is less clear, but most believe that increasing radiation exposure increases the risk of cancer in a linear fashion. The combination of intensive chemotherapy and intensive radiotherapy yields the greatest risk for treatment-related hematologic and solid malignancies. To replace effective therapy with less carcinogenic therapy of unproved effectiveness would be difficult since survival curves have not been significantly affected by the evolution of treatment-related cancers. Whether that will hold true for the adjuvant use of intensive therapy remains to be seen. Where feasible, the design of such adjuvant trials should keep the dose-response relationship in mind. If the virtual absence of metachronous leukemia in Hodgkin's disease patients treated with ABVD holds true over time, the search for noncarcinogenic combination therapy will be well worth the effort. Therapeutic options in cancer treatment currently are few, and the benefits of potentially carcinogenic chemotherapy and radiotherapy continue to outweigh the risks.","['Dorr, F A', 'Coltman, C A Jr']","['Dorr FA', 'Coltman CA Jr']",['eng'],['CA09434/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Curr Probl Cancer,Current problems in cancer,7702986,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/immunology', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/chemically induced']",1985/02/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0147-0272(85)80033-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0147-0272(85)80033-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Probl Cancer. 1985 Feb;9(2):1-43. doi: 10.1016/s0147-0272(85)80033-7.,,,,108,,,,

We found that malignant cells tend to reproduce the vimentin organization characteristic of their normal cellular counterpart. Thus, in M2 and M3 leukemias (French-American-British classification), vimentin was often reduced to a juxtanuclear bundle of filaments contrasting with the rich filamentous network expressed by M4 or M5 leukemias. In erythroblastic leukemias (M6) and megakaryoblastic leukemias, both identified by the expression of lineage-specific antigens, the absence of vimentin IFs could be correlated with the level of differentiation reached by the blasts. M1 leukemias displayed an abnormal pattern of vimentin organization with aggregated filaments giving a ring-like structure. However, no abnormality of the vimentin polypeptide could be detected by two-dimensional electrophoresis. These results show that the expression of the vimentin IF cytoskeleton may be a useful marker of differentiation in the study of leukemic cells.","['Dellagi, K', 'Tabilio, A', 'Portier, M M', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Castaigne, S', 'Guichard, J', 'Breton-Gorius, J', 'Brouet, J C']","['Dellagi K', 'Tabilio A', 'Portier MM', 'Vainchenker W', 'Castaigne S', 'Guichard J', 'Breton-Gorius J', 'Brouet JC']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Vimentin)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*analysis/ultrastructure', 'Peroxidases/blood', 'Stem Cells/*analysis', 'Vimentin/*analysis']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79112-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 Jun;65(6):1444-52.,,,,,,,,

All but one of the patients in this study had received extensive prior treatment with conventional lymphoma therapy. All antibodies were prepared against, and uniquely reactive with, the patient's own tumor. Ten patients were treated with a single antibody, but one patient received three antibodies concurrently. The treatment protocol initially used an escalating dose schedule that was intended to evaluate toxicity, pharmacokinetics and, eventually, to achieve appreciable levels of free mouse antibody in the circulation. The last two patients received substantial initial doses. Tumor sampling was performed before and during therapy to evaluate tissue penetration by antibody. None of the patients had serum paraproteins by routine clinical testing, but six had idiotype protein detectable by a sensitive immunoassay at levels greater than 1 microgram/mL, two of which were greater than 200 micrograms/mL. Plasmapheresis was capable of reducing these levels temporarily. However, the presence of serum idiotype increased the requirement for mouse antibody to achieve tumor penetration. Another obstacle to treatment was immune response to mouse Ig, which occurred in five of the 11 patients. Once an immune response had begun, further infusions of antibody were not capable of reaching the tumor or inducing tumor regression and were associated with toxicity. Our initial patient remains in an unmaintained complete remission 42 months after receiving antibody. Five of ten additional patients have had objective remissions that were also clinically significant. However, these remissions were not complete and were of relatively short duration. This therapy shows promise as an alternative modality for the treatment of B cell malignancy.

Of the patients studied, 95 were entered among whom 77 were evaluable. These comprised 40 for an MCNU group (M) and 37 for a Busulfan group (B). No significant difference was found statistically between the two groups with regard to background factors, i.e., male-to-female ratio, age, white blood cell counts, platelet counts, splenomegaly or Ph1 chromosome. RESULTS: CR rate was 83% for M and 68% for B, and the number of days to CR was 88 for M and 155 for B. Blastic crisis was noted in 31% of M patients and 33% of B patients and the number of days to blastic crisis was 542.6 and 581.9, respectively for the two groups. Deaths accounted for 28% and 29% for each of M and B. Side effects were observed in 31% of M cases and 15% of B cases. A significant difference was observed only in the period to CR. MCNU showed almost equal efficacy to that of Busulfan but was superior to Busulfan in patients who required rapid response. Side effects were mild and transient.

Sufficient data are now available for both acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemia so that the patient's response to therapy and survival can be correlated with the karyotype; it was also shown that the karyotype of the leukemic cells provides significant independent prognostic information.

Inducer-treated cells undergo an irreversible commitment to maturation and accumulate large amounts of hemoglobin. Clonal analysis of commitment of individual cells combined with biochemical measurements has revealed that MEL cell differentiation is a highly coordinated set of events (program) leading to the differentiated erythroid state. The developmental program of MEL cells consists of early and late processes. The early events appear to be membrane-mediated processes which operate independently of each other and lead to commitment to terminal maturation and hemoglobin synthesis. Inducer-treated cells express an ability to remember (""memory response"") previous exposure to inducer and to continue their differentiation after discontinuous exposure to inducer; expression of ""memory response"" occurs early in differentiation and affects both the initiation of commitment and accumulation of globin mRNA in a similar manner in inducer-treated cells. Commitment to maturation appears to be the central process responsible for determining the pattern of gene expression, limitation of proliferative activity and nuclear condensation. Commitment, however, can occur independently of hemoglobin synthesis. Although initiation of commitment is associated with early membrane-mediated events (e.g., ion-transport), maintenance and completion of maturation erythroid state is a result of a number of cellular processes. These processes are discussed in relation to the molecular and cellular mechanisms of initiation and completion of MEL cell differentiation. The role of the MEL system as a model for studying mouse and human globin gene regulation is presented.","['Tsiftsoglou, A S', 'Wong, W']","['Tsiftsoglou AS', 'Wong W']",['eng'],['CA 37727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Chromatin/physiology', 'Clone Cells/cytology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1985 Jan-Feb;5(1):81-99.,,,,134,,,,

Attempts are being made to reduce this toxicity while retaining anti-tumor activity. These include development of chemically modified anthracycline derivatives and coupling of adriamycin to or into macromolecular carriers. We and several other laboratories have shown that entrapment of adriamycin in liposomes (phospholipid vesicles) can reduce toxicity while retaining or, in some cases, enhancing anti-tumor activity. Here we report further results of experiments in mice on toxicity reduction and anti-tumor activity. Approximate maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of adriamycin were determined from normal mouse survival at 240 days after initial treatment. I.V. bolus injection of liposomal-adriamycin was superior to i.v. bolus or i.v. infusion of free drug after a single injection, 5 daily injections or 5 biweekly (every 2 weeks) injections. Using L1210 tumor as a model for systemic leukemia, liposomal adriamycin was as effective as free adriamycin at equal doses, however liposomal-adriamycin was more effective at MTD. M5076 tumor was used as a limited model for comparisons of the effects of liposomal-adriamycin on ""primary"" and ""metastatic"" disease. The results showed that whereas free and liposomal adriamycin were without significant effect on ""primary"", subcutaneous tumor, that liposomal adriamycin, but not free adriamycin had very strong effects on liver ""metastases"". The results suggest that liposomally administered drugs, including adriamycin, may have utility for treatment of certain types of cancer and for metastases in organs where liposomes accumulate.

To test the applicability of the method to pharmaceutical compounds, we used DNA-alkaline elution with a series of antiviral agents with variable DNA-damaging activity. 5-Iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (5-IdU), 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (5-BrdU) and 5-trifluoromethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (F3dT) increased the DNA elution rate over controls in a dose-dependent fashion, 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine (ARA-A) had a marginal effect. 9-(2-Hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine(acyclovir,ACV) and 5-(2-bromovinyl)-2-deoxyuridine (5-BrVdU), selective antiviral compounds, did not vary alkaline elution profiles. These results fully support the use of alkaline elution of DNA as a standard procedure in the evaluation of the genotoxic effect of drugs.","['Coronnello, M', 'Caderni, G', 'Dolara, P']","['Coronnello M', 'Caderni G', 'Dolara P']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol,Methods and findings in experimental and clinical pharmacology,7909595,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.64 (Endopeptidase K)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/*analysis', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/*methods', 'Endopeptidase K', 'Endopeptidases', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests/*methods']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol. 1985 Jan;7(1):29-34.,,,,,,,,

Flow cytometric studies showed differences in cell cycle kinetics between mafosfamid-resistant and mafosfamid-susceptible tumor cell clones. Compared to drug susceptible clonogenic tumor cells, clones that resisted treatment with 100 micrograms mafosfamid/ml exhibited a smaller percentage of cells in S-phase, indicating that mafosfamid is mostly cytotoxic to rapidly cycling tumor cells.

The contribution of irradiation.,907-14,"High dose whole body irradiation is commonly included in conditioning regimens for bone marrow transplantation for treatment of patients with hematological malignancies. Interstitial pneumonitis is a major complication after BMT. About one-fourth of all BMT patients die from IP. In about half of these cases, an infectious agent, particularly cytomegalovirus, is involved. When no infectious cause is found, it is classified as idiopathic IP (IIP). Total body irradiation is often associated with the induction of IIP; however, extrapolation of animal data from the experiments presented indicates that this is not the only factor contributing to IIP in man. Brown Norway (BN/Bi) rats were bilaterally irradiated to the lungs with 300 kV X rays at a high dose rate (HDR; 0.8 Gy/min) and at a low dose rate (LDR; 0.05 Gy/min). The dose-response curves found were very steep. In the LDR group, lung function studies were performed. There was a strong correlation between the increase in ventilation rate and the death pattern. The LD50 at 180 days was 13.3 Gy for HDR and 22.7 Gy for LDR. The ratios of LD50/180 at 0.05 Gy/min to that at 0.8 Gy/min is 1.7, which indicates a great repair capacity of the lungs. Extrapolation of animal data to patient data leads to an estimated dose of about 15-16 Gy at a 50% radiation pneumonitis induction for low dose rate TBI. As the absorbed dose in the lungs of BMT patients rarely exceeds 10 Gy, additional factors such as remission-induction chemotherapy, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, cyclosporin A, graft-versus-host disease, etc., might be involved in the high incidence of IIP in man after BMT.","['Cardozo, B L', 'Zoetelief, H', 'van Bekkum, D W', 'Zurcher, C', 'Hagenbeek, A']","['Cardozo BL', 'Zoetelief H', 'van Bekkum DW', 'Zurcher C', 'Hagenbeek A']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*radiotherapy', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/*etiology', 'Radiation Injuries, Experimental/*etiology', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Respiratory Function Tests', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(85)90112-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(85)90112-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1985 May;11(5):907-14. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(85)90112-9.,,,,,,,,

Direct comparisons are made with doxorubicin in individual experiments, and the data are related to those of earlier studies in the form of a review of experimental activity, in order to assess the relative activity of 4'-epidoxorubicin and doxorubicin. The experimental test models utilized by the NCI for these studies included the leukemias P388 and L1210, B-16 melanoma, Lewis lung carcinoma, the colon tumors 26 and 38, and the mammary tumors CD8F1 and C3H16/C. The human tumors growing in xenograft in athymic mice included the models LX-1 lung tumor, CX-1 colon tumor, and MX-1 mammary tumor. Additional comparisons were made with the tumor models Gross leukemia, sarcoma 180, MSV-induced sarcoma, MS-2 tumor, and a variety of human tumors growing in athymic mice, as well as with in vivo toxicologic and in vitro cytotoxicity models. Although for 4'-epidoxorubicin there is only a minimal alteration of the configuration of the doxorubicin molecule, quantitative comparison of 4'-epidoxorubicin and doxorubicin revealed not only similarities but also differences in biological activity. Both drugs showed activity against a broad spectrum of experimental tumors, with 4'-epidoxorubicin more effective against some tumors and equally effective against others. 4'-Epidoxorubicin evidenced less toxicity than doxorubicin in both acute and chronic toxicity studies with retention of therapeutic effectiveness and showed reduced cardiotoxicity. With 4'-epidoxorubicin there resulted a higher therapeutic index and therapeutic ratio, permitting the use of higher dosage and a greater margin of safety. The preclinical differences in therapeutic and toxicologic manifestations of 4'-epidoxorubicin, reflecting apparent alterations in pharmacologic properties and mode of action in comparison with doxorubicin, support the broad spectrum clinical trials of this already-demonstrated clinically active drug.","['Goldin, A', 'Venditti, J M', 'Geran, R']","['Goldin A', 'Venditti JM', 'Geran R']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Epirubicin', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Melanoma/drug therapy', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00176819 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1985;3(1):3-21. doi: 10.1007/BF00176819.,,,,41,,,,

The most extensive experience has been obtained with antibodies specific for functionally distinct subsets of lymphocytes. They have been used to monitor the immunosuppression of organ-graft recipients and to attempt to elucidate the disturbance of immunologic function in a variety of conditions. Current therapeutic applications under trial include immunosuppression to treat organ-graft rejection and to eliminate cells responsible for graft-vs-host disease from the bone marrow. Applications to cancer diagnosis and treatment have been hampered by the difficulty of identifying truly tumor-specific antigens. Successes have, however, been obtained in the location of metastases and in the extracorporeal treatment of autologous marrow to purge it of malignant cells, and, more rarely, with the direct administration of monoclonal antibodies in vivo. The conjugation of cell-type specific monoclonal antibodies with cytotoxic agents should overcome a number of limitations.","['Krakauer, H']",['Krakauer H'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Eur J Clin Microbiol,European journal of clinical microbiology,8219582,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Autoimmune Diseases/diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Bacterial Infections/diagnosis/therapy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/classification/immunology', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/therapy', 'Parasitic Diseases/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation Immunology', 'Vaccines', 'Virus Diseases/diagnosis/therapy']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02148651 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Microbiol. 1985 Feb;4(1):1-9. doi: 10.1007/BF02148651.,,,,74,,,,

Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) involves infusion of bone marrow from a suitable donor into a properly conditioned recipient. Most BMT is allogeneic, in which the donor is genetically dissimilar but shares some common tissue antigens with the recipient. Almost all patients undergoing allogeneic BMT must be ""prepared"" with high-dose cyclophosphamide to prevent graft rejection. Most patients with hematologic malignancy also receive total body irradiation to eradicate malignant cells located in areas inaccessible to the systemic circulation. Bone marrow transplantation is the treatment of choice for severe aplastic anemia. In acute myelogenous leukemia, the best results are observed in young patients undergoing BMT in first remission. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia, BMT is usually reserved for patients in second or subsequent remission. Early results are promising in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia who receive BMT before the accelerated phase or blast crisis of this disease. Allogeneic BMT offers an opportunity for cure in some patients with relapses of Hodgkin's disease or those with certain subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Other diseases for which BMT has been used include severe combined immune deficiency disease, Fanconi's anemia, and multiple myeloma. Complications of BMT include graft failure or rejection, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, and infectious complications; late complications, such as restrictive and obstructive pulmonary disease, cataracts, sterility, and secondary malignancies, may also occur. Bone marrow transplantation has become an important treatment for many hematologic diseases, but it will probably remain a treatment reserved for only a few highly specialized centers. If morbidity and mortality caused by transplant-related complications can be reduced, BMT may be offered to older patients and those without HLA-identical sibling donors.","['Yee, G C', 'McGuire, T R']","['Yee GC', 'McGuire TR']",['eng'],['CA 33252/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Clin Pharm,Clinical pharmacy,8207437,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/adverse effects', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Hematologic Diseases/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/adverse effects', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Pharm. 1985 Mar-Apr;4(2):149-60.,,,,137,,,,

This neoplastic cell population metastasized to a regional lymph node already involved by a B-cell derived chronic lymphocytic leukemia expressing surface IgMk, BA-1, and OKT1. The large metastatic tumor cells lacked surface immunoglobulin, B-lymphocyte associated antigen BA-1, T-lymphocyte associated antigens OKT1 and OKT3, and the monocyte/macrophage markers lysozyme and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin. These tumor cells expressed HLA-DR antigens, adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), OKT6, and contained S-100 protein, i.e., they expressed the phenotype peculiar to epidermal Langerhans cells. The typical clinical and histologic features of Histiocytosis X were absent.

Epidemiology, treatment principles and prognosis in childhood malignancies.",425-8,"The proportion of malignancies in children differs from that in adults: Leukemias and malignant lymphomas predominate with a total of 50%, followed by tumors of the nervous system, of the kidneys, and of connective and supportive tissue. Most of these diseases respond well to cytostatic therapy. Therefore chemotherapy occupies a major role in the curative concepts for nearly all childhood malignancies. Its objective is the destruction of micrometastases as well as the reduction of primary tumor mass in inoperable cases, and it often helps to limit the extent of radical surgery. Radiotherapy, too, can be reduced under the influence of cytostatic therapy. In nearly all childhood cancers, prognosis has improved substantially over the past 10 to 15 years. Today, our aim is not the mere limited survival, but a definitive cure. Modern strategies have raised the cure rates of Hodgkin's disease to 90%, of Wilms' tumor, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non- Hodgkin lymphomas to 70-75%, of soft tissue sarcomas and osteosarcomas to about 50%, and of acute myelogenous leukemia, neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma to 30-35%. Centralized management of childhood cancers in specially staffed hospitals is mandatory on account of their relative low frequency, the risks of chemotherapy, and the high staff workload.","['Schellong, G']",['Schellong G'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Pathol Res Pract,"Pathology, research and practice",7806109,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Cancer Care Facilities/trends', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Germany, West', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/radiotherapy/surgery/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Sarcoma/epidemiology', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/epidemiology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0344-0338(85)80153-9 [pii]', '10.1016/S0344-0338(85)80153-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Res Pract. 1985 Jan;179(3):425-8. doi: 10.1016/S0344-0338(85)80153-9.,,,,28,,,,

Every 12 h patients receive 3 g/m2 Ara-C for 75-90 minutes for a total of 12 doses. Using that regimen, 25% of patients with refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and 60% of patients in untreated relapse achieve a complete remission (CR). With few exceptions, complete remissions are obtained after one cycle, median remission duration is between 4 and 6 months. Consolidation or maintenance therapy was not usually given. Currently, numerous modifications of that regimen are under investigation: combinations with other cytostatic agents like anthracyclins, m-AMSA, vincristine; the Capizzi-regimen and intermediate dose Ara-C. Preliminary results of those trials are promising but need to be confirmed by other groups.

The leucocyte count of her AML (FAB 2) decreased from 120,000/microliter to 30,000/microliter on the third day after HD ARA-C. Patient 2 reached CR criteria of the bone marrow for 23 days, then resistant AML (FAB 2) recurred. A male patient of 30 years was treated for recurrent acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL) with a high cumulative dose of 176 gs of ARA-C. The repeated courses of treatment included a period of 50 days of CR. Toxicity was remarkable including pulmonal and cerebral dysfunction. A fourth patient with monocytic leukemia did not respond to HD ARA-C, neither did the patient with the malignant teratoma. Adverse reactions were tolerable. Only the third patient suffered from severe toxicity, pneumonitis, blurring vision, cerebral dysfunction and dermatitis. His pretreatment regimen had included X-ray prophylaxis to the skull.

BCF was administered at 5000 and 50 000 ppm in air for 6 h to groups of C57B1/6J mice of both sexes. Animals were killed at 24, 48 and 72 h after cessation of exposure and the incidence of bone marrow micronuclei per 1000 PCEs determined. There was no significant difference in the incidences of micronuclei between untreated animals and those exposed to either concentration of BCF at any of the sampling times. These results suggest that BCF is mutagenic in vitro in only one strain of Salmonella; in mammalian cells the compound induced no gene mutation in vitro nor clastogenic activity in vivo at doses that also produced clear evidence of toxicity.","['Styles, J A', 'Richardson, C R', 'Callander, R D', 'Cross, M F', 'Bennett, I P', 'Longstaff, E']","['Styles JA', 'Richardson CR', 'Callander RD', 'Cross MF', 'Bennett IP', 'Longstaff E']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Bromochlorofluorocarbons)', '0 (Chlorofluorocarbons, Methane)', '0 (Mutagens)', '91I5X8AJXS (bromochlorodifluoromethane)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biotransformation', 'Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', 'Bromochlorofluorocarbons', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'Chlorofluorocarbons, Methane/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Leukemia L5178/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microsomes, Liver/metabolism', 'Mutagenicity Tests', '*Mutagens', '*Mutation', 'Rats', 'Salmonella typhimurium/genetics', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-7992(85)90021-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-7992(85)90021-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1985 Apr;142(4):187-92. doi: 10.1016/0165-7992(85)90021-1.,,,,,,,,

Immunotoxins (IT) were synthesized by conjugating ricin (R) to four different monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) directed against distinct markers of T cell lineage. Treatment with anti-p67-R produced effective elimination of leukemic T cells from human marrow. The cyclophosphamide congener mafosfamid (ASTA Z 7577) markedly enhanced the target cell cytotoxicity of IT and extended the final level of clonogenic kill 2 to 3 logs. Our data show that anti-p67-R in combination with mafosfamid resulted in a maximum elimination of 6.2 logs of neoplastic T cells with minimal toxicity to normal bone marrow progenitors. The efficiency of this protocol was not reduced in the presence of excess normal bone marrow cells. Similar findings were obtained by using a cocktail of four different anti-T cell IT. This approach is unique in combining both immunologic (IT) and chemical (mafosfamid) strategies for more effective ex vivo bone marrow purging in autologous bone marrow transplantation for T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma.","['Uckun, F M', 'Stong, R C', 'Youle, R J', 'Vallera, D A']","['Uckun FM', 'Stong RC', 'Youle RJ', 'Vallera DA']",['eng'],"['CA-31618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '88746-71-8 (Asta Z 7557)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Growth Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/*methods', 'Ricin/*therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*pathology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 May;134(5):3504-15.,,,,,,,,

Exposure of the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 to trypsin, chymotrypsin, or elastase induced the appearance, within 3-6 days, of neutrophilic granulocytes defined by their morphology, their ability to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium, and their efficient phagocytosis of latex particles. Upon further incubation monocyte-like cells appeared. While these cells developed into fully mature macrophages other types of cells disappeared and on day 12 the culture consisted of a pure macrophage population. The inducing effect could be observed when the enzyme was presented alone, whereas a synergistic effect was noted when the protease was added in the presence of subthreshold concentrations of chemicals known to induce differentiation in this cell line such as dimethylsulfoxide, retinoic acid, butyric acid, or hexamethylene bisacetamide. Optimal induction of differentiation by trypsin required a 48 hr continuous exposure to the enzyme. When the protease was removed earlier no appreciable differentiation was noticed. The protease-induced differentiation involved a direct interaction with the cells and was not due to a proteolytic cleavage of a serum component because it could be obtained in serum-free cultures. The enzymatic activity of the protease was needed for its effect on cell maturation: Addition of protease inhibitors such as soybean-trypsin inhibitor or trasylol completely blocked differentiation induced by the proteases but had no effect on differentiation induced by the other inducers. It is still to be determined whether a proteolytic process is a general molecular event in cell differentiation or induction by chemicals involves a mechanism different from that initiated by exogenous proteases.","['Fibach, E', 'Treves, A', 'Kidron, M', 'Mayer, M']","['Fibach E', 'Treves A', 'Kidron M', 'Mayer M']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Protease Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Macrophages/*pathology/physiology', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*pharmacology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Trypsin/*pharmacology']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041230212 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1985 May;123(2):228-34. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041230212.,,,,,,,,

With the use of transplantation, 10% to 30% of patients with relapsed leukemia and approximately 50% of patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia in first remission can be cured. Cures have also been seen in a variety of other hematologic malignancies, including chronic granulocytic leukemia, preleukemia, hairy cell leukemia, and malignant lymphoma. Transplantation is currently limited by the need for a suitable marrow donor; by the complications of the transplant procedure, including infection, graft-versus-host disease, and the toxicities of intensive chemoradiotherapy; and by the risk of recurrent disease. Some of these limitations will likely be overcome as a result of current research. The use of partially matched family members and matched unrelated donors will make transplantation available to more patients. Some forms of posttransplant infection, including those associated with herpes simplex and cytomegalovirus, can now be prevented or treated. Improved methods of controlling graft-versus-host disease including T-cell depletion of marrow and the use of more effective immunosuppressive agents, as well as a better understanding of the toxicities of the preparative regimens, are making the transplant procedure safer and more tolerable. Finally, the development of better preparative regimens and transplantation earlier in the patient's disease course will likely allow for a larger percentage of patients to be cured.","['Appelbaum, F R', 'Thomas, E D']","['Appelbaum FR', 'Thomas ED']",['eng'],"['CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Postoperative Complications/etiology', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/etiology', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Tissue Donors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19850501)55:9+<2202::aid-cncr2820551424>3.0.co;2-s [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1985 May 1;55(9 Suppl):2202-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19850501)55:9+<2202::aid-cncr2820551424>3.0.co;2-s.,,,,75,,,,

Using a leukemic cell colony assay, we have reinvestigated the variables influencing lysis of human leukemic cells (KM-3, HPB-NULL, NALM-6) in bone marrow using BA-1, BA-2, BA-3, and complement. Specific variables addressed included the concentration of excess bone marrow cells, the number of treatments, the presence or absence of DNase during the treatment, the combination of antibodies, and the sensitivity of different leukemic cell lines to lysis. Using the colony assay, the BA-1,2,3 cocktail was shown to be more effective than any single antibody or combination of two antibodies. We also determined that the concentration of excess bone marrow cells and number of treatments had a direct bearing on leukemic cell lysis. Although two cycles of treatment were significantly superior to one cycle, three cycles were not significantly superior to two cycles. Inclusion of DNase (10 micrograms/mL) was a critical adjunct that eliminated clumping and facilitated plating cells in the colony assay. Finally, we could show that striking differences existed in the sensitivity of the leukemic cell lines to lysis with the BA-1,2,3 cocktail and complement. NALM-6 cells were the most sensitive (approximately four logs of kill), and KM-3 cells were the most resistant (less than two logs of kill). Our results strongly support the utility of sensitive leukemic cell colony assays in the analysis of marrow treatment variables in autologous bone marrow transplantation.","['LeBien, T W', 'Stepan, D E', 'Bartholomew, R M', 'Stong, R C', 'Anderson, J M']","['LeBien TW', 'Stepan DE', 'Bartholomew RM', 'Stong RC', 'Anderson JM']",['eng'],"['CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05385/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay/*statistics & numerical data', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/classification/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83602-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 Apr;65(4):945-50.,,,,,,,,

One hundred twenty-two cases, or 16% were designated as T cell leukemia based on the reactivity of blast cells with previously well-characterized antisera (PT) against a T lymphocyte-associated antigen. Using this antisera-based definition as a standard, we looked for a monoclonal antibody combination that would be a suitable substitute. An algorithm calling for reactivity with either monoclonal antibody 3A1 or Leu-1 was a 92% sensitive and 97% specific predictor of PT reactivity. Only 27 of 755 cases of leukemia were incorrectly classified using this algorithm. Subsequently, Ficoll-Hypaque-separated bone marrow cells from 118 additional patients with ALL (21 of whom had T cell ALL) were stained by immunofluorescence using a combination of directly fluoresceinated 3A1 and Leu-1. Reactivity of 20% or more of the cells with this antibody combination was a 100% sensitive and 94% specific indicator of T cell ALL defined by PT positivity; with a higher cutoff value for positive values, or the use of supplemental tests, even this small number of false-positives could be eliminated.

Pre-treatment in vitro studies showed that the leukaemic T cells were sensitive to therapeutic concentrations of CyA. The patient's pruritus disappeared promptly after 2 d of treatment. The positive effect of CyA on the pruritus was related to the dose and plasma concentrations of the drug. Analysis of leukaemic cell surface markers using monoclonal antibodies showed that episodes of pruritus were correlated with the appearance of cells expressing the T cell ""activation"" markers interferon- gamma (IFN-gamma) and HLA-DR. This indicated that CyA may control pruritus by suppressing the production/release of lymphokines. Immunohistochemical staining of repeated skin biopsies demonstrated a reduction of infiltrating T cells. Clinically, this was correlated with an improved skin status and a partial regress of palpable lymph node size. Apart from an initial reversible drop in the circulating helper/suppressor T cell ratio, the number of circulating Sezary cells was unaltered during CyA treatment. After 5 months, higher doses of CyA were needed to control symptoms, and this was correlated wit with partial drug resistance also in vitro.","['Totterman, T H', 'Scheynius, A', 'Killander, A', 'Danersund, A', 'Alm, G V']","['Totterman TH', 'Scheynius A', 'Killander A', 'Danersund A', 'Alm GV']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,['0 (Cyclosporins)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cyclosporins/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Phenotype', 'Pruritus/*drug therapy', 'Sezary Syndrome/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Skin/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/immunology/*pathology']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1985.tb02256.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1985 Feb;34(2):196-203. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1985.tb02256.x.,,,,,,,,

In hypocellular dogs the number of CFU-GM were significantly decreased compared to values obtained from control or clinically normal irradiated dogs, while virtually no CFU-GM were observed in the leukemic dogs. Only the CFU-GM values of the hypocellular group showed an association, e.g., a suggestion of an abortive regenerative effort, with increasing absorbed dose. Proliferative capacity of T lymphocytes (CFU-L) was not affected by either increasing absorbed irradiation or the presence of leukemia. D0 values were determined on marrow fibroblastic cells to ascertain whether a radioresistant subpopulation of stromal elements would result from continuous in vivo irradiation. No correlation was found between absorbed dose and increased D0 values. However, seven of eight dogs which developed acute nonlymphocytic leukemia displayed marrow fibroblastic cells with elevated D0 values.

DNA sequence analysis indicated that one such deletion was localized entirely within the 5' part of the pol gene, did not affect the region encoding reverse transcriptase, and preserved the translational reading frame downstream of the mutation. The major viral precursor polyproteins (Pr65gag, Pr200gag-pol, and gPr80env) were synthesized at wild-type levels in cell lines carrying the mutant genome. These cell lines assembled and released wild-type levels of virion particles into the medium. Cleavage of both Pr65gag and Pr200gag-pol precursors to the mature proteins was completely blocked in the mutant virions. Surprisingly, these virions contained high levels of active reverse transcriptase; examination of the endogenous reverse transcription products synthesized by the mutant virions revealed normal amounts of minus-strand strong-stop DNA, indicating that the RNA genome was packaged and that reverse transcription in detergent-permeabilized virions was not significantly impaired. Processing of gPr80env to gP70env and P15E was not affected by the mutation, but cleavage of P15E to P12E was not observed. The mutant particles were poorly infectious; analysis indicated that infection was blocked at an early stage. The data are consistent with the idea that the 5' part of the pol gene encodes a protease directly responsible for processing Pr65gag, and possibly Pr200gag-pol, to the structural virion proteins. It appears that cleavage of the gag gene product is not required for budding and release of virions and that complete processing of the pol gene product to the mature form of reverse transcriptase is not required for its functional activation.","['Crawford, S', 'Goff, S P']","['Crawford S', 'Goff SP']",['eng'],['CA 30488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Gene Products, gag', '*Genes, Viral', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', '*Mutation', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Viral Fusion Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.53.3.899-907.1985 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1985 Mar;53(3):899-907. doi: 10.1128/JVI.53.3.899-907.1985.,PMC254725,,,,,,['GENBANK/M10413'],

In the present study, the effect of supernatants (SN) derived from normal EC and a human squamous carcinoma cell (SCC) line were tested for their effects on natural killer (NK) cell activity. EC- as well as SCC-derived SN were able to augment in vitro NK cell activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes against K 562 cells. In contrast, adherent cell-derived, IL 1-containing SN did not affect NK cell activity. Upon high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) gel filtration, ETAF and the EC-derived NK cell activity-augmenting factor (ENKAF) exhibited a similar m.w. However, by using reverse-phase HPLC, ETAF and ENKAF eluted as distinct peaks of activity, indicating that SCC cell-derived ENKAF is different from ETAF. Furthermore, ENKAF does not contain interleukin 2 (IL 2) or interferon (IFN) activity. The enhancement of NK cell activity was dose dependent and evident after 20 hr of preincubation of effector cells. Pretreatment of target cells with ENKAF did not affect the susceptibility of the target cells. The NK activity of large granular lymphocytes (LGL) purified by discontinuous Percoll gradient centrifugation and further depleted of high-affinity sheep erythrocyte rosetting cells was enhanced by ENKAF. In contrast, no NK cell activity was expressed by LGL-depleted T cell populations before or after treatment with ENKAF. In a single cell cytotoxicity assay in agarose, the number of lymphocyte binding to K 562 was not affected by ENKAF, but the frequency of dead conjugated target cells and presumably of active killer cells was increased by pretreatment with ENKAF. Additional incubation of LGL with ETAF did not further increase ENKAF-mediated augmentation of NK activity. In contrast to ETAF, ENKAF was not chemotactic for polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These results indicate that normal as well as transformed EC release a unique cytokine--ENKAF--which augments NK cell activity of LGL but is distinct from ETAF, IL 2, and IFN.","['Luger, T A', 'Uchida, A', 'Kock, A', 'Colot, M', 'Micksche, M']","['Luger TA', 'Uchida A', 'Kock A', 'Colot M', 'Micksche M']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-8)']",IM,"['Biological Products/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chemotactic Factors/physiology', 'Cytokines', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epidermis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Interleukin-8', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Temperature']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Apr;134(4):2477-83.,,,,,,,,

Several cloned, nonleukaemic cell lines (FDC-P cells) are absolutely dependent on HCGF and die in the absence of it. In these cell lines, factor dependence is associated with the ability of HCGF to increase glucose uptake, thereby controlling glycolytic flux and intracellular ATP levels. We have now investigated the effects of HCGF on glucose uptake in WEHI-3B cells. At 20 degrees C 2-deoxyglucose uptake could be stimulated by the addition of HCGF to the extracellular medium. L-glucose uptake was markedly lower than 2-deoxyglucose uptake and did not respond to the addition of HCGF. At 37 degrees C no HCGF stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake was found. However, at this temperature HCGF release from WEHI-3B cells was markedly higher than at 20 degrees C. Our experiments indicate that HCGF stimulates the glucose transport system in both WEHI-3 cells and FDC-P cells. The similarities between the WEHI-3B cell and FDC-P2 cell polypeptide phenotype were investigated using two-dimensional isoelectric focussing/poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis. This revealed a high degree of correlation between the two cell types in their protein constituents, indicating a close relationship between the normal and leukaemic cells. These similarities between WEHI-3B cells and FDC-P2 cells are considered and their relevance to haemopoiesis and leukaemogenesis is discussed.","['Whetton, A D', 'Bazill, G W', 'Dexter, T M']","['Whetton AD', 'Bazill GW', 'Dexter TM']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Deoxy Sugars)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoradiography', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/analysis/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Deoxy Sugars/*metabolism', 'Deoxyglucose/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Peptides/analysis', 'Temperature']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041230112 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1985 Apr;123(1):73-8. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041230112.,,,,,,,,

Exposure of the Friend cells to dimethyl sulfoxide, which stimulates differentiation, increased ATP-dependent proteolysis approximately 2-fold although inducing differentiation in the K562 line had no significant effect on proteolysis. In contrast to the previously described soluble ATP-dependent proteolytic system of reticulocytes, the activity in the more primative erythroid cells is associated with a particulate fraction and is readily sedimentable by centrifugation at 100,000 X g for 1 h. Like the soluble reticulocyte system, the particulate activity requires divalent cation and is inhibited by hemin as well as vanadate. The activity was isolated on a sucrose cushion (30%) and did not appear to be associated with membranes, cytoskeleton, or polysomes. This enzymatic activity which degrades abnormal globin chains may initially reside in a particulate fraction and then become solubilized during erythroid maturation to the reticulocyte stage. Alternatively, the particulate activity may disappear with cell maturation being replaced by a distinct soluble activity.

The same type of H-2d----H-2b chimeras displayed complete resistance to inculation of leukaemogenic H-2b restricted RadLV while all H-2b----H-2b, syngeneically reconstituted mice developed disseminated leukaemia.

Thus, no H-2 restriction of donor T cells can be advocated for suppression of anti-tumour effector functions in the chimeras.

A model for the management of adults with cancer.,1215-25,"Clinical research on cancers of children during the last two decades has led to spectacular improvements in treatment and cure rates. The demands of multi-institutional clinical trials required development of teams of specialists at each participating institution. Multidisciplinary teamwork in diagnosing, staging, and treating children with cancer has become the only acceptable mode in this country. These concepts now should be applied to the management of adults with cancer. The complete staging of cancer now involves many new disciplines. Accurate staging, including biologic as well as clinical staging, is becoming increasingly important in determining the most appropriate treatment plan. Although surgical removal provides the greatest opportunity for cure of patients with malignant tumors, the majority of patients having primary surgery cannot be cured by surgery alone. Multiple disciplines should be involved in the assessment of each patient, in developing and in carrying out the most appropriate plan of patient management, in order to achieve the best results.","['Hammond, G D']",['Hammond GD'],['eng'],['CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Canada', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/therapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', '*Patient Care Team', 'Prognosis', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/therapy', 'Sarcoma/therapy', 'Time Factors', 'United States']",1985/03/15 00:00,1985/03/15 00:01,['1985/03/15 00:00'],"['1985/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19850315)55:6<1215::aid-cncr2820550613>3.0.co;2-d [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1985 Mar 15;55(6):1215-25. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19850315)55:6<1215::aid-cncr2820550613>3.0.co;2-d.,,,,,,,,

II. Studies with monoclonal antibodies and terminal transferase.",297-309,"A panel of 19 monoclonal antibodies (McAb) and the enzyme terminal transferase (TdT) have been applied to the characterization of poorly differentiated blasts from 50 patients with chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL) and myelofibrosis in blast crisis (BC), acute myelofibrosis and undifferentiated leukaemia. These cells were also extensively studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (see Polli et al, 1985a). McAb against platelet glycoproteins (GP) showed a high specificity for megakaryoblasts, in particular those reactive with the GPIIb/IIIa complex (J15) and GPIIIa (C15 and C17), which were positive in a higher proportion of blasts than the McAb to GPIb (AN51 and FMC25). Findings with these anti-platelet McAb paralleled those of the platelet-peroxidase (PPO) reaction in 76% of cases studied simultaneously. The PPO reaction was always positive in cases in which two or more of the McAb were reactive with the blast cells. The differences observed suggest, nevertheless, that PPO is more sensitive for megakaryoblasts than the McAb and that this TEM technique should be reserved for cases which are negative with the platelet specific McAb. Of the McAb against myeloid antigens used in this series OKM1 was positive in 50% of cases but the others failed to demonstrate early features of differentiation in myeloblasts and monoblasts. In only three cases were erythroid precursors demonstrated by TEM and these were the only ones reactive with a McAb to glycophorin-A (LICR LON/R10). TdT and the McAb J5 helped in the identification of lymphoblasts which were seen as a 'pure' proliferation in 23% of CGL-BC and as part of blast cell mixtures in another 17% of cases. The McAb reactive to haemopoietic precursor cells (RFB1, FMC8 and OKIa), on the other hand, were of no practical value for the classification of blast cell types. The lineage specificity of several of the McAb used in this study, confirmed by TEM, suggest that these reagents are valuable tools for the characterization of immature blast cells.","['San Miguel, J F', 'Tavares de Castro, J', 'Matutes, E', 'Rodriguez, B', 'Polli, N', 'Zola, H', 'McMichael, A J', 'Bollum, F J', 'Thompson, D S', 'Goldman, J M']","['San Miguel JF', 'Tavares de Castro J', 'Matutes E', 'Rodriguez B', 'Polli N', 'Zola H', 'McMichael AJ', 'Bollum FJ', 'Thompson DS', 'Goldman JM', 'et al.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Stem Cells/*pathology']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1985.tb02995.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1985 Feb;59(2):297-309. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1985.tb02995.x.,,,,,,,,

In six patients, CLL and plasma cells synthesized Ig molecules with different light chains, probably indicating the coexistence of two distinct clonal proliferations.

A structure-activity analysis revealed that derivatives with side-chains, which contain a negatively-charged group, had significantly reduced inhibitory activity. The ability of these compounds to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase was dependent on the hydroxyl groups being in the ortho position and did not correlate with free radical inhibitory activity. A kinetic analysis by the method of Lineweaver-Burk indicated that the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase by the derivative 3,4-dihydroxybenzylamine was competitive with the reducing substrate dithioerythritol. This analog, in combination with hydroxyurea, gave synergistic inhibition or ribonucleotide reductase, suggesting different sites of action. Using Tween 80-treated L1210 cells, it was found that these drugs had an immediate inhibitory effect on ribonucleotide reductase activity in intact, reversibly permeabilized cells. Furthermore, although these drugs had no immediate effect on DNA polymerase, in permeabilized L1210 cells (when the cells were preincubated with the dihydroxybenzene derivatives for 1 hr prior to permeabilization), there was significant inhibition of DNA polymerase activity.

In the present study we use two dimensional gel electrophoresis to show that the PMA effect on platelets is associated with enhanced phosphorylation of a series of polypeptides at 44K which migrate close to but distinct from a previously reported 47K protein. We identified these proteins as the class I molecules of the human histocompatibility antigens (HLA A,B). We further demonstrate that the PMA effect is also associated with a dramatic phosphorylation of HLA antigens in HL-60 leukemic cells and in human lymphocytes, showing that an increase in phosphorylation of HLA antigens is intimately related to the signal of PMA in various cellular systems. Immunoprecipitation of HLA proteins resulted in coprecipitation of phosphorylated myosin light chain (20K). HLA antigens are transmembrane proteins which interact with cytoskeletal elements, probably via their intracellular region, which has been previously shown to be phosphorylated.

Epidemiologic systems to monitor exposure, as well as risk with or without such exposure, have been very hard to develop and very expensive to implement, and often have yielded ambiguous or questionably useful findings. The pharmaceutical industry is rising to the challenge of this situation, with attention to epidemiologic responsibilities and potential contributions deriving from them. This paper reviews the overall methodologic and public policy context surrounding pharmaco-epidemiology in the 1980s and then depicts an evolving program in pharmaco-epidemiology at one company, Burroughs Wellcome, as an example of one possible contributor. It discusses the company's epidemiologic approach to the question of association between treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, one of which is manufactured by Burroughs Wellcome Company (Imuran brand azathioprine) and a possible increased risk of neoplasms in patients receiving these drugs as treatment for their rheumatoid arthritis. The paper will highlight specific epidemiologic applications of data bases derived from the published literature as well as voluntary reporting to industry. It will describe a proactive program in the development and conduct of epidemiologic studies to address these difficult problems.","['Tilson, H H', 'Whisnant, J']","['Tilson HH', 'Whisnant J']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,['MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)'],IM,"['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*complications/drug therapy', 'Azathioprine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Computers', '*Drug Industry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Time Factors', 'United States']",1985/01/21 00:00,1985/01/21 00:01,['1985/01/21 00:00'],"['1985/01/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/21 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(85)90250-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(85)90250-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1985 Jan 21;78(1A):69-76. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(85)90250-5.,,,,,,,,

All four patients had taken antimetabolites prior to receiving total body irradiation, and two continued to use them after total body irradiation. Two patients had taken alkylating agents before, and one had used them after total body irradiation. All patients showed clinical improvement. However, in two patients myeloproliferative disorders developed: a myelodysplastic preleukemia at 40 months after total body irradiation in one and acute myelogenous leukemia at 25 months in the other. Total body irradiation differs from total nodal irradiation in the total dose of irradiation (300 to 400 rads versus 2,000 to 3,000), and in the duration of the therapy (two sittings versus treatment over several weeks to months). Furthermore, the patients in the total body irradiation study frequently used cytotoxic drugs before and/or after irradiation, whereas in one total nodal irradiation study, azathioprine (2 mg/kg per day or less) was permitted, but no other cytotoxic agents were allowed. Rheumatologists may therefore face a binding decision when deciding to treat a patient with rheumatoid arthritis with either a cytotoxic drug or irradiation.","['Urowitz, M B', 'Rider, W D']","['Urowitz MB', 'Rider WD']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*complications/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Preleukemia/chemically induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1985/01/21 00:00,1985/01/21 00:01,['1985/01/21 00:00'],"['1985/01/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/21 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(85)90248-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(85)90248-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1985 Jan 21;78(1A):60-4. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(85)90248-7.,,,,,,,,

Because various leukaemic cell lines express high levels of c-myc messenger RNA, it was of interest to discover whether the gene could be down-regulated in these cells by a growth inhibitor such as interferon (IFN). We show here that in Daudi Burkitt's lymphoma cells, IFN-alpha produces a five- to sevenfold reduction in c-myc mRNA through a decreased rate of c-myc gene transcription. By isolating a growth-resistant Daudi cell variant that had escaped from this down-regulation, we provide the first clear link between reduction of c-myc mRNA and the IFN-mediated G0/G1 arrest characteristic of Daudi cells. Furthermore, by screening other cell lines, we demonstrate the heterogeneity of human leukaemic cells with respect to these criteria. Thus, IFN-alpha fails to reduce the c-myc mRNA and to change the cell-cycle distribution in HL-60 and U937 cells, although normal induction of other IFN-regulated activities takes place.

We measured the serum thyrotropin and thyroid hormone concentrations longitudinally in 35 patients with hematopoietic cancer or aplastic anemia who were treated by bone-marrow transplantation. In 19 patients thyroxine declined sharply after bone-marrow transplantation and was associated with a reduction of the serum thyrotropin in the 17 patients tested, often to levels below the normal range. The serum triiodothyronine level, free thyroxine index, and free thyroxine level also declined in these patients. In the patients who recovered, clinical improvement was accompanied by the return of thyrotropin and thyroid hormone concentrations to their pretreatment ranges. These and related findings suggest that the low-thyroxine state of severe illness is the result of several events, one of which is failure of the normal negative-feedback control of the pituitary-thyroid axis due to illness-associated, decreased secretion of thyrotropin. The notion that such patients are ""euthyroid"" must be questioned, but the possible value of thyroid hormone-replacement therapy in these circumstances remains to be determined.","['Wehmann, R E', 'Gregerman, R I', 'Burns, W H', 'Saral, R', 'Santos, G W']","['Wehmann RE', 'Gregerman RI', 'Burns WH', 'Saral R', 'Santos GW']",['eng'],"['CA-15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CAO-6973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '06LU7C9H1V (Triiodothyronine)', '9002-71-5 (Thyrotropin)', 'Q51BO43MG4 (Thyroxine)', 'VTD58H1Z2X (Dopamine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/blood', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dopamine/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Thyrotropin/blood/*metabolism/physiology', 'Thyroxine/*blood', 'Triiodothyronine/blood']",1985/02/28 00:00,1985/02/28 00:01,['1985/02/28 00:00'],"['1985/02/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/28 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM198502283120904 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1985 Feb 28;312(9):546-52. doi: 10.1056/NEJM198502283120904.,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms by which macrophages recognize malignant cells, however, are not well understood. We used human monocytes and four lymphoblastoid cell (LC) lines derived from human acute lymphocytic leukemia to investigate the initial recognition of tumor cells by monocytes. IgM antibody mediated the binding of these cells to monocytes only in the presence of complement. The stepwise addition of complement components to IgM-coated LC indicated that C3 was necessary to monocyte binding. Similarly, monocyte recognition of IgM-coated LC was maximal in the presence of sera from patients with congenital C5 or C6 deficiency, but absent in the presence of sera deficient C4 or from a patient with congenital C2 deficiency. Complement activation was associated with C3 consumption and the deposition of substantial amounts of C3 on to LC. Although 3H-C3 bound to LC appeared stable for 2 hours, approximately 4.0 +/- 2 X 10(5) 3H-C3 per LC was necessary for monocyte recognition, compared to approximately 2.7 +/- 0.5 X 10(3) 3H-C3 per RBC. The data indicate that LC can be recognized by monocytes through complement by mechanisms similar to nonmalignant target cells. However, substantial amounts of C3 are necessary to induce monocyte recognition of IgM-coated LC and, thus, such complement mediated recognition may be inefficient.","['Armstrong, S', 'McDermott, P', 'Schreiber, A D']","['Armstrong S', 'McDermott P', 'Schreiber AD']",['eng'],"['CA-15236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-27068/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-28207/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Complement C3)', '0 (Complement C3b Inactivator Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'Complement C3/metabolism', 'Complement C3b Inactivator Proteins/pharmacology', 'Complement System Proteins/deficiency/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen', 'Monocytes/immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Complement/analysis/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Trypan Blue/pharmacology']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.37.2.161 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1985 Feb;37(2):161-74. doi: 10.1002/jlb.37.2.161.,,,,,,,,

In this report, the relationship between the cytoskeleton in the M phi and the M phi cytolytic activity has been investigated. The actin filament inhibitors cytochalasin B and dihydrocytochalasin B (H2CB) both reduced M phi-mediated lysis of AbK562 cells by approximately 50% at a concentration of 1 microM. This concentration of H2CB did not inhibit the number of target cells bound to M phi. Dihydrocytochalasin B did not inhibit the M phi ability to release cytotoxic protein factors, suggesting that H2CB does not inhibit lysis by inhibiting release of cytotoxic protein factors. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed a rapid accumulation of actin filaments towards the contact area in more than 80% of the examined M phi-AbK562 conjugates. Exposure to H2CB did not prevent this accumulation, but caused aggregation of the accumulated actin filaments in the contact area with the target cell. Accumulation of actin filaments did not occur toward tumor cells not coated with antibodies. Scanning and thin section electron microscopy demonstrated large M phi pseudopodia directed toward the AbK562 cells, with close apposition of the effector and target cell membranes with interdigitations. The formation of the M phi pseudopodia was inhibited by exposure to H2CB. These observations indicate that M phi membrane motility toward AbK562 cells is closely related to M phi-mediated lysis of AbK562 cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy of the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and the Golgi apparatus revealed that both the MTOC and the Golgi apparatus in M phi reoriented towards the bound AbK562 cells in approximately 45% of the examined M phi-AbK562 conjugates. The microtubule-depolymerizing drugs colchicine and vinblastine did not inhibit M phi-mediated lysis of AbK562 cells at concentrations which disrupted the microtubule arrays in the M phi. The carboxylic ionophore monensin, which blocks Golgi-derived secretion, inhibited M phi-mediated lysis of AbK562 to a lesser extent as compared to H2CB. These results suggest that microtubule functions are of less importance in M phi-mediated lysis of AbK562 cells as compared to actin filament functions. However, the MTOC and the Golgi apparatus could participate in M phi-mediated lysis of AbK562 cells by mechanisms related to secretion of cytotoxic molecules.","['Espevik, T']",['Espevik T'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)']",IM,"['Actins/analysis/physiology', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/physiology', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects', 'Cytoskeleton/analysis/*physiology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Golgi Apparatus/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Microtubules/drug effects/physiology', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*immunology/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Rabbits']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Mar;134(3):2017-25.,,,,,,,,

New epidemiological data, presented in this study, show that the median age of patients with ANLL is 62-64 years, with 54%-59% of the patients being greater than 60 years old. When combining age-specific incidence data with age-specific data on CR derived from the recent literature, it can be calculated that the cumulated rate of CR for all ages combined will be only between 35.3% and 49.2% with current therapy. It can also be calculated that BMT with its present limitations can at most cure 1.44%-2.5% of all patients with ANLL. These findings suggest that some of the accepted conceptions in ANLL regarding age distribution of patients, cumulated rates of CR, and value of BMT cannot stand up to closer scrutiny. Treatment priorities and resource allocation in ANLL should be reconsidered, and more attention should be given to solving the problems of treatment in elderly patients.","['Brincker, H']",['Brincker H'],['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Multi-Institutional Systems', 'Prognosis']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1985 Jan;69(1):5-11.,,,,,,,,

Treatment of the promyelocytic HL-60 cells with dimethyl sulfoxide or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 induced the cells to acquire a phenotype that resembled that of granulocytes and monocytes-macrophages, respectively. These phenotypes were characterized by changes in cell growth, cell morphology, expression of specific cell surface antigens, and activities of lysozyme and nonspecific esterase enzymes. Induction of these differentiation markers in the HL-60 cells was associated with induction of the myeloid-specific nuclear antigens. The ML-2 cells, which are arrested at the myeloblast-promyelocyte stage, were also susceptible to the induction of cell differentiation and to changes in the expression of the nuclear antigens, but the degree of susceptibility was less than in the HL-60 cells. The less-differentiated KG-1 and B-II myeloid cells were either not responsive or responded only in a limited degree to the induction of cell differentiation or to changes in the expression of the nuclear antigens. We suggest that the reactivity of cells with monoclonal antibodies to specific nuclear antigens can be used as a maturational marker in cell differentiation studies. Furthermore, nuclear antigens expressed early in cellular differentiation may provide information about changes in regulatory elements in normal and malignant cells.","['Murao, S', 'Epstein, A L', 'Clevenger, C V', 'Huberman, E']","['Murao S', 'Epstein AL', 'Clevenger CV', 'Huberman E']",['eng'],['R01 CA30621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Nucleoproteins)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Nuclear', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Nucleoproteins/*analysis']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Feb;45(2):791-5.,,,,,,,,

At these concentrations, little effect was noted immediately on L1210 cell radiolabeled precursor incorporation; however, at higher concentrations, EDOMEN inhibited [3H]leucine and [3H]mannose incorporation, while MAZ specifically decreased L1210 cell [3H]thymidine and [3H]leucine incorporation. Inhibition of Lewis lung carcinoma and B16 melanoma cell growth by 50% in vitro was achieved at higher concentrations of these agents (10(-4) to 10(-3) M). Since the currently available nitrosoureido sugars, streptozotocin and chlorozotocin, have been observed by us to be diabetogenic, EDOMEN and MAZ were evaluated for their specific toxicity to rat pancreatic beta-cells in vitro. Cytotoxicity in beta-cell cultures was monitored both by phase-contrast microscopy and the release of insulin into the culture medium. beta-Cells were found to be 10-fold more sensitive to the toxic effects of MAZ than were pancreatic fibroblasts. EDOMEN, on the other hand, did not damage beta-cells preferentially and therefore was not considered diabetogenic. Both MAZ and EDOMEN had moderate activity as antileukemic agents in mice. At 50 mg/kg/day i.p. for 5 days, MAZ increased the life span of female DBA/2J mice with L1210 leukemia by over 50%. Similarly, doses of EDOMEN at 125 to 250 mg/kg/day i.p. for 5 days increased L1210 leukemic life span by nearly 60%. At these doses, no effect of MAZ was observed on primary Lewis lung carcinoma growth or life span of tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice. EDOMEN, however, increased life span in Lewis lung carcinoma mice by up to 33% and caused an apparent antimetastatic effect. These studies indicate that EDOMEN may have enhanced value as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent due to its therapeutic effectiveness, lack of diabetogenic potential, and other favorable formulation properties (water solubility) as compared with other clinically available nitrosoureas.","['Bernacki, R J', 'Wilson, G L', 'Mossman, B T', 'Angelino, N', 'Kanter, P M', 'Korytnyk, W']","['Bernacki RJ', 'Wilson GL', 'Mossman BT', 'Angelino N', 'Kanter PM', 'Korytnyk W']",['eng'],"['CA08793/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES03066/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '84069-38-5 (CGP 6809)', '95611-08-8', ""(2-amino-2-deoxy-N'-methyl-N'-nitrosoureido-1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetylmannopyranose)""]",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Insulin/metabolism', 'Islets of Langerhans/*drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Melanoma/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/*therapeutic use']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Feb;45(2):695-702.,,,,,,,,

Injection of in vivo immune lymphocytes i.v. caused complete regression of footpad tumor and cured 96% of all mice (greater than 60 days mean survival; p less than 0.0005). Carrageenan or trypan blue treatment of the tumor-bearing host abrogated the therapeutic effect of adoptively transferred cells. Cure rates were significantly reduced to 27% (p less than 0.004) and 0% (p less than 0.0001) and mean survival times to 40.2 days (p less than 0.0005) and 15.2 (p less than 0.005) days for mice treated with carrageenan and trypan blue, respectively, in addition to immune cells. In vivo treatment of the immune spleen cell donors with carrageenan or trypan blue had no significant effect on the ability of those splenocytes to mediate cure when adoptively transferred into tumor-bearing hosts, indicating that the inhibitory activity of these agents cannot be attributed to direct toxicity to immune lymphoid cells. These results demonstrate that a recipient component(s), possibly macrophages, sensitive to carrageenan and to trypan blue but relatively resistant to radiation (500 rads), plays a vital role in the cure of tumor-bearing mice that receive the adoptive transfer of immune splenocytes.","['Mule, J J', 'Rosenstein, M', 'Shu, S', 'Rosenberg, S A']","['Mule JJ', 'Rosenstein M', 'Shu S', 'Rosenberg SA']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['9000-07-1 (Carrageenan)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrageenan/pharmacology', 'Female', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Trypan Blue/pharmacology', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Feb;45(2):526-31.,,,,,,,,

In one case, conversion from acute lymphoblastic leukemia to acute myeloid leukemia was noted (FAB L1, TdT+ to FAB M4, Auer rods, TdT-). In another patient, two distinct populations of myeloid and lymphoid blast cells were observed simultaneously (TdT-, LeuM1+/TdT+, LeuM1-). In two additional patients, acute leukemia was characterized by the expression of both lymphoid and myeloid markers on the same cell (TdT+/Leu M1+, B4+/Leu M1+ and greater than or equal to 70% TdT+, T11+, My9+). The Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome was negative in all cases, though other chromosomal abnormalities were noted in three out of four cases. Malignant transformation of a pluripotential stem cell for both lymphoid and myeloid lineages, with or without the Ph1 chromosome marker, could explain the coexistence of distinct populations of lymphoblasts and myeloblasts in acute leukemia.

Under similar assay conditions the normal c-abl gene products, murine P150c-abl and human P145c-abl, lacked detectable kinase activity. Reaction conditions were modified to identify conditions which would permit the detection of c-abl tyrosine kinase activity. It was found that the Formalin-fixed Staphylococcus aureus formerly used for immunoprecipitation inhibits in vitro abl kinase activity. In addition, the sodium dodecyl sulfate and deoxycholate detergents formerly used in the cell lysis buffer were found to decrease recovered abl kinase activity. The discovery of assay conditions for c-abl kinase activity now makes it possible to compare P150c-abl and P145c-abl kinase activity with the altered abl proteins P160v-abl and P210c-abl. Although all of the abl proteins have in vitro tyrosine kinase activity, they differ in the way they utilize themselves as substrates in vitro. Comparison of in vitro and in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation sites of the abl proteins suggests that they function differently in vivo. The development of c-abl kinase assay conditions should be useful in elucidating c-abl function.","['Konopka, J B', 'Witte, O N']","['Konopka JB', 'Witte ON']",['eng'],['GM 07185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Thymoma', 'Thymus Neoplasms', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.5.11.3116-3123.1985 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1985 Nov;5(11):3116-23. doi: 10.1128/mcb.5.11.3116-3123.1985.,PMC369126,,,,,,,

The leukemic T-cell lines in tissue culture were 200-fold more sensitive than B-cell lines to the toxic effect of deoxyadenosine. The increased sensitivity of T-cell lines to AdR plus dCF was associated with the accumulation of deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) in the cells. In established cell lines, an inverse correlation was observed between ED 50 of AdR plus dCF and the relative increase of dATP levels in the cells after the incubation of the cells with AdR plus dCF. In circulating leukemic cells that had been incubated with AdR and dCF, dATP arose in all groups but the correlation was not found between the sensitivity of AdR and the relative dATP accumulation.

A lymph node biopsy revealed that the majority of the cells had plasmacytoid features but were consistently negative for surface or cytoplasmic immunoglobulin products, myelomonocytic surface markers, and peroxidase. Rather, lymph node plasmacytoid cells expressed T-cell markers (T 4/Leu 3+, T 10+), transferrin receptors (T 9+), and a proportion of them was also positive for sheep erythrocyte receptors (T 11/Leu 5+). This case is strikingly similar to a case reported by Lennert's group with respect to morphology, surface phenotypic features of the malignant plasmacytoid cells, and the association between a lymphoproliferative and a myeloproliferative disorder.

In the present study, low density mononuclear cells from normal peripheral blood were separated into adherent/non-adherent, phagocytic/non-phagocytic, T-lymphocytes/non-T cells, and Fc-receptor positive and negative cells in search for LAI-producing cells in normal blood. Cell fractions enriched for NK-cells were isolated from Percoll gradients and NK-activity and LAI-production were assayed in the different fractions. Anti-Leu-2, anti-Leu-3, and anti-HLA-DR were used to deplete mononuclear cells of cells positive for these monoclonals using a panning technique. It is concluded from these studies that normal LAI-producing cells belong to a non-adherent, non-phagocytic, non-T, non-B, Fc-receptor positive population which does not express NK-activity, and which is Leu-2, Leu-3 and HLA-DR negative.

Examination of TBC on cytocentrifuge slides indicated that the majority of binders displayed LGL morphology. The cytotoxic reaction mediated by monkey NK cells exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics pattern; the maximum rate of lysis (Vmax) of K-562 was found to be 1-2 X 10(4) following 3 h of incubation.

This would indicate that the reduced cellular responsiveness in aging may be related both to a defect of IL-2 receptor expression on T cells of aged subjects and to an impairment in the endogenous IL-2 synthesis in the aged individuals.","['Rabinowich, H', 'Goses, Y', 'Reshef, T', 'Klajman, A']","['Rabinowich H', 'Goses Y', 'Reshef T', 'Klajman A']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Ireland,Mech Ageing Dev,Mechanisms of ageing and development,0347227,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Aged', 'Aging', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*immunology']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0047-6374(85)90081-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0047-6374(85)90081-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Mech Ageing Dev. 1985 Nov;32(2-3):213-26. doi: 10.1016/0047-6374(85)90081-8.,,,,,,,,

Optimal effects were found after 2 days of in vitro culture of the cells with 50 micrograms/ml of poly(I,C)-LC or 14 h to 3 days after a single intraperitoneal injection of 1-2 mg/kg of poly(I,C)-LC into normal mice. The increase in CSF secretion by M phi and BMC was paralleled in vivo by an increase in serum CSF levels, followed by a rise in committed granulocyte and M phi progenitor cells (GM-CFU-C), nucleated BMC, and blood leukocytes of myelomonocytic origin. Poly(I,C)-LC at doses greater than 4 mg/kg, however, were strongly myelosuppressive. In vitro treatment of undifferentiated myelomonocytic leukemia cells from the WEHI-3B cell line with 10-1,000 micrograms/ml of poly(I,C)-LC resulted in a significant increase in CSF secretion by the leukemic cells and a concomitant inhibition of their proliferation. Incubation of cells from the WEHI-3B D+ subline, which differentiate in response to GM-CSF or G-CSF, with 50-100 micrograms/ml poly(I,C)-LC in agar cultures induced in approximately 45% of the leukemic colonies a differentiation into granulocytes and/or M phi. Poly(I,C)-LC, however, had no effect on differentiation of cells from the CSF unresponsive WEHI-3B D- subline. The CSF-inducing biological response modifier poly(I,C)-LC thus has the potential to stimulate growth and differentiation of normal, as well as differentiation of malignant myelopoietic progenitor cells.","['Schlick, E', 'Bettens, F', 'Ruffmann, R', 'Chirigos, M A', 'Hewetson, P']","['Schlick E', 'Bettens F', 'Ruffmann R', 'Chirigos MA', 'Hewetson P']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Response Mod,Journal of biological response modifiers,8219656,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '25104-18-1 (Polylysine)', '7KYP9TKT70 (poly ICLC)', '9004-67-5 (Methylcellulose)', 'K679OBS311 (Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium)', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Methylcellulose/*analogs & derivatives', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Poly I-C/*pharmacology', 'Polylysine/*pharmacology']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Biol Response Mod. 1985 Dec;4(6):628-33.,,,,,,,,

Because of the difficulties inherent in obtaining sufficient peripheral blood lymphocytes to purify the collagen synthesis inhibitory factor (CSIF) further and to study in detail its mechanisms of action, we have examined CSIF production by several leukemic human T- and B-lymphocyte cell lines. From the 10 lines tested (4 T- and 6 B-lymphocyte cell lines), we found 2 T-lymphocyte cell lines which produced CSIF constitutively. When the effects of various lymphocyte mitogens on CSIF production by these cell lines were examined, it was found that only phorbol myristic acid was stimulatory. Further studies demonstrated that optimal CSIF production by the phorbol myristic acid-stimulated leukemic T-lymphocytes could be achieved in a chemically defined, serum-free medium. The CSIF in the supernatants from such cultures was further purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration chromatography and it was shown that it had similar properties to those of CSIF produced by normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes. These findings indicate that certain leukemic T-lymphocyte cell lines are capable of CSIF production in continuous cultures.

This second set rejection occurred even against the allogeneic tumor inoculated as early as 3 days old, if the mice had been primed with the alloantigens at birth.

The purpose of this study was to measure the effects of hydrocortisone on this process, using two end-points. First, we measured the effects of increasing concentrations of hydrocortisone on the primary plating efficiency of T-lymphocyte-depleted blast cell preparations from AML peripheral blood. Second, colonies forming in the presence or absence of the hormone were pooled and replated; changes in the plating efficiencies (secondary plating efficiency or PE2) of these suspensions reflected the effect of the hormone on blast progenitor self-renewal. For comparison, we measured the hydrocortisone dose response curves for normal granulopoietic and T-lymphocyte colony-formation. The latter showed little individual variation; T-lymphocyte colony-formation was regularly sensitive to the hormone while granulopoietic colony-formation was resistant. In contrast, wide variations were found in the hydrocortisone dose response curve for blast from 24 patients with AML (FAB 1-6). A significant association was found between successful remission induction and resistance to hydrocortisone in 24 treated patients. The association was maintained when the data was stratified by other risk factors, including PE2 and the presence of blasts bearing immunologically-defined markers of more than one differentiation lineage (lineage infidelity). We propose that sensitivity to hydrocortisone may reflect the passage of blast cells through lymphopoiesis-associated components of differentiation programs. From this point of view, the poor prognosis associated with sensitivity of blast progenitors to hydrocortisone may be similar to the response-failure of patients whose blasts exhibit lineaged infidelity when tested with immunological procedures.","['Cheng, G Y', 'Curtis, J E', 'Tritchler, D', 'McCulloch, E A']","['Cheng GY', 'Curtis JE', 'Tritchler D', 'McCulloch EA']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(85)90048-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1985;9(12):1547-57. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(85)90048-7.,,,,,,,,

Mononuclear cells of low density (d less than 1.062g cm-3) with blast-cell morphology were cryopreserved before culture in vitro. Upon culture in conventional colony assays, up to 20% of the cells formed hemopoietic colonies. Although the spectrum of colony types resembled that of normal bone-marrow cells, there were large differences between the patients with respect to the number, type and size of colonies that were observed. Colony formation required the addition of hemopoietic growth factors, such as colony-stimulating activity and erythropoietin to the culture medium. The cells were used to assay hemopoietic regulatory molecules. Both erythropoietin and colony-stimulating activity induced a strong proliferative response as measured by thymidine incorporation. Maximal stimulation was observed when erythropoietin and the supernatant of mixed lymphocyte cultures were added simultaneously. The difference between the cells from the 2 patients in clonal assays was reflected by the different response to individual hemopoietic regulators. The time course of maximal stimulation followed distinct patterns dependent on the source of stimulator. The stimulation was linearly dependent on the input cell number.

Alkylating agent mutagenesis is frequently mediated through formation and persistence of a particular DNA base adduct, O6alkylguanine, which preferentially mispairs with thymine rather than cytosine, leading to point mutations. O6alkylguanine is repaired by O6alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (alkyltransferase), a protein that removes the adduct, leaving an intact guanine base in DNA. We measured alkyltransferase activity in myeloid precursors and compared it with levels in other cells and tissues. In peripheral blood granulocytes, monocytes, T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes, there was an eightfold range of activity between individuals but only a twofold range in the mean activity between cell types. Normal donors maintained stable levels of alkyltransferase activity over time. In bone marrow T lymphocytes and myeloid precursors, there was an eightfold range of alkyltransferase activity between donors. Alkyltransferase activity in the two cell types was closely correlated in individual donors, r = 0.69, P less than 0.005, but was significantly higher in the T lymphocytes than the myeloid precursors, P less than 0.05. Liver contained the highest levels of alkyltransferase of all tissues tested. By comparison, small intestine contained 34%, colon 14%, T lymphocytes 11%, brain 11%, and myeloid precursors 6.6% of the activity found in liver. Thus, human myeloid precursors have low levels of O6alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase compared with other tissues. Low levels of this DNA repair protein may increase the susceptibility of myeloid precursors to malignant transformation after exposure to certain alkylating agents.","['Gerson, S L', 'Miller, K', 'Berger, N A']","['Gerson SL', 'Miller K', 'Berger NA']",['eng'],['ESCA 00134-01/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow/*enzymology', 'Cell Line', '*DNA Repair', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/*enzymology', 'Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Distribution']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI112215 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1985 Dec;76(6):2106-14. doi: 10.1172/JCI112215.,PMC424319,,,,,,,

At low concentration (congruent to 10 microM) these agents enhance the activities of a number of inhibitory purine nucleosides, including adenosine and 2'-deoxyadenosine. The LMC-inhibitory activity of Ado but not dAdo is further enhanced by 5-iodotubercidin, uridine, 4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone, or L-homocysteine and is antagonized by theophylline. The inhibition of LMC by Ado and dAdo is increased by nitrobenzyl-thioinosine. Lymphocyte-mediated cytolysis was inhibited by EHNA or HOA alone (IC50 congruent to 150 microM), but not by dCF and CF (even at 400 microM). Inhibition of LMC by EHNA, HOA, Ado, or dAdo could not be attributed to changes in nucleoside 5'-triphosphate or S-adenosylhomocysteine levels. Inhibition of LMC by Ado appears to be related to increases in lymphocyte cAMP levels, while the mechanism of action of dAdo remains obscure. Lymphocyte-mediated cytolysis may be inhibited by EHNA and HOA through modulation of cAMP metabolism.","['Wolberg, G', 'Zimmerman, T P']","['Wolberg G', 'Zimmerman TP']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '20776-39-0 (9-(1-hydroxy-2-octyl)adenine)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '59262-86-1 (9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adenosine/pharmacology', '*Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Coformycin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Mice', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pentostatin', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/*metabolism']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1985.tb27112.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1985;451:215-26. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1985.tb27112.x.,,,,,,,,

In the majority of cases, the detection of antibodies directed against either the viral core protein, a Mr approximately equal to 24,000 protein termed p24 gag, or the viral envelope antigen is proof of previous viral infection. Thus, we have expressed the p24 gag antigen in Escherichia coli in order to produce a diagnostic reagent for the detection of virus exposure. The bacterially synthesized antigen reacts with human and rabbit antisera directed against the native p24 gag protein in both electrophoretic transfer blot assay and ELISA.

The rationale for this approach involved the observation that these mice were immunologically hyporesponsive to endogenous ecotropic virus (Akv) but fully responsive to type-specific determinants of WM-E. Hybridoma cell lines derived from mice immunized with both denatured and viable virus produced antibodies with specificity for three viral membrane-associated polypeptides, gp70, p15(E), and p15gag. Epitopes specific for WM-E virus were detected in each of these polypeptides. Cross-reactivity with Friend ecotropic virus (Friend murine leukemia virus) was observed with some gp70- and p15gag-specific antibodies, but no reactivity with endogenous Akv ecotropic virus was seen. The majority of these antibodies did not react with either xenotropic or mink cell focus-forming viruses. Two WM-E-specific anti-gp70 antibodies reacting with different determinants had virus-neutralizing activity in the absence of complement, suggesting that the respective epitopes may participate in receptor binding or virus penetration events. We used these monoclonal antibodies in initial studies to examine the replication of WM-E virus in neonatally inoculated AKR/J mice which are fully resistant to the paralytic disease induced by this virus. Since these mice express high levels of endogenous ecotropic virus, standard assays for ecotropic virus cannot be used to study this question. We present evidence that the resistance to disease does not involve a resistance to virus replication, since these mice expressed levels of viremia and virus replication in spleen and lumbar spinal cord comparable to susceptible NFS/N mice at a time when the latter began to manifest clinical signs of lower-motor-neuron pathology.","['McAtee, F J', 'Portis, J L']","['McAtee FJ', 'Portis JL']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Viral/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Gene Products, gag', 'Mice/*microbiology', 'Mice, Inbred AKR/immunology/microbiology', 'Neurons/*microbiology', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Paralysis/*microbiology', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology', '*Virus Replication']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.56.3.1018-1022.1985 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1985 Dec;56(3):1018-22. doi: 10.1128/JVI.56.3.1018-1022.1985.,PMC252677,,,,,,,

We have resolved into these two components the survival curves obtained for CLL lymphocytes by use of a simple mathematical model. A multiple correlation coefficient comparing the predicted with the experimental survival curves was close to unity (0.954-0.999). For 14/18 patients with unequivocal B-cell CLL, the leukaemic (colchicine ultrasensitive) cells behaved as a homogeneous population (D37 0.32-1.28 Gy). This is similar to the more radiosensitive class of lymphocytes of normal blood (believed to include the B cells) and is some 4-fold less than the more radioresistant class (comprising most of the T cells). The lethally hit cells were homogeneous in death rate, which followed first order kinetics. The half-life (range 9-87 h) was, on average, some 50 per cent shorter than the more radiosensitive normal lymphocytes. The remaining four patients constituted a miscellaneous group. From one of these, it can be seen that an excessively slow death rate can give the misleading impression of radioresistance. It is hypothesized that the benefit afforded certain CLL patients treated with low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) or splenic irradiation (SI) may reside, partly, in the sparing of T lymphocytes of the helper type and in accompanying selective elimination (or functional inactivation) of those of the suppressor type.","['Thomson, A E', 'Vaughan-Smith, S', 'Peel, W E', 'Wetherley-Mein, G']","['Thomson AE', 'Vaughan-Smith S', 'Peel WE', 'Wetherley-Mein G']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Int J Radiat Biol Relat Stud Phys Chem Med,"International journal of radiation biology and related studies in physics, chemistry, and medicine",0374725,,IM,"['Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood/radiotherapy', 'Lymphocytes/*radiation effects', 'Radiation Tolerance']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09553008514552081 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol Relat Stud Phys Chem Med. 1985 Dec;48(6):943-61. doi: 10.1080/09553008514552081.,,,,,,,,

We found that purine nucleoside transport in L1210 and P388 cells exhibited similar kinetic properties and sensitivity to dipyridamole and nitrobenzylthioinosine (both influx and efflux) and that the stimulation of 2'-deoxyadenosine uptake by the inhibitors in L1210 cells is not mediated at the level of its transport into the cells but rather reflects an enhanced intracellular net accumulation of deoxyadenosine nucleotides.","['Plagemann, P G', 'Wohlhueter, R M']","['Plagemann PG', 'Wohlhueter RM']",['eng'],"['AM 35211/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 24468/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', '5A614L51CT (Inosine)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Coformycin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Deoxyadenosines/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Dipyridamole/*pharmacology', 'Inosine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Pentostatin', 'Thioinosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1985/12/01 00:00,1985/12/01 00:01,['1985/12/01 00:00'],"['1985/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Dec;45(12 Pt 1):6418-24.,,,,,,,,

The results were correlated with induction, remission and relapse stages of the disease. Using the first method the levels of CIC in induction were 15.18 +/- 9.15, with 19/29 positive cases (65.50%), P less than 0.001 compared with controls. In the remission phase the levels were 9.02 +/- 5.62, 11/45 (24.49%) nonsignificant P value, and in relapse they were 16.14 +/- 11.17 28/48 (58.33%) P less than 0.001.

Thus the values of CIC as measured by PEG in the three clinical of phases ALL did not differ significantly from controls. This contrasts with results obtained by the radioiodinated C1q binding assay, where the incidence of positive values was significantly higher in induction and in relapse and lower in the remission phase. These observations were extended in sequential vertical studies performed in a group of patients. These results suggest that raised CIC detected by the 125I-C1q method may reflect a progressive state in ALL and that quantitation of these immune complexes may provide an adequate biochemical marker for prognosis.","['Croce, M V', 'Fejes, M', 'Riera, N', 'Minoldo, D A', 'Segal-Eiras, A']","['Croce MV', 'Fejes M', 'Riera N', 'Minoldo DA', 'Segal-Eiras A']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '80295-33-6 (Complement C1q)', 'EC 3.- (Complement Activating Enzymes)']",IM,"['Antigen-Antibody Complex/*analysis', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Complement Activating Enzymes/metabolism', 'Complement C1q', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/*immunology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00199780 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1985;20(1):91-5. doi: 10.1007/BF00199780.,,,,,,,,

Significantly elevated CIC levels were observed in all pathologic groups. However, sera from NHL patients with an unfavorable prognosis consistently exhibited the highest frequency of positive values and mean CIC levels in both these assays. The two tests showed concordance in 66.6% of the NHL patients' sera and were significantly correlated. Of the sera from NHL patients 12.7% were positive in the C1q-binding assay only and 15.9% in the L1210-binding assay only.

Previous work in which glucocorticoids were used to inhibit IL-2 production has indicated that proliferation of this cell line is dependent upon endogenously produced IL-2. We have found that the MLA 144 cell line has a copy of the gibbon leukemia virus inserted into the 3' nontranslated region of the IL-2 gene. This integration event produces a composite mRNA made up of the protein coding sequences of the IL-2 gene transcript but incorporating the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) in the 3' nontranslated region of the mRNA. This composite mRNA transcript uses the polyadenylylation signal in the viral 5' LTR and incorporates the viral transcriptional control regions. The integration event must involve only one allele of the IL-2 gene, since transcripts essentially identical to normal human IL-2 mRNA are also produced in cloned sublines of MLA 144. That the viral LTR contains a 94-base-pair repeat reminiscent of enhancer sequences in several viruses suggests that the integration of the viral LTR at the 3' end of the IL-2 gene is responsible for the constitutive production of IL-2 in the MLA 144 cell line.","['Chen, S J', 'Holbrook, N J', 'Mitchell, K F', 'Vallone, C A', 'Greengard, J S', 'Crabtree, G R', 'Lin, Y']","['Chen SJ', 'Holbrook NJ', 'Mitchell KF', 'Vallone CA', 'Greengard JS', 'Crabtree GR', 'Lin Y']",['eng'],['CA 39612/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hominidae/*genetics', 'Hylobates/*genetics/microbiology', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics/microbiology/*veterinary', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.21.7284 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Nov;82(21):7284-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.21.7284.,PMC390834,,,,,,"['GENBANK/K03174', 'GENBANK/M11144', 'GENBANK/M16832']",

Pertussis toxin reveals correlation between inositol trisphosphate generation, calcium ion transients, and cellular activation.",1348-54,"The mechanism of neutrophil activation by the chemotactic peptide formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) has been studied by pretreatment of human neutrophils with pertussis toxin. Upon stimulation with FMLP, the cytosolic-free calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i, is increased both by stimulation of calcium influx and mobilization of cellular calcium. We have measured [Ca2+]i as well as the generation of the phospholipid breakdown product inositol trisphosphate (IP3), which is thought to mediate Ca2+ mobilization. As the phosphoinositide pool in human neutrophils is difficult to prelabel with [3H]myoinositol, experiments were also carried out in the cultured human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 after differentiation with dimethylsulfoxide. Pertussis toxin pretreatment of both cell types inhibited FMLP stimulated membrane depolarization, exocytosis, and superoxide production in a dose-dependent manner. This toxin effect was selective for the receptor agonist, since stimulation of these parameters by two substances bypassing the transduction mechanism, the calcium ionophore ionomycin and the phorbolester phorbol myristate acetate, were unaffected. Rises in [Ca2+]i, as well as generation of IP3 in response to FMLP, were inhibited in parallel; for the inhibition of functional responses, slightly lower toxin concentrations were required. The attentuation of the [Ca2+]i rise was more marked in the absence of extracellular calcium, i.e., when the rise is due only to calcium mobilization. The results provide evidence that phospholipase C stimulation by FMLP resulting in IP3 generation is involved in the signal transduction mechanism. Coupling of FMLP receptor occupancy to phospholipase C activation is sensitive to pertussis toxin, suggesting the involvement of a GTP binding protein (N protein), which has been shown to be a pertussis toxin substrate. The parallel changes in [Ca2+]i and IP3 further support the hypothesis that IP3 is the calcium-mobilizing mediator in FMLP-activated cells.","['Krause, K H', 'Schlegel, W', 'Wollheim, C B', 'Andersson, T', 'Waldvogel, F A', 'Lew, P D']","['Krause KH', 'Schlegel W', 'Wollheim CB', 'Andersson T', 'Waldvogel FA', 'Lew PD']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Ethers)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/metabolism', 'Ethers/pharmacology', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Intracellular Fluid/analysis', 'Ionomycin', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI112109 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1985 Oct;76(4):1348-54. doi: 10.1172/JCI112109.,PMC424072,,,,,,,

In this study leucovorin (folinic acid, LCV) was added to the MTX/FUra combination with the intention of generating elevated levels of methylenetetrahydrofolate to promote the formation of a stable fluorodeoxyuridylate-thymidylate synthetase ternary complex, thereby augmenting the cytotoxicity of the MTX-FUra sequence. The addition of 10 or 100 microM LCV concurrently with or after 10 microM FUra following MTX (1 microM) pretreatment did not augment the inhibition of L1210 cell growth or the clonigenicity compared with MTX prior to FUra without LCV. The effects of LCV scheduling on the sequential MTX and FUra-induced inhibition of thymidylate synthesis were measured by examining the rate of [6-3H] dUrd incorporation into the acid-precipitable cell fraction and by direct quantitation of the thymidylate synthetase ternary complex. Combination of 100 microM LCV with 10 microM FUra after 1 microM MTX resulted in significantly more ternary complex formation than did 1 microM MTX before 10 microM FUra alone. The inhibitory effects of FUra on thymidylate synthetase in the presence of MTX, however, could not be augmented by LCV as determined by [6-3H] incorporation into acid-precipitable material, nor did the addition of LCV result in increased cytotoxicity. Factors other than the inhibition of DNA synthesis may be critical to the cytotoxicity of sequential MTX and FUra in L1210 cells.","['Danhauser, L L', 'Heimer, R', 'Cadman, E']","['Danhauser LL', 'Heimer R', 'Cadman E']",['eng'],"['CA-08341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-27130/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S-T32-CA09085-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Fluorouracil/*toxicity', 'Kinetics', 'Leucovorin/*toxicity', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/*pathology', 'Methotrexate/*toxicity', 'Mice', 'Thymidylate Synthase/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00263888 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1985;15(3):214-9. doi: 10.1007/BF00263888.,,,,,,,,

Normally, hematopoietic marrow yields low signal intensity on phase-contrast images; pathologic conditions affecting hematopoietic marrow typically result in increased signal intensity due to either accumulated lipid or water.

In many of these translocations the breakpoints lie near cellular homologues of transforming genes, suggesting that tumour development is partly due to the activation of these genes. The best-characterized example of such a translocation occurs in mouse plasmacytoma and human B-cell lymphoma, where c-myc, the cellular homologue of the viral oncogene myc, is brought into close proximity with either the light- or heavy-chain genes of the immunoglobulin loci, resulting in a change in the regulation of the myc gene. T-cell malignancies also have characteristic chromosomal abnormalities, many of which seem to involve the 14q11-14q13 region. This region has recently been found to contain the alpha-chain genes of the human T-cell antigen receptor. Here we determine more precisely the chromosome breakpoints in two patients whose leukaemic T cells contain reciprocal translocations between 11p13 and 14q13. Segregation analysis of somatic cell hybrids demonstrates that in both patients the breakpoints occur between the variable (V) and constant (C) region genes of the T-cell receptor alpha-chain locus, resulting in the translocation of the C-region gene from chromosome 14 to chromosome 11. As the 11p13 locus has been implicated in the development of Wilms' tumour, it is possible that either the Wilms' tumour gene or a yet unidentified gene in this region is involved in tumorigenesis and is altered as a result of its translocation into the T-cell receptor alpha-chain locus.","['Lewis, W H', 'Michalopoulos, E E', 'Williams, D L', 'Minden, M D', 'Mak, T W']","['Lewis WH', 'Michalopoulos EE', 'Williams DL', 'Minden MD', 'Mak TW']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosome Mapping', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Oncogenes', 'Plasmacytoma/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1985/10/10 00:00,1985/10/10 00:01,['1985/10/10 00:00'],"['1985/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/317544a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1985 Oct 10-16;317(6037):544-6. doi: 10.1038/317544a0.,,,,,,,,

Direct evidence that PMA temporarily enters and is released from cellular compartment during superinduction protocol.,275-97,"The K-562 cell line was treated with the superinduction protocol involving phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) for production of human interleukin 1 (IL-1). The resultant dialyzed K-562 superinduced supernatants contained potent IL-1-like activity when tested in 4 bioassays for IL-1. However, these K-562 SIS failed to induce fever in rabbits, the IL-1 like activity was not inhibited by an anti-human IL-1 antiserum in the murine thymocyte (LAF) assay, and the IL-1-like activity did not adhere to a specific immunoadsorbent column. Together with recent evidence that PMA may contaminate supernatants produced by the superinduction protocol and can mimic IL-1 bioactivity (9,10), the results of these novel methods suggested that IL-1 was not the bioactive moiety in K-562 SIS. To further examine the source of K-562 SIS IL-1-like activity, the active K-562 SIS were fractionated over Sephadex G-50, and the large molecular weight component (approximately 50,000) was found to express potent LAF activity yet remained nonpyrogenic. 3H-PMA was added to the superinduction protocol as a tracer for PMA migration. The 3H-PMA provided new and direct evidence that PMA adhered to or entered K-562 cells and adhered to plastic culture flasks during the serum free wash steps of the superinduction, and that PMA was released by K-562 cells into the serum containing supernatants during the incubation phase of the protocol. A 3H-PMA component of K-562 SIS co-migrated on gel filtration with the large molecular weight proteins which expressed LAF activity, and is a nondialyzable contaminant of superinduction supernatants. This PMA/protein complex is the main and perhaps the sole mediator of four distinct biological activities ascribed to IL-1.","['Williams, J M', 'Dinarello, C A', 'Rosenwasser, L J', 'Kelley, V', 'Reddish, M', 'Strom, T B']","['Williams JM', 'Dinarello CA', 'Rosenwasser LJ', 'Kelley V', 'Reddish M', 'Strom TB']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Lymphokine Res,Lymphokine research,8308208,"['0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Prostaglandins E)', '0 (Pyrogens)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Compartmentation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dinoprostone', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis/immunology/*physiology', 'Leukemia P388/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/analysis/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Macrophages/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Proteins/administration & dosage/analysis/metabolism', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Prostaglandins E/metabolism', 'Pyrogens/administration & dosage', 'Rabbits', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lymphokine Res. 1985 Fall;4(4):275-97.,,,,,,,,

However, phorbol esters have also recently been found to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation in certain other cell types, and we therefore studied tyrosine kinase activity in normal and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) peripheral blood B lymphocytes stimulated with phorbol ester. High levels of tyrosine labeling were observed in unstimulated cells with major endogenous substrates of 75K, 66K, 43K, and 28K in Triton-soluble material, and of 56K to 61K in Triton-insoluble material; this profile was essentially similar in normal and CLL B cells. Treatment with phorbol ester for time periods varying from 20 min to 48 hr led to qualitative increases in tyrosine labeling of these phosphoproteins, as measured both in vitro and in intact cells ""in vivo."" Although the relative abundance of tyrosine phosphorylation as a percentage of total labeling was variable due to concomitant enhancement of serine and threonine phosphorylation, exogenous peptide substrate assays confirmed the increased tyrosine kinase activity quantitatively. Enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation was succeeded or accompanied in both normal and abnormal B cells by cellular activation, as judged by increased [3H]thymidine uptake, and terminal differentiation of CLL cells. These findings provide further evidence implicating tyrosine kinases in B lymphocyte activation.","['Nel, A E', 'Navailles, M', 'Rosberger, D F', 'Landreth, G E', 'Goldschmidt-Clermont, P J', 'Baldwin, G J', 'Galbraith, R M']","['Nel AE', 'Navailles M', 'Rosberger DF', 'Landreth GE', 'Goldschmidt-Clermont PJ', 'Baldwin GJ', 'Galbraith RM']",['eng'],"['CA-00611/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-27062/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Phorbols)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Solubility', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",1985/11/01 00:00,1985/11/01 00:01,['1985/11/01 00:00'],"['1985/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Nov;135(5):3448-53.,,,,,,,,

CTLL-D4, specific for a unique surface determinant on a radiation-induced leukaemia RL male 1 of BALB/c origin, was obtained from the limiting dilution culture of MLTC cells performed between spleen cells of a CB6F1-nu/+ mouse immunized in vivo and RL male 1 stimulator cells, and cultured for several months in the absence of added TCGF as described in our preceding paper (Kuribayashi, 1985). The specific inhibition of tumour growth by CTLL-D4 was demonstrated both in Winn-type neutralization assay and in systemic transfer experiments. A subcutaneous inoculation of the mixture of CTLL-D4 and RL male 1 cells resulted in the complete inhibition of tumour growth, even at the effector to tumour cell ratio of 1:1, whereas non-cytolytic D4f, which was self-Ia antigen(s)-reactive, composed entirely of Lyt-1+23- T cells and derived originally from CTLL-D4 but completely lost its cytotoxic activity during culture with the irradiated syngeneic feeder cells alone, had no inhibitory effect at all. In the adoptive transfer studies, the subcutaneously established tumours were rejected by the single i.v. transfer of 2 X 10(7) CTLL-D4 cells into CB6F1-nu/nu mice. However, D4f was ineffective again in this systemic transfer system. When the effect of CTLL-D4 cells on tumour rejection in vivo was compared to that of non-cultured spleen cells hyperimmunized with RL male 1 cells, the former exhibited more rapid rejection in nude mice after i.v. transfer than the latter did, suggesting that CTLL-D4 cells also attack the tumour cells much more effectively as effectors in vivo. Thus, it is conceivable that CTLs are mainly involved in tumour rejection in this adoptive transfer system using RL male 1 tumour cells and athymic nude mice.","['Keyaki, A', 'Kuribayashi, K', 'Sakaguchi, S', 'Masuda, T', 'Yamashita, J', 'Handa, H', 'Nakayama, E']","['Keyaki A', 'Kuribayashi K', 'Sakaguchi S', 'Masuda T', 'Yamashita J', 'Handa H', 'Nakayama E']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/classification/*immunology']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1985 Sep;56(1):141-51.,PMC1453675,,,,,,,

Establishment and characterization of an exogenous IL-2-independent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte line specific for radiation-induced leukaemia RL male 1.,127-40,"A CTL line (CTLL-D4) mediating specific cytolytic activity against radiation-induced leukaemia RL male 1 has been established and maintained on a long-term basis without the addition of exogeneous TCGF. This line was originally selected by the limiting dilution of MLTC cells from RL male 1-immune (BALB/c X C57BL/6) F1-nu/+(CB6F1-nu/+) spleen cells (500 cells/well) in the presence of 5% rat TCGF, 2000 rads-irradiated normal CB6F1-nu/+ spleen cells as the feeder cells, and 10,000 rads-irradiated RL male 1 tumour cells as the stimulator. After expansion only with the feeder and tumour cells, CTLL-D4 shows highly specific cytotoxic activity against RL male 1 by in vitro CMC assay, since cells such as RL male 6, RL female 8, RL female 9, P815, MOPC-315 (H-2d), EL-4 (H-2b) and YAC (H-2a) are not killed. Microcytoxicity assay of this line has revealed that CTLL-D4 comprises three subsets of T lymphocytes (100% Thy-1.2+): 15-25% Lyt-1+23-, 60-75% Lyt-1+23+ and 10-15% Lyt-1-23+. The proliferation of this line seems to depend largely upon the syngeneic MLR-like responsiveness of the Lyt-1+23- subsets of CTLL-D4 to the Ia-positive cells in CB6F1-nu/+ splenic feeder cells, and has been restricted to the H-2d-haplotype of the feeder cells. In spite of the vigorous cell proliferation by coculturing with the feeder cells alone, the cytolytic activity of this line begins to decrease after some 7 days of culture in the absence of the stimulator RL male 1 cells which have no capacity to stimulate by themselves. Thus, by long-term culture of CTLL-D4 with the syngeneic feeder cells alone, a new non-cytolytic line (D4f) was established. Mechanisms enabling the long-term maintenance of CTL activity and subset composition have been discussed in terms of cellular cooperation between the subsets of this line.","['Kuribayashi, K', 'Keyaki, A', 'Sakaguchi, S', 'Masuda, T']","['Kuribayashi K', 'Keyaki A', 'Sakaguchi S', 'Masuda T']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', '*Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology', 'Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/classification/cytology/*immunology']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1985 Sep;56(1):127-40.,PMC1453654,,,,,,,

The response of a freshly explanted neoplastic population of phenotypically well-characterized lymphosarcoma cell leukemia blasts was studied after incubation with the differentiating agent TPA (12-0-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate). Terminal differentiation was assessed by measuring the immunoglobulin secreted in culture supernatants and the production of intracytoplasmic immunoglobulins. Activation of the cells was studied using fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies to various antigens in a flow cytometer (fluorescence-activated cell sorter) and 3H-thymidine (3H-Tdr) incorporation was evaluated to measure DNA synthesis in cells grown in complete medium and TPA-supplemented medium. The events induced by TPA were characteristic of B cell maturation and included morphological changes to plasmacytoid cells, reduction in surface immunoglobulins (sIgM, sIgD, and K), enhancement of cytoplasmic immunoglobulin, and amplification of immunoglobulin secretion. Surface antigen changes were accompanied by increased 3H-Tdr incorporation. Cell proliferation and differentiation appeared to be coupled and both were amplified by TPA treatment. These observations indicate that TPA can promote maturation of malignant secretory B cells to a terminal differentiation stage. The significance of these findings to normal B cell differentiation and their potential clinical utility is discussed.","['Efremidis, A P', 'Haubenstock, H', 'Holland, J F', 'Bekesi, J G']","['Efremidis AP', 'Haubenstock H', 'Holland JF', 'Bekesi JG']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Phorbols)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Growth Substances/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulins/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85055-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 Oct;66(4):953-60.,,,,,,,,

The expression of Ki-1 antigen has been analyzed by immunocytochemical techniques in a wide range of human tissue and cell samples, including fetal tissue, malignant lymphomas (290 cases), and mitogen- and virus-transformed peripheral blood lymphocytes. The antigen was detectable on a variable proportion of cells in all cases of lymphomatoid papulosis and angio-immunoblastic lymphadenopathy and in 28% of the cases of peripheral T cell lymphomas (including lympho-epithelioid lymphomas). It was also expressed (more strongly) on tumor cells in 45 cases of diffuse large-cell lymphoma, most of which had originally been diagnosed as malignant histiocytosis or anaplastic carcinoma, because of their bizarre morphology. However, all of these cases lacked macrophage and epithelial antigens. Thirty-five cases expressed T cell-related antigens (associated in nine cases with the coexpression of B cell-related antigens), seven bore B cell-related antigens alone, and three were devoid of T and B cell markers. DNA hybridization with a JH specific probe showed a germline configuration in 11 cases of T cell phenotype, in two cases lacking T and B cell antigens, and in one case of mixed T/B phenotype, while rearrangement was found in two cases of clear B cell type and in one mixed T/B case. Expression of the Ki-1 antigen could be induced, together with interleukin 2 (IL 2) receptor, on normal lymphoid cells of both T and B cell type by exposure to phytohemagglutinin, human T leukemia viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, or Staphylococcus aureus. The results obtained indicate that Ki-1 antigen is an inducible lymphoid-associated molecule that identifies a group of hitherto poorly characterized normal and neoplastic large lymphoid cells. Tumors comprised solely of these cells show both morphological and immunological similarities to the neoplastic cells in Hodgkin's disease. This suggests that both disorders represent the neoplastic proliferation of activated lymphoid cells of either T cell or, less commonly, B cell origin. Disorders in which only a minority of cells express Ki-1 antigen (lymphomatoid papulosis, angio-immunoblastic lymphadenopathy, and certain T cell lymphomas) probably represent lesions in which only some of the abnormal cells have transformed into an ""activation state."" In direct support of this view is the finding that the Ki-1 expression in these lesions is accompanied by the expression of HLA-DR and IL 2 receptors.","['Stein, H', 'Mason, D Y', 'Gerdes, J', ""O'Connor, N"", 'Wainscoat, J', 'Pallesen, G', 'Gatter, K', 'Falini, B', 'Delsol, G', 'Lemke, H']","['Stein H', 'Mason DY', 'Gerdes J', ""O'Connor N"", 'Wainscoat J', 'Pallesen G', 'Gatter K', 'Falini B', 'Delsol G', 'Lemke H', 'et al.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Child', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histiocytes/immunology', 'Hodgkin Disease/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/classification', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mononuclear Phagocyte System/*immunology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85040-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 Oct;66(4):848-58.,,,,,,,,

PBMCs from healthy donors demonstrated an IL 2 synthesis of 12.4 +/- 10 U/mL. B-CLL PBMCs produced a significant amount of IL 2 (8 +/- 6.6 U/mL) despite the low percentage of T cells (13% +/- 8%) associated with this disease compared with that found in healthy donors (63% +/- 7.5%). If IL 2 production is expressed as units per milliliter per 10(4) T cells, its level in patients with B-CLL (1.1 U/mL/10(4) T cells) is five times greater than that of the controls (0.19 units). When expressed as units per milliliter per liter of blood, the B-CLL patients produce approximately 12 times as much IL 2 as controls. IL 2 production in normal controls was doubled after irradiation of PBMCs or addition of indomethacin. This increase was not seen with B-CLL PBMCs suggesting that the latter have been devoid of prostaglandin-producing normal IL 2 suppressor cells. By mixing normal or B-CLL T cells with non-T cells we found that T cells from patients with B-CLL stimulated by normal accessory cells produced the same amount of IL 2 as normal T cells. Moreover, B-CLL non-T cells (mainly B leukemic cells) produced no IL 2 themselves but played a much more efficient role in IL 2 production than did non-T cells from healthy donors. This was not due to detectable IL 1 production by these cells. The IL 2 produced by B-CLL PBMCs was partially purified and recovered in a 16,000 mol wt fraction, the same mol wt as IL 2 from normal cells.","['Rossi, J F', 'Klein, B', 'Commes, T', 'Jourdan, M']","['Rossi JF', 'Klein B', 'Commes T', 'Jourdan M']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85039-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1985 Oct;66(4):840-7.,,,,,,,,

Of the 140 children evaluated, 79.3% expressed the common ALL (cALL) antigen (all analyses performed by MoAb), 11.4% were T-ALL and 9.3% were non-T, non-B, non-common ('null') ALL. The proportion of adult cALL cases was slightly lower (64% of the 50 cases studied) than that of childhood ALL, whilst the incidence of T-ALL was significantly higher in adults than in children (26% v. 11.4%, P less than 0.05). Because of the high proportion of cALL cases, the incidence of 'null' ALL in adult patients was similar (10%) to that of children, and lower than previously reported. The recognition of early pre-T-ALL cases (T1+, RFT2+, T10+, T6-, T11-, E-) contributed to the overall low proportion of 'null' ALL; prior to the use of MoAb, such cases would probably have been classified as undifferentiated acute leukaemia or 'null' ALL. The search for B-cell-related markers showed that the incidence of pre-B-ALL cases (cytoplasmic immunoglobulin positive cases) was similar in adults and in children (25.6% and 32%, respectively). Furthermore, the great majority of cases studied expressed the BA-1 antigen (92.8% of adults and 79% of children), whilst the BA-2 antigen was found in 53% of cases (tested only in children), confirming a hierarchy in the expression of B-cell related markers in cALL: BA-1, BA-2, CyIg. Several of the 'null' cases also expressed the BA-1 antigen on a variable proportion of cells, pointing to a possible B-cell origin of the blasts. This multicentre study shows that both in adult and in childhood ALL the combined use of conventional immunological markers and of a panel of MoAb allows identification of the cell lineage of the great majority of cases, thus reducing the number of 'null' ALL. Furthermore, these findings suggest that practically all cases of ALL belong either to the T or to the B cell compartment and that the neoplastic cells appear blocked at different levels along the lymphoid differentiation pathway.","['Foa, R', 'Baldini, L', 'Cattoretti, G', 'Foa, P', 'Gobbi, M', 'Lauria, F', 'Madon, E', 'Masera, G', 'Miniero, R', 'Paolucci, P']","['Foa R', 'Baldini L', 'Cattoretti G', 'Foa P', 'Gobbi M', 'Lauria F', 'Madon E', 'Masera G', 'Miniero R', 'Paolucci P', 'et al.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/immunology', 'Lymphocytes, Null/immunology', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1985.tb02823.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1985 Oct;61(2):251-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1985.tb02823.x.,,,,,,,,

This suggests the antigen may be a clonal marker.","['Zola, H', 'Moore, H A', 'Hunter, I K', 'Hohmann, A', 'McNamara, P J', 'Bradley, J', 'Muir, P', 'Morley, A', 'Melo, J V', 'Catovsky, D']","['Zola H', 'Moore HA', 'Hunter IK', 'Hohmann A', 'McNamara PJ', 'Bradley J', 'Muir P', 'Morley A', 'Melo JV', 'Catovsky D']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Leukocytes/*immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phenotype', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1399-0039.1985.tb00935.x [doi]'],ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 1985 Jul;26(1):60-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0039.1985.tb00935.x.,,,,,,,,

Compared to B normal, B-CLL lymphocytes had fewer receptors for WGA and more for Lens culinaris, SBA and Tetragonolobus purpureus lectins. Receptors for Concanavalin A, Pisum sativum, PHA and Tetragonolobus purpureus showed a higher affinity with B normal lymphocytes, while the other lectins assayed showed more affinity with B-CLL lymphocytes.

SIRSox inhibits antibody secretion by B lymphocytes and cell division by normal or transformed cell lines. Effects of purified growth factors on suppression of antibody secretion were examined to determine whether any would oppose the inhibitory effects of SIRS or SIRSox. Interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 2 (IL-2), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) each inhibited SIRS-mediated suppression of antibody secretion by cultured mouse spleen cells. Inhibition of SIRS activity was most effective when growth factors were added late in the culture period. IL-1, IL-2, and EGF also blocked suppression by SIRSox. However, EGF and IL-1 blocked suppression by SIRSox only when added 3-6 hr before addition of SIRSox, whereas IL-2 blocked suppression by SIRSox when added before or up to 3 hr after addition of SIRSox. Further evaluation showed that IL-2, but not EGF or IL-1, reversed inhibition of antibody secretion by SIRSox in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. With 50 units of IL-2 per 0.5-ml culture, reversal was complete within 1 hr. The ability of growth factors to interfere with inhibition of cell division by SIRSox was examined with the human B-cell leukemia RPMI-1788. This cell line binds EGF but is not known to have cell surface receptors for IL-1 or IL-2. EGF (0.3-1 ng/ml), when added to RPMI-1788 cultures 4-6 hr before SIRSox, interfered with the ability of SIRSox to inhibit cell division. Taken together, these data indicate that growth factors interfere with both the immunosuppressive and growth inhibitory properties of SIRSox in both heterogeneous and homogeneous cell populations.","['Aune, T M']",['Aune TM'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Suppressor Factors, Immunologic)', '0 (soluble immune response suppressor)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/*drug effects', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Lymphokines/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Oxidation-Reduction', '*Suppressor Factors, Immunologic']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.18.6260 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Sep;82(18):6260-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.18.6260.,PMC391032,,,,,,,

Here we present evidence that the human genome also contains gamma-chain genes that undergo somatic rearrangement in leukaemia-derived T cells. Murine gamma-chain genes appear to be encoded in gene segments that are analogous to the immunoglobulin gene variable, constant and joining segments.

However, during purification, significant IL-1-like activity is also found with apparent molecular weights of greater than 80,000, 50,000, and 35,000 daltons. The active species with the highest apparent molecular weight (greater than 80 kilodaltons) is not a strong comitogen for thymocytes but exhibits relatively strong direct mitogenic activity. By affinity By affinity chromatography, it was shown that the direct mitogen is probably a contaminant distinct from the IL-1. Significant IL-1 activity is also recovered at approximately 50,000 daltons, but upon rechromatography it dissociates, suggesting that it is an aggregate. In contrast, the species eluting at 35,000 daltons and 15,000 daltons are stable upon rechromatography even in 6 M urea. Upon isoelectric focusing, the 15,000 and the 35,000 dalton species show similar patterns, with a prominent peak of IL-1 activity near neutrality and multiple peaks in the range of pI 4.5-5.8. Therefore, it appears that human monocytes secrete at least four biochemically distinct and noninterconvertible proteins, all of which stimulate the proliferation of murine thymocytes in the presence of PHA. Although the IL-1 preparations described above were prepared by pooling IL-1-rich supernatants from 12 donors, the heterogeneity is not due to genetic diversity.

Measurement of anti-thrombin III, plasminogen, factor V, and fibrin degradation products as well as platelet aggregation sensitivity to adenosine diphosphate disclosed no consistent abnormalities that would explain pathologic thrombus formation. A decrease in platelet counts observed in nine of 11 patients, prompted us to investigate the possible involvement of factor VIII in this disorder. Levels of factor VIII procoagulant activity, von Willebrand factor (vWF) and ristocetin cofactor were similar to findings for an identically treated comparison group who remained free of thrombotic complications. However, qualitative examination of vWF by crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) revealed a distinct right shift of the immunoprecipitin lines in each of three thrombotic patients tested, whereas a normal profile was found in three similarly treated patients without the complication. This altered pattern had reverted to normal when CIE was repeated 2 to 7 months later.

Analysis of the correlations to the T cell antigen-receptor complex.,823-38,"Prior studies indicate that the 9.3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) which defines a 44 kD T lineage-specific glycoprotein (T44) enhances the proliferative response of peripheral blood T lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or allogeneic cells. The T44 molecule was expressed in both resting and activated T lymphocytes and in a subset of thymocytes, as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytofluorometry. In view of the potential importance of T44 in T cell activation, we investigated the ability of the 9.3 (anti-T44) antibody to stimulate peripheral blood T lymphocytes under culture conditions giving optimal proliferative responses to anti-T3 mAb. Like UCHT1 (anti-T3) mAb, the 9.3 (anti-T44 mAb) promoted strong proliferative responses of purified T cells, provided that adherent cells were added to the culture. Maximal proliferation in response to 9.3 antibody was consistently detected at day 5 (at day 3 with anti-T3 or PHA). Moreover, triggering of T lymphocytes with 9.3 antibody (in the presence of adherent cells) resulted in strong IL-2 production that peaked at 48 h. Analysis of the physical and functional relationship between the T44 molecule and other molecules involved in T cell activation, including the clonotypically restricted Ti and the monomorphic T3 or T11 molecules, was carried out on a mutagenized jurkat T leukemia cell line. This mutant, termed JA3 (surface phenotype: T11+, T3+, 3A1+, T4-, T8-, DR-, Tac-, 4F2+, T44+) produced large amounts of IL-2 upon stimulation with PHA, anti-T3, or anticlonotypic mAb in conjunction with phorbol myristate acetate (or adherent cells). The molecules precipitated by anti-T44 mAb from 125I-labeled JA3 cells appeared as a diffuse band of Mr 40-45,000 under reducing conditions; under nonreducing conditions, a prominent band of Mr 80-85,000 was observed, while the Mr 40-45,000 band was greatly reduced. Thus, T44 molecules in both reducing and nonreducing conditions had relative molecular weights similar to that of molecules carrying clonotypic (Ti) determinants. In addition, like anti-Ti or anti-T3 mAb, anti-T44 antibody induced JA3 cells to produce large amounts of IL-2 in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate. Other similarities between T44 and molecules carrying clonotypic structures included the susceptibility to antibody-induced modulation and the late reexpression (72 h) at the cell surface after modulation. Taken together, these experiments suggest that anti-T44 mAb might recognize a monomorphic determinant of the T cell receptor molecule or be physically or functionally linked to the T3-Ti complex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Moretta, A', 'Pantaleo, G', 'Lopez-Botet, M', 'Moretta, L']","['Moretta A', 'Pantaleo G', 'Lopez-Botet M', 'Moretta L']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', '*Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.162.3.823 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1985 Sep 1;162(3):823-38. doi: 10.1084/jem.162.3.823.,PMC2187795,,,,,,,

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of TL from thymocytes of all TL+ mouse strains, precipitated by anti-TL antiserum or monoclonal antibodies, showed two closely migrating bands of equal intensity in the heavy (H) chain position (45-50,000 mol wt). Comparison of these two bands by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing (2D IEF)-SDS-PAGE and 2D chymotryptic peptide mapping showed no differences indicative of protein dissimilarity. Thus, the two components of the H chain doublet may differ only in a feature of glycosylation that does not affect charge. The two leukemias studied gave only a single band in the H chain position. On 2D peptide mapping and 2D IEF-SDS-PAGE, the patterns for TL of Tlaa and Tlae thymocytes, which are closely related serologically, were broadly similar, but clearly different from the pattern typical of Tlac and Tlad thymocytes. 2D peptide maps of TL from Tlaa thymocytes and Tlaa leukemia cells did not differ. Leukemia cells of Tlab origin (thymocytes TL-) gave 2D peptide and 2D IEF-SDS-PAGE patterns of a third type. With the exception of Tlaa, thymocytes of TL+ mice yielded additional TL products of higher molecular weight than the TL H chain.","['Chorney, M J', 'Tung, J S', 'Bushkin, Y', 'Shen, F W']","['Chorney MJ', 'Tung JS', 'Bushkin Y', 'Shen FW']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)', 'EC 3.4.21.1 (Chymotrypsin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis/immunology', 'Chymotrypsin', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Male', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/immunology', 'Peptides/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1985/09/01 00:00,1985/09/01 00:01,['1985/09/01 00:00'],"['1985/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.162.3.781 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1985 Sep 1;162(3):781-9. doi: 10.1084/jem.162.3.781.,PMC2187819,,,,,,,

The rate of the fluorescence increase and the lag time before the response were dependent on the doses of the cytotoxin. Addition of MnCl2 to the cytotoxin-treated cells induced a decrease in the quin2 fluorescence at rates dependent on the doses of the cytotoxin. The cytotoxin did not stimulate the inositol lipid turnover in JURKAT cells, which was determined by the accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates in myo-[2-3H]inositol-prelabeled cells in the presence of LiCl.

Addition of conditioned media rich in T-cell growth factor (TCGF) activity to cultures of infected birds resulted in a reconstitution of the suppressed mitogenic responsiveness up to the level found in lymphocyte cultures from normal chickens. This indicates that the defect of the observed immunopathology is not at the level of responding T-cells. Measurements of TCGF production always showed reduced TCGF levels in the suppressed cultures suggesting that there is a defect at the TCGF production level.

Growth characteristics and leukemogenesis in vivo were determined for parental and methotrexate-resistant L1210 cell variants with reduced capacity for folate coenzyme transport inward. These variants exhibited 6-, 16-, and 100-fold reductions compared to parental cells in influx Vmax for the high-affinity system transporting 5-substituted reduced folates and methotrexate. They also exhibited reduced saturability for methotrexate influx (3-fold higher Km), but not for influx of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. The reduced influx capacity in these variants correlated with their increased requirement for reduced folates during growth in vitro and with the ability of the variants to proliferate and develop leukemia in vivo. Lack of growth potential in vivo for one variant appears to reflect the inability for net intracellular accumulation of reduced folate per se, since growth of this variant could be restored by treatment of mice with folic acid, but not with 5-methyltetrahydrofolate or 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, and following reversion to a more transport-proficient phenotype.","['Sirotnak, F M', 'Goutas, L J', 'Mines, L S']","['Sirotnak FM', 'Goutas LJ', 'Mines LS']",['eng'],"['CA 08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 22764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism', 'Leucovorin/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Methotrexate/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation']",1985/10/01 00:00,1985/10/01 00:01,['1985/10/01 00:00'],"['1985/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Oct;45(10):4732-4.,,,,,,,,

Other immunological abnormalities, such as lineage infidelity or maturation asynchrony, are more likely explanations. Moreover, immunological heterogeneity is pronounced among human tumor cells. For these reasons, antibody independent tumor surveillance is receiving increased attention. It is mediated by cytotoxic macrophages, NK-cells and the so called NK-like, pre-induced cytotoxic T-cells. NK-cells, probably a T-cell subpopulation sharing a marker with macrophages, have a cytotoxic effect mainly on certain cell-lines, but hardly on viable human tumor cells. In contrast, different degrees of pre-stimulation with allogeneic lymphocytes, lectins or interleukin 2 can induce, in human T-cells, both HLA-restricted and non-restricted cytotoxicity against viable human tumor cells.

Twelve of the patients had undergone splenectomy, three had no palpable spleen and had therefore not been offered surgery, and two patients with substantial splenomegaly were given interferon (IFN) as treatment of first choice. Toxic effects were minor except in one patient who experienced a severe form of somnolence syndrome. In all patients hairy cells (HCs) were cleared from the blood and platelet and Hb levels improved in 2-14 weeks. Neutrophils were improved in 14/17 of the patients. In the two patients with splenomegaly, the spleen became impalpable after 5-8 weeks therapy, and haematological improvement occurred at 12-14 weeks. HC infiltration of the marrow was reduced in all patients, but was complete (less than 5%) in only two, both of whom had impalpable spleens. Immunological surface-marker studies confirmed that light-chain-restricted B cells disappeared from the blood in parallel with the clearance of morphological HCs. There was no evidence of HC maturation and no increase in phenotypic NK cells. T cells were moderately reduced and the relatively greater reduction of Leu 2a+ suppressor cells resulted in increased Leu 3a+/2a+ helper/suppressor ratios in 11/17 of the patients. Early experience in the six patients who have stopped IFN suggests that, after an initial further increase in Hb and neutrophil levels, HCs gradually return with slow deterioration of haematological parameters. Interferon is now the treatment of choice for patients becoming cytopenic post-splenectomy or for patients without splenomegaly. IFN is effective first-line therapy in patients with splenomegaly, but further work is needed to establish whether the agent should replace splenectomy in such patients. Some form of maintenance or re-treatment therapy will probably be necessary.","['Worman, C P', 'Catovsky, D', 'Bevan, P C', 'Camba, L', 'Joyner, M', 'Green, P J', 'Williams, H J', 'Bottomley, J M', 'Gordon-Smith, E C', 'Cawley, J C']","['Worman CP', 'Catovsky D', 'Bevan PC', 'Camba L', 'Joyner M', 'Green PJ', 'Williams HJ', 'Bottomley JM', 'Gordon-Smith EC', 'Cawley JC']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Interferon Type I)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Splenectomy', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1985.tb07480.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1985 Aug;60(4):759-63. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1985.tb07480.x.,,,,,,,,

The sensitivity limit of the assay is 0.1 ng/ml of purified E-receptor antigen. Using this assay, one can show that the T-cell mitogen phytohaemagglutinin stimulated both lymphocytes and cells of the resting human T-cell lymphoma cell line Jurkat to shed or secrete E-receptor into the culture medium. Results of the radioimmunoassay performed on human sera indicated that some patients with Hodgkin's disease, melanoma, sarcoma, or acute or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia had elevated levels of this antigen in their serum, whereas normal human sera registered lower levels. Elevated levels of the soluble form of E-receptor in the serum were suggestive of an in vitro assessment of their immunosuppressive activity.

The mechanism by which it exerts its effects on hematopoiesis is unknown. In this report, we describe the ability of horse ATG to induce growth and differentiation of normal bone marrow. A single cell suspension of normal human bone marrow was cultured in methylcellulose medium and examined for the growth and maturation after incubation with ATG (10 micrograms/ml). After 3-4 days of culture, spherical colonies containing mature myeloid elements were found in cultures containing ATG but not in cultures containing medium or preimmunization horse IgG. The addition of 10% colony-stimulating factor increased growth by 40%. The number of spherical colonies is not dependent on the presence of macrophages or T lymphocytes. This property of ATG may be relevant to the mechanism behind the hematologic recovery in some patients with acquired aplastic anemia. We also describe the ability of ATG to induce terminal differentiation in the HL60 leukemic cell line. ATG binds to HL60 cells and at concentrations between 10 and 100 micrograms/ml, 50% of the cells become mature granulocytes, acquire the ability to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium, and lose their proliferative capacity in the clonogenic assay. These new observations of ATG-induced differentiation of normal marrow myeloid elements and terminal differentiation of the HL60 cell line point to different avenues for future search of differentiation-inducing agents.","['Hunter, R F', 'Mold, N G', 'Mitchell, R B', 'Huang, A T']","['Hunter RF', 'Mold NG', 'Mitchell RB', 'Huang AT']",['eng'],['CA 09307-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)'],IM,"['Antilymphocyte Serum/*physiology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.82.14.4823 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Jul;82(14):4823-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.14.4823.,PMC390997,,,,,,,

It stained predominantly the early hematopoietic cells of the lymphoid lineage and also thymocytes, peripheral B-cells and activated T- and B-cells similarly to OKT10. The heavy chain of this antigen was a glycoprotein of Mr 43,000 (p43). Sequential immunoprecipitation with C21 and OKT10 antibodies indicated that they both reacted with an identical heavy-chain molecule. This observation was further documented by two-dimensional analysis. Monoclonal antibody C21 was used to probe a p43,12 complex further. Structural polymorphism of the p43 heavy chain isolated from T- and B-cells of different individuals was not detected by chymotryptic peptide mapping, although molecules from these cell types possessed a different charge on two-dimensional gels. An unusual observation was made regarding this complex on MOLT4 cells. The light chain co-precipitated from these cells was 12,000 daltons and had a pI distinct from that of beta 2-microglobulin but similar to the pI of the beta t molecule. Comparison between chymotryptic peptide maps of the p43 heavy chain and those of the human and murine class I molecules such as HLA, T6, H-2K, Qa-2 and TL revealed no apparent homology. We have shown, however, that the peptide backbone of p43, as studied by both tunicamycin treatment of cells and endoglycosidase F digestion of immunoprecipitates, was identical in size to that of murine Qa-1.

Dose response analyses of the relationship between exogenous differentiation stimulus (supplied by peripheral blood mononuclear leucocytes) and clone cell maturity in double layer semi-solid agar cultures, were used to identify a measure of response with a linear relationship to differentiation stimulus on which bioassay systems could be based. All 7 AML samples tested at presentation and 1 sample from a patient during the regenerative phase after therapy, exhibited some response to exogenous differentiation stimulus. Only in the latter was there no significant difference in the response of test and reference cells. The other 7 showed marked variation in the pattern of the response in vitro. There was no close correlation between differentiation capacity in vitro and extent of differentiation observed in vivo. This discrepancy might be related to varying availability of endogenous differentiation stimulus in different patients. The technique for assaying differentiation response was adapted to demonstrate and quantify the endogenous differentiation stimulus (the stimulus provided by the leukaemic patient's marrow cells).

Parathyroid hormone and prostaglandins were not detectable in the supernatant fluids of the leukemic cell cultures. In one patient, BRSA was measured twice and found to be decreased to a normal level when the patient was in hematological remission with a normal calcium level (8.3 mg/dl).

Reversal of growth inhibition by addition of cytidine.,429-34,"High levels of deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine in patients with inherited deficiency of either adenosine deaminase or purine-nucleoside phosphorylase, respectively, are considered to be responsible for the associated immunological disorder. The mechanism involves phosphorylation to the corresponding deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates which subsequently inhibit the CDP-reducing activity of ribonucleotide reductase. Addition of deoxycytidine protects cells from the cytotoxic effects of deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine by competition for phosphorylation and by replenishing dCTP, the apparent limiting DNA precursor. Addition of cytidine, but not uridine, led to a reversal of deoxyguanosine and thymidine growth inhibition, comparable to that obtained with deoxycytidine. Analysis of the intracellular nucleotide pools showed that increased levels of cytidine ribonucleotides were sufficient to overcome the inhibitory effects of dGTP and dTTP on CDP reduction, thereby circumventing a depletion of the dCTP pool. A partial reversal of deoxyadenosine toxicity was also obtained with addition of cytidine. In this case little change in the dCTP level was observed, but a decreased dGTP pool appeared to be correlated with growth inhibition. High cytidine ribonucleotide levels partially prevented this effect. The present results may encourage the use of cytidine in combination with deoxycytidine as a pharmacological regime in treatment of immunodeficiency disease associated with increased deoxyribonucleotide levels.","['Dahbo, Y', 'Eriksson, S']","['Dahbo Y', 'Eriksson S']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleosides)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytidine/*pharmacology', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine/pharmacology', 'Deoxyguanosine/pharmacology', 'Deoxyribonucleosides/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Thymidine/pharmacology']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1985.tb09038.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1985 Aug 1;150(3):429-34. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1985.tb09038.x.,,,,,,,,

The neoplasms from individual rats all expressed the antigenic phenotype MP+, W3/13+, Thy-1+, RT-1+, RT-7+, W3/25-. However, approximately two-thirds of the neoplasms were positive for the OX 8 antigen, and one-third were negative. The OX 8- neoplasms only involved the thymus, whereas approximately 40% of the OX 8+ neoplasms involved the spleen as well as the thymus. Virtually all OX 8+ and OX 8- neoplastic cells contained terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), and both OX 8+ and OX 8- lymphomas expressed the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-5' isozyme and the primary, but not the secondary, ADA isozyme. This enzymatic phenotype is characteristic of thymocyte precursors, but not thymocytes. Our results therefore indicate that RAGV-induced lymphomas arise from transformed prethymic TdT+ cells which contain the LDH-5' and the primary ADA isozymes. These preleukemic cells presumably migrate to the thymus where they express the RT-7 pan-T-cell antigen and, in some instances, the OX 8 antigen during the development of overt leukemia. The OX 8+ neoplasms, being more differentiated than their OX 8- counterparts, then migrate to peripheral lymphoid tissues.","['Barton, R W', 'Greiner, D L', 'Medlock, E S', 'Goldschneider, I']","['Barton RW', 'Greiner DL', 'Medlock ES', 'Goldschneider I']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/*pathogenicity', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cytoplasm/immunology', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/metabolism', 'Female', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/analysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Thymus Neoplasms/enzymology/immunology/*pathology']",1985/08/01 00:00,1985/08/01 00:01,['1985/08/01 00:00'],"['1985/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(85)90089-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(85)90089-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1985 Aug;94(1):113-21. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(85)90089-9.,,,,,,,,

Useful features of the 19F NMR indicators include direct identification of the intracellular cation bound to the indicators, internal calibration of [Ca]i and pHi from the spectra, and simultaneous measurements of two or more indicators in the same cell suspension. Perturbations of cellular functions by 5FBAPTA and quin 2 are very similar, but vary widely in different cell systems. The [Ca]i and pHi responses of normal and transformed cells to mitogens and growth factors in serum are compared with data from similar experiments using fluorescence indicators. The only major discrepancy in [Ca]i measurements using the two independent assays was observed in Ehrlich ascites tumour cells. These cells have a high intracellular Zn2+ content which substantially quenches the quin 2 fluorescence, but does not affect [Ca]i measurements by 5FBAPTA. The Zn2+ present in the cells is detected as a separate response in the 5FBAPTA spectrum. The time course of the Ca signal in 2H3 cells stimulated by antigen to release histamine by exocytosis has been defined using 5FBAPTA and quin 2. Extension of the 19F NMR technique to [Ca] i and pHi measurements in perfused organs is illustrated in rat heart and responses to pharmacological agents are demonstrated.

Besides four basic groups (Group 1: CLL without therapy; Group 2: CLL on therapy, without remission; Group 3: CLL on therapy, partial remission; Group 4: CLL on therapy, complete remission) patients were further classified into phase (type) A (stable, indolent CLL) or phase (type) B (active, progressive CLL). The major criteria for phase A were: total tumor mass (TTM) doubling time (DT) longer than 12 months, no MF, and/or good response to therapy. The major criteria for phase B were: TTM DT less than 12 months and/or accompanying MF and/or no response to therapy. The following major findings have been demonstrated: (1) altered quantitative relationship between active and nonactive parts of T-cell compartment (E/A ratio) in the progressive phase of CLL; (2) altered B/T gamma ratio in the progressive phase of CLL; (3) more than 50% increased percentage of T gamma cells in the stable phase of CLL; (4) very low stable and absent seeding efficiency of T-cells in the progressive phase of CLL; (5) altered (delayed) DNA synthesis pattern in the progressive phase of CLL; and (6) negative local xenogeneic graft versus host reaction in the progressive phase of CLL.

In one patient, the progenitor cells involved by the leukemia exhibited multipotent differentiative expression, whereas in the other patient the cells showed differentiative expression restricted to the granulocytic pathway. In the patient whose abnormal clone showed multipotent expression, the ratio of B-A G6PD in B lymphoid cell lines was skewed in the direction of type B (the enzyme characteristic of the leukemia clone) and significantly different from the 1:1 ratio expected. It is, therefore, likely that the neoplastic event occurred in a stem cell common to the lymphoid series as well as to the myeloid series. In contrast, evidence for B cell involvement was not detected in the patient whose ANLL progenitor cells exhibited restricted differentiative expression. These findings underscore the heterogeneity of ANLL. Clinically and morphologically similar malignancies in these two patients originated in progenitors with different patterns of stem cell differentiative expression.

In both the common and the null groups overall and disease-free survival was superior in the children. In contrast, no difference was evident in the T-ALL group, which was also notable for its high incidence in young coloured males.

However a preliminary analysis of patients in the 1980-1982 period showed an increase. Mortality rates are decreasing since 1973, as expected. Incidence rates and proportions of different morphological and immunological subtypes reflect the pattern of occurrence in populations with a high standard of living. A relatively high incidence rate of acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) is observed with a peak at the age of 3-5. The proportion of patients with T-cell phenotype among ALL-patients, immunologically typed between 1979 and 1982, appeared to increase with age, while the proportion of common ALL decreased. Statistical analysis of the data of patients with ALL in the Western part of the country including areas with nuclear plants, gave no indication for the presence of clustering. Subclassification of childhood leukaemia (CL), notably ALL, may be necessary for obtaining more specific etiologic clues.

The tetracyclines impair mitochondrial protein synthesis if they have access to cells. Inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis during a number of cell cycles results, as a consequence, in proliferation arrest. The tetracyclines can therefore be considered as cytostatics. In the present study the effect of prolonged treatment with doxycycline on the growth of a T-cell type leukaemia of the rat was investigated. It is shown that doxycycline treatment inhibits not only tumour cell proliferation, but leads moreover to complete tumour eradication. The way by which the latter is achieved depends on the doxycycline concentration and, surprisingly, on the stage of tumour progression at which doxycycline administration is started. As, because of the permeability barrier, the proliferation of erythroid and B-lymphoid cells is not affected by the tetracyclines, the tetracyclines may provide a tool without serious side-effects in the therapy of T-type tumours.","['van den Bogert, C', 'Dontje, B H', 'Kroon, A M']","['van den Bogert C', 'Dontje BH', 'Kroon AM']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,['N12000U13O (Doxycycline)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division', 'Doxycycline/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Rats', '*T-Lymphocytes']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(85)90142-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(85)90142-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1985;9(5):617-23. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(85)90142-0.,,,,,,,,

Acid phosphatase.,537-48,"This report describes the qualitative acid phosphatase (acP) isoenzyme profiles detected in permanent human hematopoietic cell lines. The acP activity was separated into its isoenzymes by isoelectric focusing on horizontal thin-layer polyacrylamide gels. The pattern of acP isoenzyme was investigated in a total of 86 cell lines. These cell lines were classified into five groups on the basis of their phenotypes characterized in the multiple marker analysis: 74 leukemia-lymphoma cell lines (26 T-, 34 B-, 6 myelomonocytic, 8 Non-T, Non-B cell lines) and 12 so-called 'normal' Epstein-Barr virus transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. Their immunological features had been analysed in detail by use of a large panel of poly- and monoclonal antibodies which led to a further subclassification into stages of differentiation. A progressive increase in number and staining intensity of the isoenzymes which paralleled the expression of surface markers at different stages of differentiation along their developmental pathway was seen in the T- and B-leukemia-lymphoma cell lines. Some cell lines whose isoenzyme profiles did not correspond to the stage of differentiation as evidenced by surface antigen analysis might represent good examples of deranged gene expression in otherwise normally programmed malignant cells, i.e. in our study a mismatch between the isoenzymatic and immunological phenotypes. The tartrate-resistant isoenzyme was detected in 9 out of 74 leukemia-lymphoma cell lines (4 T-, 2 B-, 1 myelomonocytic, 2 Non-T, Non-B cell lines) and in 10 out of 12 normal B-lymphoblastoid cell lines; the only one studied hairy cell leukemia cell line did not express this isoenzyme. The relative specificity of the tartrate-resistant acP is discussed in detail. No leukemia-lymphoma specific isoenzyme or an additional isoenzyme which was not seen in normal hematopoietic cells could be observed. Nor did we find an isoenzyme or isoenzyme pattern characteristic for a certain cell lineage. This underlines the necessity of a combined analysis using markers from different disciplines in the 'multiple marker analysis' in order to accurately characterize normal and malignant blood cells. Furthermore, our results support the concept of maturation arrest at particular stages of differentiation together with the theory of normal gene expression in leukemic cells equivalent to that in their normal counterparts.","['Drexler, H G', 'Gaedicke, G', 'Minowada, J']","['Drexler HG', 'Gaedicke G', 'Minowada J']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Tartrates)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'W4888I119H (tartaric acid)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology', 'Lymphoma/*enzymology/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tartrates/pharmacology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(85)90133-X [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(85)90133-x [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1985;9(5):537-48. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(85)90133-x.,,,,,,,,

Four cases had absent or low Leu-1 positivity (V1: E-RFC+, Leu-1-, 2a-, 3a+, MASO36c-), while two other cases with low Leu-1 positivity had both Leu-2a and 3a, a characteristic of cortical thymocytes, but were unreactive with MASO36c (V2: E-RFC+, Leu-1-, 2a+, 3a+, MASO36c-).

Five of 10 CTCL patients, compared with zero of six CLL patients, developed antibodies to mIgG.

To determine whether OP might be a useful anticancer agent with specific T cell toxicity, OP's effect on cell growth was determined on colony-forming cells. The assay used supported growth of both malignant lymphoid and normal myeloid colony-forming cells (CFU-C) and thus a direct comparison of OP's antilymphoid and antimyeloid toxicity was obtained. The malignant lymphoid cells tested were established from patients at relapse and were resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic agents in vitro. While OP was found to be toxic to all cells tested, some selective kill of malignant cells over CFU-C occurred. OP's cytotoxicity was time-dependent and a three-log enhanced kill occurred when the drug exposure time was increased from 1 to 24 h. When test cells were continously exposed to OP, the ID50 was less than 1 micrograms/ml for malignant lymphoid cells and the sensitivity index (SI = x ID50 CFU-C divided by x ID50 cell line) ranged from 1.5 to 3.0. The National Cancer Institute currently screens new compounds for antitumor activity by determining whether the test drug is toxic to a mouse lymphocytic leukemia cell line (P388). While the mouse P388 cells were sensitive to OP in vitro, no effect was seen when OP was administered in vivo, even when schedules designed to take advantage of OP's time-dependent toxicity were used. Since malignant cells were sensitive to OP (ID50 less than 1 micrograms/ml), and some selectivity over CFU-C occurred (SI greater than 1), OP may be a useful agent for control of leukemic cell growth in vitro. However, since OP did not control the growth of P388 cells in vivo, additional studies designed to enhance the therapeutic index of OP in vivo are needed.","['Cohen, P S', 'Smith, S D']","['Cohen PS', 'Smith SD']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Phenanthrolines)', '14708-99-7 (ferroin)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Magnesium/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phenanthrolines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Zinc/metabolism']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00257285 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1985;15(1):6-10. doi: 10.1007/BF00257285.,,,,,,,,

Adenosine deaminase deficiency with subsequent lympholysis can be simulated in vitro by treatment of lymphoid cells with deoxyadenosine plus deoxycoformycin. We found that such in vitro treatment caused fragmentation of the nucleus, disintegration of nuclear chromatin, and the formation of cytoplasmic blebs in T-lymphoblast lines, but not in B-lymphoblast lines. For all but one of the cell lines tested, the extent of morphological changes paralleled the sensitivity to growth inhibition by deoxyadenosine plus deoxycoformycin. Similar morphological changes were observed in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes treated with deoxyadenosine plus deoxycoformycin. These morphological changes were energy-dependent processes. They were preceded by inhibition of DNA synthesis and deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) accumulation, but followed by depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and cell lysis. These changes may represent an intermediate step between metabolic alterations and lympholysis.","['Matsumoto, S S', 'Yu, A L', 'Yu, J']","['Matsumoto SS', 'Yu AL', 'Yu J']",['eng'],"['CA 27740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 21845/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Coformycin/analogs & derivatives/*toxicity', 'Deoxyadenosines/*toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Pentostatin', 'Ribonucleosides/*toxicity', 'Time Factors']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/07357908509039783 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Invest. 1985;3(3):225-33. doi: 10.3109/07357908509039783.,,,,,,,,

In four of the cases, significant percentages of the CLL cells expressed IL 2 membrane receptors (as assessed with the monoclonal antibody anti-Tac), indicative of their potential sensitivity to IL 2.

Twenty-five to fifty units of r-IL 2 per milliliter of culture medium provided optimal stimulation.

E- cells were further depleted by complement-mediated cytotoxicity with OKT3 monoclonal antibody (E-OKT3- cells). The study of their spontaneous T-cell colony-forming ability suggested that proliferation of T-CFC in the absence of added growth factors requires cellular cooperation because: (1) No colony growth was observed at low cell concentrations (up to 2 X 10(4) cells/ml) whereas at higher cell densities the number of colonies increased exponentially; (2) The plating efficiency from unfractionated MNC was higher than that from E-OKT3- or E+ cells. Irradiated autologous E+ cells enhanced the plating efficiency from blast-enriched cell fractions (E-OKT3-) when co-cultured either directly in methylcellulose or separately in a two layer assay (agar-methylcellulose), suggesting that their activity could be due to diffusible factors; (3) Adherent-cell depletion of MNC decreased colony formation. Autologous irradiated adherent cells were able to restore the plating efficiency from MNCA- cells when co-cultured directly in methylcellulose but not in separate layers; however, media conditioned by patients' A+ cells could enhance the colony growth from patients' MNCA- cells, indicating that their activity could also be mediated by constitutively released soluble factors.","['Georgoulias, V', 'Jasmin, C']","['Georgoulias V', 'Jasmin C']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (colony promoting activity)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Adhesion', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Organic Chemicals', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(85)90057-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(85)90057-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1985;9(3):357-67. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(85)90057-8.,,,,,,,,

Idiotypic immunoglobulin was isolated from mouse X human tumor-cell hybridomas or from patients' serum and was used to immunize mice for the development of murine anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies. Each patient's anti-idiotype antibodies demonstrated reactivity restricted to the immunizing immunoglobulin, thereby limiting their therapeutic utility to a single individual. In addition, we isolated isotype switch variants of hybridomas producing monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody. The restricted specificity of these antibodies was found to be of value for the analysis of the extent of malignant B cell infiltration in a variety of tissues from several patients. Large populations of idiotype-bearing cells were detectable in biopsy specimens from patients K.T. and L.H. In contrast, although bone marrow specimens from patient G.D. were apparently devoid of morphologically abnormal cells, a small, highly fluorescent population of cells was demonstrable underscoring the potential utility of these antibodies for posttreatment evaluation as well as for therapy. In a fourth patient, H.M., anti-idiotype antibodies developed against the circulating macroglobulin isolated from his plasma failed to react with either his circulating or bone marrow hairy cell leukemia cells. However, examination of an enlarged inguinal lymph node revealed the presence of a large number of idiotype-bearing cells. Thus, the presence of two distinct malignant B cell clones were discovered in this individual through the use of anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies. Anti-idiotype antibodies, therefore, represent a highly specific tool for the evaluation and potential therapy of B cell malignancies in individual patients.","['Giardina, S L', 'Schroff, R W', 'Kipps, T J', 'Woodhouse, C S', 'Abrams, P G', 'Rager, H C', 'Morgan, A C Jr', 'Foon, K A']","['Giardina SL', 'Schroff RW', 'Kipps TJ', 'Woodhouse CS', 'Abrams PG', 'Rager HC', 'Morgan AC Jr', 'Foon KA']",['eng'],"['GM17367/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-23910/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Allotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Antibody Specificity', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Allotypes/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin G/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C']",1985/07/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Jul;135(1):653-8.,,,,,,,,

In addition, the rate of processing of pulse-labeled Ii has been determined relative to its rate of dissociation from the alpha/beta complex of I-Ak. Ii, alpha-, and beta-chains were immunoprecipitated with anti-I-Ak or anti-Ii monoclonal antibodies. The heretofore uncharacterized complex oligosaccharide form of Ii (Ii-c) was identified in gel-purified immunoprecipitates by peptide mapping with reverse-phase HPLC. Ii-c is resistant to deglycosylation by Endo H, which is specific for high-mannose N-linkages, but can be digested with Endo F, a glycosidase capable of cleaving both complex and high-mannose N-linked oligosaccharides. Immunoprecipitation of surface iodinated cells indicates that Ii-c is expressed on the plasma membrane. Pulse-chase metabolic labeling data show that the processing of Ii to Ii-c occurs with a t1/2 of about 120 min. In contrast, the processing of both alpha- and beta-chains of I-Ak to complex forms occurs with a t1/2 of 15 to 20 min. Our data show that Ii-hm begins to dissociate rapidly from the I-Ak complex after 100 to 120 min of chase. Only a small amount (less than 5% on a per mole basis) of Ii-c was found associated with the I-Ak complexes after 300 min of continuous metabolic labeling. These results are consistent with Ii serving as a carrier for Ia antigens as they are transported to the cell surface. In addition, they suggest that the processing of Ii to Ii-c, or a late processing event of the alpha- and beta-chains, such as their sialylation, may be a possible mechanism for inducing the dissociation of Ii from the I-Ak complex.","['Holt, G D', 'Swiedler, S J', 'Freed, J H', 'Hart, G W']","['Holt GD', 'Swiedler SJ', 'Freed JH', 'Hart GW']",['eng'],"['CA-36700/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-07445/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-13563/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', '*Genetic Variation', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Oligosaccharides/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Trypsin']",1985/07/01 00:00,1985/07/01 00:01,['1985/07/01 00:00'],"['1985/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Jul;135(1):399-407.,,,,,,,,

The survival of strain LY-R was markedly enhanced by the reduction in dose rate. The dose-rate dependence of the survival of strain LY-S was less clear, because of the biphasic nature of its survival curve following low dose-rate radiation. However, if the initial slope of the low dose-rate survival curve is compared to the slope of the high dose-rate survival curve for strain LY-S, only a slight increase in survival at the low dose rate is apparent.

The weak interaction of L-LSGP with lentil lectin, concanavalin A (Con A) and leucoagglutinin (La), its unchanged mobility in SDS-PAGE after tunicamycin treatment and its high amount of hydroxy amino acids suggest that most carbohydrate chains are O-glycosidically linked to the peptide chain. Native as well as Nase-treated L-LSGP show size microheterogeneity. This is probably due to small chemical differences in the L-LSGP molecules from different lymphocyte subsets.","['Axelsson, B', 'Hammarstrom, S', 'Finne, J', 'Perlmann, P']","['Axelsson B', 'Hammarstrom S', 'Finne J', 'Perlmann P']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Monosaccharides)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Lectins', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monosaccharides/analysis', 'Neuraminidase', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*blood', 'T-Lymphocytes/*analysis', 'Trypsin', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830150503 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1985 May;15(5):427-33. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830150503.,,,,,,,,

The identification of the T-cell nature of their ALL-cells was based on the positivity of their blasts with 3A1 monoclonal antibody which recognizes immature and mature T-cells. Four tested cases showed a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) positivity, and four out of five were acid phosphatase (AcP)-positive. Cells from all cases were characterized with a panel of 15 monoclonal antibodies: 3A1 was constantly positive; J5, BA-1, OKT6, Leu-7, and other monoclonal antibodies reactive with T-cells (OKT3, OKT4, OKT8, OKT11, Leu-1, T65) were negative; only two cases had weak positivity with OKT11 and Leu-1, respectively; cells from all cases were surface immunoglobulin (SIg)-negative; three out of the five cases were OKT10-positive and three OKT9-positive; none of the cases reacted with OKM1 and anti-HLA-DR. Our findings indicate that the use of 3A1 monoclonal antibody was helpful in the recognition of individual cases of T-ALL otherwise considered as unclassified-ALL (U-ALL). 3A1 and an anti-common ALL Antigen (CALLA) reagent may represent the essential monoclonal antibodies to be used for screening ALL cells.","['Lopez, M', 'De Rossi, G', 'Bonomo, G', 'Napolitano, M', 'Pasqualetti, D', 'Guglielmi, C', 'Annino, L', 'Pandolfi, F']","['Lopez M', 'De Rossi G', 'Bonomo G', 'Napolitano M', 'Pasqualetti D', 'Guglielmi C', 'Annino L', 'Pandolfi F']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Diagn Immunol,Diagnostic immunology,8308082,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/classification/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Male', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Diagn Immunol. 1985;3(1):11-4.,,,,,,,,

Of these the surface immunoglobulins (sIg) and monoclonal antibodies (McAb) BA-1, BA-2, FMC7, OKM1, and anti-T65 allowed a fair distinction between five cytological subtypes: chronic lymphocytic (CLL), ""lymphoplasmacytoid"" (LPL), centrocytic (CL), prolymphocytic (PLL), and hairy cell leukemia (HCL). In that order the sIg showed a decreasing number of cases of mu +/- delta class and an increase of alpha or gamma positivity. The number of BA-1-positive cases was decreased in PLL and HCL. There was a decline of BA-2- and anti-T65-positive cases in the order mentioned, while this was accompanied by an increase of FMC7 and OKM1 positivity. A significant mutual exclusion between anti-T65 and FMC7 was observed and the same was true for FMC7 and BA-2. The antibodies FMC7 and OKM1, and anti-T65 and BA-2 were linked to each other. Also FMC7 positivity was related to sIg of the alpha and gamma classes. On the basis of this unique combination of markers a differentiation scheme of B lymphocytes is proposed, in which prolymphocytic leukemia and hairy cell leukemia seem to represent a maturation arrest at a more advanced stage than chronic lymphocytic or ""lymphoplasmacytoid"" leukemia.","['den Ottolander, G J', 'Schuit, H R', 'Waayer, J L', 'Huibregtsen, L', 'Hijmans, W', 'Jansen, J']","['den Ottolander GJ', 'Schuit HR', 'Waayer JL', 'Huibregtsen L', 'Hijmans W', 'Jansen J']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,Clinical immunology and immunopathology,0356637,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*classification/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis/genetics']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0090-1229(85)90082-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 1985 Apr;35(1):92-102. doi: 10.1016/0090-1229(85)90082-0.,,,,,,,,

The functional status of the steroid receptors was confirmed by nuclear transfer of the cytoplasmic hormone-receptor complex upon temperature activation. Since the rise in E2-receptor display paralleled a large increase in the proliferative activity of the cells as well as a change in their maturation status the question was raised as to whether the E2-receptor should be considered as a physiological marker of growth rate or of cellular differentiation. Exposure of the patient's blast cells to E2 in vitro resulted in cessation of cell growth following at least one mitosis after addition of the inducer as seen from the replacement of the large blasts by small CLL-like cells without definite signs of alteration of the differentiation status. This suggests the association of E2-receptor expression with control of growth rather than cell maturation.","['Paietta, E', 'Tudoriu, C D', 'Goldstein, M', 'Papenhausen, P', ""d'Olimpio, J"", 'Wiernik, P H']","['Paietta E', 'Tudoriu CD', 'Goldstein M', 'Papenhausen P', ""d'Olimpio J"", 'Wiernik PH']",['eng'],['P30 CA 13330-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Receptors, Estradiol)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '731DCA35BT (Diethylstilbestrol)']",IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Diethylstilbestrol/pharmacology', 'Estradiol/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Plasma Cells/pathology', 'Receptors, Estradiol/analysis']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(85)90018-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1985;9(1):19-29. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(85)90018-9.,,,,,,,,

Mechanism of target cell recognition by autoreactive thymocytes.,4244-9,"Neonatal infection of mice with Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV-M) results in the establishment of a chronic virus-carrier state. Such MuLV-carrier mice exhibit several immunologic abnormalities including generalized immunosuppression and autoimmunity. Previously, we found thymocytes from MuLV-M-carrier mice to be cytotoxic for normal syngeneic and allogeneic fibroblasts but not for xenogeneic (hamster) target cells. However, when the same syngeneic or allogeneic target cells were infected with MuLV-M, they were ""spared"" from the autoreactivity, leading us to speculate that the MuLV receptor on the target cell membrane was involved in the autoreactivity. To address this question, we tested MuLV-carrier thymocytes for their ability to lyse hamster/mouse-hybrid target cells; some of which possessed chromosome 5 (which codes for the ecotropic MuLV receptor). Of the nine hybrid cell lines initially tested, only the five clones that carried chromosome 5 were killed by the autoreactive thymocytes. In additional experiments, we noted that the cytotoxic reaction was inhibited in the presence of a monoclonal antibody that reacts with an MuLV-M gp70 epitope. The results suggest that the autoreactive cytotoxicity is mediated, at least in part, through the formation of a ""bridge"" between MuLV budding from the membrane of the thymocytes and the ecotropic MuLV receptor on the target cells.","['Proffitt, M R', 'Kozak, C', 'de la Motte, C', 'Caulfield, M J']","['Proffitt MR', 'Kozak C', 'de la Motte C', 'Caulfield MJ']",['eng'],"['AI-18334/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-20242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/physiology', 'Binding, Competitive', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/microbiology', 'Thymus Gland/*cytology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology', 'Viral Fusion Proteins']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Jun;134(6):4244-9.,,,,,,,,

The cellfree supernatant (CFS) from B151K12 cells (B151-CFS) could induce terminal differentiation of pre-activated B cells or in vivo passaged chronic B leukemia cells, BCL1, into immunoglobulin-secreting cells, while it did not exert a nominal lymphokine activity such as BCGFI (now known as BSFpl), IL 2, or gamma-interferon. However, it promoted [3H]thymidine uptake of dextran sulfate (DXS)-stimulated normal B cells and in vivo passaged BCL1 cells, suggesting that it also has BCGFII activity. We tried extensively to purify and to separate the TRF active molecule from the BCGFII active molecule by using many types of purification procedures. The purification scheme consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, Blue-Sepharose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and gel permeation with fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). It was revealed that the BCGFII active molecule was hardly separable from the TRF during the entire purification procedure. The TRF as well as BCGFII active materials were glycoprotein with an apparent m.w. of 50 to 60 Kd on gel permeation chromatography and 18 Kd on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The BCGFII active materials were hardly separable from the TRF active one, even after a reverse-phase FPLC, in which both BCGFII and TRF activities were recovered in the fractions eluted at 44 to 48% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Furthermore, the absorption of TRF and BCGFII active materials by using BCL1 cells removed not only TRF but also BCGFII activity. Moreover, B cell-specific monoclonal antibody (9T1), which can preferentially block TRF-dependent plaque-forming cell responses, also inhibited the expression of BCGFII activity to BCL1 cells.

We have analysed the role of accessory cells and the correlation to target cell surface Ig phenotype in TPA-induced morphological and functional differentiation of 12 CLL populations. A more than three-fold increase in secreted IgM was seen in 10 of 12 cases, with the strongest responses in patients having monoclonal serum IgM. CLL populations negative for or having only weak surface mu chain expression were less inducible. The impact of autologous and allogeneic accessory cells on TPA induction was studied in cell enrichment/depletion experiments using both physical and cytotoxic antibody techniques. CLL cells physically depleted of autologous E+ and monocytic (light density fraction) cells still responded to TPA. This response could be enhanced by allogeneic E- light fraction cells. Further depletion of autologous accessory cells by treatment of the E- high density fraction CLL cells with a panel of monoclonal antibodies plus complement demonstrated the permissive role of one or two populations of autologous cells expressing low avidity E receptors and the T3, T4 and T8 antigens. Augmenting T cells of similar phenotype were found among allogeneic cells from normal individuals. Thus, TPA-induced IgM secretion in biopsy B-CLL cells is regulated by minute numbers of autologous helper T cells. Furthermore, the Ig secretory response of CLL populations seems to be correlated with the surface Ig the surface immunoglobulin phenotype of the leukaemic cells.","['Danersund, A', 'Totterman, T H', 'Nilsson, K', 'Egle-Jansson, I', 'Kabelitz, D', 'Sjoberg, O']","['Danersund A', 'Totterman TH', 'Nilsson K', 'Egle-Jansson I', 'Kabelitz D', 'Sjoberg O']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Phorbols)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1985 Mar;59(3):644-52.,PMC1576933,,,,,,,

A complete blood count showed 47,200 leukocyte per mm3 with 82% granular lymphocytes, 8% small lymphocytes and others. Hemoglobin was 11.5 g/dl and platelet count was 365 X 10(3)/mm3. Surface marker study revealed erythrocyte-rosettes 94%, Leu-1 59%, Leu-2a 70%, Leu-3a 14%, Leu-4 98%, Leu-7 57%, Leu-11 5%, HLA-DR 92%, BA-2 6%, common ALL antigen 4%, and surface immunoglobulin 2%. These results suggest granular lymphocyte proliferation with T-cell phenotype. Natural killer activity was 4.5%, but it was elevated to 11.4% after interleukin-2 stimulation by 2 days' culture. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus-I antibody was absent. No lymphadenopathy and no hepatosplenomegaly were seen, except for bone marrow infiltration of granular lymphocytes. The patient has been in good health without any acute distress. The leukocyte count has gradually decreased to 12,300/mm3 with 79% lymphocytes in 6 months of follow-up without any therapy. This case is suggestive of benign lymphocytosis, although similar cases have been reported previously as chronic lymphocytic leukemia with T-cell marker and/or natural killer function.","['Toki, H', 'Okabe, K', 'Kimura, Y']","['Toki H', 'Okabe K', 'Kimura Y']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Lymphocytosis/blood/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 1985 Mar;15(1):151-9.,,,,,,,,

From application of univariate and multivariate statistical methods, we determined the relationship of five blast cell features to treatment outcome in 250 patients who were enrolled in two clinical trials at this center from May 1979 through April 1982. Karyotype ploidy, lymphoblast morphology, and immunophenotype were each significantly related to prognosis as measured by time to failure, while periodic acid-Schiff reactivity and glucocorticoid receptor number lacked prognostic implication for this patient population. In addition, clinical features of initial WBC count, age, and race were also significant independent variables in predicting treatment response. By multivariate analysis, both ploidy and morphology contributed prognostic information to a clinical model based on WBC count, age, and race. If the model was adjusted for impact of ploidy, however, French-American-British morphology no longer contributed additional prognostic information. Our findings suggest that many traditional biological features used to estimate prognosis in ALL can be discarded in favor of clinical features (leukocyte count, age, and race) and cytogenetics (ploidy) for planning of future clinical trials.","['Kalwinsky, D K', 'Roberson, P', 'Dahl, G', 'Harber, J', 'Rivera, G', 'Bowman, W P', 'Pui, C H', 'Ochs, J', 'Abromowitch, M', 'Costlow, M E']","['Kalwinsky DK', 'Roberson P', 'Dahl G', 'Harber J', 'Rivera G', 'Bowman WP', 'Pui CH', 'Ochs J', 'Abromowitch M', 'Costlow ME', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', '*Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', 'Phenotype', 'Ploidies', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Time Factors']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1985.3.4.477 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1985 Apr;3(4):477-84. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1985.3.4.477.,,,,,,,,

Chemical modification of arginine residues by phenylglyoxal or sulfhydryl groups by N-ethyl maleimide and iodoacetamide completely destroys the activity of IL-1 from THP-1 cells as well as that of the pI 6.8 component from PBM. In contrast, the pI 5.1 component of PBM IL-1 is resistant to heat denaturation and sulfhydryl reagents, although it is totally inactivated by phenylglyoxal.

Major parameters of this assay were the number of thymic lymphocytes, incubation time, the age of the thymocyte donor, and the source and amount of serum used. The majority of complex-forming lymphocytes from normal young adult mice were found to have a blastlike morphology, indicating their possible origin from the subcapsular zone of the thymus. Changes of complex-forming cells during thymus development seemed to support this concept. The complex formation occurred in two steps: adherence of the lymphocytes to stromal cells and subsequent crawling of the lymphocytes under stromal cell cytoplasm.

When nuclei were isolated and incubated in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions, the activity resulted in the production of 3'-OH termini in the cellular DNA and the release of chromatin due to internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. This enzyme activity was chromatin-bound and could be extracted from chromatin in an active form in 0.35 M KCl. The majority of endonuclease activity from erythroleukemic spleens was present in nuclei of precursor erythroid cells of low buoyant density (1.025-1.05 g/ml). Uninfected normal splenic tissue contained an endonuclease activity which was almost entirely confined to a B-lymphocyte population of high buoyant density (greater than 1.07 g/ml). Erythroid cell-enriched spleens from phenylhydrazine-treated mice exhibited a distribution of endonuclease activity in cells at low and high densities reflecting a mixture of erythroid and lymphoid cells. Cloned erythroleukemic cell lines propagated in vitro lacked cells of low density and showed no detectable endonuclease activity. However, nuclei from these cell lines were susceptible to exogenously added endonuclease extracted from erythroleukemic spleen cells. These same cell lines propagated as subcutaneous tumors contained endonuclease activity and a morphologically-similar low-density cell population which accounted for the endonuclease activity in these tumors. Nuclei from cloned lymphoid cell lines, representing different B-lymphocyte phenotypes, showed differences in the presence of endonuclease activity.

AF could be exerted by B cells from different origin, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), Burkitt's lymphoma (BL)-derived lines, either EBV-positive or not, pre-B and B leukemias and lymphomas. The EBV-converted BJAB-B95 BL cells could exert an AF as efficient as BJAB cells, their EBV-negative counterparts, which demonstrates that EBV itself does not play any role in this function. The HLA-DR antigen-negative BL-K562 hybrids PUTKO and DUTKO, T51.4.1.6 cells which derived from an HLA-DR-negative variant of the T51 LCL and 721.84.5 cells from a mutagenically dissected HLA-DR-negative clone of the 721 LCL, also exerted very efficient AF. 721 LCL, PUTKO and DUTKO hybrids could produce interleukin 1 activity when triggered with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA). Furthermore, addition of anti-DR monoclonal antibodies which blocked completely the AF of the B cell lines in mixed lymphocyte-tumor cell reaction did not affect the mitogen-triggered AF exerted by the same B cell lines. The induction of cellular differentiation with TPA markedly reduced the AF exerted by all B cell lines studied as well as by the hybrid cells DUTKO. By contrast, the PUTKO hybrid was unsensitive to sodium butyrate and TPA treatments, which were unable to abrogate its AF. Taken together, these data indicate that the AF in mitogen-induced T lymphocyte responses is dependent upon some precise maturational stages of accessory cells and HLA-DR antigen expression is not required for AF in mitogen-induced proliferation assays.","['Wakasugi, H', 'Dokhelar, M C', 'Garson, D', 'Harel-Bellan, A', 'Fradelizi, D', 'Tursz, T']","['Wakasugi H', 'Dokhelar MC', 'Garson D', 'Harel-Bellan A', 'Fradelizi D', 'Tursz T']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Monocytes/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830150309 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1985 Mar;15(3):256-61. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830150309.,,,,,,,,

This difference is related to the greater efficiency with which T-lymphoblasts accumulate cytotoxic levels of dATP derived from the adenosine deaminase substrate 2'-deoxyadenosine (dAdo). Previous work has shown that differences in dATP accumulation by cultured T- and B-lymphoblastoid cell lines cannot be explained by large differences in the levels of dAdo-phosphorylating or dAdo nucleotide (dAXP)-degrading activities in cytoplasmic extracts of these cells, although it has been proposed that intact B-cell lines may catabolize intracellular dAXP more rapidly than do T-cell lines. To further examine the determinants of dAdo sensitivity in T- and B-lymphoblasts, we have studied dAdo and dAXP metabolism in the human T- and B-cell lines CEM and WI-L2 and in hybrids generated by fusion of these cell lines. The hybrid nature of the fusion products was established by nutritional studies and by analyses of cellular surface antigens, DNA content, and enzymatic activities. We found that WI-L2 X CEM hybrids and another T X B hybrid derived from fusion of the SB human B-cell line with CEM were 30- to 40-fold less sensitive to dAdo and about 10-fold less sensitive to the dAdo analogue 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine than was CEM, or about as resistant as were their B-cell parental lines. Our studies confirm that CEM avidly accumulates dAXP from dAdo but does not catabolize intracellular dAXP. In contrast, WI-L2, SB, and WI-L2 X CEM and SB X CEM hybrids rapidly degraded intracellular dAXP, which limited their ability to undergo dAXP pool expansion. Expression of dAXP catabolic activity in T X B hybrids behaved as a dominant mechanism, conferring resistance to dAdo- and dAdo-related nucleosides to T X B hybrids. It has been postulated that cell fusion may play a role in the progression of tumors and contribute to diversity among the cells that compose clonal tumors. We have speculated that fusion of a malignant T-lymphoblast with an activated B-cell might be a mechanism for the evolution of drug resistance in acute T-cell leukemia.","['Kurtzberg, J', 'Hershfield, M S']","['Kurtzberg J', 'Hershfield MS']",['eng'],"['5T32 AM 07015/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM 00434/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM 20902/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coformycin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Culture Media', 'DNA/analysis', 'Deoxyadenosines/*toxicity', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/analysis', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Pentostatin', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Apr;45(4):1579-86.,,,,,,,,
