The biology of these viruses suggested that MCFs are the product of recombination between endogenous ecotropic and xenotropic viruses and, further, that the recombination has taken place within the envelope (env) gene which encodes the surface glycoprotein (gp70) of the virion. We have compared by tryptic peptide analysis, the gp70s of four MCF isolates with the gp70s of various possible parental viruses. In addition, we have compared the tryptic peptides of the gag gene products p30 and p15 from several of these viruses. The results allow the following conclusions: (i) the gp70s of the MCF viruses are not identical to one another and are different from the gp70s of the possible parental viruses tested; (ii) the MCF virus gp70s have tryptic peptides in common with xenotropic virus gp70s as well as with ecotropic virus gp70s; and (iii) the gap region protein, p30, of the MCFs tested is identical to p30 of AKR ecotropic virus (Akv-1 or Akv-2) and distinct from p30 of xenotropic viruses, suggesting that the 5' end of the recombinant viruses is of Akv origin. The findings are discussed with respect to the possible role a recombinant virus might play in leukemogenesis in AKR mice.",PMC432010,,,,,,,,,

Sedimentation and electrophoretic analyses indicated that the virus contains a distinct 28S RNA with about 5700 nucleotides. It is the smallest avian tumor virus RNA detected to date. The small size of the RNA suggests that the defectiveness of the virus is due to deletions in replicative genes. The RNA shared 3 to 5 of 30 large RNase T1-resistant oligonucleotides with the RNA of other avian leukosis and sarcoma and may represent the transforming information of the virus.

These patients stayed in complete remission for at least three months after the blood sample was taken. In the sera of 11 patients no antiviral activity could be found with the FPV-BT20 assay system. 3 of the 11 were in relapse, 5 had a relapse within 3 months and 3 stayed in remission more than 3 months after the blood sample was taken. In the FPV-CEF and in the VSV-BT20 system antiviral activity was also found. The activity in the FPV-CEF system corresponded well with the FPV-BT20 assay and the disease status, whereas the activity detected by the VSV-BT20 system did not. The nature of the antiviral activities in the sera of AML patients against FPV and VSV is not yet clear. Interferon and specific antiviral antibodies can probably be ruled out. The antiviral activity against FPV appears to be a biological index of the activity of the disease and might eventually be used to determine intensity and length of treatment.",,Antivirale Aktivitat im Serum von Patienten mit akuter myeloischer Leukamie: prognostische Bedeutung?,,,,,,,,

Congenital transmission of LLV was erratic and neither the VST nor tests for virus in egg albumen prior to incubating eggs identified all hens that transmitted infection. For example, 14 hens negative on VST produced 50 eggs negative for virus in albumen and yet one of the embryos from these eggs was infected. Eggs from other hens had infectious virus in albumen and about half of the embryos from these were infected. Tests for virus in cloacal swabs from one-day-old chicks were as sensitive as tests on embryos for detecting congenital transmission.

At least one-third of ss-DNA belonging to the nonrepetitious part of the cell genome could be hybridized to homologous RNAs. In the present work, similar results were obtained with ss-DNA from cells of chickens infected by avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV). To investigate whether this enrichment of ss-DNA in transcribed DNA sequences involves provirus DNA, radioactive AMV RNA and cDNA copies of AMV RNA were used. Most of the 70S AMV RNA hybridized much faster to ss-DNA from productively infected leukemic cells than to bulk DNA. cDNA, either double-stranded or single-stranded, made in the presence of actinomycin D hybridized to total nuclear DNA with similar kinetics. In contrast, about half of the double-stranded cDNA molecules hybridized 40-50 times faster to ss-DNA than to total DNA, indicating that only one of the provirus DNA strands seems to be present in ss-DNA. This was confirmed by the fact that relatively insignificant amounts of the ss-cDNA molecules made in the presence of actinomycin D could be annealed to ss-DNA as compared with bulk DNA. These results indicate that actively transcribed DNA sequences can be selectively distributed in the ss-DNA fraction, probably because of single strand breaks in the vicinity of transcription sites.",PMC431703,,,,,,,,,

For the future it would seem that major advances are going to come not from clinical therapeutic trials but from combined laboratory and clinical research approaches. Chemotherapy will be the main stay of treatment for the foreseeable future. Immunotherapy may play some role as our knowledge of that modality improves.

Our findings suggested a major role of the viral surface glycoprotein gp71 in immunological defense mechanisms. This was confirmed by vaccination experiments with isolated gp71 in mice. The induced immunity was highly specific and not operative against endogenous murine C-viruses belonging to other serotypes. Surprisingly the latter were found to be activated by the vaccination with gp71 of FLV. In heterologous animal species isolated FLV-gp71 induced the formation of broadly reacting antibodies. They were found to be effective in the therapy of infections with FLV in mice as well as with feline leukaemia virus in cats. Most impressive results were obtained with an antiserum prepared against feline leukaemia virus in a goat.

Ts3 is a spontaneous temperature-sensitive mutant of Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) which previous studies indicated to be defective in assembly or release of the virions. In the present study, both SEM and TEM revealed the following: (i) there were more cell-associated virions in ts3-infected cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature (39 degrees C) than either in cells grown at the permissive temperature (34 degrees C) or in wild-type MuLV-infected cells grown at 39 degrees C; (ii) there were more normal single particles than multiploids (virions with two or more pieces of genomic RNA) in ts3-infected cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature; (iii) there were more multiploids in ts3-infected cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature than either in cells grown at the permissive temperature or in wild-type MuLV-infected cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature; (iv) upon temperature shift from 39 to 34 degrees C, about 90% of the cell-associated virions dissociated from the cell surface. TEM studies also indicated that upon temperature shiftdown, virion assembly rapidly occurred. The above observations suggest that faulty assembly, which results in the production of multiploids, may not be the reason why ts3 virions accumulate on the cell surface at the nonpermissive temperature. The relatively higher proportion of multiploids found in ts3-infected cells grown at 39 degrees C compared with those grown at 34 degrees C may be due to the higher density of budding virions at the cell surface at the nonpermissive temperature, which increases the possibility of two or more particles assembling close to one another. The accumulation of ts3 virions in all stages of assembly at the nonpermissive temperature, together with the fact that rapid assembly and release of ts3 virions occurred on temperature shiftdown, indicates that virion assembly is restricted after it has been initiated. The probable role of altered glycoprotein(s) in restricting virion assembly is discussed.",PMC515925,,,,,,,,,

The new method also offers a preparative route to Mannich bases 1a and 1b were needed in multigram quantities for biological testing. In addition, the cyclization of certain of the monoalkylaminomethylrifamycins to the novel N,15-didehydro-15-epi[methano(alkylimino)]rifamycin SV derivatives (2) is described. The anticellular and antiviral effects of representatives of both series of compounds against cultured mouse cells and murine oncornavirus are are discussed.",,,,,,,,,,

Cell cultures of leukocyte-rich plasma from four patients were positive for the virus. In this study viremia was clearly related to dissemination of dermal lesions-the spread of zoster lesions outside an infected dermatome. The child with the longest viremic phase, five days, had the longest and most severe course of skin dissemination, as well as biochemical evidence of hepatitis. One patient with viremia had advanced embryonal carcinoma and died of disseminated tumor before her clinical course could be evaluated. These observations, the first to document a viremic phase for herpes zoster in immunosuppressed children, furnish an added criterion for evaluation of antiviral drugs and live-virus vaccines in the treatment and prevention of varicella-zoster infections.",,,,,,,,,,

An understanding has developed of the importance for determining clinical and laboratory features present at diagnosis as an aid not only to establish a prognosis but also to design specific treatment regimens. A system has been developed for bringing new chemotherapeutic agents into clinical trials as effectively as possible. Through both clinical and laboratory studies, an increasing understanding of the biology of cancer is being developed. This understanding will provide the basis for more rational treatment programs in the future. Physicians of different specialty interests have learned to work together to develop coordinated programs of treatment so important to optimal care. By far the most important lesson learned, however, is that cancer in children is not of necessity a fatal disease, even when dissemination has occurred. For the furture, it will be necessary to develop even more effective methods of treatment, and research must provide a better understanding of this disease that may offer the opportunity for prevention, which, after all, is the number one interest of the pediatrician.",,,120,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the combination of 3-OMG plus nicotinamide (also effective in reducing SZ toxicity) increased the dose that killed 50% of the animals to 540 mg/kg. In L1210 leukemic mice treated with SZ, there was a 2-fold increase in the median survival of animals pretreated with 3-OMG and a 3-fold increase in that of animals pretreated with the combination of 3-OMG and nicotinamide. Neither 3-OMG nor nicotinamide alone enhanced the survival of the leukemic mice. Pretreatment of normal mice with 3-OMG partially prevented the expected fall in hepatic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide content. This study suggests that 3-OMG, by protecting normal tissue, will permit the administration of larger therapeutic doses of SZ in leukemic L1210 mice.

In this group of 102 patients, all pediatric cancers were seen as initial lesions, but Wilms' tumor and retinoblastoma were over-represented and leukemia and brain tumors underrepresented. Survival variation as well as tumor susceptibility may be responsible for this disproportion. Osteosarcomas and chondrosarcomas were the most frequent second malignant neoplasms (SMN). Embryonal tumors were rare as SMN and adult-type tumors (carcinomas) appeared at earlier than expected ages, whether arising after irradiation or not related to that form of therapy. Radiation was associated with 69 SMN, genetic disease accounted for 27 SMN and both conditions were noted in 15 SMN. In the group of 21 patients for whom neither radiation nor a known genetic disorder could be implicated, there were three with colon carcinoma and glioma and five with leukemia or lymphoma and glioma.

Fourteen other pyridine derivatives were ineffective or toxic. Untransformed normal rat kidney (NRK) cells are reversibly arrested in the G(1) stage of the growth cycle as shown by cell counts, mitotic index, [(3)H]thymidine incorporation, and flow microfluorometry. Flow microfluorometry was used to monitor the effects of picolinic acid on numerous other cell lines. Normal cells are blocked in G(1), whereas transformed cells show responses that are dependent upon the transforming virus and independent of species or origin of the cell line. Kirsten sarcoma virus-transformed cells are blocked in G(1). Simian virus 40-transformed cells progress to a G(2) block. Cells transformed by polyoma or Harvey sarcoma virus with Moloney virus coat have flow microfluorometry profiles that indicate blocks in both G(1) and G(2). Cells transformed with Moloney sarcoma virus are not blocked in a specific phase of the cell cycle. Picolinic acid does not change the levels of NAD(+) plus NADH; however, the growth inhibition by picolinic acid is partially overcome by nicotinamide.

A numerical listing and discussion are beyond the scope of this review. Wells and Fraumeni give some insight into common congenital malignant neoplasms. Table 2 lists the percentage of neonatal deaths caused by type-specific cancers. Retinoblastoma is probably the most common malignant tumor in the neonate. About seven per cent of these tumors have been apparent at birth. This tumor is not discussed in either article because it is not lethal until muypes in neonatal and pediatric patients. Some congenital malformations in the in the neonate are recognized as being frankly benign (cysts), potentially malignant (teratomas), and frankly malignant (neuroblastoma). A high percentage of teratomas are benign in the newborn period. Leukemia in the newborn appears to be more aggressive yet neuroblastoma has a better prognosis. More studies are needed to help us define why the neonate does better with some tumors and worse with others. Surface cell markers on neonatal leukemia, B and T cell function studies, and other immunologic surveillance studies are needed. Study of neonatal oncology may add to our knowledge of carcinogenesis and oncogenesis in the future.",,,75,,,,,,,

Leukemia regression occurred in about 25% of infected mice and resulted in the return of lymphoid organs to near-normal weight and normal histology and the recovery from anemia. A tenfold to 1,000-fold decrease in virus titer was seen in those mice in which leukemia regressed when compared to leukemic animals, although infectious virus was still recoverable from apparently normal spleens. The sera of mice in which leukemia regressed contained potent virus-neutralizing activity that was associated mainly with immunoglobulins.

Direct comparisons of the percentages of S-Ig-bearing cells and EAC rosette-forming cells in both infected and BLV-free animals showed no evidence for the presence of a substantial population bearing one surface marker but not the other.

Only the 1-nitro derivative exhibited strong inhibitory effect on RNA biosynthesis and caused distinct ultrastructural changes (nucleolar segregation, chromatine margination etc.) in a living cell. The 1-nitro derivative binds covalently to DNA in vivo resulting in crosslink formation.

One mechanism, controlled by a gene mapping in or close to H-2D, influences the capacity of the H-2D gene product to form molecular complexes with FV molecules in the plasma membrane of infected cells. Formation of a complex appears to provide a target antigen for syngeneic cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, to cause co-capping of FV and H-2D antigens, to permit the selective inclusion of H-2Db molecules into progeny Friend virions, to influence the long-term maintenance of virus production in vitro and, in conjunction with the second mechanism, to stimulate the generation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. This second mechanism is controlled by a gene in the H-2K or H-2I region, and, in the presence of an H-2/FV molecular complex immunogen, influences the generation of H-2 restricted cytotxic T-lymphocytes and the rate of rejection of syngeneic FV-induced tumor cells.",,,,,,,,,,

At later times, after synthesis of MuLV proteins has been inhibited by the VSV infection, neither MuLV virions nor the VSV (MuLV) pseudotypes are made. Infection of MuLV-producing cells with mutants of VSV having temperature-sensitive lesions in either G or M protein does not generate pseudotypes at nonpermissive temperature, indicating that both proteins are needed for pseudotypes to form. Although the pseudotypes resist neutralization by anti-VSV serum, they are inactivated by anti-VSV serum plus complement, and they can be precipitated by rabbit anti-VSV serum plus goat anti-rabbit IgG. These results, coupled with experiments using a temperature-sensitive mutant of VSV G protein grown at partly restrictive temperature, suggest that small numbers of VSV G protein are obligately incorporated into VSV(MuLV) pseudotypes. There appears to be a stringent requirement for recognition of the viral core by homologous envelope components as the nucleating step in the budding process. Only after such a nucleation can the envelope components of the second virus substitute into the membrane of the budding particle.",,,,,,,,,,

DNase treatment of HeLa nuclei in vitro also stimulates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity, but not in nuclei derived from MNU-treated cells unless they have been subsequently incubated to allow for recovery from MNU damage. DNA polymerase activity is stimulated in vitro by poly(ADP) ribosylation of nuclear proteins. By using intact nuclei derived from MNU-treated HeLa cells, the repair via elongation of single-strand DNA breaks is demonstrated in vitro. This repair is dependent on DNA polymerase activity and is enhanced by adenosine diphosphate ribosylation of histones. Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase with nicotinamide results in extensive degradation of MNU-damaged DNA. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase may play a role in the repair of alkylation damage to cellular DNA and that the inhibition of this enzyme in vivo might be exploited to potentiate the antitumor and carcinogenic activities of MNU.",,,,,,,,,,

Because of this, the role or viruses in the etiology of human cancers is especially difficult to assess. When animal tumor systems were used as models, the roles of various predisposing characteristics in virus oncogenesis were elucidated. Extrapolation of these findings to the human diseases suggests the importance of genetics, age, hormones, immune competence, and stress in determining susceptibility to tumor development in individuals infected with an oncogenic virus. The importance of cofactors in induction of those human tumors most strongly associated with virus infection, including Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, cerviccal carcinoma, acute myelogenous leukemia, and breast cancer, is reviewed. Understanding of the role of these cofactors in virus carcinogenesis may lead to disease prevention through elimination of one or more of the cofactors.",,,53,,,,,,,

The activities of the isolated isoenzymes are markedly decreased when the concentrations of ATP, phosphate or Mg2+ that are optimum in vitro are replaced by concentrations of ATP, phosphate or Mg2+ that are optimum in vitro are replaced by concentrations approximating to those found in vivo. Further, comparisons of the Km values of isolated uridine kinases with those for cellular uptake of pyrimidine nucleosides and their rate of intracellular phosphorylation suggest that nucleoside-transport systems play a rate-limiting role in nucleoside analogue activation and consequently that it is impossible to estimate the Km of uridine kinase in the intact cell.

In addition, nuclear RNA labelling profiles were analyzed in human acute leukemia blast cells and nucleolar RNA synthesis was studied in Novikoff hepatoma cells in vitro after incubations of the tumor cells with adriamycin and DNA-adriamycin. The studies revealed that compared to the free drugs a) the DNA complexes were generally less active with respect to inhibition of overall DNA and RNA synthesis in these divergent tumor cell types, b) characteristic differences between adriamycin and daunomycin which are related to a more rapid cellular uptake of daunomycin were still present after complexing of both drugs to calf thymus DNA, and c) the intracellular mode of action of the free antibiotics was not changed by complex formation with DNA. These results indicate that a preferential incorporation of the macromolecular complexes into the tumor cells by pinocytosis--as originally postulated by Trouet et al. (1972)--is not likely for Novikoff hepatoma cells, human mammary carcinoma cells and human acute leukemia blast cells. In contrast, it may be concluded from this study that the DNA complexes dissociate already at the outer cell membrane resulting in a generally decreased but kinetically drug-specific cellular uptake.

For a better definition of these abnormalities, 14 patients with untreated chronic granulocytic leukemia were studied. The patients were divided into three groups on the basis of the functional activities of their phagocytosing granulocytes. In four patients (group I), the granulocytes were normal in respect to particle ingestion, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)-stimulated reduction, cyanide-insensitive oxygen (O2) consumption, superoxide anion (O2-)-stimulated production, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, and iodination. They also had a normal myeloperoxidase (MPO) content. In four patients (group III), the granulocytes were significantly defective in all of these activities. In the six remaining patients (group II), all the initial metabolic steps of the phagocytosing granulocytes (ingestion, NBT reduction, O2 consumption, O2-production, H2O2 production) were normal, as were the MPO content of the granulocytes, while iodination was strikingly decreased. These metabolic features suggested a degranulation defect which was observed ultrastructurally in the only patient studied among these six. The phagocytosing granulocytes of this patient did not degranulate and no deposits of MPO activity were seen in the phagosomes.",,,,,,,,,,

This may be viewed in relation to the natural history of tumors. In most cases, tumors evolve in several steps, with a successful of clonal variants following each other, characterized by increasing independence of host regulations (including immune restrictions). This process is commonly designated as tumor progression. In all probability, selection for nonrejectability is part of this process. Selection of the host for rejecting capacity is unlikely to play any major role, since the overwhelming majority of the naturally occurring tumors arise after the host has passed the peak of its reproductive period. The nonrejectability of spontaneous tumors may be overcome by target-cell modification, e.g., by chemical coupling, somatic cell hybridization, or viral xenogenization. Furthermore, genetic analysis of the F1 resistance effect in relation to seemingly nonrejectable tumors may reveal the existence of specific immune-response (Ir) genes that can influence the recognition of tumor-associated membrane changes by the host immune system.",,,64,,,,,,,

A concentration of about 1 mM was required to completely inhibit the proliferation of Novikoff rat hepatoma and mouse L-cells, whereas about 0.1 mM completely inhibited the proliferation of L1210 and P388 mouse leukemia and Chinese hamster ovary cells. INOX inhibited in a similar time- and concentration-dependent manner the synthesis of protein, RNA, and DNA, as measured by the incorporation of labeled amino acid, uridine, and thymidine, into acid-insoluble material, without significantly affecting the incorporation of these precursors into the acid-soluble pool. Flow microfluorometric analyses showed that many of the INOX-treated cells became arrested in G2 + M. The results are consistent with the view that INOX affects multiple metabolic steps. The effects of INOX were quite different from those caused by typical inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase, hydroxyurea, and 2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo(2,3-a)imidazole, which very rapidly inhibited DNA synthesis and caused arrest of the cells in G1, with minimal effects on RNA and protein synthesis.",,,,,,,,,,

Reactivation occurs when cellular immunity is compromised owing to either immune-deficiency disease or iatrogenic intervention. When intervention is modest, most antibody-positive patients do not shed virus (19); when the group is treated with a higher mean dose of cytotoxic agents, almost all antibody-positive patients shed virus (6). In the instance where the chemotherapeutic program includes massive doses of these agents, as in heart or marrow transplantation, or when dysfunction of all cellular activity is extreme, as in the case of severe combined immune deficiency and far-advanced neoplasia, dissemination of infection with multiple-organ involvement ensues (17, 20-22). Primary infection may occur in some patients with neoplasia or in marrow-transplant recipients from either blood transfusions or from marrow, although data are insufficient to be certain (22). It has been conclusively shown, however, that seronegative renal-allograft recipients usually develop primary infection when they acquire a kidney from a seropositive donor. Clinical illness related to virus infection in the first few months after transplantation occurs in almost all patients with primary infection and seldom in those with reactivation infection (6, 25, 26). Three very intriguing observations have been made that should suggest avenues for future research: (a) Since illness occurs more closely related to development of antibody than it does to onset of virus shedding, this suggests that host response plays an important role in the disease that is obviously caused by a virus; a definition of the mechanism of this interaction could lead to an understanding of host-induced disease processes in man; (b) Graft-versus-host disease in marrow transplantation; and (c) allograft rejection in renal-graft recipients correlate with development of CMV infection (16, 22, 24, 26). Taken together, these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that virus antigens interrelate with most antigens in such a way as to lead to immune response to both antigens. Exploration of this clinical observation could lead to a greater understanding of the function of the HL-A system in man.",,,28,,,,,,,

In vitro studies performed in these systems indicate that blocking serum factors can thwart cell-mediated immune responses and that ""unblocking"" antibodies are often found in animals whose tumors have regressed. To what extent spontaneous regressions of human neoplasms are due to immunologic mechanisms is unknown; in 2 patients who had undergone spontaneous tumor regression, tumor cell cytotoxic lymphocytes and unblocking serum factors were detected. Better animal models and better knowledge about the mechanisms of tumor immune reactions are needed before tumor regression can be more successfully induced by immunologic manipulation (to what extent that will even be feasible in man is unknown).",,,,,,,,,,

Polyoma virus in mice, Marek's disease in the chicken, Herpesvirus saimiri in the squirrel monkey, and the Epstein-Barr virus in man are examples. There is much less evidence for immune surveillance against chemically induced tumors. It is argued that surveillance against the virus-induced tumors may have evolved by the selective fixation of appropriate immune responsiveness (IR) genes. It is important to distinguish between the breakdown of an existing surveillance mechanism, e.g., by immunosuppresion, and the lack of immune recognition, due to the deficiency of the IR gene equipment. Presently available in vitro lymphocytotoxicity tests are not yet developed to the point where they can reliably distinguish between these alternatives.",,,46,,,,,,,

When cells were grown in the presence of the proline analogue L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, a 70,000-dalton precursor polypeptide (Pp70) was found in addition to Pp60 after a 2.5-min pulse. The cleavage of Pp60 could be partially inhibited by the general protease inhibitor phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). This partial inhibition was found to occur only if PMSF was present during pulse-labeling. Intracellular Pp70 and Pp60 and FeLV virion p70, p30, p15, p11, and p10 were subjected to tryptic peptide analysis. The results of this tryptic peptide analysis demonstrated that intracellular Pp70 and virion p70 were identical and that both contained the tryptic peptides of FeLV p30, p15, p11, and p10. Pp60 contained the tryptic peptides of FeLV P30, P15, and P10, but lacked the tryptic peptides of P11. The results of pactamycin gene ordering experiments indicated that the small structural proteins of FeLV are ordered p11-p15-p10-p30. The data indicate that the small structural proteins of FeLV are synthesized as part of a 70,000-dalton precursor. A cleavage scheme for the generation of FeLV p70, p30, p15, p11, and p10 from precursor polypeptides is proposed.",PMC515687,,,,,,,,,

By comparing the cytolysis of various H-2 different 51Cr lymphomas by CTL from several inbred and congenic lines differing at H-2, and by competition experiments using unlabelled cells, one can demonstrate that this phenomenon is due to an H-2 barrier. H-2b/H-2d hybrid-anti-MSV-CTL immunized by H-2b, H-2d or H-2b/H-2d tumours lyse only FMRGi+ lymphomas of the same H-2, and their activity for a given target is inhibited only by H-2-identical competitive cells. H-2 antigens are therefore directly involved in the interaction between tumour cells and immune CTL which probably react with an 'H-2 modified' antigen of the tumour cells surface. The use of CTL from intra-H-2 recombinant lines shows that H-2D and probably H-2K molecules are involved, but vary according to the tumour cells. A possible role of the I region is discussed as well as the implications of these results in immunosurveillance against viral neoplasia.",,,,,,,,,,

Several murine sarcoma virus (MSV) pseudotypes were used as immunogens and tested against themselves, against other pseudotypes, against leukemogenesis by their helper viruses, and against sarcomagenesis by 3-methylcholanthrene. Five MSV pseudotypes were obtained by rescuing complete MSV from MSV-genome carrier, nonproducer hamster tumor cells, using five different leukemia viruses as helpers. The immunogenic properties of these pseudotypes could be specified on the basis of the following observations. 1) They all induced sarcomas in newborn mice and regressing sarcoma nodules in young adult mice. After regression, most mice remained free of neoplastic disease, but some developed sarcoma or leukemia relapses. 2) They had an individual host range pattern, usually determined by the helper virus, as tested by inoculation of a constant virus dose in BALB/c, C57BL/Ka, and Swiss mice. 3) They were all immunogenic, in the sense that the first virus inoculation prevented sarcoma induction by a second challenge, either viral or cellular. 4) They were cross-reactive in vivo, one pseudotype immunizing against another, in the combinations tested. 5) They were able to immunize against leukemogenesis induced by their helper viruses. This was shown by prevention of leukemic deaths by Rauscher and Friend viruses, by a slight prolongation of survival after challenge with the Precerutti-Law leukemia virus, and by inhibition of splenomegaly by Moloney leukemia virus. In a second stage of the study, we investigated whether immunization with any of the MSV psuedotypes had an inhibitory effect upon sarcomagenesis induced by near-threshold doses of 3-methylcholanthrene. The incidence of these sarcomas was essentially the same in virus-immunized and control mice. It was concluded that immunizing procedures able to prevent sarcomagenesis when the inducer is a virus did not have any consistent preventive effect when the inducer was a chemical.",,,,,,,,,,

In 1964 it was discovered that feline LSA was caused by an oncornavirus, the feline leukemia virus (FeLV). In 1970, a simple, indirect immunoflourescent antibody (IFA) test for FeLV was developed which enabled large numbers of cats, living in their natural (household) environments, to be tested for the virus. In one study, over 2,000 cats were tested and the results showed conclusively that FeLV is a contagious agent for cats. This finding was independently confirmed by several other investigators using different testing procedures. After discovering the contagious nature of FeLV a test and removal program was devised which successfully prevents the spread of FeLV and the development of FeLV diseases in the pet cat population. There is, at present, no evidence that FeLV infects humans living with FeLV infected cats.",,,,,,,,,,

Interference is manifest against pseudotypes in which the vesicular stomatitis virus genome is contained within the coat of one of the murine leukemia viruses. The pseudotypes display the cell specificity of the leukemia viruses: pseudotypes with an ecotropic MuLV coat infect mouse cells but not rabbit or mink cells; pseudotypes with a xenotropic MuLV coat infect rabbit or mink cells well but mouse cells very poorly. Efficient pseudotype formation also occurs between the two MuLV classes, and both the interference patterns and the cell specificity of these pseudotypes are entirely determined by their envelope. Using these pseudotypes, ecotropic MuLV infection could be established in xenogeneic cells, and the resulting progeny could be scored by using a conventional XC cell assay. Also, xenotropic MuLV infection could be established in a mouse cell, showing that no absolute intracellular barrier against xenotropic virus growth exists in murine cells. The major barriers against both xenotropic and ecotropic MuLV therefore are cell surface barriers.

In contrast, the cytotoxic reactivity reflected in spleen cells of NIH Swiss nude mice apparently had no immunologic specificity. A significant level of blastogenic response could be generated in vitro by using normal (B6C3)F1 and AKR spleen cells in the presence of gp71. This reactivity was highly type specific. Moreover, using normal spleen cells from (B6C3)F1, both secondary blastogenic responses and cytotoxic T cell responses could be induced in vitro with purified soluble viral gp71.

In particular, the effect of infection with N, B, or NB tropic MuLVs on Fv-1b restriction in Balb/3T3 cells was measured with an infection center technique in which pseudotypes of murine sarcoma virus (MSV), which have been shown to exhibit Fv-1 dependence of expression, were used to quantitate the degree of restriction. The resulting dose-response curves indicate that productive infection of a single Balb/3T3 cell with N tropic MSV requires co-infection with two MuLV particles. These two MuLV particles are functionally distinguishable. One of them must be N tropic and must be added less than 18 hr after infection with N tropic MSV. The second MuLV particle, on the other hand, need not be N tropic and may be added at any time. Balb/3T3 cultures infected with sufficient N tropic MuLV become fully permissive to transformation by N tropic MSV and to productive infection by N tropic MuLV. This effect, termed ""abrogation"" of Fv-1 restriction, results from infection of a Balb/3T3 cell with a single N tropic MuLV particle, but apparently occurs without viral replication. It seems probable that a requirement for abrogation of Fv-1b restriction by a single infectious particle of N tropic MuLV, which does not itself replicate, is responsible for the two-hit dose-response relationship observed in infectivity titrations of N tropic MuLV in Balb/3T3 cells. The requirements that N tropic MuLV be added within a specified time period with regard to N tropic MSV in order for abrogation to occur suggests that in the absence of N tropic MuLV, the cellular Fv-1b restriction mechanism inactivates N tropic MSV by 9 hr after infection.",,,,,,,,,,

All secretory granules of normal promyelocytes are also MPO-positive. In this study we have found abnormal promyelocytes with MPO-positive as well as MPO-negative secretory granules in blast phase CML patients which contrast with the normal pattern of MPO distribution in most CML patients not in the blast phase or in nonleukemic controls. Alkaline phosphatase activity was found in the nuclear envelope of blasts and promyelocytes of one of the blast transformation patients who had a markedly increased leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score. The cytochemical changes in the distribution of MPO suggest that immature leukemic cells may alter their patterns of secretory granule production.

Evidence from a number of studies using various mouse strains and different leukemia viruses has shown that the controlling genes may act either directly or indirectly. ""In vitro"" experiments have shown controlling effects directed by the prospective target cells themselves in which effective virus infection and/or and/or replication is inhibitied. From ""in vivo"" experiments it is also evident that susceptibility may be controlled through indirect means mediated by immune relationships and other factors involved in the basic regulations of hematopoiesis. The present paper presents a brief review of the various genes known to control susceptibility and resistance to murine leukemia viruses. Certain conflicts in the literature relating to the naming of particular specific genes by different laboratories is also discussed, and some minor revisions in nomenclature designed to resolve some of the existing confusion are proposed.",,,,,,,,,,

Material from in vivo and in vitro sources of normal tissues and lymphomas was assayed for in vitro infectivity, using the XC plaque assay, and for oncogenicity, by assessing lymphoma-accelerating capacity after inoculation into newborn animals. Normal tissues from healthy young AKR mice up to 7 months of age were found to have XC but not oncogenic activity. XC activity persisted, and weak oncogenic activity appeared in older mice. Cocultivation of normal young cells with NIH Swiss mouse embryo cells did not result in the appearance of oncogenic activity, although XC virus increased in titer. A cell-free filtrate of a virus-accelerated lymphoma was studied for host range. Virus as measured by polymerase and gs antigen was found to be propagated on NIH Swiss mouse embryo and wild mouse embryo cells, but not on human rhabdomyosarcoma, normal rat kidney, rabbit corneal, and BALB/c embryo cells. Virus as measured by the XC assay grew better on NIH Swiss mouse than on BALB/c embryo cells. Both of these cell lines propagated virus as measured by the oncogenicity assay. Supernatants from an in vitro cell line from a virus-accelerated lymphoma did not produce XC plaques but were oncogenic. Those from two cell lines of spontaneous lymphomas were negative with both assays. Cultivation of supernatants from these cultured lymphoma cells with NIH Swiss mouse embryo cells resulted in material which produced small plaques on the XC assay. These findings are interpreted as showing the presence of two viruses in AKR mice. One is XC positive and present throughout life. The other is oncogenic, appears later in life, and could be a separate virus or a variant of the first one.",,,,,,,,,,

The molecular details of the replication of these viruses, which are called ribodenoxyviruses, are starting to be known. The ribodenoxyviruses belonging to a single species may either cause sarcomas, leukemia or no disease. The viruses belonging to a single species differ only in whether or not they contain genes for disease formation. In the case of Rous sarcoma virus, the virus causes sarcomas by adding a gene for sarcoma formation to the genome of infected cells. Ribodeoxyviruses appear to undergo different kinds of genetic changes at extraordinarily high rates. In addition, nucleotide sequences related to ribodeoxyvirus RNA are present in the DNA of many uninfected cells. These nucleotide sequences may represent a virus precursor, and ribodeoxyviruses are hypothesized to have evolved from these nucleotide sequences in uninfected cells. These data have led us to hypothesis that non-viral carcinogens act to mutate a cellular gene(s) that is involved in the same types of information transfer and genetic variation as ribodeoxyviruses and thus give rise to the formation of cancer gene(s).",,,,,,,,,,

Marek's disease is successfully kept under control by vaccination of all day-old chickens raised for egg production. Broilers are not vaccinated. During 1975 over 23 million chicks were vaccinated with cell-associated Marek's disease virus CVI 988 vaccines and about 3 million doses of HVT vaccine were administered, mostly in lyophilised form. The mechanism of the immunity conferred by the MD vaccines is discussed. Lymphoid leukosis was successfully controlled in three inbred lines of White Leghorn chickens and in a commercial grand parent flock of White Plymouth Rocks. The control method that can be applied to flocks in the field is based on three elements: From an infected flock hens are selected in whose eggs no lymphoid leukosis viruses can be detected in pooled extracts of groups of embryos. Only eggs from hens that demonstrably do not shed virus congenitally to their embryos are used for the production of progeny. The offspring are reared in isolation until two months of age at which time the age related resistance against tumour formation appears to be sufficiently developed. The chickens are subsequently inoculated intramuscularly with lymphoid leukosis viruses of subgroups A and B and transferred to a conventional chicken house. The inoculated birds become persistently viremic, resist intramuscular challenge infections or exposure by contact, but produce virus-negative eggs during the laying period. For lymphoid leukosis, congenital infection is considered the usual mode of virus transmission. Horizontal virus transmission becomes important when virus-free chickens, reared in isolation for two months, are exposed in field conditions without previous ""vaccination"". During the egg-laying period of these flocks, virus shedding was observed in a similar percentage as in flocks with congenitally infected birds.",,Over bestrijding van aviaire tumorvirusziekten,,,,,,,,

Characteristic type C-MuLV particles were observed in bone tumors induced by the SD-MSV-M-virus in vitro and in vivo. The SD-MSV-M virus also induced bone tumors in rats of all strains tested, and it has a similar tumor-inducing property in hamsters. Immunoelectronmicroscopic studies showed that envelope antigens of MSV-SD virus in rat bone tumors can be distinguished from those found in hamster bone tumor cells. In tissue cultures of MSV-SD rat bone tumors, two separate cell lines have been established: one of them releases both MSV and MuLV and the other produces MuL virus only. The MuLV in this cell line acts as helper. The different interactions appear to support the concept of control mechanisms for the partial expression of genes which are responsible for neoplastic properties, virus replication, and synthesis of gs-antigens. Biochemical studies on structural rearrangement and subunit composition of RNA released from MSV-SD virus, have shown that there are two forms of the native genome RNA differing in their sedimentation coeffiiecients and in subunit composition. In human osteosarcoma tissue culture, type-C viruslike particles are found. In cocultures derived from human osteosarcoma with cells taken from the bone marrow or peripheral blood of patients with different types of leukemia, certain morphological changes are observed which resemble those induced in animal cells by RNA tumor viruses. In osteosarcomas where no cytoplasmic antigen could be proved by an immunofluorescence test, the antigen could be produced by cocultivation with antigen-positive leukemic bone marrow cells. Whole human embryo cells treated with fluid from leukemia bone marrow cultures showed the presence of the cytoplasmic antigen when tested with positive sera, but they showed no morphologic changes. In high molecular weight RNA species, sedimentation coefficients ranging from 62S to 68S are demonstrated by molecular hybridization techniques. In cross-hybridization experiments, annealing values were observed only with complementary DNA products synthesized from sarcoma viruses. Three particularly high molecular weight RNA species released from human sarcoma cell cultures showed no cross-hybridization with either the DNA product of Rauscher leukemia virus or that of Gross leukemia virus.",,,,,,,,,,

Induction of these cells as well as of clones from P3HR-1 EBV-converted BJAB cells with iododeoxyuridine, aminopterin, and hypoxanthine resulted in the appearance of a nuclear antigen in about 1-6% of the cells 1-4 days after induction. The antigen is different from known EBV-induced antigens like EBNA, viral capsid antigen (VCA) or the D- and R-subspecificities of the early antigen (EA) complex. It is demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence and inactivated after acetone fixation. The antigen was not detectable after induction of uninfected BJAB and Ramos cells nor has it been found in noninduced or induced P3HR-1 and Raji cells. Thus, it appears that EBV-infection mediates the expression of this antigen, for which the name TINA (transiently induced nuclear antigen) is suggested. Sera reacting against TINA generally contained high antibody titers against EBV-induced EA. Only a limited number of highly EA-reactive sera, however, were also positive for TINA.

This cDNA hybridized completely to its homologous 70S RNA and was free of self-complementary sequences. Sequences complementary to MuLVR cDNA were found in DNA from tissues of some patients with leukemia (2 of 8), Hodgkin's disease (3 of 10), and one patient with multiple myeloma. DNA from spleen and kidney of a patient with nonneoplastic disease did not contain detectable MuLVR-related sequences. These virus-related sequences in the DNA from these neoplastic tissues were related but not identical to MuLVR sequences because differences of approximately 6 degrees in the midpoints of thermal elution profiles were found between the heterologous and homologous duplexes. These nucleotide sequences are not the same as the proviral sequences of baboon type-C virus previously found from some other patients with leukemia [Reitz et al. (1976) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 73,2113-2117; Wong-Staal et al. (1976) Nature 262, 190-195], because there is no sequence homology between nucleic acids from MuLVR and baboon virus. The absence of these nucleic acid sequences in many tissues of patients with neoplasia and from the few tissues examined from people with nonneoplastic disease suggests that they are not endogenous elements but are acquired after fertilization. Taken together with the previous detection of baboon and woolly monkey type-C viral related components in some human tumors, the results suggest acquisition of at least three types of type-C viral sequences in the human population.",PMC393258,,,,,,,,,

Complementary DNA was isolated which was specific for each part of the M-MSV genome. The DNA of a number of mammalian species was examined for the presence of nucleotide sequences homologous with the two M-MSV regions. Both sets of viral sequences had homologous nucleotide sequences present in normal mouse cellular DNA. MSV-specific sequences found in mouse cellular DNA closely matched those nucleotide sequences found in M-MSV as seen by comparisons of thermal denaturation profiles. In all normal mouse cells tested, the cellular set of M-MSV-specific nucleotide sequences was present in DNA as one to a few copies per cell. The rate of base substitution of M-MSV nucleotide sequences was compared with the rate of evolution of both unique sequences and the hemoglobin gene of various species. Conservation of MSV-specific nucleotide sequences among species was similar to that of mouse globin gene(s) and greater than that of average unique cellular sequences. In contrast, cellular nucleotide sequences that are homologous to the M-MSV-murine leukemia virus ""common"" nucleotide region were present in multiple copies in mouse cells and were less well matched, as seen by reduced melting profiles of the hybrids. The cellular common nucleotide sequences diverged very rapidly during evolution, with a base substitution rate similar to that reported for some primate and avian endogenous virogenes. The observation that two sets of covalently linked viral sequences evolved at very different rates suggests that the origin of M-MSV may be different from endogenous helper viruses and that cellular sequences homologous to MSV-specific nucleotide sequences may be important to survival.",PMC353801,,,,,,,,,

However, previous data of increased viral RNA levels did not distinguish between an increased rate of viral-specific RNA synthesis and a slower rate of viral RNA degradation. According to the recently developed assay of Coffin et al. (1974) for measuring rates of viral RNA synthesis, short-term labeling experiments of a mouse mammary tumor cell line indicate that the glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone stimulates a 3-fold increase in the synthesis of MMTV-specific RNA within 10 min after the addition of hormone and that stimulation of RNA synthesis reaches 5- to 10-fold within 30 to 60 min, while the synthesis of Moloney leukemia virus-specific RNA in the same cell is unaffected by steroids. The decay rates of pulse-labeled and accumulated MMTV RNA in the presence or absence of dexamethasone show this RNA to have a half-life of greater than 8 h. In addition, hormone-stimulated MMTV RNA appears to have an increased rate of decay compared to basal MMTV RNA, thus ruling out an increased stability of MMTV RNA in the presence of steroid hormones as the basis for increased RNA levels. Thus, the magnitude, rapidity, and specificity of hormone action on MMTV RNA synthesis indicate a primary effect upon transcription.",PMC353799,,,,,,,,,

The immunogenicity of intact X-irradiated L1210 cells was distinguishable from that of VSV-infected cell homogenates on the basis of the susceptibility of immunogenicity to experimental procedures used in preparation of the immunogenic homogenates: Homogenization of intact X-irradiated cells or their infection with VSV prior to irradiation led to loss of immunogenicity. In addition, uninfected cell homogenates were not made immunogenic nor was the immunogenicity of VSV-infected cell homogenates eliminated by X-irradiation. At the time of tumor challenge, sera from mice that were effectively immunized with VSV-infected cell homogenate showed a high VSV-neutralizing titer but no complement-dependent cytotoxicity for L1210 cells. Quantitative absorption studies demonstrated that VSV infection led to a marked reduction in L1210 surface antigens recognized by cytotoxic alloantibody; spatial association between these antigens and VSV antigens was not demonstrable on VSV-infected cells.

Bredinin inhibited nucleic acid synthesis of L5178Y cells, but bredinin itself was not incorporated into the nucleic acid. Inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis was clearly reversed by GMP. Similarly chromosomal aberrations in L5178Y cells caused by bredinin were reversed by GMP. In contrast, the effect of ahigh concentration of bredinin on cell multiplication was not reversed by GMP. The modal volume of L5178Y cells increased during incubation in the presence of bredinin and GMP for 24 hours, 5 X 10(-5) M bredinin with GMP causing a 70% increase in cell volume. This increase in cell volume was mainly due to an increase in the protein content of the cells. The cytostatic effect of bredinin with GMP was reversed completely by adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Other cyclic nucleotides and nucleotides were ineffective. The reversing effect of cyclic AMP on cell survival depended upon the concentration of GMP, and was not seen in the absence of GMP.

The tests employed included the detection of FeLV using fixed-cell immunofluorescence and the detection and titration of antibody to : (1) the feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA), as detected by membrane immunofluorescence; (2) viable FeLV, using serum neutralization; (3) virion core protein p30, using radioimmunoprecipitation; and (4) virion glycoprotein gp70, using radioimmunoprecipitation. All of the tracers had evidence of horizontal infection by FeLV, by several criteria. Seven of the 10 had virus that could be isolated from plasma. All of these 7 developed a terminal illness within 18 months; 3 developed aplastic anemia, 3 infectious peritonitis, and 1 lymphoma. The remaining 3 were negative for FeLV by both virus isolation and fixed-cell immunofluorescence. These 3 did, however, develop high antibody titers by all four criteria and they remained healthy throughout the examination period.

The viral DNA appears to be synthesized as double-stranded molecules of approximately 6 X 10(6) daltons some of which are converted into supercoiled cricles perhaps as a requisite for integration. The endogenous v-DNA in normal chicken cells and both the endogenous and amv v-DNA in leukemic chicken myeloblasts are covalently linked with chromosomal DNA. There is no detectable free DNA either circular or linear present in leukemic cells several weeks after infection. The endogenous v-DNA which is transmitted vertically from parents to offspring is uniformly and stably distributed in all chicken organs. There are about 1-2 copies of endogenous provirus per haploid genome of all normal cells. This DNA is very closely related to RAV-O RNA. After infection with AMV it seems that target cells such as leukemic myeloblasts, RBC and nephroblasts acquire complete copies of AMV DNA. Interestingly, only these target cells can be converted to neoplastic cells in the chicken as well as in vitro. The target cells acquire 1-2 copies of AMV specific DNA per haploid genome in addition to the endogenous v-DNA. All the available evidence shows that leukemic and kidney tumor cells have acquired AMV v-DNA. It remains to be elucidated whether the newly added viral DNA is alone responsible for neoplastic changes or does so in conjunction with endogenous viral information.",,,,,,,,,,

Not only the more primitive BFU-E shows hormone-independency (18). This phenomenon is in favour of the view that the Rauscher virus induced erythroblastosis is a true neoplasia although transplantation experiments failed so far. The experiments in which transformation in vitro of B.M. cells by RLV is established (19) show that the CFU-E can serve as a target for the virus. Treatment of normal mice with CFA leads to a rapid increase in CFU-E in the bone marrow (18). Splenomegaly of RLV-infected mice is enhanced by CFA-treatment probably due to an increase in targets. Transfection with proviral DNA also can transform the CFU-E of BALB-c mice. This approach allows in vitro studies on the resistence of mouse strains to RLV in vitro. The studies are of interest for the human disease in two aspects. In vitro transformation assays are needed to study the oncogenic potential of putative human leukemia viruses. Furthermore the studies have yielded some new insight in the pathogenesis of virally induced erythroblastosis. This might serve as a model for e.g. acute myeloid leukemia in man.",,,,,,,,,,

The enzyme activities were expressed in terms of the quantity of protein extracted and per 10(10) cells. Whereas the protein extracted and the enzyme activities from normal lymphocytes were relatively constant, considerable variation was noted in cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This variability in the properties of the leukemic cells suggests that the difference may be useful in the subclassification of the leukemias. The studies of the complete enzyme system were done with 300 million cells. The extraction of 350,000 normal lymphocytes/mul gave a soluble protein concentration of 1.46+/-0.16 mg protein per ml, and the yield from the same number of CLL lymphocytes varied between 0.72 and 8.32 mg protein per ml. The 5'-nucleotidase activity gave an inverse correlation with the amount of extractable protein. In individual cases of CLL, the protein concentrations and the 5'-nucleotidase activities were found on either side of the normal values. In most cases, the adenosine deaminase of CLL lymphocytic cell extracts was lower than normal, and the adenosine kinase was higher; in the CLL cells, these two enzymes gave a positive correlation with one another. Little or no difference was observed in the activities of the purine nucleoside phosphorylases in extracts of normal or leukemic lymphocytes and granulocytes. The hypoxanthine-guanine and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase activities increased in the leukemic granulocytes but almost always showed a decrease in the CLL lymphocytes when compared with the normal cells. Most of the leukemic cells had greater than normal activities of the enzymes synthesizing phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate when tested with the purines. The total nucleotide produced from adenine and guanine with adenine- and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase was about equal in normal and leukemic lymphocytes, but the proportion of the adenosine 5'-triphosphate in the product was much greater with the leukemic cells. This suggested that the ribosyltransferase activities were the same in both types of cells, but the nucleoside kinases and the nucleoside diphosphate kinases were more active in the leukemic cells. Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase was less active than normal in the CLL cell extracts and was not directly related to the amount of inosine monophosphate generated from hypoxanthine.",,,,,,,,,,

There is no increase of MuLV antigen or xenotropic virus in spleen or lymph nodes. Production of ecotropic MuLV remains unchanged with age in thymus, lymph nodes, and spleen. Thymic grafts from 6-month-old AKR mice, but not from 2-month-old mice, induce both amplified MuLV-antigen expression and xenotropic virus production in the thymus of young AKR recipients.

In experiment 1, IgG was given on the day of birth and on four additional days, and finished on day 14. This schedule resulted in suppression of over 4 logarithms of normal virogene expressions up to 25 days of age and led to partial viral suppression for over 200 days of age. At 365 days of age, 20 of 24 (83.3%) control animals were dead of leukemia whereas six of 30 (20%) treated animals had died of leukemia. In a second experiment, only four inoculations of IgG were given from birth to 20 days, after which they were given three inoculations of radiation-killed vaccine specific for AKR-Gross leukemia virus and one injection of murine sarcoma virus-Gross leukemia virus 10 days later. This combined immunization procedure provided significant virus suppression up to 288 days of age.

The occurrence of such additional malignant diseases was analysed in our five-years autopsy material. During this period 7670 autopsies were performed. Malignant diseases were observed in 1707 cases (22.1%) and among them in 58 cases were proved multiple primary malignant neoplasms (3.3%). The average time between the occurrence of initial and second tumors was 29 months. The frequency of second tumors in patients with leukemias (mainly chronic lymphocytic leukemia) were four times higher than in patients with tumors of epithelial origin. Hepatocarcinomas arose in cirrhotic livers and astrocytomas were often followed by new malignancies. In consequence of successfully applied surgical, radiological and combined immunosuppressive, antineoplastic therapy the survival of cancer patients lengthened, so among different side-effects of the used therapy the oncogenesis cannot be left out of account. The danger of subsequent malignant tumors makes it imperative that immunosuppression should only be applied when strictly indicated.",,,,,,,,,,

Of the backcross mice, 81% produced high titers of ecotropic MuLV; the remaining 19% did not contain detectable infectious MuLV. The virus-producing and non-virus-producing backcross mice were equally sensitive and highly susceptible to MCA-induced sarcomagenesis. Tumors of all virus-positive mice contained infectious MuLV. Some tumors (54%) of virus-negative mice also contained infectious MuLV; this indicated the induction of endogenous MuLV in the tumors of these mice. We concluded that the overt production of MuLV in mice of this backcross did not function in the sensitivity of the mice to sarcoma induction by MCA.

Multiple criteria were used to monitor the purity and yield of PM material after cell disruption by nitrogen cavitation and after membrane fractionation by a combination of differential centrifugation and isopyknic ultracentrifugation in dextran density gradients. Lactoperoxidase-catalyzed radioiodination before cell disruption was used as an extrinsic surface marker; Na+,K+-activated ATPase, as well as alkaline phosphatase, was used as intrinsic functional PM markers. The distribution of nuclei, mitochondria, lysosomes, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) during fractionation was monitored by the measurement of DNA, succinate dehydrogenase and monoamine oxidase, beta-glucuronidase and glucose-6-phosphatase, and NADH:lipoamide oxidoreductase, respectively.

Cell surface membrane proteins were radioiodinated and solubilized in nonionic detergent. Specific antisera were subsequently added and the immune complexes precipitated by addition of the staphylococcal adsorbent and low speed centrifugation. The antigens isolated included surface immunoglobulins from mouse and human lymphocytes, human beta-microglobulin and HL-A alloantigens, mouse H-2 alloantigens, and the murine leukemia virus glycoprotein gp 70. Rabbit, sheep, goat, and mouse antisera were all effective for the specific phase of the precipitation reaction. The surface membrane immunoglobulins of mouse splenic lymphocytes and human peripheral blood lymphocytes differed with respect to class composition and protein A reactivity. Mouse lymphocyte surface immunoglobulins were nonreactive with protein A, whereas a high proportion of human lymphocyte surface immunoglobulins of different classes bound directly to the staphylococci. In sequential immunoprecipitation studies the prior isolation of one antigen had no appreciable effect on the subsequent recovery of another antigen.

The time of appearance and distribution pattern of MLV infectivity in various tissues were examined by the XC plaque assay technique at fixed intervals during the leukemogenic treatment. In ENU- or BNU-treated mice, only a few samples of the thymus showed MLV infectivity with rather low titers during incubation period and the presence of MLV was not consistent even in leukemic cases though the thymus was almost invariably the target of leukemogenesis. On the other hand, many samples of the uterus, spleen, and mesenteric node from non-leukemic and leukemic mice harbored a good quantity of MLV. In tissues such as the liver, kidney, bone marrow, and muscle, positive cases occurred only sporadically.

We have found that H-2 alloantisera recognize components of molecular weight 70 000-80 000 mouse lymphocytes and leukemia cells. These components were also detected by a goat antiserum against the murine leukemia virus (MuLV) glycoprotein (gp 70) and are therefore closely related to or identical with that viral protein. Although most H-2 alloantisera detected gp 70-like molecules on lymphocytes and leukemia cells from a great variety of mouse strains, only one H-2 alloantiserum was found to interact with a gp 70 component on cells from C57BL/10 and C57BL/6 mice. Animals such as C57BL/10 mice that lacked the component reacting with most H-2 alloantisera showed increased serum levels of anti-MuLV antibodies after injection of B10.A spleen cells having a gp 70 component detectable by other H-2 alloantisera. In contrast, strains with cells reactive to antiviral antibodies in the H-2 alloantisera had low responses to MuLV antigens after a similar immunization procedure. Serum levels of anti-MuLV antibodies in both groups of mice, however, were increased after injection of Freund's adjuvant. These observations suggest that anti-MuLV antibodies in mouse alloantisera may arise from a response to viral antigens on the immunizing cells and general stimulation of the immune system.",,,,,,,,,,

As found earlier, the virus is defective for replication and transforms bone marrow cultures in vitro, and surprisingly, also chick embryo fibroblasts. Inoculation of transformed AEV cells negative for virus production into newborn chicks induced the formation of sarcomas only, whereas cells superinfected with helper virus induced the formation of erythroblastosis in addition to sarcomas. The helper virus alone caused neither sarcomas nor erythroblastosis during the experimental period. These findings were explained by the hypothesis that AEV-induced erythroblastosis develops more rapidly than do AEV-induced sarcomas and that animals receiving i.v. injections die of the leukemia before sarcomas become detectable. The observation that animals receiving i.m. injections of AEV developed sarcomas at the site of injection strongly supports this concept. Most of the animals that received i.m. injections also developed an erythroblastosis that was delayed, however, in comparison to the animals receiving i.v. injections.

The derivatives are a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) analog prepared by an exchange reaction with NAD in the presence of nicotineamide adenine dinucleotide glycohydrolase and a presumed aminothiadiazole mononucleotide prepared by treatment of the NAD analog with nucleotide pyrophosphatase. Both derivatives are potent inhibitors of inosine 5'-phosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase obtained from leukemia L1210 cells. The NAD analog is a pseudoir-reversible inhibitor of the enzyme, noncompetitive with either IMP or NAD. The aminothiadiazole mononucleotide has a K1 of about 0.1 muM, is competitive with IMP, and is uncompetitive with NAD: the inhibition appears to be reversible by Ackermann-Potter analysis. A metabolite of [5-14C]aminothiadiazole is formed in L1210 cells in vivo to a level of 0.3 nmole/10(9) cells. Retention volume of the metabolite on a high-pressure liquid chromatography system is the same as that of the aminothiadiazole mononucleotide prepared as described above. These results suggest that IMP dehydrogenase is the site of action for aminothiadiazole metabolites as was indicated by earlier observations. There is no evidence that the NAD analog is formed in vivo. Nicotinamide prevented formation of the mononucleotide in vivo. Therefore, since formation and cleavage of the NAD analog apparently are not the route to the thiadiazole nucleotide, some other pathway for the metabolism of nicotinamide may be involved such as the action of a phosphoribosyltransferase or the sequential action of a nucleoside phosphorylase and a nucleoside kinase.",,,,,,,,,,

However, the appearance of ultrastructurally abnormal blasts in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cultures suggests that NaIO4 also stimulates the transformation of an abnormal subpopulation of lymphocytes. Development of invaginated nuclei produced morphological features similar to nuclear blebs, a cellular abnormally described in blood cells from other cancers. Furthermore, the consistent localization of nuclear invagination only to portions of nuclei adjacent to developing cytoplasmic microtublar complexes suggests a role for microtubules in the transformation process. The absence of these unusual blasts in cultures stimulated with other mitogens may indicate that these NaIO4-sensitive cells are not responsive to the more commonly used plant lectins.",,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the activity of vesicle-entrapped ara-C against L1210 cells was also studied in vivo. The results obtained in vitro with ara-C indicated no difference in the concentration needed to inhibit growth of cells by 50% between free ara-C and vesicle-entrapped ara-C.

When correlated with histologic findings, the overall detection rate was 32.2 per cent for primary tumors, 53.3 per cent for metastatic tumors and 65.8 per cent for leukemia and lymphoma. Highest degree of accuracy in the primary tumor group was achieved with medulloblastoma (61.9 per cent). Among metastatic tumors, those originating in the lung (70 per cent) and breast (83 per cent) were the one most often detected. Comparison of the two filter techniques indicated a slightly higher detection rate when the Millipore filter was used. The reasons for this are not entirely clear, but increased cellular yield with the Millipore filter may be an important factor. The cytocentrifuge method was found to be generally inferior to either of the filter techniques in quality of cell preservation.

Two cell lines free of endogenous type C virus were examined and found to be highly tumorigenic in tumor growth kinetic studies. In vitro inoculation of these cell lines with Rauscher-murine leukemia virus (R-MuLV) resulted in their chronic infection in which 95 to 100% of the cells were scored as virus positive. These infected lines showed a highly significant increase in their immunogenicity as compared to their uninfected controls. Animals in which these virus-positive tumors regressed were then shown to be highly resistant to challenge with the uninfected tumor cell lines as well as to live R-MuLV. This observed resistance to uninfected tumor cell lines could not be induced by immunization of the mouse with uninfected tumor cells and R-MuLV simultaneously at the same injection site, nor could it be induced with lethally irradiated virus-infected tumor cells, subtumorigenic doses of uninfected cells, or inactivated R-MuLV or Gross leukemia virus (G-MuLV). Cell-mediated cytotoxicity studies revealed that spleen cells obtained from animals whose virus-infected tumors regressed were cytotoxic to homologous infected and uninfected tumor cells as well as to other uninfected tumor cell lines syngeneic to the BALB/c mouse. Correlation of in vitro cytotoxicity with in vivo immunity was provided by the Winn assay, by inoculation into susceptible mice of immune and nonimmune spleen cells premixed with uninfected tumor cells. The immune cells were highly effective in preventing this tumor cell transplantation. It was concluded that type-C virus infection of these syngeneic tumor cells resulted in their acquiring strong transplantation antigens that were in part due to the virion, but were at least in part due to alterations of antigens or haptens that are present in a less immunogenic form on the uninfected tumor cell.",,,,,,,,,,

FLV-infected, COAM-statolon-treated mice that have received silica and have failed to suppress FLV leukemia produced normal amounts of interferon, but did not make antibodies cytotoxic for FLV leukemic cells. Transfer of untreated spleen cells, splenic T cells, or thymocytes from mice with suppressed FLV erythroleukemia to FLV-infected mice treated with silica and COAM-statolon restores the humoral immune response to FLV antigens and results in leukemosuppression.

Antibody to FOCMA developed following FeLV infection and was expressed in heterologous species. In combination with an assay for antibody to FeLV p30, the major virion structural protein, 200 cats sera from three different geographic areas were examined for evidences of FeLV-type-C-virus infection. Approximately 17% of all sera examined contained antibody to FOCMA. Antibodies directed to the FeLV p30 were detected in 8 of the sera and only in cats with FOCMA antibody.

In order to purify the virus particles sucrose gradients were employed according to TANAKA et al. (1972) and in some details according to SMITH and WIVEL (1973). In immunofluorescence studies on mammary tumor slices a complete cross-reaction between antisera against A particles from mammary tumors and MTV-B particles from mouse milk was observed. Both kinds of antisera reacted in identical fluorescence pattern types with intracytoplasmic A particle clusters and with extracellular accumulations of B type virions, respectively, in tumors of different histological structures. RIP test studies suggest that these cross-reactions are attributed to three common antigens in A and B type viruses. Thus, there does not remain any doubt that intracytoplasmic A particles in murine mammary tumors are MTV-related. All these A particles antigens were identically detected using an antiserum against A particles isolated from mouse leukemia cells (serum kindly provided by Dr. TANAKA). The biological role of intracytoplasmic A particles in mouse tissues is discussed. In contrast to the precursor theory, it is believed that they could represent something like a nonsense way of particle maturation in MTV-infected cells.",,,,,,,,,,

This immune failure, which is very pronounced in treated leukemic patients and following transplantation, is on the contrary often localised at a precise level during common infections. Knowledge of these levels is thus essential for the clinician who, in all infected patients, should assess the state of the skin, mucosal and tissue and humoral defences whether specific or non-specific in the light of modern immunological data. Infection in the immunodepressed subject requires urget treatment. Antibiotics are not the only form of treatment, one should supervise, maintain and restore adequate immune levels.

The inhibition of cytolysis by F-Ado was potentiated markedly by an inhibiotr (Ro 20-1724) of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase and, unlike the inhibition caused by adenosine, was irreversible when the cytotoxic lymphocytes were incubated with F-Ado and were then washed free of exogenous nucleoside. Incubation of cytotoxic lymphocytes with F-Ado resulted in the rapid, dose-dependent formation of 2-fluoroadenosine 5'-triphosphate (F-ATP); the build-up of F-ATP within these cells was accompanied by a reciprocal depletion of ATP. Once formed intracellularly, the F-ATP was not diminished during a subsequent 30-min incubation of the cells in F-Ado-free medium. 2-Fluoroadenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (F-cAMP), a novel compound, was synthesized chemically. This cAMP analogue was found to be highly cross-reactive in a radioimmunoassay specific for cAMP and to be equipotent to cAMP in its ability to activate a crude preparation of protein kinase derived from rat brain. A column chromatographic procedure was devised whereby F-cAMP and cAMP could be purified simultaneously from tissue extracts. Treatment of cytotoxic lymphocytes with F-Ado resulted in the formation of presumptive F-cAMP in amounts greater than that of cAMP, as determined by the concentration of F-Ado added to the medium and was not observed when the lymphocytes were incubated with either adenosine or 2-chloroadenosine, two agents which caused large increases in cAMP. The simultaneous presence of Ro 20-1724 enhances greatly the formation of F-cAMP from F-Ado without affecting the pool size of F-ATP. Removal of exogenous F-Ado from cells previously incubated with this drug and subsequent incubation of these cells in drug-free medium did not result in a substantial reduction in intracellular F-Ado (via prior incubation with F-Ado); 2'-deoxyadenosine was also effective in this capacity, while 9-beta-D-arabinofulanosyladenine was without effect. The level of cAMP was elevated transiently, in a dose-dependent manner, by F-Ado, and returned to control value after removal of exogenous F-Ado from the cells. Ro 20-1724 enhanced greatly this transient elevation of cAMP caused by F-Ado.",,,,,,,,,,

Graffi virus-induced GiL-4 leukemia cells, Rauscher virus-induced RB1-5 leukemia cells, and MSV-induced MSV-B16 sarcoma cells were used as stimulating syngeneic tumor cells and/or target cells. Under appropriate culture conditions, cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) were generated in both primary and secondary MLTC. As assessed by a quantitative short-term 51Cr release assay system, CTL activity in secondary MLTC populations was at least 10-fold higher than that in primary MLTC populations, and 100-fold higher than that in spleen cells taken at the peak of the in vivo response of MSV-infected mice. The ability of spleen cells to mount a secondary CTL response in vitro could be observed as early as 5 days after virus injection, increased up to the time of maximum tumor size and persisted long after tumor regression.

On the basis of its sedimentation coefficient and known complexity, the 30S Mo-MSV RNA was estimated to be a unique RNA molecule of about 6000 nucleotides. Hybridization experiments using viral RNA and DNA complementary to viral RNA (cDNA) made by viral DNA polymerase indicated that the 30S Mo-MSV RNA shared 70% of its sequences with Mo-MLV, 30% with another MLV derived from Mo-MLV, and 30% with Kirsten sarcoma-xenotropic leukemia virus. The 30S Mo-MSV RNA sequences shared with these viruses were not additive. The Tm of a Mo-MSV RNA-MLV cDNA hybrid was 83 degrees C, indicating that large contiguous nucleotide sequences were shared between the two nucleic acids. Mo-MSV RNA and Mo-MLV RNA shared possibly seven of 20-30 RNAase T1-resistant oligonucleotides, while Mo-MSV RNA contained three, and Mo-MLV RNA contained at least five specific oligonucleotides. We conclude that the 30S Mo-MSV RNA molecule consists of approximately 70% (about 4200 nucleotides) Mo-MLV-specific sequences and of 30% (1800 nucleotides) Mo-MSV-specific sequences covalently linked. Our results favor the hypothesis that 30S Mo-MSV RNA was generated by recombination between Mo-MLV and other genetic elements. We discuss whether all or only the MSV-specific sequences of the 30S Mo-MSV RNA function as sarcoma genes. Mo-MLV cDNA was hybridized about 45% by unfractionated Mo-MSV (MLV) RNA at RNA/DNA ratios of up to 10, about 50% by electrophoretically purified 30S Mo-MSV RNA at RNA/DNA ratios up to 500, but close to 100% by unfractionated Mo-MSV(MLV) RNA at RNA/DNA ratios over 900. This indicated that unfractionated RNA of our Mo-MSV(MLV) contained a complete complement of Mo-MLV, albeit at a low ratio.",,,,,,,,,,

In cells producing murine leukemia virus, budding viruses and other areas of the cell surface were consistently labeled with gp71 antiserum. A gp52-like antigen was likewise detected on both cell surfaces and virions of C3H and DBA cells producing the mammary tumor virus. Budding virions with surface spikes but with crescent-shaped nucleoids in C3H/HeJ cells were labeled specifically with gp52 antiserum. The antigen localized with anti-gp52 serum was detected in low concentration on the surface of nonvirus-producing cultures of a C57BL/6 sarcoma induced by the Schmidt-Ruppin D strain of Rous avian sarcoma virus (SRD-2), a BALB/c bone marrow culture (JLS-V9), and a normal BALB/c fibroblast culture (BALB/cF).

Expression of gp52 antigen in the absence of gp71 was not detected in any of the cultures examined.

Particular attention was paid to cross-reactivity between gp55 and the other targets. The data indicate that responsiveness to C3H-MuMTV and RIII milk are linearly correlated with responsiveness to gp55. A preferential relationship was demonstrable between responses to gp55 and to those breast cancer tissues containing a gp55-like protein component (S-p50). The critical role of a gp55-like protein as the antigen responded to by breast cancer patients' in leukocytes was also suggested by the ability of anti-gp55 antiserum to decrease leukocyte responsiveness to RIII-gp55, C3H-MuMTV, and breast cancer tissues. In vitro cellular hypersensitivity against RIII-gp55 was preferentially found in prognostically favorable cases with immunogenic lesions. Further studies are needed to test the possibility that gp55 might be of value in the immunodiagnosis of early breast cancer, the monitoring of prognostically significant cellular hypersensitivity, and the induction of such hypersensitivity (immunoprophylaxis).",,,,,,,,,,

Two of these lines, infected with BAI strain A virus, liberate only small quantities of virus in the culture fluid. The cells retain the ability to induce myeloblastic leukemia when inoculated i.v. into 1- to 2-day-old chicks, but do so less efficiently than freshly obtained myeloblasts. These cells do not appear to be transplantable, since the disease produced is characterized by the presence of myeloblasts that liberate large quantities of virus. The other two cell lines, infected with the MC29 strain of avian leukosis virus, liberate normal levels of infectious virus in the culture fluid. When these cells are inoculated into the wing web of 1- to 2-day-old chicks, tumors develop at the site of inoculation which are detectable as early as 4 to 7 days after challenge. Chromosome studies demonstrate that the four cell lines have karyotypes typical of Gallus domesticus. The myeloblastic cell lines (D.U. 11157 and D.U. 1765) show a reduction in the number of microchromosomes.

Intermediate forms from Rous sarcoma virus or murine leukemia virus were isolated after heating of vRNA's at 58 degrees C and sedimenting in sucrose gradients, and at least four intermediates could be identified in each case. Melting of feline virus (RD-114) RNA produced one major intermediate which required a comparatively high temperature to denature, and a second intermediate occurring in conditions of low ionic strength.

Replication of HSV-2 was suboptimal in random-bred Swiss/3T3A cells and, in initial experiments, infection with a low virus-to-cell ratio resulted in carrier cultures with enhanced murine leukemia virus (MuLV) p30 expression. Immunofluorescence tests with Swiss/3T3A cells productively infected with HSV-2 also showed HSV-associated cytoplasmic antigens and enhanced MuLV p30 expression when compared with uninfected controls. Inactivation of HSV-2 with UV light did not abolish this reaction, although the number of cells expressing p30 was reduced. HSV-2 replicated more efficiently in a line of NIH Swiss cells (N c1 A c1 10). These cells are not readily inducible for type C expression by conventional methods; however, untreated and UV-inactivated HSV-2 induced both HSV-2-associated antigens and MuLV p30 in these cells.

Sedimentation velocity measurements indicated that the labels caused unwinding of calf thymus DNA. Those acridines which contained both 6-chloro and 2-methoxy substituents were less toxic to leukemia L1210 in static culture than the corresponding unsubstituted analogues. While the unsubstituted aminoacridines were quite good inhibitors of Escherichia coli DNA-primed RNA polymerase, the 6-chloro-2-methoxy-substituted compounds stimulated this enzyme system. In the presence of E.coliDNA, the ESR spectrum of 4-[(6-chloro-2-methoxy-9-acridinyl)amino]-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxyl (12) became broad and highly asymmteric with a maximal hyperfine splitting of 57.5 G. This observation suggests that when 12 intercalates into DNA the piperidinyl moiety that bears the nitroxide group becomes highly immobilized. These results suggest that the spin-labeled 9-aminoacridines will be useful probes for nucleic acids.",,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that the number of binding sites for Robinia and Con A decreases after the establishment of a leukaemic cell line, whereas the affinity constant increases for Robinia. The relationship between lectin binding and cell growth was carried out on 5 cell lines, 3 of leukaemic and 2 of normal origin. In all cases the maximum number of sites was determined at the time of doubling for the cell population; the affinity constant reciprocally decreases at this moment. For Robinia, a difference was found in both cell growth and the number of sites between an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) negative leukaemic cell line and the other EBV positive cell lines.

From this point of view the heterogeneity of tumors of the RES was studied to reveal the following results. Tumors of the ""Reticuloendothel"" (Aschoff) reveal pictures of endothelioma, while tumors of histiocytes in connective tissue show findings of fibrohistiocytoma. Histiocytes and reticulum cells of lymph nodes are respectively independent cells, and reticulum cells do not partake in the in the development of histiocytosis or histiocytic sarcoma. Follicular lymphoma is a neoplastic growth of reticulum cells having desmosomes in lymph follicles, and tumor cells of the majority of reticulum cell sarcoma are similar to the cells forming the lymph node anlage in the early fetal stage (lymphoreticular cell). Ewing's sarcoma is considered to be a kind of angiopericytoma.",,,22,,,,,,,

In the prototype GIX+ mouse strain 129, this glycoprotein is a Mendelian character expressed independently of virus production. In the intact thymocyte plasma membrane, part of this glycoprotein, bearing group-specific (gs) antigen, is inaccessible to antibody. The moiety bearing the type-specific GIX determinant is accessible to GIX antibody, which may be an important factor in determining the consequences of autoimmune responses involving GIX. Previously, all attempts to induce GIX antibody in mice had failed. We now find that the hybrid mouse (B6-GIX+ X 129) spontaneously produces substantial amounts of GIX antibody, presumably of the IgM class appearing as early as 2 mo of age. The specificity of the GIX natural mouse antibody is the same as that recognized by the conventional GIX typing serum produced in rats (""anti-NTD""). As neither parent strain produces appreciable GIX antibody, we surmise that this autoimmune response requires two dominant genes, each parent contributing a high-response allele to the hybrid. These can be envisaged as two immune response loci, controlling different immunocompetent cells which must cooperate to produce GIX antibody. Production of GIX antibody by the hybrids increases progressively with age. This is accompanied by decreased expression of GIX antigen on their thymocytes. We attribute this to antigenic modulation. Antibody to gs antigen of gp70 is also found in autoimmune (B6-GIX+ X 129) hybrids but not in either parent strain. We are investigating evidence of a pathological autoimmune syndrome in these hybrids.

This inhibition was specific for gp71 as demonstrated by the inability of xenogeneic antisera to other viral glycoproteins or structural proteins to inhibit and by the ability of purified antigens to block specifically the inhibitory effect. The ability of antisera to gp71 to inhibit LPS responses, however, is highly dependent on the strain and age of mouse spleen cells used and appears correlated with the expression of endogenous viruses. Moreover, the preferential inhibition of LPS responses suggests that this expression may be predominately B cell specific. The results suggest that the inhibitory effect is mediated via antibody binding to lymphocytes and that expression of viral envelope antigens on the cell surface which bind immunoglobulins can block or interfere with the binding or uptake of mitogens. A variety of natural mouse immune sera and ""tumor"" sera, having antibodies directed against gp71, can similarly inhibit mitogen responses; and this inhibition can be specifically blocked with MuLV or gp71.",,,,,,,,,,

Application of the principles and methods described makes accurate estimation of the percentage of each IC type present in neoplasms possible for the first time. Compared to purely mechanical means of disaggregating tumors, all enzyme mixtures tested markedly increased yields of viable cells/g neoplasm. Best results were obtained with a combination of collagenase and a protease of broader substrate range (alpha chymotrypsin, papain, pronase or trypsin). The combination of enzymes that gave the highest yields with the least effect on inflammatory cell markers was trypsin, collagenase and DNAse (TCD). Because mechanical injury appeared to be the greatest single cause of cell loss (the enzymes themselves had little direct effect), potential sources were identified and either eliminated or minimized. With TCD, depending on the tumor system, cell recovery (measured as DNA recovered in cell suspensions) was as high as 50% and yields were as much as 6.9 X 10(8) viable cells/g tumor. Complete disaggregation was not required to obtain representative IC populations from tumor fragments. Neutrophils, eosinophils and mast cells from disaggregated neoplasms were counted in Giemsa stained cytocentrifuge preparations based on their unique morphologic appearances. Macrophages were identified by their capacity to phagocytose zymosan, a function which proved highly resistant to the effect of enzymes. Flourescent microscopic identification of brain associated thymus antigen (BATA) allowed quantification of T lymphocytes, since this marker was virtually unchanged by enzyme exposure. Surface immunoglobulin (Ig) was stripped from B lymphocytes most rapidly by pronase and chymotrypsin, slowly by trypsin and papain, and not at all by collagenase. Ig positive cells therefore could be quantified in suspensions generated by collagenase or very short (20 min) exposure of fragments to trypsin.",,,,,,,,,,

Spleen cells for normal, non-infected donors were placed into diffusion chambers (constructed with 0.22 mum por size Millipore filters) which were then implanted into the peritoneal cavities of normal syngeneic recipient mice. The cells were infected with an injection of MuLV-F into the peritoneal cavity and, in some instances, also by placing virus into the chambers. Cells were recovered by treating the chamber content with elastase and collagenase. The infection was determined in two ways: (1) cells with replicating MuLV were enumerated as infection centers (IC) on S+L- indicator cells; and (2) virus-related cell membrane antigen (MA) was detected by immunofluorescence. Cells recovered from chambers after 2-3 weeks of culture represented about 10% of the original inoculum; viability was approximately 90%. The number of IC in MuLV-F-infected chambers was about 10 times higher than obtained by infection and cultivation of spleen cells in vitro. The kinetics of IC and MA in chamber-cultured. MuLV-F-infected spleen cells was similar to that in the spleen of infected mice during the first 10 days after infection. Later on, the process of infection within the chambers slowed down, reaching about 50% MA-positive and about 10% IC-positive cells, whereas the number of both IC- and MA-positive cells in the spleen reached 80% or more. The infection of splenic lymphocytes in diffusion chambers occurred equally well when chambers were implanted into: (1) syngeneic, virus susceptible hosts; (2) syngeneic, lethally irradiated hosts; and (3) allogeneic, virus-resistant hosts, suggesting that the process within the chamber is independent of MuLV replication in the tissues of the chamber-bearing mouse. The diffusion chamber technique seems to provide an environment in which various types of isolated lymphocytes of different mouse strains can interact with MuLV almost as efficiently as in vivo.",,,,,,,,,,

The destruction of neoplastic cells by cytostatic agents depends on the existence of metabolic reactions within the cells which can be specifically blocked by these agents. Concerning the action of purine antagonists there is, as yet, no clear evidence whether de novo synthesis of purines takes place in normal as well as in leukemic leukocytes. Therefore studies were performed to evaluate the capacity of these cells to incorporate the purine precursor, glycine, into their acid-soluble adenine nucleotides. The results demonstrate that ""resting"" human lymphocytes are not capable of building purines de novo. However, stimulation of the cells with a mitogen (Phytohemagglutinin) leads to the induction of de novo purine synthesis. Leukemic cells do not show uniform behaviour. In order to get more information about the mechanisms by which synthesis of purines as well as the morphologic transformation of lymphocytes may be induced, the metabolism of cyclic AMP was investigated. According to our results the nucleotide does not play an essential role in initiating the transformation process, but it seems to have regulating function in the further development of cell transformation. The studies furthermore indicate an important role of cyclic AMP during proliferation of leukemic cells.",,Gezielte Chemotherapie neoplastischer Erkrankungen.

Firstly, their tumour resistance is not due to the lack of the lymphomaprone AKR cells. Secondly, results showing titres of MuLV-gs antigen comparable with, and occasionally in excess of, those in the AKR suggest that the tumour resistance of the chimaeras is unlikely to be due to a lack of oncogenic leukaemia virus. However, in marked contrast to the AKR, antibody-viral antigen renal complexes in the chimaeras were minimal. Lack of viral antigens could not explain the relative lack of renal complexes. Absence of the corresponding anti-viral antibody is the most likely explanation and this has to be attributed to the CBA component of the tetraparental AKR reversible CBA/H-T6 chimaeras.

Two sera also reacted with C57BL/6 mouse leukemia induced by Friend virus. These results were obtained by indirect immunoelectron microscopy with various virus-producing cells and by absorption tests using as targets gibbon lymphosarcoma cells that release gibbon ape leukemia virus. In a previous report, the presence of natural antibody in sera from healthy gibbon apes was demonstrated. When the specificities of the human and gibbon natural antibodies were compared, the human natural antibody reacted with two nonproducing culture cell lines of human lymphocytic leukemia (CEM-A and MOLT) and with human embryonic diploid (CIH-1(V-) cells [which became type C virus-producing CIH-32(V+) cells after many passages], but did not react with normal gibbon spleen monolayer cells. In contrast, gibbon natural antibody showed no reaction with CEM-A, MOLT, and CIH-1(V-) cells but reacted with gibbon spleen monolayer cells. Neither human nor gibbon natural antibody that was reactive with gibbon ape leukemia virus crossreacted with feline leukemia virus and mouse wild-type AKR leukemia virus. The gibbon lymphosarcoma cells releasing gibbon ape leukemia virus were used in a screening study of sera from healthy humans. Out of 72 sera screened by indirect immunoelectron microscopy using this system, 55 were positive (76%), i.e., 26 out of 35 males (74%) and 29 out of 37 females (78%).

Red cell auto-antibodies (positive Coombs tests) were detected, on average, 11 months later in the F1 hybrids than in the parental strain, and the course of the disease was protracted. In explicably, the auto-immune reactions then appeared progressively earlier in successive generations of both croses. The Coombs reactions of the F1 and F2 hybrids were often weak and inconsistent, while those of F3 offspring showed the strong and stable picture typical of NZB mice. The incidence of auto-immune disease in each generation, although similar in the reciprocal crosses, indicated that the pattern of inheritance was very complex. The hybrids did not develop the lymphoid type B reticulum cell neoplasia which characterizes auto-immune NZB mice. Instead, and irrespective of Coombs status, they had lymphocytic leukaemias, lung adenomas, hepatomas and type A reticulum cell neoplasms of the liver. Murine leukaemia virus was identified electronmicroscopically in F1 embryos, and in all the adults examined. It was also isolated from leukaemic spleen cells passaged briefly in vivo, and from malignant hepatic (reticulum) cells maintained in vitro. These isolated were leukaemogenic in newborn BALB/c, NZB, and F1 hybrid recipients, but did not induce or accelerate positive Coombs reactions. Only a small proportion of the hybrids had significant glomerulonephritis, and overt kidney disease was minimal. The lesions were not confined to Coombs-positive mice. Possible links between auto-immunity, malignancy, and virus infection in NZB mice are discussed in the light of these results.",PMC1538487,,,,,,,,,

The progeny MuLV from such a mixed infection are sensitive to Fv-1 restriction in both N- and B-type cells, but are still highly infectious for mouse cells which do not exhibit Fv-1 restriction. This dual sensitivity to Fv-1 restriction is a phenotypic property of MuLV produced by mixedly infected cells, since individual virus clones derived from this MuLV are either N- or B-tropic. In further experiments, we superinfected murine sarcoma virus (MSV)-transformed cells with mixtures of N- and B-tropic MuLVs. The rescued MSV is restricted in its ability to transforms both N- and B-type cells. The results suggest that N- and B-tropic MuLVs specify different determinants, which are incorporated into virions along with the viral genome and which are the recognition sites for Fv-1 restriction. The presence of a given determinant in a virion renders the virus sensitive to restriction in cells of the opposite Fv-1 type.",,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, three NZB murine lymphoid cell lines obtained from NZB mice free of hematopoietic neoplasm can grow as well in cystine-deficient media containing L-cystathionine (CSN), the immediate precursor of CYS in the biosynthetic pathway, as in cystine sufficient medium. The former class of cells is, therefore, CYS auxotrophs (CYS-) and the latter CYS prototrophs (CYS+). Compared to CYS+ cells, the CYS- lines appear to be relatively deficient in the enzyme cystathionase, which catalyzes the cleavage of CSN to CYS and alpha-ketobutyrate. Using protein synthetic capacity as a criterion, normal thymocytes from mixed-bred Swiss mice behave like CYS prototrophs, while those from littermates bearing Moloney type C virus-induced thymic tumors behave like CYS auxotrophs. The former are also characterized by substantially higher levels of cystathionase than the latter. Extracts of thymocytes from tumor-free AKR mouse thymus are also characterized by higher levels of cystathionase activity than extracts of spontaneous AKR thymomas. Exogenous in vitro type C virus infection of a CYS+ cell results in vigorous virus production but no concomitant reduction in cystathionase activity. Thus viral replication alone in any random lymphoid cell is not sufficient to alter the enzyme level. The data therefore suggests that CYS auxotrophy may closely accompany neoplastic transformation of certain hematopoietic cells in vivo, including that induced by certain ""thymic"" type C viruses.",,,,,,,,,,

Using purified 32P-labeled RNA and 125I-labeled p12 protein, complexes that are stabilized by formaldehyde-cross-linking can be readily detected after velocity gradient centrifugation. The in vitro reconstructed ribonucleoprotein complexes are seen only with p12 proteins incubated with viral RNAs isolated from the same type C viruses; no such complexes form with heterologous protein-RNA mixtures. Homologous but not heterologous p12 molecules compete with radiolabeled p12 protein for the specific viral RNA binding sites. The competition assay permits the detection of 10 ng of viral p12 protein. The major internal protein of type C viruses (p30) does not bind to viral RNA using identical assay conditions. From the specific activities of the radiolabeled components and also by equilibrium sedimentation analysis, we estimate that fewer than 15 molecules of p12 protein bind to each molecule of viral RNA. Both the specificity and stoichiometry of the p12-RNA interactions suggest that these RNA tumor virus proteins have a regulatory role in cells.",,,,,,,,,,

However, increased mesangial cells and matrix have also been found in some patients with hematuria and progressive renal failure.

Three of these patients were in complete remission of the blood and were only undergoing courses of reinduction. The 4th was in incomplete remission.

This GIX-gp70 molecule is found on the thymocytes of some (GIX+) strains of mice, where its expression is controlled by two mendelian genes, Gv-1 and Gv-2. Previous recombination data involving the prototype GIX+ strain 129 indicated that the H-2 (chromosome 17) and Gv-1 loci are linked, at a distance of 36 units from one another. New data indicate that the association of H-2 and GIX phenotypes is an example of quasi-linkage, evidently dependent in this instance on heterozygosity at a locus or loci in the vicinity of H-2. Other previous recombination data, involving the GIX+ strain AKR, had indicated that the Gpd-1 (chromosome 4) and Gv-1 loci are linked at a distance of 19 units from one another. New data from other crosses show that this association of Gpd-1 (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 1) and GIX phenotypes also constitutes quasi-linkage, evidently due to heterozygosity at the Fv-1 locus. An important theoretical consequence of quasi-linkage in general is that it should enhance the heritability of particular constellations of unlinked genes, and so influence population structure. Our new data are discussed from the viewpoint that MuLV genomes are apparently concerned in quasi-linkage, and therefore by the same arguments may influence the genetic structure of populations. This in turn may strengthen the view that integrated MuLV genomes are not simply intruded into a self-sufficient cellular genome, but are themselves elements of the cellular genome with primary functions, perhaps in reproduction or embryogenesis.",PMC430452,,,,,,,,,

Environmental carcinogens could hypothetically increase the rates at which these mutations occur, but they probably, in fact, contribute little to the incidences. Certain exceptions, notably leukemia and lymphoma, are noteworthy, and a viral origin for them has been widely hypothesized. If most solid tumors of childhood are indeed correctly attributable to mutations in germ and/or somatic cells, then the prospect for the prevention of childhood cancer becomes very dim. In fact, the incidence of the germinal forms may increase as treatment improves (18). In theory, one might be able to identify individuals harboring cancer genes germinally and even to identify them prenatally. But even if the burden of cancer attributable to the hereditary subgroups were elimanted, there would still remain the larger nonhereditary group resulting from somatic mutations. If this hypothesis is correct, then childhood cancer cannot be prevented. With this conclusion goes the admonition, however, that environmental mutagens might significantly increase the burden of childhood cancer. One such mutagen, therapeutic radiation, is known to increase the prospect that second tumors will occur in patients who carry a germinal cancer mutation. The major effort to reduce the incidence of childhood cancer by prevention should be spent in examining the possibility that leukemia and lymphoma are viral in origin. If the arguments presented are correct, then the main effort against childhood cancer must be that of early diagnosis and treatment. I realize that many have already argued for that strategy in the approach to cancer generally, but I now believe that it is particularly relevant to any program against cancer in children.",,,31,,,,,,,

The number of released particles, as determined by direct electron microscopic enumeration, was reduced to a lesser extent. In contrast, interferon failed to affect the number of budding particles and caused a slight increase in the number of completed particles present in the microspace contiguous to the cell membranes. A working hypothesis is that, in the presence of interferon, C-type particle assembly and release are slowed but not arrested; sizable numbers of particles continue to be assembled and released. Some of these particles may be defective in one or more proteins, such as reverse transcriptase or proteins necessary for final release. These in vitro data justify speculation that, in vivo, interferon may be expected to reduce tissue damage due to antigen-antibody complex formation, but not damage due to sytolytic immune attack on cells carrying the antigens.",,,,,,,,,,

Lung tumour frequency (tumours/lung) was significantly higher in mice treated with urethane when young (21 days old) and adult (63 days old) than in those treated in utero (Days 11-19 of gestation). When relative sensitivity of a lung cell was calculated as the ratio of average number of tumours per lung per mg of lung at the time of treatment, however, a lung cell of the foetus was more sensitive to urethane than that of the young and adult. Hepatomata were induced significantly only when male foetuses and neonates were exposed to urethane. The offspring exposed to urethane on Days 11-16, however, developed hepatomata in lower incidence than those exposed on Days 14-19, whereas the previous investigation by the author revealed that Days 11-13 correspond to the stage most sensitive to hepatocarcinogenesis. This contradiction was due to the occurrence of testicular hypogenesis (chemical castration) in all offspring of the former group. Differentiating female gonad and rapidly proliferating blood vessels of the placenta and deciduum were also sensitive to tumour induction by urethane. Thus, high tumour susceptibility of rapidly proliferating and undifferentiated cells suggests that some initiating events in the process of carcinogenesis may occur during or after DNA replication. Leukaemia induction in the young mice, but not in the foetus, remains to be elucidated.",PMC2024959,,,,,,,,,

XC plaque and infectious center assays carried out with N- and B-tropic viruses on both SIM (Fv-1nn) and SIM.R(Fv-1bb) host cells yielded results that were best approximated by Poisson one-hit curves. Titration curves of N-tropic virus by direct XC plaque assay were linear and parallel on the different hosts, with titers 1.8 to 2.7 log10 lower on SIM.R and on (SIM X SIM.R)F1 than on SIM cells; similar linear and parallel curves were found for B-tropic virus, with titers 1.4 to 2.0 log10 lower on SIM and (SIM XSIM-R)F1 than on SIM-R cells. In the infectious center assays, the proportion of infected cells was linearly related to multiplicity of infection on both permissive (N- on SIM and B- on SIM.R) restrictive (B- on SIM and N- on SIM.R) genotypes at multiplicities of infection below 0.5; the line relating the variables was about 1 log10 lower in the restrictive than in the permissive situations. At multiplicities of infection where the proportion of infected cells reached a plateau, differences between the results on permissive and restrictive genotypes were considerably reduced. This appeared to be due to the action of non-Fv-1 factors in permissive host.

One of 18 animals developed a hepatoma, but none of the mice given CCl4 in 0.1 ml of 50% oliver oil subcutaneously at the right thigh developed hepatoma. However, a marked enhancement of hepatoma induction was observed in mice injected with CCl4 one day before the single intragastric administration of BNU, with 12 out of 28 mice developing one or more hepatomas (average 3.2/mouse) ranging in diameter from 0.5 to 1.5 cm. By extending the administration interval between CCl4 and BNU to 1 week or 1 month, or by reversing the order of administration, the hepatotumorigenic action was virtually lost. There was no occurrence of hepatoma but a predominant development of leukemia, of either thymic or nonthymic origin, was observed in mice of younger age treated with CCl4 one day before continuous oral administration of BNU (1 mg/day/mouse). It is thus concluded that the preparative (cocarcinogenic) action of CCl4 is indispensable for hepatotumorigenesis with a single large dose of BNU.",,,,,,,,,,

All the tumor cells examined showed mitochondrial reoxidation of cytoplasmic NADH, as evidenced by the accumulation of pyruvate when the cells were incubated aerobically with L-lactate. Reoxidation of cytoplasmic NADH thus generated was completely inhibited by the transaminase inhibitor aminooxyacetate. The involvement of the respiratory chain in the reoxidation of cytoplasmic NADH was demonstrated by the action of cyanide, rotenone, and antimycin A, which strongly inhibited the formation of pyruvate from added L-lactate. Compounds that inhibit the carrier-mediated entry of malate into mitochondria, such as butylmalonate, benzenetricarboxylate, and iodobenzylmalonate, also inhibited the accumulation of pyruvate from added L-lactate by the tumor cells. The maximal rate of the malate-aspartate shuttle was established by addtion of arsenite to inhibit the mitochondrial oxidation of the pyruvate formed from added lactate. The capacity of the various tumor lines for the reoxidation of cytoplasmic NADH via the malate-aspartate shuttle approaches 20% of the total respiratory rate of the cells and thus appears to be sufficient to account for the mitochondrial reoxidation of that fraction of glycolytic NADH not reoxidized by pyruvate and lactate dehydrognenase in the cytoplasm.",,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow from either leukemic or mammary tumor-bearing mice produces more clones in vitro in the presence of a specific colony-stimulating factor. However, in all cases, the myeloid progenitor cells have similar requirements for the colony-stimulating factor. The optimum condition for growth in all instances is 7% fetal calf serum + 7% horse serum + 7% tryptose phosphate broth. Decrease in the concentration of these three constituents has a less drastic effect on in vitro proliferation of bone marrow cells from leukemic mice. Some cells from Soule virus-induced leukemias even grew in the absence of serum. The combination of suboptimal amounts of serum and colony-stimulating factor is used as a tool for detecting cells with altered growth characteristics in bone marrow of leukemic mice. During the progression of the leukemia, there is an increase in the amount of transformed colony-forming cells per 5 X 10(4) bone marrow cells. The increase is already noticeable 4 weeks after inoculation, when no clinical signs of the leukemia are present, and reaches a maximum of about 20%.",,,,,,,,,,

This was shown when the same filtrates were tested in parallel by the XC and O tests and opposite results were obtained on the two assays, e.g., XC+ 0- or XC- O+.

When lymphomas originally virus induced were passaged by cells in 2- to 3-month-old syngeneic AKR or C3H mice, oncogenic activity of filtrates of these transplanted lymphomas decreased as cell passages increased. These filtrates from C3H lymphomas also had decreased XC activity as cell passages increased. Normal lymphoid tissue from 1- to 5-month-old AKR mice was XC+ O-, while from C3H mice it was XC- O-.

Routine karyological analysis of clones isolated at each stage of serum selection revealed that treatment with either serum resulted in a limited loss of chromosomes (compared to the untreated hybrid cell cultured in parallel) and that the pattern of chromosome loss could not be correlated with the particular antiserum used for selection. However, more detailed analysis with the SSC-formamide C-banding technique, which identifies chromosomes containing a mouse centromere region, demonstrated that while large-scale chromosome loss was not achieved as a result of antiserum selection, the limited loss of chromosomes did, in fact, reflect a specific depletion of chromosomes in response to treatment with cytotoxic antiserum. Specific chromosomal elimination was shown to occur as early as the first round of antiserum treatment. Antigenic analysis of the serum-selected clones revealed a quantitative decrease in the expression of the species-specific surface antigens selected against, but no qualitative loss of antigens was detected. The results suggest that treatment with cytotoxic antiserum may select for clones that have lost specific chromosomes bearing genes regulating the expression of species-specific surface antigens, rather than for those demonstrating large-scale depletion of chromosomes bearing the corresponding structural genes. Some of these chromosomally depleted hybrid cell clones have been used (along with pseudotype viruses containing the genome of vesicular stomatitis virus within the envelope of murine leukemia virus, VSV [MuLV]), to study the mechanisms regulating MuLV replication in Chinese hamster cells. The results indicate that the restriction of MuLV replication in Chinese hamster cells operates at two levels: (a) an inability to adsorb to or penetrate Chinese hamster cells; and (b) an additional intracellular block which is dominant in the mouse-Chinese hamster hybrid cell clones examined. This latter block is presently under study.",,,,,,,,,,

Testing of the tissue extracts was carried out by homologous and heterologous assay systems using 125I-labeled murine (Friend) and feline (Rickard) p30 antigens and anti-feline and anti-murine p30 antisera. The homologous assays were designed to detect the presence of p30 antigens in the human tissue extracts having similar characteristics to the p30 antigens of either the feline or murine type C viruses. The heterologous assay system was designed to detect interspecies antigenic determinants common to murine and feline viruses and also primate viruses. A competing antigen present in 28 per cent of the tissue extracts assayed demonstrated an antigenic protein that competed with the viral p30 protein used in the heterologous radioimmunoassay system and to a lesser extent in the homologous feline radioimmunoassay system. Antigenic competitor proteins were found in tumor and non-tumor tissue. These data suggest that some human urothelial tissues contain at least part of the genome of 1 or more type C viruses. Those tissues that are positive only in the heterologous assay system behave like viral p30 antigens already identified in tissues of several other primates. Those tissues that are positive in the heterologous assay system and the homologous system indicate that the p30 antigenic activity is closely related to that p30 present in feline C-type viruses. Further purification and more detailed characterization of those competing proteins are now under study.",,,,,,,,,,

Using rate zonal centrifugation we confirmed that the eluates from AKR/J glomeruli contained antibody(s) that bound specifically to p30. These results indicate that AKR/J mice spontaneously mount immune responses against the major oncornavirus polypeptide antigens.",PMC515536,,,,,,,,,

The results demonostrate that this humoral immune response is primarily directed against the AKR strain of murine leukemia virus (MuLV) proteins gp71, gp43, and p15(E). These sera also react with Friend- or Rauscher-MuLV in radioimmune precipitation assays. This reaction is not due to a separate immune response, but rather is primarily a consequence of the cross-reactivity of antibodies to the AKR strain of MuLV p15(E) with the p15(E) of these viruses. These data, using autogenous immune sera, emphasize the serological differences of the virion glycoproteins and the serological similarity of the p15(E) virion component of the viruses.

The laser beat frequency light-scattering spectroscopy measurements yield the light-scattering intensity, weighted diffusion coefficients. The corresponding average hydrodynamic diameters, as calculated from the diffusion coefficients by the Stokes-Einstein equation for MuMTV, RSV, and FeLV, respectively, are: 144 +/- 6 nm, 147 +/- 7 nm, and 168 +/- 6 nm. Portions of the purified RSV and MuMTV preparations, from which light-scattering samples were obtained, and portions of the actual FeLV light-scattering samples were examined by negatively stained, catalase crystal-calibrated electron microscopy. The light-scattering intensity weighted averages of the electron micrograph size distributions were calculated by weighing each size by its theoretical relative scattering intensity, as obtained from published tables computed according to the Mie scattering theory. These averages and the experimentally observed hydrodynamic diameters agreed to within +/- 5%, which is the combined experimental error in the electron microscopic and light-scattering techniques. We conclude that the size distributions of singlet particles observed in the electron micrographs are statistically true representations of the sedimentation-purified solution size distributions. The sedimentation coefficients (S20, w) for MuMTV, RSV, and FeLV, respectively, are: 595 +/- 29S, 689 +/- 35S, and 880 +/- 44S. Virus partial specific volumes were taken as the reciprocals of the buoyant densities, determined in sucrose density gradients. The Svedberg equation was used to calculate particle weights from the measured diffusion and sedimentation coefficients.

Syncytia were not observed in diploid embryonic lung cells inoculated with bovine buffy coat cells free of BLV. The syncytia-induction effect is associated with the synthesis of complete BLV by the buffy coat cells and is independent of whether these cells are viable, disrupted, normal, or malignant. Cell-free preparations of BLV and density gradient-purified virus also induce syncytia when added directly to diploid embryonic lung cells and to bovine, bat, and caprine monolayer cell cultures. Ether treatment, ultraviolet light irradiation, heating, freezing, and thawing destroy the syncytia-inducing activity of BLV. This activity is also neutralized when the virus is incubated with sera containing antibodies to BLV, but not when incubated with sera free of these antibodies or reference serum for the foamy-like bovine syncytial virus. Several other lines of evidence rule out the possibility that this virus or other bovine viruses are responsible for the syncytia-inducing phenomenon described here. BLV antigen was consistently detected by the immunofluorescent test in the syncytia-positive monolayer indicator cultures.

More than 50 additional B-cell lymphomas and more than 40 biopsies from patients with Hodgkin's disease did not contain detectable amounts of EBV-DNA when tested by nucleic acid hybridization. A tentative scheme of EBV-induced pathogenesis is discussed.",,,,,,,,,,

This includes the findings of C-type virus or its antigen expressions in every naturally occurring tumor of two strains of ""low-incidence"" laboratory mice, the BALB/cCr mouse and the NIH Swiss mouse. Vaccine preparation methods are described including the inactivation of C-type virus infectivity with optimal maintenance of the antigen titers of at least two of the polypeptides of the C-type virus, gp69/71 and p30. The cell-mediated immune response of the mouse to C-type virus vaccines, as measured by a footpad assay for delayed-type hypersensitivity and an in vitro lymphocyte transformation assay, is described. Studies with two murine C-type viruses (Rauscher leukemia and Gross leukemia) a simian C-type virus, and an avian C-type virus (avian myeloblastosis virus) showed that the cell-mediated immune response of the animal includes type-specific, group-specific, and interspecies-specific reactivity. The mouse gave a cell-mediated immune response to at least one of the polypeptides of the C-type virus, the gp69/71, whether this polypeptide was presented to the immune system of the mouse as whole virus, Tween-ether-treated virus, or a purified polypeptide. One measure of the effectiveness of the C-type virus vaccines was provided by immunization of the mouse with Rauscher leukemia virus preparation that induced resistance to challenge with both live Rauscher leukemia virus and a naturally occurring BALB/c leukemia virus. Evidence is presented that the C-type virus can act as an effective transplantation antigen in syngeneic tumor cell lines resulting in the immunogenicity and loss of tumorigenicity of these cell lines. An approach to the viral immunoprevention of spontaneously occurring tumors is discussed.",,,,,,,,,,

In Friend leukemia, Friend virus induces permanent differentiation of erythropoietin-responsive cells. This erythropoietic proliferation and maturation is accompanied by a marked cell loss and provokes enlargement of the stem cell compartment. The so-called leukemic cells have a limited proliferation capacity and may not be truly malignant as opposed to blastic cells in acute leukemias. Clinical, hematological, and physiopathological data that are presently available in chronic granulocytic leukemia, polycythemia vera, and the erythroblastic component of erythroleukemia are compatible with the Friend physiopathological model. It is suggested that these differentiated leukemias initiate from an uncontrolled differentiation of a committed cell compartment, which stimulates proliferation of the stem cell compartment. The disease would be due to a proliferation and accumulation of ""subnormal"" cells characterized by a shorter mean life-span than the normal differentiated cell population. Although limited, the data available suggest that the physiopathology of acute leukemias is clearly distinguishable from that of differentiated leukemias; several immunological and therapeutic applications of this model are outlined.",,,,,,,,,,

The observed clustering of cases of feline lymphosarcoma suggested that FeLV was an infectious agent for cats. The development of a simple immunofluorescent test for FeLV permitted a seroepidemiological study to be undertaken on the distribution of the virus in cats living in their natural environment. Over 2000 cats were tested, and the results showed conclusively that FeLV is an infectious agent for cats. This finding has now been independently confirmed using three different test procedures. After the infectious nature of FeLV was discovered, a simple FeLV test and removal program was devised to control the spread of the virus in the natural environment. The spread of FeLV was controlled in 45 households by removing the FeLV-infected cats, while in 25 households, where the infected cats were left in contact with the uninfected cats, 12% of the uninfected cats became infected. The ultimate control of FeLV awaits the development of an effective FeLV vaccine, which now seems feasible since we have already experimentally immunized some cats with attenuated FeLV. Although FeLV is infectious for cats there is no evidence that FeLV can infect humans.",,,,,,,,,,

Nearly all chicken flocks are infected with Subgroup A lymphoid leukosis virus. This virus can be transmitted from dam to offspring or by contact with infected birds. Early infection, either by congential means, or soon after hatching, leads to the highest incidence of lymphoid leukosis. Maternal antibody or genetic resistance to infection delays or prevents infection, leading to a lower incidence of disease. In flocks segregating for genetic resistance to infection, continued infection is maintained through dynamic interactions between genetic resistance, acquired or maternal antibody ,and virus infection.

As a result of virological studies, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA has been demonstrated in almost all tested biopsies of African BL. This contrasts to the absence of EBV in all, or almost all, of the non-African Burkitt's lymphoma-like tumors, even though the number of tested tumors in this group is small, and to the lack of EBV in all other types of lymphoma or leukemia. Immunological studies have revealed the presence of antibodies to different EBV-associated antigens in all African patients with Burkitt's lymphoma. However the antibodies are not specific for Burkitt's lymphoma but are found in most adults all over the world, although at lower levels. They cannot therefore serve diagnostic purposes, but they can give prognostic information and occasionally give clues to the mechanisms behind late tumor recurrences, and possibly guide so-called immunotherapy. Burkitt's lymphoma patients contrast to appropriate control groups where some of the persons are anti-EBV seronegative, and this, together with the presence of EBV in Burkitt's lymphoma biopsies and the absence of EBV in other lymphomas, even though the cell type involved may be infectable by EBV in vitro and the tumor may arise in an EBV-carrying person, favors an etiological role in EBV in Burkitt's lymphoma and speaks against the ""passenger"" hypothesis, according to which EBV is picked up by the Burkitt's lymphoma cell which happens to be particularly suitable for EBV persistence. To explain the geographical distribution, a cofactor, such as certain forms of malaria, has been implied.",,,,,,,,,,

Eighteen patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in remission, and nine children with solid tumours were studied on 80 occasions at different time intervals after their last VCR dose. A mildly elevated threshold for epinephrine-induced second phase aggregation and a delay in the onset of collagen-induced aggregation was found in patients with ALL not on VCR. Vincristine induced unobtainable second phase aggregation to epinephrine in 67%, 38%, 30% and to ADP in 53%, 13%, 33% of the patients 1 week, 2-3 weeks and 4 weeks respectively after administration. The thrombocytopathy was relative, not absolute, since collagen induced aggregation at all times. Platelet counts, uptake and release of serotonin, bleeding times, clot retractions and release of platelet factor 3 were normal. Platelet adhesion was abnormal in five of 12 patients tested. In vitro platelets are a hundred-fold less sensitive to VCR than in vivo. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cyclic guanosine monophosphate and dimethylsulfoxide do not protect platelets from VCR. The exact mechanism by which VCR abolishes second phase aggregation in patients is uncertain. Because of VCR's narrow therapeutic index between thrombocytopenia and thrombocythaemia, the use of VCR should be reserved for life-threatening haematologic disorders when treating non-malignant conditions.",,,,,,,,,,

Infected mice of most strains developed immunologic diseases, including antinuclear antibody and glomerulonephritis, but not Coombs' antibodies. The nature and severity of the immunologic disease varied considerably, depending upon the genetic character of the host.

The risk is all the greater when the neutropenia is more marked and more lasting. The infections have a different distribution from that commonly observed in normal subjects. There is little inflammatory reaction, no pus formation and bacterial multiplication invades the parenchyma and may create necrosis due to arteriolar obstruction. The prognosis is very bad. For example, pulmonary infections in acute leukemia of adults, have a mortality greater than 75%. Antibiotic treatment and leukocyte transfusions give disappointing results. The prevention of infections has permitted spectacular progress. Nevertheless, the long-term prognosis is not linked to the infection itself, but to the sub-jacent disease responsible for the agranulocytosis. The infections become cured in transient toxic aplasia and in leukemia where chemotherapy permits one to obtain a remission. The infections remain fatal whatever the treatment used if the medullary aplasia is not curable.",,Infections des agranulocytoses et leur traitement,,,,,,,,

The way in which the clone-forming cell evolves in vivo towards granulopoiesis, depends on a genetic factor, phenomena of derepression and an extrinsic factor, the origin of which is probably cellular. Differentiation of the hemocytoblast leads to a cell, the destiny of which is then fixed, which may then form clones in vitro in semi-solid medium (clone-forming cell in vitro or CFC). This cell is definitely a true entity. A humoral factor of macrophage origin intervenes to ensure granulopoiesis in vivo (clone-stimulating factor CSF3.

There were reduced amounts of mono- and disialogangliosides, GM1 and GD1a, and activity of the specific galactosyltransferase required for synthesis of these gangliosides was reduced to between 0 and 18.5% of normal in the several K-Balb clones examined. When fucose-labeled glycopeptides derived from the surfaces of Balb/3T3 and K-Balb cells were compared by gel filtration chromatography, the glycopeptides from the transformed cells were enriched in earlier eluting components. These differences were also observed when the glycopeptides were derived from the entire cell and were diminished when the surface or cellular glycopeptides from Balb/3T3 and K-Balb were digested with neuraminidase prior to chromatographic analysis. Changes in these membrane sialoglycolipids and sialoglycopeptides were not influenced by Rauscher leukemia virus infection. In marked contrast, these changes in membrane glycoconjugates were not observed in Wooley monkey sarcoma virus (WSV) transformed Balb/3T3 cells (W-Balb). Although W-Balb cells like K-Balb were transformed by tissue culture criteria, their ganglioside composition, galactosyltransferase activity, and glycopeptide patterns were similar to normal Balb/3T3. These findings have potential implications concerning the role of these complex carbohydrates in the phenotypic alterations of transformed cells.",,,,,,,,,,

The avian viruses tested were Rous associated virus (RAV)-3, avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV), RAV-60, RAV-61, and B-77 sarcoma virus. Hybridization of 3H-labeled 35S AMV RNA with DNA from normal chicken cells was inhibited by unlabeled 35S RAV-0 RNA as effeciently (100%) as by unlabeled AMV RNA. Hybridization between 3H-labeled 35S AMV RNA and DNA from leukemic chicken myeloblasts induced by AMV was suppressed 100 and 68% by unlabeled 35S RNA from AMV and RAV-0, respectively. Hybridization between 3H-labeled RAV-0 and leukemic chicken myeloblast DNA was inhibited 100 and 67% by unlabeled 35S RNA from RAV-0 and AMV, respectively. It appears therefore that the AMV and RAV-0 genomes are 67 to 70% homologous and that AMV hybridizes to RAV-0 like sequences in normal chicken DNA. Hybridization between AMV RNA and leukemic chicken DNA was inhibited 40% by RNA from RAV-60 or RAV-61 and 50% by B-77 RNA. Hybridization between RAV-0 RNA and leukemic chicken DNA was inhibited 80% by RAV-60 or RAV-61 and 70% by B-77 RNA. Hybridization between 3H-labeled 35S RNA from RAV-60 or RAV-61 and leukemic chicken myeloblast DNA was reduced equally by RNA from RAV-60, RAV-61, AMV or RAV-0; this suggests that RNA from RAV-60 and RAV-61 hybridizes with virus-specific sequences in leukemic DNA which are shared by AMV, RAV-0, RAV-60, and RAV-61 RNA'S. Hybridization between 3H-labeled 35S RNA from RAV-61 and normal pheasant DNA was inhibited 100% by homologous viral RNA, 22 TO 26% BY RNA from AMV or RAV-0, and 30 to 33% by RNA from RAV-60 or B-77. Nearly complete inhibition of hybricization between RAV-0 RNA and leukemic chicken DNA by a mixture of AMV and B-77 35S RNAs indicates that the RNA sequences shared by B-77 virus and RAV-0. It appears that different avian RNA tumor virus genomes have from 50 to 80% homology in nucleotide sequences and that the degree of hybridization between normal chicken cell DNA and a given viral RNA can be predicted from the homology that exists between the viral RNA tested and RAV-0 RNA.",PMC515393,,,,,,,,,

A twofold increase in Synder-Theilen feline sarcoma virus (ST-FeSV) on feline embryo cells decreased by approximately twofold the titer of reference goat serum prepared against Kawakami-Theilen feline leukemia virus. Similar dose effects with FeLV serotype virus preparations were not observed. An assay system utilizing FeLV serotypes on sarcoma-positive leukemia-negative cells demonstrated slightly greater sensitivity than one employing ST-FeSV on FE cells. Differential antibody responses to the three subgroup-specific feline oncornaviruses (A, B ,and C) were observed in reference goat sera.

The enhancement was apparent also as a 3-fold increase in the number of cells producing MSV (infectious centers) in the co-cultivation plate. This suggested that the MSV genome rescue efficiency in terms of MSV per cell, as well as the number of cells producing MSV, increased markedly. By uridine-3H-labeling and focus assay experiments, evidence was presented which suggested that an increase in MSV/MuLV ratio in the culture fluid of co-cultivation plates was obtained when the MuLV-carrier cells were pre-irradiated. By contrast, X-irradiation of the nonproducer cells prior to co-cultivation caused only reductions of MSV genome rescue efficiency. However, use of X-irradiated MuLV-carrier cells for co-cultivation with X-irradiated nonproducer cells restored this efficiency to some extent. The dose-survival curve of the nonproducer cells was not much different from those of the MuLV-carrier cells after X-irradiation. It was suggested that the viability of nonproducer cells was required for replication of MuLV transferred from the carrier cells and for subsequent MSV genome rescue.",,,,,,,,,,

Direct effector-target cell contact was necessary for lysis to occur. The cytotoxicity of autologously stimulated (AS) lymphocytes was not restricted to EBV-genome-positive LCLs, nor to cell lines of hematopoietic origin. It was equally broad if cells carrying complement receptor had been removed before stimulation. Fresh lymphocytes, blasts induced by phytohemagglutinin or concanavalin A, and Burkitt's lymphoma biopsy cells were resistant or considerably less sensitive.

At 37 degrees C this hormone-receptor complex enters the nucleus and associates with the chromatin. The association with chromatin occurs not only in the corticosteroid-sensitive rat thymocytes and mouse tumors P288 and P1798S but also in the corticosteroid-resistant mouse tumors L1210 and P1798R. An apparent correlation, although not absolute, exists between the content of glucocorticoid-binding macromolecule and the sensitivity of the lymphocytes studied to the lytic effect of glucocorticoids; the sensitive cells having more receptor than the resistant cells. The process of lysis is attributed to the release from the much larger stores of triglyceride in thymus and sensitive lymphoma cells, of a large pool of FFA which causes focal damage to the nuclear membrane resulting in karyorrhexis and, subsequently, to cytolysis. Resistance is attributed to the capacity for preventing the accumulation of greater than about 0.5 fmole FFA/cell. Resistant cells induced to accumulate greater amounts, even for a few minutes, ultimately undergo lysis. Most effective in accomplishing this are branched chain fatty acids of C-8 and higher, which block FFA metabolism, causing accumulation which results in cytolysis.",,,,,,,,,,

This population was selected because strains AKR and C57L are both Fv-1n, and the restriction which the Fu-1b allele imposes on the output of virus was thereby obviated. The segregants were scored for three characters: (a) infectious Gross-AKR-type MuLV (V), in the tail; (b) group-specific antigen indicative of p30 internal viral protein, in spleen; and (c) GIX antigen, now thought to be indicative of gp69/71 viral envelope glycoprotein, on thymocytes. Our conclusions are: (a) It is confirmed that the AKR mouse has two unlinked chromosomal genes, Akv-1 and Akv-2, each of which can independently give rise to the life-long high output of MuLV that is characteristic of AKR mice. (b) Of the eight phenotypes that could possibly be derived from segregation of the three pairs of independent alternative traits, seven were observed, but on progeny testing only three were shown to reflect stably heritable genotypes; these were V+p30+GIX+ and V-p30-GIX- (the parental types) and V-p30+GIX+. A third, newly identified AKR gene, designated Akvp, segregating independently of Akv-1 and Akv-2, also determines expression of p30 and GIX but in this case independently of XC-detectable MuLV. (c) The four remaining observed phenotypes, which did not breed true on progeny testing, involved mostly antigen-negative parents yielding antigen-positive progeny; it is likely that these discrepancies represented suppression of phenotype by a maternal resistance factor.",PMC2190095,,,,,,,,,

Absolute increments were greater in blast cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and with acute myeloblastic leukemia than in lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but per cent increments did not differ. Time-related increases appear to be restricted to an active mechanism for AIB entry and could not be attributed to cell damage, concomitant alterations in the incubation media, or progressive reduction in transinhibition of AIB entry. Studies with two cell populations revealed these increases to be associated with an augmented Vmax and a reduction in apparent Km, suggesting enhanced capacity and affinity of the transport system for AIB. Time-related increases failed to develop in two chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) lymphocyte populations and were partially reduced in two leukemic blast cell populations during continuous exposure to high extracellular AIB concentrations. Hence, this phenomenon may represent an adaptive response to environmental amino acid deprivation. Adaptation may involve de novo protein and RNA synthesis, since it was not seen in cells which were treated with cycloheximide or actinomycin D. However, unlike previous observations in nonmalignant cells, once triggered, the adaptive response was not completely suppressed in leukemic cells which underwent a large degree of adaptation.",,,,,,,,,,

Studies in the presence of varying concentrations of Mg2+ showed that the method provided valid molecular weights for RNAs of differing amounts of ordered structure.

In contrast, virus was not found despite extensive examination in antibody negative animals. Thus, the presence of IF antibody is an accurate indicator of current rather than past BLV infection. In order for the IF test to be specific it is of critical importance that the target cells used are infected only with BLV. BLV antibodies can also be detected by the immunoprecipitation (Ouchterlony) technique. However, a significant proportion of BLV infected animals showing positive reactions in the IF test failed to show precipitin antibodies to the virus.

H+/2e- and Ca2+/2e- ratios were in normal limits for the lymphoblast mitochondria during calcium uptake in the presence of phosphate. In the absence of phosphate no calcium uptake, H+ ejection, or stimulation of oxygen consumption was observed. However, the lack of discharge of the accumulated calcium from the lymphoblast mitochondria upon inhibition of respiration suggests possible different mechanisms of cation transport compared to mitochondria from normal, mammalian cell types.

Sequential sections were analyzed for virus-specific cytoplasmic antigen expression, for morphological evidence of neoplastic transformation, and for alkaline phosphatase activity.

Cytochemical studies of phagocytosis with the electron miscroscope have shown that the degranulation of primary granules (MPO+ or MPO-) was normal after phagocytosis of Escherichia coli which were normally lysed. A defective destruction of Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans was observed in some PMN with or without MPO activity, suggesting that MPO deficiency itself was not the only cause of this defect. In PMN which appeared normal, most MPO(+) granules were unable to fuse with the phagocytic vacuole containing intact germs even after 90 min of contact. There was, therefore, in addition to a partial MPO deficiency, a defect in cellular degranulation. This defect, the mechanism of which is unknown, may be in part responsible for the defective bacterial degradation.",,,,,,,,,,

Light microscopic examination showed 36% of the polymorphonuclear leucocytes to be totally devoid of myeloperoxidase, while 50% were normally stained and 14% were slightly positive for this enzyme. Electron microscopic studies revealed considerable heterogeneity in the promyelocyte population, since the number of peroxidase-deficient azurophil granules was seen to vary from 0 to 100% in these cells. Thus, several types of promyelocytes were identified. One cell type, which resembled that seen in normal subjects, contained myeloperoxidase within its azurophil granules and also within the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. A second type of promyelocyte, which was at an early stage of development, lacked myeloperoxidase in its secretory apparatus. These cells contained two species of azurophil granules, the first of which was devoid of peroxidase activity whereas the other reacted positively. These observations suggest that the premature arrest of myeloperoxidase synthesis in the promyelocytes from a preleukaemic patient may give rise to several populations of circulating neutrophils which can exhibit varying contents of myeloperoxidase.",,,,,,,,,,

A diminished bactericidal activity against E. coli was found in nine CGL cases. The bactericidal capacity closely correlated with the degree of leucocytosis since patients with a WBC count of 90 000/mul or higher with one exception showed decreased bactericidal activities while patients with WBC counts below 90 000/mul with two exceptions showed normal bactericidal activities.

The data for granulocyte iodination did not correlate with WBC count, bactericidal capacity or [I-14C]glucose oxidation. The time course for the bactericidal activity and granulocyte iodination seemed to deviate from the controls indicating a slow initial ingestion and/or degranulation phase.

Inhibition of growth of tumor cells in culture was prevented by uridine and cytidine and was partially alleviated by deoxycytidine, but not by deoxyuridine or thymidine. DeazaUR inhibited nucleic acid synthesis but not protein synthesis in tumor cells in culture; deoxycytidine alleviated inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis. The labeling of pyrimidine ribonucleotides by 6-14C-orotic acid was inhbited by deazaUR. DeazaUR treatment of tumor cells in culture resulted in increased uptake of cytidine-3H into RNA, whereas uridine-3H uptake into RNA was inhibited. Labelling of DNA by uridine-3H/ and cytidine-H was inhibited by deazaUR. Pools of CMP, CDP, and CTP decreased markedly during deazaUR treatment of L1210 cells in culture and in vivo. These observations in growing cells pointed to deazaUR inhibition of the synthesis of cytidylic acid. Deazauridine 5'-triphosphate was found to be an inhibitor of the synthesis of CTP from UTP catalyzed by enzyme preparations from L1210 cells. This observation is in agreement with those of McPartland et al.19 that deazaUTP inhibited CTP synthetase purified from calf liver. Deazauridine treatment of L1210 cells in culture stimulated the uptake of deoxycytidine-3H into DNA while inhibiting the uptake of 3H-labeled deoxyuridine, thymidine, deoxyadenosine, and deoxyguanosine. Intracellular pools of dCTP were decreased by deazauridine treatment in L1210 cells in culture and in vivo. Deazauridine 5'-diphosphate inhibited the enzymatic reduction of pyrimidine ribonucleoside 5'-diphosphates to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides.

This activity was first detected 7 days after MuSV was injected; it peaked at 14 days, and was usually no longer detectable after 18-21 days. It could be detected at effector cell/target cell ratios between 20:1 and 5:1, at which normal spleen cells had a growth-promoting effect. The effector cells in the GIA were not T cells, and various depletion experiments suggested that they were macrophages. Macrophages of a purity of over 95% were obtained in the glass-adherent fraction of thioglycollate-induced peritoneal exudate cells (PEC). PEC were growth inhibitory when obtained from either normal or MuSV tumor-bearing mice. However, at effector cell/target ratios of 2.5:1, only PEC from MuSV tumor-bearing mice had an effect; PEC from normal mice were inactive. Activity of spleen cells in the GIA appeared distinct from T-cell-dependent specific cytotoxicity, which was not affected by removal of macrophages. Activity in the GIA was nonspecific, and target cells which do not cross-react with RBL-5 cells were equally inhibited. Furthermore, spleen cells from mice bearing primary tumors induced by 3-methylcholanthrene were also fully active against RBL-5 cells. Supernatants from spleen cell cultures obtained from mice 14 days post injection with MuSV also inhibited the incorporation of 3H-TDR by RBL-5 cells in vitro. However, this effect seemed to be an artifact, since the tumor cells proliferated equally well in the presence or absence of the supernatants. In contrast, the direct effect of spleen cells from MuSV tumor-bearing mice was reflected both by an inhibition of cell proliferation and by inhibition of 3H-TDR incorporation.",,,,,,,,,,

Murine xenotropic helper virus (MuX) and its pseudo-type of Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MSV(MuX)) were grown in cat cells to high titre. MuX alone did not replicate in any mouse cell tested including normal or transformed outbred Swis 3T3 cells or SC-I cells, but did grow in a variety of other mammalian cells. MSV(MuX) was not able to achieve that intracellular state from which it could be rescued by mouse leukaemia virus (MuLV) in any mouse cell tested with the exception of SC-I cells. Detection of MSV(MuX) foci with appropriate helper virus was as sensitive in SC-I cells as in the cells of several other species. Sequential passage of MSV(MuX) virus complex in SC=I cells resulted in a loss of infectious sarcoma and helper viruses, but transformed, MSV rescuable cells were retained. If cat embryo cells were infected with either the feline endogenous xenotropic virus (FeX) or its MSV pseudotype (MSV(FeX), two analogous states of restriction were observed. FeX alone did not replicate in cat cells as measured by release of progeny virus or by FeX group-specific antigen induction. Cat cells could be susceptible or insusceptible to the entry of MSV(FeX) as measured by MSV rescue with appropriate ecotropic feline leukaemia virus. The sensitivity of detection of MSV(FeX) foci in some cat cells in the presence of feline ecotropic virus was comparable to that exhibited by cells of other mammalian species. A single strain of cat cells underwent a change in its restrictive capacity for MSV(FeX) on prolonged passage. Late passage cat cells became very insusceptible to MSV(FeX) but not to other pseudotypes of MSV. Infectious FeX or its group-specific antigens were not detected in the insusceptible cells. The major glycoprotein of FeX did appear as a surface antigen of the insusceptibel cells. It is apparent that two levels of cellular restriction can be distinguished in each of two mammalian cell systems by the susceptibility to penetration of MSV coated with endogenous xenotropic oncornavirus.",,,,,,,,,,

Of particular interest was the fact that antigens of myeloid leukemia, but not of lymphatic leukemia, were detected on lymphoid cell lines established from blood of patients with myeloid leukemia. One of four lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from normal donors expressed antigens of lymphatic leukemia. Leukemia-associated antigens were not found on the HRIK lymphoblastoid line derived from a Burkitt's lymphoma patient on skin fibroblasts or HeLa cells.

Absorption experiments demonstrated that the antigens detected on cell lines derived from leukemia patients are similar to those detected by the primate and rabbit antisera on fresh peripheral blood leukemic cells.

The XC cells had been transformed by the Prague strain of Rous sarcoma virus but did not produce infectious virus. The molecular weight of the DNA polymerase is 70,000, as estimated by glycerol gradient centrifugation and by Sephadex gel filtration. This enzyme can be distinguished from the other cellular DNA polymerases by its elution pattern on DNA-cellulose column chromatography, its molecular weight, and its primer-template specificity. The enzyme has some characteristics of the murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. It is partially inhibited by immunoglobulin G purified from rabbit antiserum prepared against Rauscher leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, but is not inhibited by IgG from rat antiserum prepared against avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase.

The isoelectric points of MuLV and AMV are apparently less than pH 3, whereas for FeLV the data could be interpreted to indicate an isoelectric point between 3 and 5.

The use of immunological methods in studying the epidemiology of the disease is described. The incidence of FeLV infection as judged by a serological survey is at least 100 times greater than that of leukaemia in the cat population. Horizontal transmission, due to virus replication in respiratory and alimentary epithelial cells, is common. A method of producing high titres of antibody against membrane antigens of virus infected cells is described; the use of such vaccination is discussed in relation to several epidemiological facets of feline leukaemia virus infection. Leukaemia viruses are well known to cause immunodepression to heterologous antigens. The hypothesis is advanced that depression of the humoral antibody response to leukaemia virus antigens and cell membrane antigens may be an early event allowing establishment and replication of virus in haemic and the lymphatic tissues. Subsequent depression of cell mediated immunity through direct action of thymic cells is known to take place in the cat system. This may allow further spread of the virus with replication in epithelial cells which are not susceptible to cytotoxic action. Thus the primary events leading to leukaemogenesis may be an interplay between immunostimulation and immunodepression.",PMC2149587,,,,,,,,,

Its presence is best detected by measuring its ability to rescue a murine sarcoma virus (MSV) genome from a non-virus-producing MSV-transformed rat cell. The virus can serve as a helper for replication of MSV. It has a distinct type-specific coat and is a prototype for a third serotype of mouse type C viruses, NZB. The xenotropic virus may have an evolutionary role since it has a wide host range, including the ability to infect avian cells. It is produced spontaneously by all cells cultivated from NZB tissues and accounts for the high concentration of viral antigens associated with NZB tissues. The extent of virus production is similar in both male and female mice. All cell clones established from embryos also produce the virus. A variability in the intracellular regulation of virus replication is suggested since tissue cells from the same animal differ quantitatively in their ability to produce xenotropic viruses. Since enhanced spontaneous virus production is associated with cells from NZB mice, the virus may play a role in the autoimmune disease of this mouse strain.",PMC354744,,,,,,,,,

This cell line produces virions which contain structural proteins common to edogenous hamster viruses and nucleic acid sequences of hamster, mouse, and rat origin. The sedimentation characteristics of the intracellular virus-specific RNA was determined in sucrose gradients after treatment with dimethylsulfoxide by molecular hybridization using complementary DNA of strict virus specificity. Hamster virus-specific RNA sedimented at 35S (major peak) as is characteristic of productive infection by type C leukemia viruses of other species. Rat virus-specific RNA sedimented at 30S which is characteristic of the sarcoma virus-related genome found in nonproducer cells transformed by Kirsten sarcoma virus. Both Harvey and Kirsten sarcoma viruses contain a related but not necessarily identical 30S rat-specific component which is also found in normal cultured rat cells. Mouse cells producing Harvey sarcoma virus also contain a rat-specific 30S RNA. Mouse virus-derived sequences also sedimented at 30S in B-34 cells and in a similar size range in Harvey virus-infected mouse cells. The possibility that the mouse and rat-derived sequences are present on a single 30S RNA species which would then be related to sarcomagenic potential is one attractive hypothesis suggested by these data.",PMC354742,,,,,,,,,

All the tissues from normal chickens which were tested contained the same average cellular concentration of endogenous oncornavirus DNA. In contrast, different tissues from lekemic chickens and from chickens bearing kidney tumors contained different concentrations of AMV homologous DNA: in some tissues there was no increase whereas other tissues acquired additional AMV-specific DNA sequences. The increase was the greatest in tissues which can become neoplastic after infection, such as myeloblasts, erythrocytes, and kidney cells. It was directly demonstrated that DNA from AMV-induced kidney tumor contains AMV sequences which are absent in DNA from normal cells. A similar finding had been previously obtained with leukemic cells (15). 3H-labeled 35S RNA from purified AMV was exhaustively hybridized with an excess of normal chicken DNA to remove all the viral RNA sequences which are complementary to DNA from uninfected cells.

The presence of antibody against MuLV in mouse serum which can cause cytotoxic reactions with tumor cells points to the fact that particular caution should be used during the typing of murine sarcomas or leukemias for cell surface antigens, since mouse antisera may yield cytotoxicity (or other serologic reactions) based on anti-MuLV specificities, rather than on anticipated antigens.",,,,,,,,,,

Segregation is observed in first backcross (Bc1) and F2 mice, and the segregation ratios up to Bc3 mice fit a one-gene model.

Karyotype of the L104 cultures revealed predominantly rat-like patterns; however, about 5% of the cells reacted with HLA antibodies and demonstrated human isozyme patterns. Electron microscopy of L104 cells revealed the presence of C-type particles budding from the cell membranes and in cytoplasmic vacuoles. Virus was not detected in any of the other normal lung, lung tumor or XC cells examined after co-cultivation with XC cells. The particles isolated from tissue culture fluids had the biochemical and biophysical characteristics common to other known mammalian C-type particles and were serologically related to the woolly monkey virus (WMV)/gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV) complex. Cross-hybridization between viral 3H-DNA transcripts and cellular RNAs from virus-infected cells clearly show the presence of sequences in the L104 cellular RNA related to both the GaLV/WMV group of viruses and rat viruses. Hydroxyapatite chromatography reveals however that the primate-related sequences in the viral RNA are indistinguishable from WMV in thermal elution profile. The host range of L104 virus appears to vary greatly from WMV in being xenotropic and, in the cell lines thus far tested appears, to infect only rat cells. The virus gave positive KC but negative XC assays. Inoculation of whole cells or cell-free supernatants into weaning hamster did not result in either solid tumors or leukemia. Co-cultivation of appropriate cell lines may represent an approach to the detection of latent viruses in human neoplasia.",,,,,,,,,,

Subcutaneous inoculation of approximately 1.0 times 10(6) tumor cells resulted in a rapidly growing tumor at the site of inoculation and subsequent development of splenomegaly and lymphoadenopathy. All animals succumbed to the leukemia within 24 to 30 days. Treatment of diseased animals with two courses of cytoxan over a 2-week period resulted in a remission period of approximately 16 to 18 days before relapse and eventual death of approximately 70% of the drug-treated animals. A significant number of long-term survivors (50 to 83%) was obtained in groups of animals that received combined drug plus BCG or C. parvum therapy. In contrast, the administration of MER (a methanol-extracted residue of BCG) to animals in a drug-induced remission period was no more effective than drug alone. The protective effect afforded by BCG and C. parvum was dependent on the time interval between drug therapy and the administration of the immunostimulators. Treatment of leukemic animals with BCG, C. parvum, or MER alone proved ineffective as all mice died at approximately the same time as untreated control animals. No leukemic cells were observed in any of the histologically examined tissues taken from long-term survivors. The implication of these results for cancer therapy is discussed.",,,,,,,,,,

In routine smears, the blasts showed no clear evidence of differentiation. Cytochemically, the blasts exhibited strongly positive nonspecific esterase activity, which was completely inhibited by incubation with sodium fluoride, and were myeloperoxidase and sudan black B negative. Ultrastructural features of the blasts were similar to those described for monocytic leukemias. Striking clinical features included the occurrence primarily in young patients, the high frequency of lymphadenopathy at presentation, and the high incidence of post-treatment disseminated intravascular coagulation. Complete remissions were frequently initially obtained with duanorubicin in combination with various other agents and later in the disease with VP16-213.

Five cultures exhibited transformation (1 after inoculation of MuLV grown in human cells; 4 after inoculation of human leukemic bone marrow), and 4 were established as cell lines.

The established transformed cells formed colonies in soft agar, grew progressively in immunosuppressed mice, and carried antigens common to FeLV and MuLV. Although virus particles were not seen in these cultures, 68S RNA was detected in their media. Medium from nontransformed parent cultures also contained 68S RNA but in amounts about 15 times less than in transformed cultures. Transformed human cells passaged in mice produced both type C virus particles and 68S RNA. Antigens common to MuLV and FeLV were found in these particles.

It has been found that there are 2 types of actions: 1) Type I (cytocidal and concentration-dependent action). The dose survival curves of Type I agents fit the equation log S=log nminuskD (S, surviving fraction; D, concentration of agents; n and k are constant). The sensitivity of cells can be expressed by mean lethal dose 90% (MLD90=1/k). Four cell lines were compared on this basis, and some problems concerning the chemotherapy of human cancer are discussed.

The dose survival curves fit the Gompertz equation S=exp[(minusbeta/alpha)(1minus e-aD)] (beta, population reduction parameter; alpha, constant). The exposure survival curve is negative exponential, indicating that exposure time rather than concentration is the key fo effective cell killing of Type II agents. Difficulties in expression of sensitivity to Type II agents are discussed. Antimetabolites, Vinca alkaloids, and L-asparaginase belonged to this group.

The discovery that feline lymphosarcoma was associated with an RNA virus (feline leukemia virus(FeLV)) meant that infectious transmission of the disease was a possibility. The critical question was whether the predominant method of transmission from one animal to another was 'vertical' (via the gametes) or 'horizontal' (via contagion or infection). A number of epidemiological studies have shown that the chances of healthy cats contracting lymphosarcoma are greatly increased when a cat with the disease lives in close proximity. It does not matter whether the healthy cats are related to the sick animal or not. It has also been established that viremic normal cats have an approximately 900 times greater chance of developing leukemia than cats whose FeLV status is unknown. Infectious FeLV is present in the excretions and blood of viremic animals. In the natural environment, feline lymphosarcoma occurs in clusters. The results in pet cats have been supported by experiments with cat colonies under controlled conditions and prove that horizontal transmission of FeLV occurs. This does not mean that epigenetic (infection in utero or via the milk) or vertical transmission cannot also occur. It should be possible to break the cycle of horizontal transmission of the virus by vaccination and thus control FeLV-related diseases.",,,21,,,,,,,

Even if cells transform, ultimate development of a tumor may be immunologically controlled. For example, cells of some marmoset species transform after infection with RNA tumor viruses, and animals react to the transformed cells with cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. Both virus specific and cross-reacting cell membrane antigens have been demonstrated. Immune deficiency accelerates tumor growth or causes recurrence of a regressing tumor. In contrast certain simian herpesvirus (Herpesvirus saimiri, HVS and Herpesvirus ateles, HVA), which cause no or minor disease in their natural hosts, induce lymphomas or lymphoblastic leukemias in other primate species. The immune response of the natural host species to HVS is greater than that of animals developing malignancies after experimental infection. HVS and HVA share many properties with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) of man, including antigens appearing early and late during infection and their related antibody responses but no evidence exists that they induce malignancies in their natural hosts. However, if induction is as infrequent as that with EBV and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), we have not observed sufficient numbers of squirrel or spider monkeys to have seen a BL-like tumor. Interference with the immune systems of animals carrying HVS or HVA may induce tumor development, and clarify our understanding of the relationships between EBV and BL.",,,14,,,,,,,

A higher percentage of nonregressing sarcomas appeared in these animals, sometimes accompanied simultaneously by leukemia. The immune reactivity of mice receiving MuLV-Gi at birth was found to be significantly depressed when evaluated by the hemolytic palque-forming cell (PFC) technique. However, in mice infected with MuLV-Gi and MSV-M the number of PFC ranged within the control values or slightly increased. The potentiation of MSV-M oncogenicity following infection with MuLV was studied in a more natural situation. Adult AKR mice, known to release endogenous MuLV continuously, were injected with MSV-M. The incidence of induced sarcomas was similar to that observed in control BALB/c mice inoculated with MSV-M. Moreover, tumors developed with a very long latent period. On the other hand, the great majority of tumors showed no regression and ultimately killed the host. Additional experiments, making use of immunologic manipulation of the host and Fl hybrids, suggest that the relative resistance to MSV-M oncogenesis in AKR mice is influenced by genetic and immunologic factors. MSV recovered from MSV-M-induced tumors in AKR and C58 mice was typed by highly specific mouse antisera.

A general feature of all the above variants is a failure of detection of spontaneous reversion occurring after the second cycle of transformation. The nature of MuLV spontaneously released is that of a poorly replicating MuLV which exhibits cross-interference with other MuLV pseudotypes of MSV and the envelope which is most similar to that of Moloney leukemia virus (MLV).

Newly synthesized viral DNA (v-DNA) appears within an hour after infection of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) with avian oncornaviruses. A fraction of newly synthesized v-DNA becomes integrated into the cellular genome and the remainder gradually disappears. A covalent linkage between v-DNA and cellular DNA was demonstrated to exist in CEF and in leukemic myeloblasts by alkaline sucrose velocity sedimentation. Hybridization of AMV RNA in DNA excess has revealed that there are 2 clases of viral specific sequences within normal as well as in leukemic cells. The 2 types of sequences differ in their rate of hybridization. The amount of both types of DNA sequences is about 2 times higher in leukemic cells than in normal cells. Both the fast- and slowly reacting sequences in leukemic cells exhibit a higher Tm (2 degrees C) than the respective DNA sequences in normal cells. Furthermore, when nucleotide sequences in AMV RNA complementary to normal DNA are removed first by exhaustive hybridization with normal DNA, the residual RNA only hybridizes with leukemic DNA but not with normal DNA. These results suggest that leukemic cells contain viral specific DNA sequences which are absent in normal cells. Endogenous v-DNA has been shown to be integrated in cellular DNA region(s) with a reiteration frequency of approximately 1,200 copies per cell and each integration unit appears to have a size approximately equivalent to the 35S RNA subunit of the viral genome.

The indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) technique was used to detect FeLV antigen. Of the cats with lymphosarcoma (leukaemia), 73.2 per cent and of those with infectious peritonitis, 32.4 per cent were found to be positive for FeLV antigen. Of the sixty-six cats with other tumours, only one, a cat with carcinoma of the mammary gland; was positive for FeLV antigen. Of 557 cats with various lesions, forty-two (7.5 percent) were positive for FeLV antigen. The IFA-test was found to be a useful adjunct in establishing the correct diagnosis. Of all stud cats which had been in contact with FeLV-positive cats, 24.7 percent were positive for FeLV antigen, wheras all those which had not been in contact with these cats, were negative. There was a marked difference between the proportions of FeLV-positive cats in the groups of clinically normal cats which had (20.6 per cent) and which had not (0.4 per cent) been in contact with FeLV-positive cats.

Viral RNA labeled over differing intervals was characterized by gel electrophoresis and velocity sedimentation in sucrose gradients made up in aqueous buffer and 99% dimethyl sulfoxide. Labeled virus was found within 30 min after adding radioactive uridine to the cells and production of labeled virus reached a maximum at 4 to 5 h after pulse labeling. Native RNA from feline leukemia virus resolved into three size classes when analyzed by electrophoresis on 2.0% polyacrylamide-0.5% agarose gels: a 6.2 x 10(6) to 7.1 x 10(6) mol wt (50 to 60S) class, an 8.7 x 10(4) mol wt (approximately 8S) class, and a 2.5 x 10(4) mol wt (4 to 5S) class.

No constant relationship between the incidence of MuLV and the H-2 complex was apparent. Two lines, B10 and B10.A, were examined in detail because the incidence of MuLV in B10 was low and the virus appeared relatively late in life, whereas B10.A animals had a relatively high incidence of infection by MuLV early in life. Further studies of B10.A mice revealed an almost universal concordance between the virologic status of the mother and her offspring. This was particularly evident when (B10 times B10.A)F1 animals were compared with (B10.A times B10)F1 mice: Although genetically identical, the incidence of MuLV in the latter was high, whereas in the former it was low.

The tropism of MuLV was readily defined in fibroblast cultures, but not in lymphocyte cultures. Lymphocytes free of infectious MuLV could be infected across the tropism barrier by partially purified MuLv or by in vitro contact with MuLV-producing lymphocytes. Stimulation of lymphocytes was not required for this cross-infection and replication of MuLV. When cross-infected lymphocytes and was specifically associated with lymphocytes were stimulated in vitro by allogeneic cells, they facilitated MuLV infection of ordinarily non-permissive fibroblasts. This phenomenon (transtropism) required antigenically stimulated lymphocytes and was specifically associated with infection of the lymphocyte by MuLV across the tropism barrier. Thus in contrast with the resting lymphocyte, the transformed lymphocyte acquired the ability to disseminate infectious MuLV to nonpermissive cells. These findings suggest a novel relationship between lymphocytes and leukemia viruses. They indicate one mechanism whereby antigenic stimulation may enhance the development of virus-induced lymphoid neoplasms.",,,,,,,,,,

Neonatal rats infected with MuEV succumb to this hemolytic disorder unless they are treated with the synthetic double-stranded polyribonucleotide, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I-poly C). Animals receiving poly I-poly C had markedly reduced levels of virus reproduction as measured by bioassay and electron microscopy. The proliferation of erythroblasts after MuEV infection in animals not receiving poly I-poly C appeared to be an erythropoietin-dependent compensatory response to hemolysis.

This mammalian leukemia virus information (FT-) is a genetically stable part of the mammalian sarcoma viruses (FT+). Second, another component in the Kirsten and Harvey sarcoma viruses can be identified in addition to this leukemia virus information for the homologous leukemia virus; at least part of the additional information came from rat type C viruses from the animals in which the sarcoma viruses were isolated.

Our hybridization studies indicate that in the strains so far tested, the complete genome of the AKR-type MLV is present in the DNA of the embryos of both high- and low-virus-yielding mouse strains, while DNA of non-virus strains contains only a part of the genome. Furthermore, at least two populations of virus-specific DNA sequences can be identified (more abundant and less abundant species) according to their rate of association. Low-virus-yielding mouse strains contain a smaller number (1-2 copies) of the less abundant species, and thus a lower number of complete viral genome than do high-virus strains (3-4 copies). Non-virus-yielding strains are lacking these less abundant sequences in their genome. DNA from wild Mus musculus also contained viral sequences, the sample tested showing association kinetics identical to the non-virus-producing strains. Thus there is a good correlation between completeness of the AKR-type MLV genome in cellular DNA and the capacity of the cells to release AKR-type MLV. Mice of a non-virus-yielding strain made partially congenic for the AKR virus-inducing locus Akv-1 contained the complete virus genome, confirming that this locus consists of structural genes of the virus.",,,,,,,,,,

Evidence has since shown that, on comparison with the AKR, lymphomas were not only delayed but were also less common in a group of 18 early embryo aggregation derived AKR-CBA/H-T6 tetraparental chimeras. Evidence here has shown other clear differences between the AKR and AKR-CBA/H-T6 chimeras. Whereas murine group-specific murine leukemia viral antigens were detected in the sera in both situations, immunoabsorption studies showed that, in the AKR, the antigens exist complexed to the corresponding antibodies. The situation in the chimeras was in complete contrast, since here antigens exist as a ""free"" form. This in turn has led us to suggest that the advantage in respect to tumor immunity in the AKR-CBA/H-T6 chimeras is due to the tolerance to oncogenic virus being maintained. In this situation and in contrast to the AKR, in the absence of ""masking"" antibody-viral antigenic complexes, ""normal"" tumor immunity can be effected. It has to be assumed that tolerance to the oncogenic Gross virus in the AKR-CBA/H-T6 chimeras reflects the influence of the CBA component. How this has possibly been achieved is discussed.",,,,,,,,,,

It accounted for 12.5% of all tumors registered in our Cancer Registery over the period of study. The commonest type of malignant tumor in the Nigerian child was solid lymphoma, of which Burkitt's tumor predominated. The overall pattern of tumors in these children was strikingly different in certain aspects from what obtains in the Caucasian child. When four main groups of tumors were considered, the ratio frequency pattern in Nigerian children was one of high lymphoma, high orbital, low leukemia, low glioma type. In the Caucasian child, the ratio frequency pattern is usually one of high leukemia, high glioma, low lymphoma, low orbital type. The observed differences in frequencies of childhood tumors between population groups require further studies.",,,,,,,,,,

It was possible to transmit nearly all these experimentally induced leukaemias to syngeneic mice through acellular extracts, compared with very poor transmissibility of spontaneous leukaemias in the ICRC strain, indicating functional activation of viral agents on combined treatment with carcinogen and hormones. Potency of the acellular leukaemic extract from the mice of group (ii) without the ovarian hormones was much weaker than that from mice of the other experimental groups. The leukaemogenic activity of MuLV was enhanced on serial transmission in syngeneic hosts. Leukaemic lesions of ovariectomized mice treated with 20-MCA and oestradiol were also transmissible to the sucklings of allogeneic mice of strain C3H-MTV, C57-BL and Dba-MTV. The cell-free supernatant medium of the cultures of these leukaemic lesions induced leukaemias on back inoculation into syngeneic mice. Electron microscopic studies of lesions induced with carcinogen and oestradiol consistently showed abundant intracytoplasmic type A particles. Numerous intracytoplasmic type A particles as well as some type B particles were found in the leukaemic tissues of ovariectomized females treated with MCA and oestradiol combined with progesterone. Type C particles, characteristic of MuLV were seen in the leukaemic tissues of all other experimental groups.

From about the age of 3 months anti-gs antibodies occur and these complex with the corresponding viral antigens. Such complexes are best seen in the glomeruli by means of immunofluorescence. In marked contrast to the AKR, renal complexes were minimal in a group of AKR reversible CBA/H-T6 chimaeras derived by early embryo aggregation. This was particularly surprising since large numbers of type C murine leukaemia virus-like particles were identified in the chimaeras and the tissues were found to be saturated with gs antigen. The lack of renal antigen-antibody complexes was the first suggestion that anti-gs antibody might not be present in the chimaeras and renal elution studies here support this assumption. In contrast to the AKR where ""split "" renal eluates have been shown to have anti-gs activity, no activity was demonstrated in eluates from any of the chimaras. Tolerance to the oncogenic Gross virus in the chimaeras has to be attributed to the CBA parental strain component and since this component is also held responsible for the tumour resistance of these chimaeras, both phenomena could well be related. In this context it would appear that in the absence of masking by antibody viral antigenic complexes, tumour specific sites can be recognized in the chimaeras and unlike the AKR ""normal"" tumour immunity can be effected. This hypothesis is currently bei-ng tested.",PMC2009353,,,,,,,,,

The selection of hybrid cell clones was facilitated by the inability of ASL-1 cells to grow in vitro and of LM(TK)-cells to survive in hypoxanthine/amethopterin/thymidine medium. The H-2 antigens of both parental cells were formed in approximately equivalent amounts by the hybrid cells, and they possessed a hybrid karyotype. As determined by five independent experimental procedures (antibody and complement-mediated cytotoxicity tests, the reduction of specific antibody activity of antiserum of known titer, immunofluorescent tests, mixed hemagglutination tests, and their direct isolation), TL antigens but not Thy-1 antigens were formed by the hybrid cells. TL antigens of the hybrids failed to undergo modulation under conditions leading to the modulation of TL antigens of parental ASL-1 cells. Modulation was attempted with TL 1,3, TL 2, or TL 1,2,3 antisera of high titer. thybrid cells were incubated for up to 30 hr in medium with TL antisera.

Mice of the CBA/HN strain, however, were found to possess low or undetectable levels of NOA against a wide range of tumor cell lines. Genetic studies indicated that the defect in production of tumor-reactive NOA in CBA/HN mice was largely determined by the absence of an X chromosome-linked gene and is probably similar to the known X chromosome defect of this mouse strain in their antibody response to thymus-independent antigens. In spite of the low level of tumor-reactive NOA, CBA/HN mice do not have a high incidence of spontaneous tumors.

Hyper-immunity was induced by successive challenges with fresh tumor cells. The cytotoxic effect of the serum of resistant rats (RRS) against AH-64A tumor cells was not reduced after absorption with normal rat liver cells, but was slightly reduced after absorption with normal rat spleen cells. The cytotoxicity was absorbed completely with 5 times 10(6) AH-64A tumor cells. AH-64A, -B, -C, and -D are ascites hepatoma cell lines originating from a single Donryu rat. AH-64A and AH-64B cross-reacted with RRS while AH-64C and AH-64D, chemically induced DBLA-6 leukemia cells and normal lymph node cells of rats, did not react with RRS in indirect immunofluorescence and cytotoxicity tests. A neutralization test was carried out by treating 2 times 10(5) tumor cell with either RRS or immune spleen cell in vitro and then injecting them subcutaneously into irradiated rats (400 R). It was found that 1:20 dilution of RRS protected the rats against AH-64A tumor cell growth while 1:40 and 1:80 dilutions of RRS caused some protection. A subcutaneous tumor mass developed after transplantation of tumor cells treated with RRS, but after about 2 weeks this began to decrease in size and disappeared completely within 6 weeks after transplantation. Treatment of AH-64A tumor cells with immune spleen cells at cell-to-cell ratios of 1:200 and 1:100 caused complete neutralization while normal spleen cells at a ratio of 1:200 had slight effect. Treat;ent with immune spleen cells prevented tumor growth from t;e start. Most of the surviving animals were resistant to c,allenge with 1 times 10(5) fresh AH-64A cells. RRS was fractionated by cellulose acetate membrane electrophoresis and the amounts of beta1- and gamma-globulin fractions were found to be 48 and 42% more than in normal rat serum.

We have analyzed the results of this test in relation to time and in the presence of variable quantities of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). The values observed per time and PMN unit proved to be equivalent in the presence of 2.5 X 105 PMN or 5.0 x 105 PMN per 0.5 ml of incubation medium, measured after 10, 20 and 30 minutes or in the presence of 1.0 x 106 PMN, measured after 10 minutes. That is to say iodination is proportional to leukocyte concentration and incubation time. Increase of either the quantity of cells or the incubation time, beyond the area we defined, reduced iodination per cell and per unit of time. Concerning the patients with an insufficient iodination, we have studied 2 parameters in the presence of 5.0 x 105 PMN: 1) initial iodination measured after 10 and 20 minutes and 2) stability of iodination measured after 60 minutes. These two parameters were equally affected in two cases with myelofi-rosis, 3 patients with acquired refractory anaemia, one with chronic lymphoid leukaemia, one with erythroleukaemia, one with hairy cell leukaemia, one with systemic mastocytosis and almost complete myeloperoxidase dificiency, one with sickle cell disease, two with liver diseases and two with chronic myeloid leukaemia. The iodination at the 60th minute was more affected than at the 10th minute with a patient with myelofibrosis and 4 other patients with acquired refractory anaemias. The significance of these differences is not well understood; however the meaning of the decrease in the iodination of whatever type is that a PMN anomaly exists directly related to the myeloperoxidase H2O2 halogenation system, or to one of the stages of engulfment and/or metabolic events preceeding it and leading to the production of H2O2. This test, with the alterations we introduced, is suggested as a test for detection of functional PMN abnormalities.",,,,,,,,,,

Intracellular levels of cyclic 3':5'-AMP were measured in normal and CLL lymphocytes in nondividing, dividing, and quiescent [after phytohemagglutinin (PHA) addition]states. In normal lymphocytes the levels of cyclic 3':5'-AMP fluctuated throughout the cell cycle after PHA addition, whereas in CLL lymphocytes the levels were approximately 3-fold lower than in normal cells and remained relatively constant before, during, and after mitogenic stimulation. Normal cells contained approximately 3-fold lower levels of glycogen than CLL cells, whereas glycogen phosphorylase activities were increased 2- to 4-fold above those in nondividing cells in normal but not in CLL lymphocytes after stimulation with PHA. Furthermore, cyclic 3':5'-AMP phosphodiesterase activities were higher in CLL lymphocytes than in normal ones. Collectively, these studies demonstrated that (a) the intracellular levels of cyclic 3':5'-AMP differ in these two cell types; (b) the levels of cyclic 3':5'-AMP and glycogen qualitatively correlate with the activities of the enzymes that are related to these components; and (c) an inverse relationship between the levels of cyclic 3':5'-AMP and cell growth exists in mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes from healthy donors but not from patients with CLL.

Two separate cell cultures have been established from 2 individual MSV-SD-induced NB rat bone tumors. Cells of 1 bone tumor culture, designated RBT-E, are in early in vitro passages. These cells form colonies in agar medium and take up 2-deoxy-D-[3H]glucose at a greatly enhanced rate, 5 times that of normal nontransformed rat embryo cells. Cells of the RBT-E culture release both MSV and murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and therefore contain sarcoma-positive leukemia-positive transformed cells. The other rat bone tumor culture, designated RBT-L, produced MSV at early passages. RBT-L culture has been passaged over 130 times in vitro. Cells of the RBT-L culture form colonies in agar medium and take up 2-deoxy-D-[3H]glucose at an enhanced rate (3 times that of rat embryo cells), indicating the presence of transformed cells within the RBT-L culture. However, cells of the RBT-L culture at late passages (Passage 130 or more) produce only MuLV and no detectable MSV activity (as shown by the lack of tumor-inducing activity and the lack of focus-forming activities by direct assay or by infectious center assay). Attempts to rescue MSV activity from RBT-L cells by cocultivation with MuLV-producing mouse cells were not successful. The MuLV found in the RBT-L cells, however, is a competent helper virus capable of rescuing the MSV genome from MSV-SD-induced hamster bone tumor cells. All the available evidence supports the notion that late passages of the RBT-L culture contain transformed cells that do not produce conventionally detectable MSV. These cells are referred to as sarcoma-negative leukemia-positive cells. The sarcoma-negative leukemia-positive cells represent a different kind of MSV-induced transformed cells and provide a unique system for studies in search of MSV markers such as MSV-specific antigens and MSV-specific nucleotide sequences.",,,,,,,,,,

Adenylate cyclase activity rose during the preleukemic and leukemic phases of leukemogenesis. Although the drop of epinephrine-induced stimulation of thymus adenylate cyclase in the preleukemic phase was probably age related, there was an additional decrease of adenylate cyclase activation by epinephrine in leukemic cells. Cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity was slightly higher in preleukemic cells and more than fourfold AKR thymus.

The five compounds which were found to possess potential antitumor activity against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma are as follows: beta-naphthalene-sulfonyl-DL-tryptophan (A-91), beta-naphthyl-aminomethyl-gamma-aminobutyric acid (A-144), N-ethylcarbaminomethyl-L-isoleucine (A-145), n-9-fluorenylactyl-L-phenylalanine (A-192), and N-propoinyl-L-valine (A-195). The effect on life prolongation and tumor growth of these selected A-A derivatives against various types of tumors, including ascites and solid tumors in mice and ascites hepatomas in rats, was examined. A-A derivatives were administered once daily 3 consecutive days starting 24 hours after tumor implantation. Experimental results showed that among the five A-A derivatives possessing considerable activity against Ehlich carcinoma, A-144 and A-145 were found to be more effective than chromomycin A and showed activity similar to that of cyclophosphamide against ascites Sarcoma 180. A-A derivatives showed slight antitumor activity against SR61 and L1210 leukemias. In rat ascites hepatoma, such as AH13, AH7974, AH60C, and Yoshida sarcoma, only A-145 showed a significant prolongation of the lifespan in the control groups. The five selected A-A derivatives significantly inhibited the growth of Nakahara-Fukuoka sarcoma and solid Sarcoma 180. These findings indicate that among the five A-A derivatives, A-15 appeared to be the most active against ascites and solid tumors.",,,,,,,,,,

Although these virus apparently do not induce morphologic or neoplastic change in bone they may have other, more subtle, effects. Thus, comparison of sera from male C3H/Fg mice, a high leukemia-prone strain, with C57BL and C3H/HeJ mice, low leukemia strains which do not contain C-type virus in bone, reveals that serum calcium levels are significantly lower in the former than in the latter. Further, when C3H/Fg mice develop frank leukemia there is a corresponding increase in virus particles while the serum calcium concentration levels fall to even lower values. The presence of leukemia itself appears not to be the cause as indicated by the failure of implanted lymphocytic leukemic cells in C3H/Fg mice to significantly affect serum calcium concentration. It is postulated that the effects of the virus could be due either to increased osteo blastic activity or to inhibition of osteocytic osteolytic activity or to both.",,,,,,,,,,

A hemorrhagic tumor was removed from an area of oral buccal skin and diagnosed histopathologically as lymphosarcoma. Rapid physical deterioration occurred, and the cat became moribund 2 weeks after surgical operation. Necropsy revealed at least 200 spherical hemorrhagic neoplastic nodules attached to the omentum, mesentery, and peritoneum. Examination of histopathologic sections confirmed the striking characteristics of an extremely vascular and highly invasive malignant lymphoma, which was designated feline tumor No. 01 (FeT-01). There was no evidence of peripheral blood leukemia. Electron microscopic examination of tumor tissue revealed numerous viral particles having characteristics common to both feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline syncytium-forming virus (FeSFV). Primary cells and cultures propagated from tumor tissue were found to be negative or weakly positive for group-specific (gs) antigen by radioimmunoassay but strongly positive when assayed by indirect immunofluorescence. Co-cultivation of cells from tumor tissue, with normal prescreened feline embryo cells, revealed the presence of numerous FeSFV-like viral particles in the absence of C-type virus. A FeSFV was isolated from these passaged cells, with characteristics similar to FeSFV isolates previously described in the literature. The apparent presence of FeSFV in lymphosarcomatous tissue and the apparent absence of FeLV C-type particles in passaged cells indicate the need to make a more intensive study of the FeSFV group of viruses and the possible etiologic relationship to feline malignancies.",,,,,,,,,,

Thus, expression of this cell surface component is under the control of cellular genes and is subject to the controls governing the differentiation of T lymphocytes (2). Although the 129 mouse produces no demonstrable leukemia virus such as that found in the AKR strain, it was soon realized that G(IX) antigen must in some way be related to MuLV, because productive infection with MuLV is frequently associated with appearance of G(IX) antigen on cells that are genotypically G(IX-), most notably on MuLV-infected rat cells, or cells that belong to other differentiation pathways (1). The basis of this connection between G(IX) and MuLV has recently become clear from the demonstration that G(IX) is one of MuLV envelope. Therefore, our working hypothesis is that the presence of G(IX) is one of the antigens present on gp69/71 (3,4), the major glycoprotein component of the MuLV envelope. Therefore, our working hypothesis is that the presence of G(IX) antigen always denotes the presence of gp69/71 (though not all variants of gp69/71 need necessarily carry G(IX)). Study of the circumstances under which G(IX) is expressed on the cell surface is thus potentially a powerful approach to understanding how the expression of C-type viral genomes is controlled. Such studies are greatly facilitated by the availability of mutant and congenic strains of inbred mice which differ from the nonmutant or partner strains only with respect to one or another manifestation of the viral genome. It is for this reason that we record here (Table I) some details of two G(IX) mutant and two G(IX) congenic stocks derived in our colonies at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). In addition, to these four strains, Table I includes data for the three relevant partner strains, and for strain AKR, for comparison. These eight strains all differ from one another with respect to one or more MuLV-related traits.",PMC2189890,,,,,,,,,

The cells used were lymphoma cells, normal lymphocytes, myeloid leukemia cells, and normal and transformed fibroblasts, and the fibers were coated with different densities of concanavalin A or the lectins from soybean or wheat germ. Cells fixed with glutaraldehyde did not bind to lectin-coated fibers. The number of cells bound to fibers could be increased by increasing the density of lectin molecules on the fiber, the density of specific receptors on the cell, or the mobility of the receptors. It is suggested that binding of cells to fibers involves alignment and binding of specific cell surface receptors with lectin molecules immobilized on the fibers, and that this alignment requires short-range rapid lateral mobility (RLM) of the receptors. The titration of cell binding to fibers coated with different densities of lectin and albumin has been used to measure the relative RLM of unoccupied cell surface receptors for the lectin. The results indicate a relationship of RLM to lectin-induced cell-to-cell binding. The RLM or receptors for concanavalin A (Con A) was generally found to be higher than that of receptors for the lectins from wheat germ or soybean. Receptor RLM could be decreased by use of metabolic inhibitors or by lowering the temperature. Receptors for Con A had a lower RLM on normal fibroblasts than on SV40-transformed fibroblasts, and trypsinization of normal fibroblasts increased Con A receptor RLM. Normal lymphocytes, lymphoma cells, and lines of myeloid leukemia cells that can be induced to differentiate had a high receptor RLM, whereas lines of myeloid leukemia cells that could not be induced to differentiate had a low receptor RLM. These results suggest that the RLM of Con A receptors is related to the transformation of fibroblasts and the ability of myeloid leukemia cells to undergo differentiation",PMC2109514,,,,,,,,,

However, the inhibition was variable from experiment to experiment and was not consistent with the base specificity of HPUra seen for inhibition of gram positive DNA-dependent DNA polymerases. Increasing the concentration of dithiothreitol reversed the inhibition. Furthermore, at non-toxic concentrations, HPUra did not influence the plating efficiency of RLV in tissue culture, as measured by the ability to induce foci on sarcoma virus positive-leukemia virus negative cells. Oxidation of dithiothreitol in the presence or absence of HPUra was followed spectrophotometrically under enzyme conditions. HPUra catalyzed the oxidation of dithiothreitol under these conditions. Since dithiothreitol is required for optimum reaction rates, as well as complete disruption of virus in some polymerase assay systems, the oxidation of dithiothreitol in the presence of HPUra is sufficient to explain the inhibition seen.",,,,,,,,,,

However, antiserum against the void volume fraction of the gel filtration eluate precipitated the p15(E) component from solubilized, radiolabeled virions, as shown by SDS-PAGE analysis of such immunoprecipitates. Comparative radioprecipitation analyses of this type revealed that for various MuLV isolates p15(E) was distinguishable from p15 in terms of serological reactivities, relative mobilities in gel electrophoresis, and relative efficiencies of labeling with individual amino acids.

At 20 or 37 degrees C, capping of Thy 1.2 on both cell types was readily achieved but MLr capping occurred only in a few GRSL2 cells and was less pronounced. However, after addition of the secondary antibodies, MLr capping was markedly increased by gradual cooling of cells to about 17 degrees C. Conversely, after addition of antibodies at 0 degrees C, gradual warming of cells under the fluorescence microscope resulted in extensive capping both of MLr and Thy 1.2 at approximately 13-14 degrees C. Rapid cooling or rapid warming led to almost instantaneous capping. These results may be explained by the occurrence of phase transitions or phase separations in the particular temperature range. Another difference between capping of Thy 1.2 and MLr was that the former caps were small and eventually were endocytosed, whereas the MLr caps were large and were exfoliated from the cells.",,,,,,,,,,

MLm was shown by a homologous C57BL antiserum to GRSL2 leukemia (absorbed in vivo in GR mice); MLr was detected by a rabbit heterologous antiserum (absorbed in vivo in C57BL or GR mice and in vitro with BALB/c milk) prepared against Tween 80- and ether-treated purified B particles.

Both the MLr and MLm antigens were present in purified B particles, and antigenic activity were present in purified B particles, and antigenic activity was enhanced by destruction of the purified virus particles. The antigens were about eightfold enriched in a preparation of B-particle envelopes, as shown by quantitative cytotoxicity absorption (CYTA) tests. Purified nucleoid fractions of B particles were only lightly positive for the antigen, probably due to envelope contamination. One dominant gene was responsible for the expression of MLr, as shown by CYTA tests with mammary glands of individual animals of segregating crosses between the GR strain with high mammary cancer incidence and strains with low incidence.

The resulting cell line had properties very similar to those of the mouse 3T3 series and was named HAMS 3T3. The cell showed density-dependent inhibition of division with a saturation density of 1.0 to 1.2 x 10-6 cells/60-mm dish or 4.5 to 5.5 x 10-4 cells/sq cm. Addition of fresh medium containing 5 or 10% fetal calf serum to a confluent culture induced DNA synthesis in 18 hr with subsequent cell division. Cells were hyperdiploid with a mode of 45 chromosomes (80% of the cells). When cells at the 60th passage were injected into the skin or cheek pouch of an inbred hamster of the same strain as that from which they were derived, they produced a benign tumor that regressed after 3 weeks. Morphological transformation was obtained by infection with the Moloney strain of murine sarcoma virus.",,,,,,,,,,
