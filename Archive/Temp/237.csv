The Taiwan Children's Cancer Study Group.,702-10,"Ninety-seven patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have achieved complete continuous first remission for more than five years. They were treated by Taiwan Children's Cancer Study Group protocol 821 or protocol 842. Their present health status was evaluated using blood counts, immunology, a psychiatric analysis and growth parameters. Hemoglobin and platelet counts rose quickly to the normal range after complete remission was achieved, then remained at low normal throughout the course. The leukocyte counts responded immediately to chemotherapy, usually recovering to about 5,000/uL, then gradually increasing after completion of chemotherapy. The absolute neutrophil counts were at a low normal level during chemotherapy, then gradually recovered to the normal level after chemotherapy was completed. Immunologic investigation after completion of chemotherapy showed that the subsets of lymphocytes were nearly all in the normal range for the 38 patients tested. On the other hand, in 17 patients tested for T-cell function, it was found that 29.4% had low natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, 11.8% had an abnormal phytohemagglutinin (PHA) test and all had abnormally low IL-2 production (in vitro). There were 29 patients who had psychiatric analyses; the full IQ was borderline in 10.3%. The primary or middle school academic scores of 55 patients were reported; 15% of them belonged to the lower one-third of the class. Height was assessed by the standard deviation score from the mean for 58 patients. The differences were statistically insignificant; however, there were six patients whose growth curves crossed over their initial percentile line.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Lin, S T', 'Yang, C P', 'Liang, D C']","['Lin ST', 'Yang CP', 'Liang DC']","['Department of Pediatrics, Taipei Medical College Hospital, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Singapore,J Formos Med Assoc,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,9214933,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*rehabilitation/therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Taiwan']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Formos Med Assoc. 1993 Aug;92(8):702-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The retrovirus human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) is the cause of ATL; and in ATL-endemic areas, the rate of carriage of antibodies to HTLV-I is high. A definite diagnosis of ATL is based on the presence of HTLV-I proviral DNA in the tumour-cell DNA. ATL cells originate from the CD4 subset of peripheral T cells. ATL shows diverse clinical features but can be divided into four subtypes--acute, chronic, smouldering, and lymphoma type. It is resistant to chemotherapy, and the acute and lymphoma types have a poor prognosis. Familial occurrence of ATL is common. HTLV-I infection is caused by transmission of live infected lymphocytes from mother to child, from man to woman, or by transfusion.

We have used a clone-specific polymerase chain reaction to detect rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene from the leukaemic clone, and quantified the clone by limiting dilution analysis. MRD was successfully quantified, by extracting DNA from marrow slides, from 88 of 181 children with ALL, who had total leucocyte counts below 100 x 10(9)/L at presentation and were enrolled in two clinical trials, in 1980-84 and 1985-89. Leukaemia was detected in the first remission marrow of 38 patients, in amounts between 6.7 x 10(-2) and 9.9 x 10(-7) cells; 26 of these patients relapsed. Of 50 patients with no MRD detected, despite study of 522-496,000 genomes, only 6 relapsed. The association between MRD detection and outcome was significant for patients in each trial. In the first trial, patients relapsed at all levels of detected MRD, whereas in the later trial, in which treatment was more intensive and results were better, the extent of MRD was closely related to the probability of relapse (5 of 5 patients with > 10(-3) MRD, 4 of 10 with 10(-3) to 2 x 10(-5), 0 of 3 with levels below 2 x 10(-5), and 2 of 26 with no MRD detected). Early quantification of leukaemic cells after chemotherapy may be a successful strategy for predicting outcome and hence individualizing treatment in childhood ALL, because the results indicate both in-vivo drug sensitivity of the leukaemia and the number of leukaemic cells that remain to be killed by post-induction therapy.","['Brisco, M J', 'Condon, J', 'Hughes, E', 'Neoh, S H', 'Sykes, P J', 'Seshadri, R', 'Toogood, I', 'Waters, K', 'Tauro, G', 'Ekert, H']","['Brisco MJ', 'Condon J', 'Hughes E', 'Neoh SH', 'Sykes PJ', 'Seshadri R', 'Toogood I', 'Waters K', 'Tauro G', 'Ekert H', 'et al.']","['Flinders Medical Centre, Bedford Park, South Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Examination/*methods', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",1994/01/22 00:00,1994/01/22 00:01,['1994/01/22 00:00'],"['1994/01/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/22 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(94)90988-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0140-6736(94)90988-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1994 Jan 22;343(8891):196-200. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(94)90988-1.,,"['GENBANK/L23222', 'GENBANK/L23223', 'GENBANK/L23224', 'GENBANK/L23225', 'GENBANK/L23226', 'GENBANK/L23227', 'GENBANK/L23228', 'GENBANK/L23229', 'GENBANK/L23230', 'GENBANK/L23231', 'GENBANK/L23232', 'GENBANK/L23233', 'GENBANK/L23234', 'GENBANK/L23235', 'GENBANK/L23236', 'GENBANK/L23237', 'GENBANK/L23238', 'GENBANK/L23239', 'GENBANK/L23240', 'GENBANK/L23241', 'GENBANK/L23242', 'GENBANK/L23243', 'GENBANK/L23244', 'GENBANK/L23245', 'GENBANK/L23246', 'GENBANK/L23247', 'GENBANK/L23248', 'GENBANK/L23249', 'GENBANK/L23250', 'GENBANK/L23251', 'etc.']",['Lancet. 1994 Jan 22;343(8891):190.

In haematology, 'gp150' is a surface-expressed protein molecule, recognised by monoclonal antibodies belonging to the so-called 'Cluster of Differentiation' (CD-) 13, which has independently been found to be a useful marker of myeloid leukaemia in addition to providing potential prognostic value. The current report links these two independent research streams and provides evidence that the hepatobiliary disease marker, serum AAP, predominantly comprises a circulating isoform of 'gp150'. Thus, a (CD-13) monoclonal antibody raised to, and specifically reactive with, cell surface myeloid 'gp150' is able to specifically and almost completely block serum (or plasma) AAP activity otherwise observed in its absence. This holds true for serum (or plasma) derived both from normal individuals or from patients suffering hepatic dysfunction, with or without associated biliary obstruction. In the case of patients with obstructive jaundice, raised levels of AAP are observed, which fall to near normal levels following preincubation with this monoclonal antibody.

In the present study, multiple aspects of topo II-mediated drug action were examined in marrows from adult AML patients. Colony-forming assays revealed that the dose of etoposide, DNR, or m-AMSA required to diminish leukemic colony formation by 90% (LD90) varied over a greater than 20-fold range between different pretreatment marrows. Measurement of nuclear DNR accumulation in the absence and presence of quinidine revealed evidence of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) function in 8 of 82 samples at diagnosis and 5 of 36 samples at first relapse, but the largest quinidine-induced increment in DNR accumulation (< 2-fold) was too small to explain the variations in drug sensitivity. Restriction enzyme-based assays and sequencing of partial topo II alpha and topo II beta cDNAs from the most highly resistant specimens failed to demonstrate topo II gene mutations that could account for resistance. Western blotting of marrow samples containing greater than 80% blasts revealed that the content of the two topo II isoenzymes varied over a greater than 20-fold range, but did not correlate with drug sensitivity in vitro or in vivo. In addition, levels of topo II alpha and topo II beta in 46 of 47 clinical samples were lower than in human AML cell lines. Immunoperoxidase staining showed that these low topo II levels were accompanied by marked cell-to-cell heterogeneity, with topo II alpha being abundant in some blasts and diminished or absent from others. There was a trend toward increasing percentages of topo II alpha-positive cells in pretreatment marrows that contained more S-phase cells. Consistent with this observation, treatment of patients with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor for 3 days before chemotherapy resulted in increases in topo II alpha-positive cells concomitant with increases in the number of cells traversing the cell cycle. These observations have implications for the regulation of topo II in AML, for the use of topo II-directed chemotherapy, and for future attempts to relate drug sensitivity to topo II levels in clinical material.","['Kaufmann, S H', 'Karp, J E', 'Jones, R J', 'Miller, C B', 'Schneider, E', 'Zwelling, L A', 'Cowan, K', 'Wendel, K', 'Burke, P J']","['Kaufmann SH', 'Karp JE', 'Jones RJ', 'Miller CB', 'Schneider E', 'Zwelling LA', 'Cowan K', 'Wendel K', 'Burke PJ']","['Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis/physiology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*analysis', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/physiology', 'Molecular Weight']",1994/01/15 00:00,1994/01/15 00:01,['1994/01/15 00:00'],"['1994/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)77680-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jan 15;83(2):517-30.,,,,,['CA 50435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is coupled to the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck, an interaction necessary for an optimal response of certain T cells to antigen. Although anti-CD4 crosslinking may increase lck activity, the effects of HIV-1 gp120 have been controversial. Activated protein-tyrosine kinases are known to associate with certain intracellular proteins possessing src-homology regions (SH-2 domains) such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In this paper, we demonstrate that the CD4:p56lck complex associates with significant amounts of phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinase activity. High pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis of the reaction products demonstrated the presence of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI 3-P) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI 4-P), thus indicating that PI 3 and PI 4 kinases associate with CD4-p56lck. The p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase was also detected in anti-CD4 immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting with anti-p85 antiserum. Significantly, p56lck binding to CD4 appears to be necessary for the detection of lipid kinase activity associated with p56lck. Also, anti-HIV gp120 and anti-CD4 crosslinking induced a 10-15-fold increase in levels of both PI 3- and PI 4-kinase activity in anti-CD4 precipitates. Stimulation of CD4-p56lck-linked PI kinases by crosslinked HIV-1 gp120 may play a role in HIV-1-induced immune defects.","['Prasad, K V', 'Kapeller, R', 'Janssen, O', 'Duke-Cohan, J S', 'Repke, H', 'Cantley, L C', 'Rudd, C E']","['Prasad KV', 'Kapeller R', 'Janssen O', 'Duke-Cohan JS', 'Repke H', 'Cantley LC', 'Rudd CE']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston 02115.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Megakaryocytes become polyploid by allowing many rounds of DNA replication without completion of intervening mitoses. To assess the role of cell-cycle dependencies in megakaryocytopoiesis we examined human cell lines which express megakaryocytic features for their ability to continue DNA synthesis and undergo polyploidization in the presence of mitotic poisons. Treatment of HEL cells with colcemid blocked cell division but not cellular DNA synthesis. DNA content distributions of cells treated with colcemid for 48 h showed a marked increase in the proportion of polyploid cells (57.6% +/- 9.9%, n = 16), an increase in cellular size and nuclear lobation. Identical effects were observed in HEL cells treated with colchicine, nocodazole or taxol but not with the inactive compound lumicolchicine. Induction of polyploidization by antimicrotubule agents was also observed in the megakaryoblastic cell lines MEG-01, DAMI and UT-7 but not in the T-cell line MOLT-4 or the promyelocytic cell line HL-60.

Although their mechanism of action is thought to be similar, a small number of patients who do not respond to fludarabine do respond to 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine. The extent to which 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine is effective in patients who do not respond to fludarabine is not known, however. METHODS: We treated 28 patients with CLL refractory to fludarabine therapy with a continuous infusion of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine at a daily dose of 4 mg per square meter of body-surface area for seven days. The treatment could be repeated monthly. The number of treatments ranged from one to five; patients who responded continued to receive treatment until the maximal response was achieved. RESULTS: Two patients (7 percent) had partial remissions, but no patients had complete remissions. One other patient had a substantial response but had residual thrombocytopenia. The rate of response in most affected organs was 20 percent, but anemia or thrombocytopenia rarely improved. Myelosuppression was frequent, and 65 percent of the courses of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine therapy were accompanied by febrile episodes or infections. Ten patients died within 60 days of starting therapy with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine; eight deaths were related to infection. The median platelet count at the start of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine therapy in these 10 patients was 24,000 per cubic millimeter, as compared with 109,000 per cubic millimeter in the other 18 patients. Five patients were alive after a median follow-up of 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with advanced CLL refractory to fludarabine therapy are unlikely to benefit from treatment with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine. Although 20 percent of the patients have some response, thrombocytopenia and anemia are rarely corrected and may be made worse by 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine therapy.","[""O'Brien, S"", 'Kantarjian, H', 'Estey, E', 'Koller, C', 'Robertson, B', 'Beran, M', 'Andreeff, M', 'Pierce, S', 'Keating, M']","[""O'Brien S"", 'Kantarjian H', 'Estey E', 'Koller C', 'Robertson B', 'Beran M', 'Andreeff M', 'Pierce S', 'Keating M']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Remission Induction', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1994/02/03 00:00,1994/02/03 00:01,['1994/02/03 00:00'],"['1994/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199402033300504 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1994 Feb 3;330(5):319-22. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199402033300504.,,,"['N Engl J Med. 1994 Jun 23;330(25):1828-9; author reply 1829-30.

Cladribine (2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine) is a synthetic purine nucleoside developed for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. It appears that cladribine interferes with lymphocyte proliferation by inhibiting DNA repair. The pharmacokinetics of cladribine best fit a two-compartment, first-order-elimination model. Of the conditions that have been treated with cladribine, hairy cell leukemia (HCL) has shown the most dramatic response. Overall response rates in clinical studies have ranged from 80% to 100%, with a large majority of these being complete remissions; median durations of responses have ranged from about 9 to 16 months. Other conditions that have responded to cladribine are chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, low-grade lymphomas, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The drug is inactive against solid tumors. The principal dose-limiting adverse effect of cladribine is bone marrow suppression; fever, immunosuppression, renal and neurologic effects, and local skin reactions have also been reported. The drug is typically administered as an extended continuous i.v. infusion. The usual dosage for treating HCL is 0.1 mg/kg/day for seven days. The estimated cost of cladribine for treating an average patient with HCL is $3500. Cladribine has shown efficacy against a variety of hematologic malignancies, notably HCL and CLL.","['Baltz, J K', 'Montello, M J']","['Baltz JK', 'Montello MJ']","['Pharmaceutical Management Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20852.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Pharm,Clinical pharmacy,8207437,['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)'],IM,"['*Cladribine/administration & dosage/economics/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Hematologic Diseases/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Models, Biological']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Pharm. 1993 Nov;12(11):805-13; quiz 860-2.,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This deregulation of cell proliferation results from altered production of a handful of proteins that play key roles in progression through the eukaryotic cell cycle. Some of these proteins include tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes. However, no one general change or alteration of a critical gene has yet been found in all cancers. Using surgical material obtained from patients with various malignancies, we show that breast cancers and other solid tumors, as well as malignant lymphocytes from patients with lymphatic leukemia, show severe quantitative and qualitative alterations in cyclin E protein production independent of the S-phase fraction of the samples. Hence, these alterations represent a true difference between normal versus tumor tissue. In addition, in breast cancer, the alterations in cyclin E expression become progressively worse with increasing stage and grade of the tumor, suggesting its potential use as a new prognostic marker.","['Keyomarsi, K', ""O'Leary, N"", 'Molnar, G', 'Lees, E', 'Fingert, H J', 'Pardee, A B']","['Keyomarsi K', ""O'Leary N"", 'Molnar G', 'Lees E', 'Fingert HJ', 'Pardee AB']","['Division of Cell Growth and Regulation, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast/*chemistry', 'Breast Neoplasms/*chemistry/pathology', 'Cyclins/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen']",1994/01/15 00:00,1994/01/15 00:01,['1994/01/15 00:00'],"['1994/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Jan 15;54(2):380-5.,,,,,"['CA08949-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 24571/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also found that the number of transferrin receptors could be down-regulated by calcium channel blockers, and that such down-regulation diminished drug resistance, suggesting a hitherto unrecognised role for transferrin receptors in drug resistance.","['Barabas, K', 'Faulk, W P']","['Barabas K', 'Faulk WP']","['Center for Reproduction and Transplantation Immunology, Methodist Hospital of Indiana, Indianapolis 46202.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Carrier Proteins/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/toxicity', '*Drug Resistance', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/15 00:00,1993/12/15 00:01,['1993/12/15 00:00'],"['1993/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(83)72536-2 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1993.2536 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1993 Dec 15;197(2):702-8. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1993.2536.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This reagent had no effect on the respective parental CCRF-CEM and K562 cell lines. The use of 1.25 microM ICI 182,780 resulted in a 6- to 7-fold decrease in doxorubicin resistance in the CEM/A7 and CEM/VLB100 cell lines. A dose-response effect was observed at ICI 182,780 concentrations of up to 5 microM. As compared with tamoxifen (TAM), ICI 182,780 was 2 and 4 times more effective in the K562/VIN100 and CEM/A7 cell lines, respectively. ICI 182,780 at 0.625 microM increased [3H]-daunomycin uptake (P < 0.0001) as effectively as 5 microM TAM in the resistant CEM/A7 line.

However, the addition of 10 microM EST to 1-2 microM ICI 182,780 did not inhibit the ability of ICI 182,780 to modulate doxorubicin resistance in the two resistant cell lines.

In patients with chronic granulocytic leukemia in blast crisis, daily tiazofurin infusions decreased the high IMP DH activity in blast cells and resulted in 77% response (G. Weber. In: R. A. Harkness et al., Purine and Pyrimidine Metabolism in Man, Vol. VII, Part B, pp. 287-292, 1991). However, patients relapsed in a few weeks with emergence of high IMP DH activity (G. Tricot et al., Int. J. Cell Cloning, 8: 161-170, 1990). The present study showed that the tiazofurin-induced depression of IMP DH activity in rat bone marrow can be maintained by ribavirin injection. Tiazofurin (150 mg/kg, i.p., once a day for 2 days) decreased IMP DH activity to 10% and ribavirin (250 mg/kg, i.p., once a day for the subsequent 3 days) maintained the enzymic activity at 20 to 30% of control values. In control rats where no ribavirin was given, IMP DH activity of the tiazofurin-treated rats rapidly returned to the range of untreated animals. The decrease of IMP DH activity (t1/2 = 2.6 h) sharply preceded that of the bone marrow cellularity (t1/2 = 17.4 h). In addition to the target enzyme, IMP DH, tiazofurin also decreased activities of the guanylate metabolic enzymes, guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and GMP reductase, and the pyrimidine salvage enzymes, deoxycytidine and thymidine kinases with t1/2 of 2.6, 4.7, 6.0, 3.4, and 6.5 h, respectively. In cycloheximide-treated rats, where much of protein biosynthesis was blocked, the t1/2(8) of these five enzymes in bone marrow were shorter, 1.6, 4.3, 3.0, 0.6, and 0.8 h, respectively. Thus, the impact of tiazofurin in the bone marrow entails a decrease in the activity of the target enzyme, IMP DH, and also of other enzymes in purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis as a result of the enzyme half-lives shortened by this drug. These novel observations should assist in achieving better protection and recovery of bone marrow during and after chemotherapy.","['Prajda, N', 'Hata, Y', 'Abonyi, M', 'Singhal, R L', 'Weber, G']","['Prajda N', 'Hata Y', 'Abonyi M', 'Singhal RL', 'Weber G']","['Laboratory for Experimental Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5200.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.6.- (NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.7.1.7 (GMP Reductase)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'GMP Reductase', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Male', 'NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred ACI', 'Ribavirin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Thymidine Kinase/metabolism']",1993/12/15 00:00,1993/12/15 00:01,['1993/12/15 00:00'],"['1993/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Dec 15;53(24):5982-6.,,,,,"['CA-42510/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 TW00031/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells from 32/41 cases were also assessed for daunorubicin (DNR) accumulation and retention by flow cytometry (FC). Nineteen of the 41 (46%) patients were positive for MDR by JSB-1 immunocytochemistry (11/27 [41%] at presentation and 8/14 [57%] relapsed or resistant cases).

Of the twenty five FC negative patients, 6 had received previous chemotherapy and 15 (60%) achieved complete remission. Mdr 1 mRNA levels were increased in all seven FC positive cases whereas only 7/19 JSB-1 positive cases had raised mdr 1 mRNA levels. These results suggest that the assessment of MDR status by immunocytochemistry using JSB-1 is not predictive of response to chemotherapy.

To improve the detection of clonal Ig heavy-chain (IgH) gene rearrangements, we carefully determined the precise restriction map of the joining (J)H and constant (C)mu region of the IgH locus, and evaluated relevant combinations of restriction enzymes with JH and C mu probes. Our extensive Southern blot analyses revealed that rearrangements in the JH region are optimally detectable by use of a JH probe in combination with at least two restriction enzyme digests which are not affected by polymorphisms, and which produce small germline bands (e.g. BglII and BamHI/HindIII), thereby reducing the chance of comigration of germline and/or rearranged bands. Application of a JH or a C mu probe in combination with BamHI or EcoRI digests should be avoided, because of the large size of the restriction fragments and the occurrence of polymorphisms. Comparison of different types of JH probes demonstrated that optimally reproducible signals, independent of the rearranged JH gene segment, are only obtained if the JH probe is complementary to the 3' flanking sequences of the JH gene region, such as our IGHJ6 probe.","['Beishuizen, A', 'Verhoeven, M A', 'Mol, E J', 'Breit, T M', 'Wolvers-Tettero, I L', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Beishuizen A', 'Verhoeven MA', 'Mol EJ', 'Breit TM', 'Wolvers-Tettero IL', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Dijkzigt/Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern/methods', 'DNA Probes', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Restriction Mapping']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Dec;7(12):2045-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seven antioncogenes have been cloned through the study of these persons, and several others have been mapped. An eighth one was mapped and cloned through the investigation of tumors and is not yet known in hereditary form. Three dominantly inherited forms of cancer are not attributable to mutations in antioncogenes. The corresponding nonhereditary forms of most cancers generally reveal abnormalities of the same antioncogenes that are found in the hereditary forms but may also show additional ones. Some cancers, especially the embryonal tumors of children, have a small number of antioncogene mutations; some others, such as most sarcomas, have more, and the common carcinomas have the most, reflecting a hierarchy of controls over growth of stem cell populations. Still more members of this gene category remain to be mapped and cloned through the study of cancer families and of tumors.

The majority of the t(10;14) chromosomal translocation breakpoints have been mapped to the 5' end of the HOX-11 gene, supporting the notion that deregulation of the HOX-11 gene by the t(10;14) chromosomal translocation contributed importantly to leukemia formation. To further define the role of the HOX-11 homeoprotein, we have prepared rabbit antiserum against a trpE-HOX-11 fusion protein. The purified anti-HOX-11 IgG immuno-precipitated a protein with apparent relative molecular mass of 40 kD. Biochemical fractionation demonstrated that the protein is localized in the nucleus.

The HTLV Lymphoma Study Group.,1447-50,"Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) has been implicated in the aetiology of adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma in Japan and elsewhere, particularly the Caribbean. We have carried out parallel case-control studies in Jamaica and in Trinidad and Tobago to quantify the role of HTLV-I in the development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). 135 cases of NHL were enrolled in Jamaica and 104 in Trinidad and Tobago. Controls were selected from patients treated in the same wards or clinics at the same time as the cases. Overall, patients with NHL were 10 times more likely than were controls to be seropositive for HTLV-I (Jamaica odds ratio 10.3 [95% CI 6.0-18.0], Trinidad and Tobago 14.4 [7.6-27.2]). In both countries the association between NHL and HTLV-I was greatest for T-cell lymphomas (18.3 [9.5-35.6] and 63.3 [25-167]). Among T-cell lymphomas especially, there was no significant difference between men and women in the association between NHL and HTLV-I, but there was a significant inverse relation between age and likelihood of HTLV-I seropositivity. B-cell lymphomas were predominant in the older age groups and were not associated with HTLV-I seropositivity. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that early life exposure to HTLV-I is important for risk of subsequent ATL. Prevention of vertical transmission of HTLV-I could reduce by 70-80% cases of NHL in people under 60 years in this region.","['Manns, A', 'Cleghorn, F R', 'Falk, R T', 'Hanchard, B', 'Jaffe, E S', 'Bartholomew, C', 'Hartge, P', 'Benichou, J', 'Blattner, W A']","['Manns A', 'Cleghorn FR', 'Falk RT', 'Hanchard B', 'Jaffe ES', 'Bartholomew C', 'Hartge P', 'Benichou J', 'Blattner WA']","['Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland 20852.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*analysis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Jamaica', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Trinidad and Tobago']",1993/12/11 00:00,1993/12/11 00:01,['1993/12/11 00:00'],"['1993/12/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/11 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/11 00:00 [entrez]']","['0140-6736(93)92931-I [pii]', '10.1016/0140-6736(93)92931-i [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1993 Dec 11;342(8885):1447-50. doi: 10.1016/0140-6736(93)92931-i.,,,,,"['NCI N01-CP-31006/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NCI N01-CP-61002/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we investigated the mechanism of Thy-1-mediated activation and compared it with activation induced by cross-linking of the high-affinity IgE receptor. Binding of an IgG Thy-1 x 1-specific mAb, MRCOX7 (OX7), to RBL-2H3 cells and mast cells, and activation of RBL-2H3 by the OX7 were abrogated by pretreatment of the cells with phosphatidyl inositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). The F(ab')2 fragment of OX7, in contrast to the Fab' fragment, induced cell activation as well as intact OX7 mAb. Cells sensitized with IgE exhibited an increased responsiveness to anti-Thy-1 antibodies suggesting formation of functional complexes of IgE receptor/IgE/Thy-1/anti-Thy-1. Pretreatment of RBL-2H3 cells with cholera toxin potentiated activation induced by IgE+antigen (Ag) and IgE+OX7, but had no effect on activation induced by OX7 antibody alone. Similarly, dexamethasone had no effect on OX7-induced activation but inhibited IgE+Ag- and IgE+OX7-induced activation. Analysis of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in RBL-2H3 cell lysates revealed that IgE+Ag and IgE+OX7 induced a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins that were not tyrosine phosphorylated in cells exposed to OX7 mAb alone. Similar results were obtained when RBL-2H3-derived cells, expressing transfected mouse Thy-1.2, were activated with Thy-1.2-specific IgM antibody. The combined data suggest that Thy-1-specific antibodies activate cells by a mechanism that is different from activation induced by cross-linking of high-affinity IgE receptor.","['Draberova, L', 'Draber, P']","['Draberova L', 'Draber P']","['Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of Czech Republic, Praha.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phosphoinositide Phospholipase C)', 'EC 4.6.1.13 (Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Cholera Toxin/immunology', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Dexamethasone/immunology', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase', 'Phosphoinositide Phospholipase C', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/immunology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*immunology', 'Receptors, IgE/*immunology', 'Thy-1 Antigens', 'Tyrosine/immunology']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1993 Sep;80(1):103-9.,,,,,,,PMC1422128,,,,,,,,,,,

The sensitivity of both methods depended on the ability to discriminate low resistance cells from sensitive ones. Therefore, K562 cells with decreasing vinblastine (VLB) resistance levels were examined, the lowest resistance level being nonmeasurable with a colorimetric MTT assay. The fluorescent drug daunorubicin (DNR) was measured in combination with two modulators of MDR, cyclosporin-A (CsA) and verapamil (Vp) in a functional flow cytometric assay. When compared to sensitive cells, DNR uptake levels at steady state were reduced in all resistant cell lines, except for the lowest resistant cell line. The effect of modulator, CsA, on DNR uptake was seen in all resistant sublines, compared to sensitive cells, except for the lowest resistant cells. In another assay, the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression was analysed with monoclonal antibodies, MRK16 and C219. MRK16 was found to be the most sensitive antibody to screen for MDR+ cells, since we could show Pgp hyperexpression in all resistant cells. C219 reactivity became evident in cells possessing resistance factors higher than 5. These results indicate that both the functional assay and the Pgp assay are sensitive to be used for screening of MDR+ cells.","['Van Acker, K L', 'Van Hove, L M', 'Boogaerts, M A']","['Van Acker KL', 'Van Hove LM', 'Boogaerts MA']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Research, University Hospital of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Carrier Proteins/*analysis/immunology', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis/immunology', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990140706 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1993 Oct;14(7):736-46. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990140706.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, several types of in vitro and in vivo assay systems have been devised for very early haemopoietic cells in man.

A combination of PMA and TNF-alpha can induce adherence of purified B-CLL cells, which acquire a dendritic cell-like appearance. This phenomenon that we have termed spreading, is accompanied by upregulation of expression of both beta 1 and beta 2 integrin molecules. Spreading was inhibited by the addition of antibodies against CD18 or CD11c. In other B cell malignancies (HCL and NHL), morphological changes could be induced by PMA in the absence of TNF-alpha. Culturing in the presence of prednisolone resulted in an inhibition of spreading, most likely mediated via a down regulation of CD18 and CD11c expression.

The inducers up-regulated the expression of CD11b (without changing the surface expression of other markers, e.g. CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD68, HLA-DR) and completely down-regulated the originally strong expression of myeloperoxidase and c-myc at the mRNA level.

Clinically, both cases achieved complete remission by the combination chemotherapy consisting of L-asparaginase, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (L-AdVP). In remission, all these molecular abnormalities disappeared in both patients. These results suggest that the Ph1-positive and monosomy 7 AMLL in adults is de novo acute leukemia with both early B-lymphoid and myeloid phenotypes and may arise from malignant transformation of pluripotent stem cell, and expresses a heterogenous rearrangement pattern of the BCR gene.","['Hamaguchi, H', 'Nakamura, Y', 'Nagata, K', 'Shiba, S', 'Arimura, H', 'Muroga, K', 'Miyake, S', 'Ohkawa, Y', 'Morio, T']","['Hamaguchi H', 'Nakamura Y', 'Nagata K', 'Shiba S', 'Arimura H', 'Muroga K', 'Miyake S', 'Ohkawa Y', 'Morio T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Musashino Red Cross Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'CD13 Antigens', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/pathology', 'Chromosome Fragility', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monosomy', 'Multigene Family', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'Phenotype', '*Philadelphia Chromosome']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Nov;7(11):1752-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A major problem for collection of peripheral blood progenitor cells has been determination of optimal time to start leukapheresis and of the adequate amount of progenitor cells. This study has demonstrated that an induction chemotherapy with augmented dosage of CEF (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, 5-fluorouracil) in conjunction with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CM-CSF) successfully mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells in 15 patients with metastatic breast cancer. By monitoring the granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM), erythrocyte burst-forming units (BFU-E), and CD34+ cells in peripheral blood daily after leukocyte nadir, we have identified an optimal 'window' in which concentrations of blood progenitor cells reached a maximum range. Although the time interval between chemotherapy and the time for maximum stimulation could vary from between 13 days to 19 days, maximum mobilization started consistently 2 days after the white blood cells (WBC) recovered to > 2.0 x 10(9)/l after nadir, and remained elevated for 4 to 5 days. A significant reduction of progenitor cells in peripheral blood and in the corresponding leukapheresis products was observed, however, from cycle 1 versus subsequent cycles (p < 0.0001), but there was no significant difference between cycles 2 and 3. When used as the sole source of hematopoietic support for super-dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, and carboplatin, these progenitor cells induce rapid and sustained reconstitution in all patients. The median time from reinfusion to recovery of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to > 0.5 x 10(9)/l was 13 days (range 9-18 days) and to an unmaintained platelet count of > 50 x 10(9)/l, 12 days (range 10-35 days). Autologous transplantation with stimulated blood progenitor cells can be an efficient alternative to bone marrow transplantation. With optimal timing for collections, as few as two leukapheresis procedures are required to obtain an adequate progenitor cell dose.","['Ho, A D', 'Gluck, S', 'Germond, C', 'Sinoff, C', 'Dietz, G', 'Maruyama, M', 'Corringham, R E']","['Ho AD', 'Gluck S', 'Germond C', 'Sinoff C', 'Dietz G', 'Maruyama M', 'Corringham RE']","['Northeastern Ontario Regional Cancer Centre, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/blood/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukapheresis/methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Nov;7(11):1738-46.,,,['Leukemia. 1994 Nov;8(11):2020-1.

Sixteen (80%) patients were positive with MRK-16 whereas all patients were positive with JSB-1. The proportion of Pgp-positive lymphocytes from each patient sample varied from 2-94% for MRK-16 and 20-93% for JSB-1. There was no correlation between the level of positivity and disease stage or treatment history. In vitro drug resistance to vincristine (VCR) and doxorubicin (DOX) was determined by the colorimetric MTT assay. All patients were resistant to one or both drugs being consistent with the expression of Pgp. There was no correlation between the level of resistance and disease stage or drug treatment. We investigated the expression of Pgp in the normal counterpart of the B-CLL cells, CD5+CD19+ B-lymphocytes. A minor subpopulation (3%) of CD5+CD19+ lymphocytes isolated from normal controls expressed Pgp suggesting that these cells may be the potential precursors to the B-CLL cell.

EICAR causes a rapid and marked inhibition of inosinate (IMP) dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.205) activity in intact L1210 and CEM cells reflected by a concentration-dependent accumulation of IMP and depletion of GTP and dGTP levels. EICAR 5'-monophosphate is a potent inhibitor of purified L1210 cell IMP dehydrogenase (Ki/Km 0.06). Inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase by EICAR 5'-monophosphate is competitive with respect to IMP. L1210 cells that were selected for resistance to the cytostatic action of EICAR proved to be adenosine kinase-deficient. Also, studies with other mutant L1210 and CEM cell lines revealed that adenosine kinase, as well as an alternative pathway, may be responsible for the conversion of EICAR to its 5'-monophosphate.

CD4 and not CD8 was comodulated with the T-cell receptor complex, supporting the existence of a docking site on the TCR with selectivity for CD4 or CD8 but not both. Fewer than 45 SEA molecules per presenting cell led to detectable comodulation. The ratio of %CD4/%TCR modulation varied with both time and the amount of SEA used for stimulation. ConA or PHA induced modulation of CD3 but, unlike SEA, failed to induce IL-2 secretion, suggesting multiple pathways and states of T-cell activation.

Apoptosis is an active process of programmed cell suicide and now is believed to be an important target for tumor chemotherapy. In this report, the apoptosis inducing effect of HT and HHT in HL-60 cells were observed. The experiments demonstrated that 2 x 10(-7) mol.L-1 of HT and 10(-7) mol.L-1 of HHT could induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells when the cells were exposed to HT and HHT for 4 h. In agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA extracted from HL-60 cells treated with HT and HHT showed a typical internucleosomal DNA degradation, i.e., DNA ladder and parallel morphological changes as nuclear chromosome segmentation and condensation as well as cytoplasma vacuolation. This effect of HT and HHT was shown to appear in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The efficacy of HT and HHT in inducing apoptosis of HL-60 cells was found to parallel with their cytotoxic activity in HL-60 cells.

Microgel electrophoresis of DNA after an exhaustive lysis of cells (in the presence of sodium laurylsarcosine and proteinase for 20-24 h at room temperature) disclosed not only heterogeneity in DNA migration length among LY-R cells (LR) and LY-S cells (LS), but also differences between two strains with respect to this parameter. L-value for LY-S cells exceeds that for LY-R strain by 20 per cent, and the ratio LS/LR remains constant regardless of the voltage applied. Thus, the cell distribution pattern according to L-value is the intrinsic parameter for both LY-R and LY-S cells, and DNA of LY-S cells is suggested to bear more background strand breaks as compared with the radioresistant LY-R cells. LY-R cells irradiated with 10 Gy repair their DNA completely after 60-90 min of incubation at 37 degrees C but DNA migration pattern for irradiated and repaired LY-S cells is characterized by the predominance of DNA with a higher L-value than that for intact cells.

By 1 January 1992, there were 60 leukemia deaths among the irradiated patients, almost treble that expected from national rates. Leukemia mortality was not increased among unirradiated patients. Among those irradiated, the ratio of observed to expected deaths for leukemia other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia was greatest in the period 1-5 years after the first treatment (ratio = 11.01, 95% confidence interval 5.26-20.98) and decreased to 1.87 (95% confidence interval 0.94-3.36) in the 25+ year period.

The ratio for chronic lymphocytic leukemia was slightly but not significantly raised (ratio = 1.44, 95% confidence interval 0.62-2.79). Most irradiated patients received all their exposure within a year. Based on a 1 in 15 random sample, the mean total marrow dose was 4.38 Gy. Doses were nonuniform, with heaviest doses to the lower spine. The risk for nonchronic lymphocytic leukemia was adequately described by a linear-exponential model that allowed for cell sterilization in heavily exposed parts of the marrow and time since exposure. Ten years after first exposure, the linear component of excess relative risk was 12.37 per Gy (95% confidence interval 2.25-52.07), and it was estimated that cell sterilization reduced the excess relative risk by 47% at 1 Gy (95% confidence interval 17%-79%).

METHODS: A multicentric randomized trial was conducted in 222 adults who had fever (38 degrees C for > 3 h) during a period of aplasia (white cell count < 0.5.10(9)/l for 22.9 +/- 10.4 days) induced by chemotherapy for acute leukaemia (68.1%) or by bone marrow autograft for lymphoma, myeloma or solid tumour (30.3%). 109 patients were assigned to the piperacillin (12 g/d)/tazobactam (1.5 g/d)+amikacin group and 113 to the ceftazidime (3 g/d)+amikacin group. Evaluation criteria were the frequency of apyrexia after a 72-hour antibiotic regimen and major infectious events defined as death due to infection and severe infections causing a delay in the chemotherapy protocol. RESULTS: Data obtained in 188 patients who fulfilled all the protocol criteria were evaluated. The episode of fever was controlled better with the piperacillin/tazobactam+amikacin combination (apyrexia achieved in 60.6% of the patients vs 44.7% in the ceftazidime+amikacin group, p = 0.028) and there were fewer superinfections (23% vs 41% respectively, p < 0.008). Tolerance was similar in the two groups. In vitro, 56% of the strains resistant to piperacillin and isolated prior to treatment were sensitive to the piperacillin/tazobactam combination. Among the strains isolated (41 Gram-, 61 Gram+), 72% were sensitive to ceftazidime and 84% were sensitive to the piperacillin/tazobactam combination. There were 16 deaths due to infection (8.5%) with no difference according to antibiotic regimen. There was no difference in toxicity. CONCLUSION: Tolerance was similar in the two groups.

(1994) Neuroscience 59, 275-284]. These grafts contained choline acetyltransferase immunopositive chromaffin cells and received cholinergic innervation. In the experiments reported here, adrenal medulla grafts implanted in lesioned hippocampus were treated with cholinergic differentiation factor/leukemia inhibitory factor. In the presence of this factor, the number of chromaffin cells with cholinergic phenotypes increased as well as the beneficial effects of the grafts on the performances of rats in the radial maze. These results suggest that the functional effects of adrenal medulla grafted into the hippocampus set into play cholinergic mechanisms. The cholinergic differentiation factor/leukemia inhibitory factor may also have facilitated the survival and recovery of cholinergic neurons in the host tissue. However, due to the large range of action of this cytokine and the richness of the adrenal medulla contents, non cholinergic factors are also probably involved. Our results may help to elucidate the functions of the cholinergic differentiation factor/leukemia inhibitory factor since they provide the first indication that its intracerebral injection may have behavioral effects. Moreover, our data confirm the possibility of improving the efficiency of adrenal medulla implants in the central nervous system by appropriate treatments, not only by facilitating survival but also by selectively amplifying some potential factors of the graft. This might greatly enlarge the field of this grafting technique for analysing the normal functioning of the brain and for repairing it.","['Collery, M', 'Delacour, J', 'Jousselin-Hosaja, M']","['Collery M', 'Delacour J', 'Jousselin-Hosaja M']","['Laboratoire de Psychophysiologie, Universite Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', 'DL48G20X8X (Scopolamine)']",IM,"['Adrenal Medulla/enzymology/*transplantation', 'Animals', 'Chromaffin System/cytology/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Hippocampus/metabolism/*physiology', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Maze Learning/drug effects/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Scopolamine/pharmacology']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0306-4522(94)90513-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0306-4522(94)90513-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 1994 Dec;63(3):667-77. doi: 10.1016/0306-4522(94)90513-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of intraperitoneal, intracarotid, intravenous, intrathecal and intracerebral routes of transplantation were analysed, and the significance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in preventing neoplastic cell invasion was studied by disrupting the BBB with focal cold injury. Extraneurally transplanted cells appeared first in the dura and subarachnoid space. From the latter they spread further into the perivascular space of penetrating cortical vessels. Parenchymal tumour cell foci were only seen in terminally ill rats, usually associated with damage to the vessel wall. Intrathecal transplantation did not accelerate the progression of the disease. Intracerebrally transplanted cells readily produced parenchymal infiltrates with diffuse invasion into the white matter, perivascular spreading into the cortex, and contralateral extension along the corpus callosum. Parenchymal invasion did not occur immediately after disruption of the BBB, but in the chronic phase neoplastic cells infiltrated the injured area. In conclusion, the model closely resembles human CNS leukaemia. Malignant cells appeared to enter the CNS through the deficient BBB of the subarachnoid vessels, whereas the BBB of the intracerebral vessels and perivascular glia limitans were very resistant to leukaemic cell invasion. This underlines the difference between the subarachnoid and perivascular v. intraparenchymal compartments. Preceding BBB damage may predispose to brain metastases. The parenchymal dissemination of malignant cells was similar to that in primary CNS lymphoma and it followed the same spreading pathways as the extracellular fluid.","['Aho, R', 'Vaittinen, S', 'Jahnukainen, K', 'Kalimo, H']","['Aho R', 'Vaittinen S', 'Jahnukainen K', 'Kalimo H']","['Department of Pathology, University of Turku, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol,Neuropathology and applied neurobiology,7609829,,IM,"['Animals', '*Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Central Nervous System/*pathology', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2990.1994.tb01009.x [doi]'],ppublish,Neuropathol Appl Neurobiol. 1994 Dec;20(6):551-61. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2990.1994.tb01009.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Internalization of fluorescent particles by cells exhibiting the phagocytic positive phenotype (phag+) provides a sensitive indication of promoter-induced differentiation, and the resulting fluorescent cells can be quantitatively analyzed by flow cytometry. The current study was initiated to further test the predictive power of a flow cytometry based HL-60 differentiation assay in the detection of agents associated with tumor promotion. Specifically, experiments were designed to assess the sensitivity of the test system to co-promoters which enhance promoter activity in vivo. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was chosen as a model co-promoter since it has been shown to potentiate phorbol ester (i.e. 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate; TPA) induced biological effects in vivo. Results detailed in the current report indicate that PGE2 enhances TPA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner. As with in vivo co-promotion experiments, PGE2 exhibited a maximum potentiating effect when administered prior to TPA. These data indicate that HL-60 cells are not only sensitive to phorbol promoters, but also to the co-promoter PGE2. These experiments support the hypothesis that a flow cytometry based HL-60 assay may prove useful for studying chemical agents or intrinsic cellular factors that are involved in the tumor promotion phase of carcinogenesis.","['Dertinger, S D', 'Torous, D K', 'Tometsko, A M']","['Dertinger SD', 'Torous DK', 'Tometsko AM']","['Litron Laboratories, Rochester, NY 14620, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Carcinogens)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Dinoprostone/*toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fibroblasts', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Phagocytes', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['002751079400195B [pii]', '10.1016/0027-5107(94)00195-b [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1995 Apr;328(1):55-62. doi: 10.1016/0027-5107(94)00195-b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that oxidation of cellular sulfhydryl (SH) groups induces apoptosis. In Jurkat T cells and human PBL blasts, the fraction of apoptotic nuclei increased after treatment with an SH-specific oxidant, diamide. Analysis of DNA fragmentation and nuclear morphology also indicated that SH oxidation could induce apoptosis. In the apoptosis induced by SH oxidation, the decrease of cellular glutathione was transient and the increase of glutathione disulfide was observed only after apoptotic changes had occurred. Depletion of cellular glutathione with buthionine sulfoximine failed to induce apoptosis, despite a marked decrease of cellular glutathione, which was greater than that observed in apoptosis induced by diamide. Thus, the changes of cellular glutathione or glutathione disulfide may not be the major cause of apoptosis induced by diamide.

The effects of these divalent metal ions on growth rate and DNA degradation were evaluated. Measurements were done on one dex-sensitive (CEM-C7) and three different dex-resistant variants (CEM-C1, CEM-4R4, and CEM-ICR27). Dex caused a continuous increase in the Ca(II) level in dex-sensitive CEM-C7 cells, while in CEM-C1 cells dex caused an initial increase in the Ca(II) level which in approximately 36 h was restored to its normal value. The intracellular Ca(II) level in CEM-4R4 cells was not significantly affected by dex, while that of CEM-ICR27 cells decreased after dex incubation. Only the dex-sensitive CEM-C7 cells showed dex-induced DNA degradation. An intracellular free Zn(II) level of approximately 1 nM was measured for the dex-resistant CEM-C1 cells. No detectable level of intracellular Zn(II) was found in the other cell lines. Incubation with < 100 microM Zn(II) did not inhibit dex-induced apoptosis in CEM-C7 cells (e.g., DNA degradation). Treatment with approximately 250 microM Zn(II) caused significant decrease in growth rate in all cell lines and prevented dex-induced DNA degradation in CEM-C7 cells. A calibrated amount of Ca(II) ionophore (A23187), used to increase Ca(II) concentrations up to the dex-induced levels, did not induce DNA degradation in CEM-C7 or CEM-C1 cells. While elevation of intracellular Ca(II) by itself is not sufficient to initiate apoptosis in CEM-C7 cells, the results reported here suggest that Ca(II) is involved in the killing mechanism as a secondary factor. The combination of dex and ionophore caused significant DNA degradation in CEM-C1 cells, which normally showed resistance to each compound individually. The combination of dex and the Zn(II) chelator phenanthroline also caused extensive DNA degradation in the normally dex-resistant CEM-C1 cells, suggesting that Zn(II) plays a role in the dex resistance of these cells.","['Adebodun, F', 'Post, J F']","['Adebodun F', 'Post JF']","['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77555-0653.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', ""85233-21-2 (5,5'-difluoro-1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic"", 'acid)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Egtazic Acid/analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc/*metabolism']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041630109 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1995 Apr;163(1):80-6. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041630109.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the expression of Myc is necessary for cell proliferation, the expression of Mad is induced upon differentiation of at least some leukemia cell lines. Here, the expression of the mad gene has been explored in developing mouse tissues. During organogenesis in mouse embryos mad mRNA was predominantly expressed in the liver and in the mantle layer of the developing brain. At later stages mad expression was detected in neuroretina, epidermis, and whisker follicles, and in adult mice mad was expressed at variable levels in most organs analyzed. Interestingly, in the skin mad was highly expressed in the differentiating epidermal keratinocytes, but not in the underlying proliferating basal keratinocyte layer. Also, in the gut mad mRNA was abundant in the intestinal villi, where cells cease proliferation and differentiate, but not in the crypts, where the intestinal epithelial cells proliferate. In the testis, mad expression was associated with the completion of meiosis and early development of haploid cells. In cell culture, Mad inhibited colony formation of a mouse keratinocyte cell line and rat embryo fibroblast transformation by Myc and Ras. The pattern of mad expression in tissues and its ability to inhibit cell growth in vitro suggests that Mad can cause the cessation of cell proliferation associated with cell differentiation in vivo.","['Vastrik, I', 'Kaipainen, A', 'Penttila, T L', 'Lymboussakis, A', 'Alitalo, R', 'Parvinen, M', 'Alitalo, K']","['Vastrik I', 'Kaipainen A', 'Penttila TL', 'Lymboussakis A', 'Alitalo R', 'Parvinen M', 'Alitalo K']","['Molecular/Cancer Biology Laboratory, Haartman Institute, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MXD1 protein, human)', '0 (Mad protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Brain/embryology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Liver/embryology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Specificity', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Testis/metabolism']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1083/jcb.128.6.1197 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1995 Mar;128(6):1197-208. doi: 10.1083/jcb.128.6.1197.,,['GENBANK/X83106'],,,,,PMC2120421,,,,,,,,,,,

The intracellular localization of mcl-1, as well as the kinetics of its expression during differentiation, have now been studied. These studies show that the intracellular distribution of mcl-1 overlaps with, but is not identical to, that of bcl-2: mcl-1 is similar to bcl-2 in that the mcl-1 protein has a prominent mitochondrial localization, and in that it associates with membranes through its carboxyl hydrophobic tail. mcl-1 differs from bcl-2, however, in its relative distribution among other (nonmitochondrial/heavy membrane) compartments, mcl-1 also being abundant in the light membrane fraction of immature ML-1 cells while bcl-2 is abundant in the nuclear fraction. Similarly, in differentiating ML-1 cells, the timing of expression of mcl-1 overlaps with, but is not identical to, that of bcl-2: the mcl-1 protein increases rapidly as cells initiate differentiation, and mcl-1 is a labile protein. In contrast, bcl-2 decreases gradually as cells complete differentiation. Overall, the mcl-1 and bcl-2 proteins have some properties in common and others tht are distinct.

Clinico-pathological and molecular studies of HTLV-I-positive and -negative cases.,823-7,"T-cell malignancies in Brazil have a high seroprevalence rate of HTLV-I antibodies. We have analyzed the disease features in 188 Brazilian patients with a T-cell disorder. These included 40 with T-lymphoblastic leukaemia or lymphoma (T-ALL/T-LbLy) and 148 with mature T-cell diseases: 5 T-prolymphocytic leukaemia, 53 adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL), 54 cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, 29 pleomorphic T-cell lymphomas and 7 large granular lymphocyte leukaemia. The diagnosis was based on clinical, morphological and immunological features and HTLV-I serology. ATLL in Brazil has the same diseases features as in other endemic regions, the only apparent differences being: age, Brazilian patients being younger than Japanese, and ethnic grouping, one third of Brazilians being white Caucasians of European descent. We applied a scoring system based on the presence or absence of typical features associated with ATLL; hypercalcaemia, cell morphology, immunophenotype, histopathology and HTLV-I status, to see whether it may help in diagnosing cases of ATLL. All had high scores, whereas all other T-cell diseases scored low. Only 5 ATLL cases were HTLV-I-negative by serology, but they had otherwise typical features of ATLL, and their cells did not have HTLV-I proviral sequences by DNA analysis. Such cases suggest that ATLL may develop in a minority of individuals living in regions where it is endemic, without evidence of HTLV-I infection, and that other factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease.","['Pombo de Oliveira, M S', 'Matutes, E', 'Schulz, T', 'Carvalho, S M', 'Noronha, H', 'Reaves, J D', 'Loureiro, P', 'Machado, C', 'Catovsky, D']","['Pombo de Oliveira MS', 'Matutes E', 'Schulz T', 'Carvalho SM', 'Noronha H', 'Reaves JD', 'Loureiro P', 'Machado C', 'Catovsky D']","['Cell Markers Laboratory of Cancer Hospital, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*epidemiology/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",1995/03/16 00:00,1995/03/16 00:01,['1995/03/16 00:00'],"['1995/03/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/16 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910600617 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1995 Mar 16;60(6):823-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910600617.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous studies had suggested that HTLV-I carriers who have a monoclonal integration of HTLV-I proviral DNA in the peripheral blood cells, designated pre-ATL, account for about 2% of healthy carriers and are at high risk of developing ATL. Their ages ranged from 32 to 80 (median 57). Nevertheless, many cases of pre-ATL showed a long-lasting carrier state (10-year probability around 90%). In the present investigation we conducted a large-scale molecular detection of monoclonal integration in a population (481 cases) of healthy carriers with ages ranging from 16 to 82 (median 49) for the purpose of clarifying the earliest onset of this pre-ATL state. Southern-blot analysis of DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed 6 cases (1.2%) with a monoclonal band. All of these 6 were older than 40; no single positive case was found in 220 carriers under age 40. These results indicate that the molecularly detectable pre-ATL state also develops after a long latency. Thus the pre-ATL state seems to be a subtype of ATL showing an extremely indolent course of disease development, but not merely an early phase of all subtypes of ATL. We propose that, in order to reveal a promoter(s) responsible for the development of ATL from the pre-ATL state, intensive epidemiological investigation of life style, eating habits, occupation and exposure to carcinogens must be conducted on this unique group prone to ATL. It is also important to perform such an epidemiological study on the general population of carriers by paying special attention to the first 3-4 decades of each carrier's life in Japan and by comparing the data with those from carriers in different geographical areas of the world.","['Chen, Y X', 'Ikeda, S', 'Mori, H', 'Hata, T', 'Tsukasaki, K', 'Momita, S', 'Yamada, Y', 'Kamihira, S', 'Mine, M', 'Tomonaga, M']","['Chen YX', 'Ikeda S', 'Mori H', 'Hata T', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Momita S', 'Yamada Y', 'Kamihira S', 'Mine M', 'Tomonaga M']","['Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Preleukemia/*diagnosis/virology']",1995/03/16 00:00,1995/03/16 00:01,['1995/03/16 00:00'],"['1995/03/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/16 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910600612 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1995 Mar 16;60(6):798-801. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910600612.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before this study, only 2 ATL cases had been reported in French Guiana over a 10-year period. This demonstrates that the number of ATL cases is greatly under-estimated in most tropical HTLV-I endemic areas unless a specific disease search is performed. The mean age of the patients was 41 years. While HTLV-I antibodies were present in all cases, molecular studies demonstrated a clonal integration of HTLV-I in the tumoral cells in 7 cases out of the 9 tested.

The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively the alterations in hemostatic balance developing during the early period after BMT (up to day +21) and their relationships (if any) with VOD. PATIENTS AND RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (15 autologous and 14 allogeneic BMT) entered the study. No patient suffered from thrombotic and/or major hemorrhagic events. Since there were no differences between the two groups of patients with regard to modifications of coagulation parameters, they were considered together for the purposes of the study. We observed a progressive increase from baseline levels of fibrinogen, factor VIII activity (fVIII:C) and von Willebrand factor antigen (vWf), while factor VII antigen (fVIIAg), protein C and plasminogen significantly decreased. The alterations in these test values were maximal on day +14, with a trend towards normal levels one week later. There was no modification of PT, PTT, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F 1 + 2), fXIIC, tPA, PAI-1, D dimer or protein S levels; serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha were also unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that some alterations of the hemostatic system, probably a consequence of endothelial damage, can be detected early after BMT, but their clinical significance remains uncertain due to the lack of a correlation between hemostatic test alterations and the occurrence of thrombotic complications.","['Vannucchi, A M', 'Rafanelli, D', 'Longo, G', 'Bosi, A', 'Guidi, S', 'Saccardi, R', 'Filimberti, E', 'Cinotti, S', 'Grossi, A', 'Morfini, M']","['Vannucchi AM', 'Rafanelli D', 'Longo G', 'Bosi A', 'Guidi S', 'Saccardi R', 'Filimberti E', 'Cinotti S', 'Grossi A', 'Morfini M', 'et al.']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, University of Florence, Careggi Hospital, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Blood Coagulation Factors)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders/*etiology', 'Blood Coagulation Factors/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1994 Nov-Dec;79(6):519-25.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several agents, including verapamil and cyclosporine derivatives, can modify P170-related resistance in vitro and can be proposed as adjuvant treatment for leukemia and cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To investigate the optimal conditions for adjuvant treatment, D-verapamil (D-VRP), cyclosporin-A (CyA) and the cyclosporine derivative SDZ PSC 833 (PSC) were used alone and in combination at drug concentrations that can be achieved and maintained in vivo. The drugs were tested for their capacity to restore intracellular daunorubicin (DNR) and idarubicin (IDA) accumulation in high-resistance (CEM VLB 300) and intermediate-resistance (CEM VLB 100) cells to levels found in the non-resistant parental cell line (CCRF CEM). RESULTS: In intermediate-resistance cells, IDA alone was more easily restored than DNR plus modifiers, and intracellular IDA concentration was returned to the level of non-resistant cells with low-dose D-VRP (1 microM), CyA (0.8 microM) and PSC (0.4 microM). In high-resistance cells no modifier or modifier combination was able to restore intracellular DNR concentration to the value of non-resistant cells. Intracellular IDA concentration was almost completely restored only with D-VRP (2-3 microM) and CyA (0.8-1.6 microM) in combination or with PSC alone (0.4 microM). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that as far as P170-related resistance is concerned, IDA alone is as efficient as or even more efficient than DNR plus modifiers, and that residual resistance to IDA can be overcome with a combination of D-VRP and Cy-A at a clinically achievable concentration, or with a more powerful modifier like SDZ PSC 833.","['Michieli, M', 'Damiani, D', 'Michelutti, A', 'Candoni, A', 'Masolini, P', 'Scaggiante, B', 'Quadrifoglio, F', 'Baccarani, M']","['Michieli M', 'Damiani D', 'Michelutti A', 'Candoni A', 'Masolini P', 'Scaggiante B', 'Quadrifoglio F', 'Baccarani M']","['Department of Morphological and Clinical Research, University of Udine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*physiology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1994 Nov-Dec;79(6):500-7.,,,,,,['mdr-1'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In these studies, insulin-specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) was the only detection method for SICRI. The mouse melanoma B16BL6 cell line was found to be a rich source of SICRI. In this paper, we show that SICRI is not expressed in B16BL6 cells. Previous RIA measurements were wrongly ascribed to SICRI. What was really measured was a positive artifact caused by insulin tracer degradation in RIA. Several lines of evidence indicate that protease responsible for insulin degradation in B16BL6 cells in insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE; EC 3.4.22.11). First, SICRI activity of B16BL6 cytosol measured by insulin RIA was inhibited by thiol protease inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Thiol active agents as well as metal chelators, both potent IDE blockers, inhibited also the insulin-degrading activity of the same sample. Second, cross-linking to 125I-labeled insulin of partially purified sample with highest insulin RIA activity specifically labeled only a single protein with molecular mass similar to IDE (110 kDa). Labeling was blocked by 'cold' insulin in excess. Third, kinetic studies of insulin degradation by RIA active chromatographic fractions revealed an apparent Kd of 90 nM which is very similar to the reported affinity of insulin for IDE (Kd = 100 nM). Additionally, in B16BL6 as well as in mouse myeloid leukemia cells, IDE gene is actively transcribed and this expression was found to be much stronger than in normal mouse tissues. In conclusion, our results strongly question the real existence of SICRI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Saric, T', 'Seitz, H J', 'Pavelic, K']","['Saric T', 'Seitz HJ', 'Pavelic K']","['Rudjer Boskovic Institute, Department of Molecular Medicine, Zagreb, Croatia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Mol Cell Endocrinol,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,7500844,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'EC 3.4.24.56 (Insulysin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Insulin/*analysis/*metabolism', 'Insulysin/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Melanoma, Experimental/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Peptide Fragments/analysis/metabolism', 'Radioimmunoassay/*statistics & numerical data', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0303-7207(94)90182-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Endocrinol. 1994 Dec;106(1-2):23-9. doi: 10.1016/0303-7207(94)90182-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present the long-term outcome of 21 children with high-risk ALL who received prolonged intrathecal chemotherapy instead of the recommended cranial irradiation. Intrathecal triple therapy (methotrexate, hydrocortisone, and cytarabine) was administered every 2nd month throughout the maintenance phase. The average number of courses of intrathecal methotrexate was 8.7 and of triple 9.0. The 5-year event-free survival was 79%. No CNS relapses occurred. CT scan was performed at diagnosis, at cessation of therapy, and 3 years thereafter. No density abnormalities, pathological contrast enhancement, ventricular dilatation, or calcifications were found. One child showed cortical atrophy both at diagnosis and at cessation of therapy. There was a slight decrease in height SDS with time but no change in weight SDS. Delayed bone age was found in 5 children. No abnormalities of growth hormone, thyroid, adrenal, or gonadal function were observed. CONCLUSION: The study indicates that extended intrathecal chemotherapy in children with high-risk ALL may provide an effective protection from CNS relapses and is associated with a low risk of long-term side-effects.","['Hasle, H', 'Helgestad, J', 'Christensen, J K', 'Jacobsen, B B', 'Kamper, J']","['Hasle H', 'Helgestad J', 'Christensen JK', 'Jacobsen BB', 'Kamper J']","['Department of Paediatrics, Odense University Hospital, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,"['0 (Pituitary Hormones, Anterior)', '0 (Thyroid Hormones)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Brain/diagnostic imaging/drug effects/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Growth/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Pituitary Hormones, Anterior/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Thyroid Hormones/blood', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01972968 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 1995 Jan;154(1):24-9. doi: 10.1007/BF01972968.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the effect of LIF on bone formation in the absence of a resorption cycle, we used fetal rat calvaria cell cultures and quantified bone nodule production, which provides a colony assay to analyze the effects of factors on osteoprogenitor differentiation and bone formation. In these cultures, dexamethasone (Dex) stimulates bone nodule formation. In dose-response experiments, LIF inhibited bone nodule formation by cells cultured with (+Dex; ID50 = 250 U/ml) or without (-Dex; ID50 = 30 U/ml) 10(-8) M Dex. Residual nodules were small and poorly mineralized. Continuous exposure to LIF (500 U/ml) up to day 25 did not affect either the growth rate or saturation density of the cultures, but decreased alkaline phosphatase activity and bone nodule production, with greater inhibition in -Dex cultures. Exposure to LIF (500 U/ml) for 3 days early during nodule formation (about day 10) reduced bone nodule numbers to the same extent as continuous treatment in -Dex cultures and significantly, but less markedly, in +Dex cultures; earlier and later pulses had no effect. Northern blot analysis of expression of messenger RNAs of bone related proteins in cultures pulsed (-Dex) at various stages of development showed marked inhibition of alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin; slight inhibition of type I collagen; early stimulation of osteopontin; and no effect on Secreted Protein, Acidic and Rich in Cysteine/osteonectin. These results suggest that LIF is an inhibitor of bone nodule formation in these cultures, acting at a stage when late osteoprogenitors and/or early osteoblasts are present, and that Dex may modulate the effects of LIF by shifting effective doses to higher concentrations.","['Malaval, L', 'Gupta, A K', 'Aubin, J E']","['Malaval L', 'Gupta AK', 'Aubin JE']","['Medical Research Council Group in Periodontal Physiology, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Spp1 protein, rat)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bone and Bones/*cytology/embryology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Osteocalcin/genetics', '*Osteogenesis', 'Osteopontin', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Sialoglycoproteins/genetics']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.136.4.7895651 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 1995 Apr;136(4):1411-8. doi: 10.1210/endo.136.4.7895651.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This deregulated expression of c-myc is associated with mutations in the regulatory regions, i.e. the first exon and the first intron of c-myc in tumors where the chromosomal breakpoint is not itself within the regulatory region. Until recently it was widely believed that the c-myc protein in these tumors is wild type. We have demonstrated that in a fraction of Burkitt's lymphomas from Africa and from the continental USA, and in mouse plasmacytomas, the c-myc gene carries mutations in the coding region. We now show that, occasionally, such mutations are also present in multiple myelomas--tumors which do not carry translocations or amplifications of c-myc. We also show that the frequency of the c-myc coding region mutations in BL is independent of the frequency of mutations in the regulatory region. These results suggest that the mechanisms that induce missense mutations involving the coding region of c-myc may be different from those that lead to mutations in the regulatory regions.","['Bhatia, K', 'Spangler, G', 'Hamdy, N', 'Neri, A', 'Brubaker, G', 'Levin, A', 'Magrath, I']","['Bhatia K', 'Spangler G', 'Hamdy N', 'Neri A', 'Brubaker G', 'Levin A', 'Magrath I']","['Lymphoma Biology Section, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,0110513,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/virology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*ultrastructure', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', '*Genes, myc', 'Herpesviridae Infections/genetics/virology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/virology']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-79275-5_45 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 1995;194:389-98. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-79275-5_45.,,,,,,"['c-myc', 'myc']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Since IL-6 is a central growth factor for myeloma cells, an sIL-6R may modulate IL-6 activity. We have previously reported a novel IL-6R mRNA from myeloma cells that exhibits a 94-nt deletion of the entire transmembrane domain from codons 356 (G-TG) to 387 (AG-G). The transmembrane domain deletion results in a shift in the translational reading frame with the insertion of 10 new amino acids followed by a stop codon. Sequence analysis shows the ligand-binding domain of the sIL-6R to be identical to that of the membrane-bound IL-6R up to the transmembrane domain deletion. The sIL-6R cDNA was expressed in QT-6 fibroblasts and PA-1 ovarian cells using the expression vector pCDM8. Supernates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IL-6R antibody and cells transfected with the sIL-6R cDNA produced a single band with a molecular weight of 50-55 kDa. This molecular weight corresponds to the size of the sIL-6R protein observed in normal human urine. Supernates were collected from mock or sIL-6R transfected PA-1 cells after 48 hours and assayed for their ability to stimulate or suppress the growth of an IL-6 dependent cell line, ANBL-6. Soluble IL-6R alone had no effect on the growth of the ANBL-6 cells. However, the growth of ANBL-6 cells by sIL-6R was potentiated in the presence of IL-6 and could be blocked by anti-IL-6 antibody. The above results suggest that, in the presence of IL-6, sIL-6R associates with gp130 leading to signal transduction and cell growth.","['Lust, J A', 'Jelinek, D F', 'Donovan, K A', 'Frederick, L A', 'Huntley, B K', 'Braaten, J K', 'Maihle, N J']","['Lust JA', 'Jelinek DF', 'Donovan KA', 'Frederick LA', 'Huntley BK', 'Braaten JK', 'Maihle NJ']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,0110513,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Coturnix', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Fibrosarcoma/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin/chemistry/*genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Solubility', 'Teratocarcinoma/pathology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-79275-5_24 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 1995;194:199-206. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-79275-5_24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As an approach to this problem, aged NZB mice with a B cell lymphoproliferative disorder were chosen as a murine model. Three groups of NZB mice (2 months, 6 months and > 18 months) for a total of nineteen were studied. A complete autopsy including a CBC was performed on each mouse. Spleen cells were immunophenotyped and cell cycle analysis was performed. Spleen weight, peritoneal cell counts and absolute lymphocytes counts were all elevated in the oldest group. All mice showed evidence of extramedulary hematopoiesis and the older group showed lymphocytic infiltrates in the lacrymal glands, kidneys, liver and lungs. Two of the seven aged mice had a malignant lymphoma. One was a marginal zone lymphoma and the other a lymphocytic lymphoma. Splenic immunophenotyping showed a loss of T cells with an increase in B cells as the mice age. Cell cycle analysis revealed hyperdiploidy in all of the aged mice with a decrease in the percentage G0G1 cells. This disease appears to involve an absolute lymphocytosis of the peritoneum and the peripheral blood compartment. This is associated with splenic aneuploidy. The infiltration of the spleen by malignant cells of varying morphology is a late event.

We have therefore investigated 24 patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (14 autologous, 10 allogeneic) for hematological malignancies. Serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH), albumin-modified calcium, and biomarkers for bone turnover--osteocalcin, bone alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP), and carboxyterminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP)--were measured. The samples were collected before myeloablative treatment, on the day of bone marrow infusion and 1, 2, 3, and 12 weeks thereafter. A serum PTH peak was consistently seen the day after total body irradiation, but no long-term effects on PTH/calcium homeostasis were observed.

Pro-B, pre-B, and B lymphocytes were severely reduced but granulocytes were greatly elevated. This phenotype could be adoptively transferred with bone marrow cells. It was not alleviated by bcl-2 or myc transgenes that promote lymphocyte survival or proliferation. Bitransgenic myc/max 41 mice developed pre-B cell lymphoma. An accompanying massive granulocytosis unexpectedly proved to be clonally derived from the pre-B lymphoma cells. These observations suggest that B lymphopoiesis in max 41 mice has been diverted to granulocyte production.

The present study evaluated the antitumor activity of KRN5500 against murine tumors and human tumor xenografts. KRN5500 prolonged the survival of P388 leukemia- and B16 melanoma-bearing mice but was marginally effective on colon adenocarcinoma 26. The antitumor activity of KRN5500 (4 mg/kg/day x 5, IV) against xenografts of 10 human stomach, 14 colon and 2 esophageal cancers was evaluated with two parameters: the tumor growth inhibition rate (TGIR) and the tumor mass reduction by comparison with mitomycin C (MMC, 6.7 mg/kg/day x 1,IV). KRN5500 showed a marked efficacy in the human tumor xenograft model. The overall response rate of 26 cancers to KRN5500, evaluated by TGIR, was approximately equal to their response rate to MMC (72% vs. 73%). However, more tumors were reduced by KRN5500 than by MMC (52% vs. 39%). It is notable that the response rates of 14 colon cancers to KRN5500 were significantly higher than those to MMC, both in TGIR (69% vs. 58%) and in tumor mass reduction (46% vs. 23%). Among the tumors sensitive to KRN5500, COL-1 showed a marked response (TGIR 93%) and a significant reduction in tumor mass (0.22-fold the starting volume). In the mode of action, KRN5500 was found to show an inhibitory effect on protein synthesis in P388 cells (IC50 1.5 microM).

Aproliferative disorders in this context may also indicate immune or hematopoietic deficiency.

The virus induces malignancies of the B-cell lineage (leukaemia/lymphoma). The role played by interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the BLV-induced leukemogenesis process was evaluated. Six cell lines derived from BLV-induced tumours were tested for the expression of IL-6 receptors. Two cell lines (LB155 and YR2) display 250-300 receptor per cell (kd = 1.7 10(-10) M and 1.4 10(-10) M, respectively) whereas the other four (LB159, LB167, YR1 and M51) do not display detectable amounts of receptors. Very low (if any) expression of IL-6 receptors has been found in the case of the B lymphocytes of animals in persistent lymphocytosis (PL). Despite the presence of IL-6 receptors on the surface of LB155 and YR2 cells, no influence of exogenous IL-6 on their growth has been observed. Northern analyses indicated the presence of IL-6 transcripts only in the case of mRNA isolated from LB155 cells. Since this cell line also expresses receptors for the cytokine, an autocrine loop may exist in these cells. Experiments in which bovine and bovine epithelial cell lines were transfected with a plasmid containing the bovine IL-6 promoter controlling the expression of the reporter cat gene failed to indicate any influence of the viral transactivator p34tax on the activity of this promoter. We conclude that IL-6 receptors and IL-6 mRNA can be found in some BLV-induced tumours, but this does not correlate with viral expression in BLV-induced leukaemia/lymphoma.","['Droogmans, L', 'Cludts, I', 'Cleuter, Y', 'Kerkhofs, P', 'Adam, E', 'Willems, L', 'Kettmann, R', 'Burny, A']","['Droogmans L', 'Cludts I', 'Cleuter Y', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Adam E', 'Willems L', 'Kettmann R', 'Burny A']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Brussels (ULB), Rhode-St-Genese, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cattle', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*immunology/virology', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Sheep', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['1043-4666(94)90052-3 [pii]', '10.1016/1043-4666(94)90052-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1994 Nov;6(6):641-6. doi: 10.1016/1043-4666(94)90052-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both compounds 1 and 2 caused the lysis of erythrocytes and neutrophils. The rate of lysis of erythrocytes was comparable to the rate of change of erythrocyte membrane microviscosity caused by both compounds 1 and 2.

A current concern for these workers is the potential carcinogenicity posed by inhalation of bitumen fumes or dermal exposure to bitumens. Bitumens are chemically different from many carcinogenic coal-tar based materials. Both have been employed in road paving and waterproofing. We examined and combined the results of the epidemiologic studies conducted on asphalt workers and roofers. We examined the cancer risk separately in three broad job categories: 1) roofers (exposed to bitumen fumes and previously often to coal-tar fumes); 2) highway maintenance workers (HMWs) and road pavers (exposed to bitumen fumes as well as possibly coal-tar fumes previously); and 3) miscellaneous and unspecified bitumen/asphalt workers. In roofers, an increased risk was suggested for cancers of the lung (aggregated relative risk 1.8, 95% confidence interval 1.5-2.1), stomach (1.7, 1.1-2.5), nonmelanoma skin (4.0, 0.8-12), and leukemia (1.7, 0.9-2.9). Some of the excesses may be attributable to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) from coal-tar products. The aggregated relative risks in road pavers and HMWs were consistently lower than in roofers for cancers of the lung (0.9, 0.8-1.0), stomach (1.1, 0.8-1.5), bladder (1.2, 0.7-1.8), skin (2.2, 1.2-3.7), and leukemias (1.3, 0.9-1.8). Their risk of skin cancer was significantly increased, based on one study. Miscellaneous and unspecified workers had a significant excess (1.5, 1.2-1.8) of lung cancer. The data were poorly focused to address the carcinogenicity of bitumen fumes, as contrasted with tar-derived exposures. For the prospect of shedding more light on the bitumen-cancer controversy, the feasibility of a powerful multicenter cohort is currently being studied by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).","['Partanen, T', 'Boffetta, P']","['Partanen T', 'Boffetta P']","['Unit of Analytical Epidemiology, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', '0 (Coal)', '0 (Hydrocarbons)', '8052-42-4 (asphalt)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants, Occupational/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Coal/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons/adverse effects', 'Incidence', '*Industry', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.4700260602 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1994 Dec;26(6):721-40. doi: 10.1002/ajim.4700260602.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early consolidation therapy was given to 14/21 patients and consisted of m-AMSA and VP-16 in 11 of them. The response to, and toxicity from, myelosuppressive chemotherapy was different according to the type of AML. In patients with n-AML a complete remission (CR) was obtained in 63% (10/16) and only 19% (3/16) died of MCT-related toxicity. In contrast, only 1/5 patients with s-AML achieved CR while 4/5 died of toxicity. The median duration of CR was 40 weeks (range: 5-147+) and median overall survival 23 weeks (range: 1-211+), with an estimated 3-year overall survival rate of 9.5% (2/21). Overall survival of patients with n-AML was significantly longer than that of patients with s-AML (p < 0.05). Hospital stay in relation to survival time was 100% for patients with s-AML, 49% for patients with n-AML not achieving CR and 25% for patients with n-AML with CR.

We investigated this possibility in human promyelocytic HL-60 and erythroid K-562 leukemia cells and in human SK-MEL-131 melanoma cells. Our results indicated that genistein, in a dose-dependent manner, inhibited cell multiplication and induced cell differentiation. The maturing HL-60 cells acquired granulocytic and monocytic markers. The differentiating K-562 cells stained positively with benzidine, which indicates the production of hemoglobin, an erythroid marker. Following genistein treatment, maturing SK-MEL-131 melanoma cells formed dendrite-like structures and exhibited increased tyrosinase activity and melanin content.

GMR beta is required for high-affinity binding, cell proliferation, and protein phosphorylation but has no intrinsic GM-CSF-binding activity. GMR alpha in isolation binds to GM-CSF with low affinity and can signal for increased glucose uptake. In addition to the membrane-bound receptor (mGMR alpha), there is a naturally occurring soluble isoform (sGMR alpha) that is released free into the pericellular milieu. Analysis of genomic sequences reveals that the soluble GMR alpha isoform comes about by alternative mRNA splicing. To examine GMR alpha expression, we developed a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay based on serial dilutions of in vitro transcribed GMR alpha RNA. This assay provides a strict log-log measure of GMR alpha RNA expression, distinguishes transcripts related to the soluble and membrane-associated isoforms, and quantitatively detects 0.1 fg of GMR alpha-related mRNA. There was little or no GMR alpha expression in two human lymphoid cell lines and in the erythroblastic leukemia cell line K562, but all myeloid cell lines tested expressed both the membrane-associated and soluble isoforms of GMR alpha. Baseline level of expression of both isoforms varied > 20-fold among the myeloid cell lines studied. Differentiation of HL-60 cells to neutrophils with dimethyl sulfoxide led to a 2-fold downregulation of sGMR alpha and a 20-fold upregulation of mGMR alpha. These differentiation-induced transcriptional changes were unrelated to changes in mRNA stability. These findings indicate that sGMR alpha is differentially expressed from mGMR alpha in human hematopoietic cells and that programmed downregulation of sGMR alpha may be important in myeloid maturation.","['Heaney, M L', 'Vera, J C', 'Raines, M A', 'Golde, D W']","['Heaney ML', 'Vera JC', 'Raines MA', 'Golde DW']","['Division of Hematologic Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-5)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genomic Library', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-5', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/03/14 00:00,1995/03/14 00:01,['1995/03/14 00:00'],"['1995/03/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/14 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.6.2365 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Mar 14;92(6):2365-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.6.2365.,,,,,"['P30 CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL42107/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA30388/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC42484,,,,,,,,,,,

The levels of mPLZF mRNAs increased perinatally in the liver, heart, and kidney, but with the exception of the heart, they were either absent or very low in the adult tissues. In situ analysis of mPLZF expression in mouse embryos between 7.0 and 10.5 days of development revealed that mPLZF mRNAs and proteins were coexpressed in spatially restricted and temporally dynamic patterns in the central nervous system. In the hindbrain region, a segmental pattern of expression correlated with the development of the rhombomeres. From 9.0 days of development, starting first in rhombomeres 3 and 5, there was an ordered down-regulation of expression in the center of each rhombomere, so that 1 day later elevated levels of mPLZF mRNAs and proteins were restricted to cells surrounding the rhombomeric boundaries. The chicken homologue of the PLZF gene, which we have also cloned, demonstrated a similar segmental pattern of expression in the hindbrain. To date, PLZF represents the only example of a transcription factor with elevated expression at rhombomeric boundaries. The high degree of evolutionary conservation between the patterns of PLZF expression during mammalian and avian central nervous system development suggests that it has an important functional role in the regionalization of the vertebrate hindbrain, potentially regulating boundary cell interactions.","['Cook, M', 'Gould, A', 'Brand, N', 'Davies, J', 'Strutt, P', 'Shaknovich, R', 'Licht, J', 'Waxman, S', 'Chen, Z', 'Gluecksohn-Waelsch, S']","['Cook M', 'Gould A', 'Brand N', 'Davies J', 'Strutt P', 'Shaknovich R', 'Licht J', 'Waxman S', 'Chen Z', 'Gluecksohn-Waelsch S', 'et al.']","['Laboratory of Developmental Neurobiology, Medical Research Council National Institute for Medical Research, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Central Nervous System/embryology/metabolism', 'Chickens', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Embryo, Mammalian/metabolism', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myocardium/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Rhombencephalon/cytology/embryology/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Zinc Fingers']",1995/03/14 00:00,1995/03/14 00:01,['1995/03/14 00:00'],"['1995/03/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/14 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.6.2249 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Mar 14;92(6):2249-53. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.6.2249.,,"['GENBANK/Z47205', 'GENBANK/Z47206']",,,['CA59936-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC42461,,,,,,,,,,,

NIH 3T3 cells expressing CBF beta-SMMHC acquired a transformed phenotype, as indicated by their ability to form foci, grow in soft agarose, and form tumors in nude mice. Cells expressing normal CBF beta or the SMMHC tail domain did not become transformed. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays showed that extracts from cells transformed by CBF beta-SMMHC no longer formed the normal CBF/DNA complex but instead formed a much larger complex that did not migrate into the gel. Analysis of CBF beta-SMMHC deletion mutants demonstrated that the chimeric protein was transforming only if two domains were both present: (i) CBF beta sequences necessary for association with the CBF alpha subunit, and (ii) SMMHC sequences important for the formation of multimeric filaments.

Inhibition of leukocyte migration or leukocyte aggregation in the presence of low drug concentrations was positive in the 5 cases tested. Lung function tests showed a restrictive pattern and the outcome of DIPD was always favorable. (2) Chronic pneumonitis/fibrosis was seen in 6 patients who received a variable association of cyclophosphamide (3 patients), bleomycin (2 patients), BCNU (2 patients), and melphalan (1 patient).

Apoptosis-associated cleavage sites were mapped to the 28S rRNA divergent domains D2, D6 (endothelial cells), and D8. The D2 cuts occurred in hairpin loop junctions considered to be buried in the intact ribosome, suggesting that this rRNA region becomes a target for RNase attack in apoptotic cells. D8 was cleaved in two exposed UU(U) sequences in bulge loops. Treatment with agents causing necrotic cell death or aging of cell lysates failed to produce any detectable limited D2 cleavage but did produce a more generalized cleavage in the D8 region. Of potential functional interest was the finding that the primary cuts in D2 exactly flanked a 0.3-kb hypervariable subdomain (D2c), allowing excision of the latter. The implication of hypervariable rRNA domains in apoptosis represents the first association of any functional process with these enigmatic parts of the ribosomes.","['Houge, G', 'Robaye, B', 'Eikhom, T S', 'Golstein, J', 'Mellgren, G', 'Gjertsen, B T', 'Lanotte, M', 'Doskeland, S O']","['Houge G', 'Robaye B', 'Eikhom TS', 'Golstein J', 'Mellgren G', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Lanotte M', 'Doskeland SO']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 28S)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic AMP/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/physiology', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Polyribosomes/*metabolism', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 28S/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Ribonucleases/*metabolism', 'Ribosomes/chemistry']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.15.4.2051 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1995 Apr;15(4):2051-62. doi: 10.1128/MCB.15.4.2051.,,,,,,,PMC230432,,,,,,,,,,,

AML-1 is a site-specific DNA-binding protein that recognizes the enhancer core motif TGTGGT. The t(8;21) translocation fuses the first 177 amino acids of AML-1 to MTG8 (also known as ETO), generating a chimeric protein that retains the DNA-binding domain of AML-1. Analysis of endogenous AML-1 DNA-binding complexes suggested the presence of at least two AML-1 isoforms. Accordingly, we screened a human B-cell cDNA library and isolated a larger, potentially alternatively spliced, form of AML1, termed AML1B. AML-1B is a protein of 53 kDa that binds to a consensus AML-1-binding site and complexes with CBF beta. Subcellular fractionation experiments demonstrated that both AML-1 and AML-1/ETO are efficiently extracted from the nucleus under ionic conditions but that AML-1B is localized to a salt-resistant nuclear compartment. Analysis of the transcriptional activities of AML-1, AML-1B, and AML-1/ETO demonstrated that only AML-1B activates transcription from the T-cell receptor beta enhancer. Mixing experiments indicated that AML-1/ETO can efficiently block AML-1B-dependent transcriptional activation, suggesting that the t(8;21) translocation creates a dominant interfering protein.","['Meyers, S', 'Lenny, N', 'Hiebert, S W']","['Meyers S', 'Lenny N', 'Hiebert SW']","[""Department of Tumor Cell Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factors', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.15.4.1974 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1995 Apr;15(4):1974-82. doi: 10.1128/MCB.15.4.1974.,,['GENBANK/U19601'],,,"['5 P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA64140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC230424,,,,,,,,,,,

H1 (zero) also accumulates in a variety of cell culture lines undergoing terminal differentiation. During in vitro mouse erythroleukemia cell differentiation, H1 (zero) gene expression is induced very rapidly, prior to the time when the cells actually commit to terminal differentiation. We have used a combination of transfection assays and in vitro DNA-protein interaction studies to identify nuclear protein binding sites in the H1 (zero) promoter that control expression and induction of the H1(zero) gene in mouse erythroleukemia cells. The results indicate that transcription of the H1 (zero) gene is controlled by three elements present in the upstream region of the promoter between positions -305 and -470. Site-directed mutagenesis of each of these elements showed that one of them controls inducibility of the gene in differentiating cells. The other two elements in the upstream control region affect primarily the level of transcription of the gene in undifferentiated and differentiating cells. These two elements share a DNA sequence motif consisting of a (dG)6 tract contained in an eight-base consensus, (A/C)GGGGGG(A/C).

The specificity of MNDA expression for cells in the granulocyte-macrophage lineage was reexamined in cell lines established from patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia. Cell lines that expressed MNDA exhibited myeloid cell features and granulocyte or monocyte differentiation could be induced in vitro, while cell lines exhibiting properties of very early stage cells or multipotential cells did not express MNDA. Cells originating from cases of Burkitt's lymphoma were negative. By contrast, three lymphoblastoid cell lines (immortalized in vitro with Epstein-Barr virus) were weakly positive and MNDA was up-regulated by interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) treatment. As we reported previously, MNDA mRNA level in adherent monocytes is elevated by IFN-alpha; in this study, we further assessed MNDA expression in in vitro monocyte-derived macrophages. Three additional agents (endotoxin, phytohemagglutinin, and phorbol ester) and other conditions that affect function, cytokine production, differentiation, and/or growth of monocytes were examined for their ability to alter MNDA expression. The results varied with the agent, cell type, and stage of differentiation. Changes in MNDA expression occurred slowly (hours to days), suggesting that MNDA could mediate changes realized over a long period. The results also reveal a discordance in certain MNDA positive cells between steady-state levels or changes in levels of protein and mRNA indicating that the regulation of MNDA expression occurs at more than one point. Changes in MNDA expression are consistent with a role in opposing macrophage differentiation and activation of monocytes/macrophages.","['Briggs, R C', 'Kao, W Y', 'Dworkin, L L', 'Briggs, J A', 'Dessypris, E N', 'Clark, J']","['Briggs RC', 'Kao WY', 'Dworkin LL', 'Briggs JA', 'Dessypris EN', 'Clark J']","['Department of Pathology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee 37232.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Endotoxins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (MNDA protein, human)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/genetics/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Endotoxins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Phorbol Esters/metabolism', 'Phytohemagglutinins/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.240560417 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1994 Dec;56(4):559-67. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240560417.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of protein isoprenylation by lovastatin (LOV) induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells, a process of active cell death characterized by the internucleosomal degradation of genomic DNA. In this article we show that LOV-induced apoptosis is associated with intracellular acidification and that activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter induces a raise in pHi which is sufficient to prevent or arrest DNA digestion. First, LOV induced a decrease in pHi which was dose-dependent and correlated with the extent of DNA degradation. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that this acidification was due to the appearance of a subpopulation of cells whose pHi was 0.9 pH units below control values. Cell sorting experiments demonstrated that DNA degradation had occurred only in those cells which had suffered intracellular acidification. LOV-induced apoptosis could be suppressed by mevalonate supplementation, inhibition of protein synthesis, and protein kinase C activation by phorbol myristate acetate. In all three cases, intracellular acidification was abolished. Inhibition of the Na+/H+ antiporter by 5-N-ethyl-N-isopropyl amiloride induced DNA degradation in HL-60 cells per se and suppressed the protective effect of phorbol myristate acetate. LOV-induced intracellular acidification was not due to a complete inhibition of the Na+/H+ antiporter. In fact, LOV-treated cells were able to respond to phorbol myristate acetate stimulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter with a marked increase in pHi. This effect was accompanied by a rapid arrest of DNA digestion. These observations illustrate the strong pH dependence of LOV-induced DNA degradation, thus providing a connection between the activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter and the suppression of apoptosis.","['Perez-Sala, D', 'Collado-Escobar, D', 'Mollinedo, F']","['Perez-Sala D', 'Collado-Escobar D', 'Mollinedo F']","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers)', '7DZO8EB0Z3 (Amiloride)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', ""85138-49-4 (2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein)"", '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', '9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'S5UOB36OCZ (Mevalonic Acid)', 'VW50CE070T (ethylisopropylamiloride)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Amiloride/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Fluoresceins', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', '*Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lovastatin/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Mevalonic Acid/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/03/17 00:00,1995/03/17 00:01,['1995/03/17 00:00'],"['1995/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.11.6235 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)81486-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Mar 17;270(11):6235-42. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.11.6235.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WT1 is down-regulated in differentiated leukemia cells both in vivo and in vitro and is up-regulated in fetal spleen and immature leukemia cells. The modulation of WT1 expression was examined in many cell types, and a hematopoietic-specific enhancer element has been identified. Here we describe the transcriptional response of this enhancer to hematopoietic-specific transcription factors. We found co-expression of WT1 and GATA-1 mRNA in K562 cells and in mouse spleen, suggesting potential interactions between these two transcription factors. We find that the activity of the 3' WT1 enhancer is positively correlated with the expression of GATA-1. Gel shift competition experiments and transactivation studies revealed that this functional activity is mediated via binding at a GATA-binding site in the WT1 enhancer. The transactivation of the WT1 enhancer by GATA-1 implies that GATA-1 plays a role in the regulation of WT1 during hematopoiesis.","['Wu, Y', 'Fraizer, G C', 'Saunders, G F']","['Wu Y', 'Fraizer GC', 'Saunders GF']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'HeLa Cells', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers']",1995/03/17 00:00,1995/03/17 00:01,['1995/03/17 00:00'],"['1995/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.11.5944 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)81446-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Mar 17;270(11):5944-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.11.5944.,,,,,"['CA 16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 34936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['WT1'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Addition of retinoic acid (RA) for the last 24 h during dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)-induced differentiation enhanced fMLP-dependent signals and interaction between fMLP receptor and G(i). RA modifies both the function and subunit composition of G(i)2, the predominant G(i) of HL-60 membranes, as shown by comparing purified G(i)2 from membranes of Me2SO-treated cells (D-G(i)2) to G(i)2 from membranes of cells treated with both Me2SO and RA (DR-G(i)2). As compared to D-G(i)2, DR-G(i)2 induced more fMLP binding when added to membranes of pertussis toxin-treated HL-60 cells and, in the presence of GTP gamma S, stimulated beta gamma-sensitive phospholipase C in extracts of HL-60 cells to a much greater extent at a lower concentrations. Immunoblasts revealed that RA induced expression of the gamma 2 subunit, which was otherwise undetectable in G(i)2 purified from HL-60 cells or in HL-60 membranes. Possibly by inducing expression of gamma 2, RA alters two functions of the G(i) beta gamma subunit, modulation of fMLP receptor-G(i)2 coupling and activation of the effector, Phospholipase C.","['Iiri, T', 'Homma, Y', 'Ohoka, Y', 'Robishaw, J D', 'Katada, T', 'Bourne, H R']","['Iiri T', 'Homma Y', 'Ohoka Y', 'Robishaw JD', 'Katada T', 'Bourne HR']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Francisco 94143.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/pharmacology"", 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/isolation & purification/*metabolism']",1995/03/17 00:00,1995/03/17 00:01,['1995/03/17 00:00'],"['1995/03/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/17 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.11.5901 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)81441-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Mar 17;270(11):5901-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.11.5901.,,,,,"['CA54427/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 39867/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM27800/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nature of the effect, impact on folate compound polyglutamate pools, and evidence for programmed down-regulation during maturation.",5462-8,"These studies in HL-60 cells examined the regulation of folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity at the level of gene expression during terminal maturation. Following addition of 210 mM Me2SO to cultures of HL-60 cells at a concentration that induces maturation of 85-90% of the cells, FPGS activity, but not folylpolyglutamate hydrolase (FPGH) activity, was reduced 2-7-fold within 1-5 days. The initial decline in FPGS activity preceded any effect of Me2SO on rate of growth and the increase in appearance of nitro blue tetrazolium-positive cells, a marker of cellular maturation, and the decrease after 5 days of exposure to Me2SO was solely accounted for by a 7-fold decrease in value for Vmax. The same time and concentration dependence for Me2SO was shown for the decline in FPGS activity, increase in nitro blue tetrazolium-positive cells, and decline in the level of a 2.1-kilobase FPGS mRNA during exposure to this inducer. This decline in FPGS mRNA was reversible when Me2SO was removed from the culture medium but only until that time when an appreciable number of cells were committed to terminal maturation. Following growth of HL-60 cells with [3H]MTX, used as a model folate compound, a large reduction in its intracellular polyglutamate pools was shown during maturation which quantitatively reflected the decline in FPGS activity as well as folate transport inward (Sirotnak, F.M., Jacobson, D.M., and Yang, C-H. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11150-11156). Other data showed that folate status or obviation of the folate requirement during growth of these cells strongly influenced the rapidity of the onset of maturation following exposure to inducer. Overall, these results show that FPGS activity in HL-60 cells is a marker for proliferative capacity and that the underlying basis for the decline in FPGS activity during maturation is altered cognate gene expression which is manifested as early reversible and late irreversible phases. They also suggest that the coordinate reduction observed in folate transport, FPGS activity, dihydrofolate reductase, and probably other folate related enzymes by limiting macromolecular biosynthesis may be early programmed events in the maturation process that influence the switch from proliferation to senescence in these cells.","['Egan, M G', 'Sirlin, S', 'Rumberger, B G', 'Garrow, T A', 'Shane, B', 'Sirotnak, F M']","['Egan MG', 'Sirlin S', 'Rumberger BG', 'Garrow TA', 'Shane B', 'Sirotnak FM']","['Program in Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Hypoxanthines)', '0 (Pteroylpolyglutamic Acids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', 'EC 3.4.19.9 (gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthines/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Peptide Synthases/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Pteroylpolyglutamic Acids/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Thymidine/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase/metabolism']",1995/03/10 00:00,1995/03/10 00:01,['1995/03/10 00:00'],"['1995/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.10.5462 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)94776-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Mar 10;270(10):5462-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.10.5462.,,,,,"['CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56517/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Properties of two distinct transport systems in inside-out vesicles from L1210 cells and a variant subline with altered efflux of methotrexate and cholate.",5312-9,"The transport of 2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione (DNP-SG) into inside-out vesicles from L1210 cells was employed to identify and characterize ATP-dependent efflux routes for DNP-SG. Measurements of ATP-dependent uptake at varying concentrations of [3H]DNP-SG revealed the presence of two distinct transport systems. Transport at low substrate concentrations occurred predominantly via a high affinity system (Km = 0.63 microM), whereas a low affinity system (Km = 450 microM) predominated at high concentrations of substrate. The high affinity system was characterized by a potent inhibition by the glutathione conjugates of bromosulfophthalein (Ki = 0.09 microM) and ethacrynic acid (Ki = 0.44 microM), leukotriene C4 (Ki = 0.20 microM), and the taurate diconjugate of bilirubin (Ki = 0.10 microM). The low affinity transport system for DNP-SG exhibited a high affinity for bilirubin ditaurate (Ki = 1.8 microM), indoprofen (Ki = 3.0 microM), and biphenylacetic acid (Ki = 5.9 microM). Different results were obtained with an L1210/C7 variant which has a defect in the efflux of methotrexate and cholate. Vesicles from the latter cells contain the same low affinity transport activity as parental cells, but the high affinity route is absent and has been replaced by a system with an intermediate affinity for DNP-SG (Km = 4.5 microM). These results indicate that L1210 cells contain two unidirectional efflux pumps for DNP-SG with substantial differences in inhibitor sensitivity. The high affinity system shows a binding preference for glutathione conjugates but can also accommodate large anionic conjugates, whereas the low affinity system has a binding preference for large organic anions. Results with the variant cells support the hypothesis that the high affinity transport system for DNP-SG also mediates the unidirectional efflux of methotrexate and cholate in intact L1210 cells.","['Saxena, M', 'Henderson, G B']","['Saxena M', 'Henderson GB']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cholic Acids)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '26289-39-4 (S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'G1JO7801AE (Cholic Acid)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cholic Acid', 'Cholic Acids/*metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'Glutathione/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/03/10 00:00,1995/03/10 00:01,['1995/03/10 00:00'],"['1995/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.10.5312 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)94754-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Mar 10;270(10):5312-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.10.5312.,,,,,['CA23970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relation between GM-CSF and the leukemic transformation is discussed and the possible contribution of the cytokine to the stimulation of this complication is emphasized.","['Mittelman, M', 'Floru, S', 'Pick, A I']","['Mittelman M', 'Floru S', 'Pick AI']","['Department of Medicine B, Hasharon Hospital, Petah-Tikva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Haematologia (Budap),Haematologia,0130266,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'VAD I protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications/*therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*therapy', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologia (Budap). 1994;26(2):111-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effect of P-glycoprotein overexpression.,287-98,"Overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-GP) accompanied by multidrug resistance (MDR) to diverse groups of cytostatics was developed by long-term adaptation of mouse leukemic cell line L1210 to vincristine. Two resistant sublines of cells characterized by ID50 values for vincristine 1.05 mg/l (L1210/VCR-1) and 2.3 mg/l (L1210/VCR-2), respectively, were used. The sensitive parental cell line L1210 had the ID50 value for vincristine around 0.01 mg/l. Overexpression of P-GP induced by the adaptation procedure was found to be accompanied by an increase in the mean cell diameter from 10.28 +/- 1.60 microns (mean +/- SD, n = 122) for sensitive L1210 cells to 17.82 +/- 2.59 microns (n = 120) and 37.26 +/- 5.72 microns (n = 121) for L1210/VCR-1 and L1210/VCR-2 resistant cell sublines, respectively. Significant decrease in ability to accumulate [3H]-vincristine from cultivation medium was observed for both resistant cell sublines in comparison to sensitive cells. Accumulation of [3H]-vincristine by sensitive cells is secured only by passive diffusion of the drug across the plasma membrane. Contrary to that, active efflux of drug operating against its diffusion across the plasma membrane should be assumed as a factor influencing the [3H]-vincristine accumulation by resistant cells. Indeed, the time dependence of [3H]-vincristine accumulation by sensitive cells could be fitted using simple monoexponential kinetic dependence in contrast to biexponential kinetic dependences that are necessary for fitting [3H]-vincristine accumulation by both resistant cell sublines. Kinetic analysis of the experimental data indicates that accumulation of [3H]-vincristine by sensitive cells grows to a plateau reflecting probably the equilibrium of drug concentration in the intracellular and extracellular space. On the contrary, accumulation of [3H]-vincristine by both resistant cell sublines was stabilized after an initial growth on a considerably lower level than it was observed for the sensitive cells in the equilibrium.","['Breier, A', 'Stefankova, Z', 'Barancik, M', 'Tribulova, N']","['Breier A', 'Stefankova Z', 'Barancik M', 'Tribulova N']","['Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Gen Physiol Biophys,General physiology and biophysics,8400604,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Vincristine/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gen Physiol Biophys. 1994 Aug;13(4):287-98.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To infer physiological significance of protein-carbohydrate interactions, mammalian lectins are obviously preferable as research tools. So far, human serum lectins have not been used to assess their binding to immunophenotyped human normal or transformed blood cells. Thus, our study combines two groups of lectins with different specificity from plant and human sources. Besides concanavalin A (ConA) we have isolated the mannose-binding protein and serum amyloid P component from human serum. Especially the mannose-binding protein is believed to play a role in host defence against bacteria and yeast cells with unknown impact on normal and tumor cells. These three lectins establish the first group. In addition to the immunomodulatory mistletoe lectin, whose binding can elicit enhanced cytokine secretion from mononuclear blood cells, we included the beta-galactoside-binding lectin (14 kDa) from human placenta in the second group. The initial series of measurements was undertaken using two-color flow cytometry to determine the phenotype-associated binding (based on cluster designation; CD) of the lectins to blood and bone marrow cells from normal donors and the cell line CEM (T-lymphoblastoid), KG1-A (primitive myeloid leukemia) and Croco II (B-lymphoblastoid). Heterogeneity was apparent for each lectin in the CD-defined cell populations. Significant differences in binding were noted between Viscum album agglutinin (VAA) and other lectins for CD4+ cells from blood and between mannose-binding protein (MBP) and VAA versus 14 kDa, ConA and serum amyloid P component (SAP) for CD19+ cells from bone marrow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Mann, K K', 'Andre, S', 'Gabius, H J', 'Sharp, J G']","['Mann KK', 'Andre S', 'Gabius HJ', 'Sharp JG']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Boston University, MA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,"['0 (Lectins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,"['Blood Cells/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Galactose/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lectins/*blood', 'Mannose/*blood', 'Plant Proteins/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Reference Values', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 1994 Oct;65(1):145-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A similar result was obtained when 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was used to induce monocytic differentiation. The stable transfectants were derived by transfecting HL-60 cells with DNA encoding an N-terminal truncated raf-1 protein. In normal HL-60 cells retinoic acid is known to induce a colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1)-dependent metabolic cascade culminating in G0 arrest and phenotypic conversion. Early in this cascade, expression of the RB tumor suppressor gene product is down-regulated. A progressive redistribution of the form of the protein from largely hyperphosphorylated protein to the hypophosphorylated form begins later with G0 arrest and differentiation. In the activated raf-transfected cells, RB down regulation occurred more rapidly, consistent with accelerated differentiation. But the conversion to the hypophosphorylated form was not accelerated and occurred after G0 arrest and phenotypic conversion to myeloid differentiated cells. Thus raf activation appears to be a component of the induced metabolic cascade culminating in terminal differentiation. In this cascade raf activation promotes RB down-regulation. The data are consistent with a model in which raf is an effector of the CSF-1-dependent metabolic cascade which culminates in terminal cell differentiation, and RB downregulation is one of the downstream consequences of RAF action. Furthermore, they indicate that RB down-regulation may be an essential component of the cellular processes causing G0 arrest and differentiation, but RB hypophosphorylation is more likely a consequence thereof and not a cause.","['Yen, A', 'Williams, M', 'Platko, J D', 'Der, C', 'Hisaka, M']","['Yen A', 'Williams M', 'Platko JD', 'Der C', 'Hisaka M']","['Department of Pathology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,"['0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 1994 Oct;65(1):103-13.,,,,,['ES 07052/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],['raf'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The agents inhibited DNA and RNA synthesis in preference to protein synthesis in L1210 lymphoid leukemia cells. Inosine-monophosphate dehydrogenase apparently is a target site of the compounds; similar effects on phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate amido transferase, orotidine-monophosphate decarboxylase, and both nucleoside and nucleotide kinases were observed. Deoxyribonucleotide pool levels were reduced in the cells; DNA strand scission was observed with the agents. In rodents, the amine carboxyboranes were potent hypolipidemic agents, lowering both serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, in addition to lowering cholesterol content of very low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and elevating high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations. De novo regulatory enzymes involved in lipid synthesis were also inhibited (e.g., hypocholesterolemic 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-Coenzyme A reductase, acyl-Coenzyme A cholesterol acyltransferase, and sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase). Concurrently, the agents modulated LDL and HDL receptor binding, internalization, and degradation, so that less cholesterol was delivered to the plaques and more broken down from esters and conducted to the liver for biliary excretion. Tissue lipids in the aorta wall of the rat were reduced and fewer atherosclerotic morphologic lesions were present in quail aortas after treatment with the agents. Cholesterol resorption from the rat intestine was reduced in the presence of drug. Genetic hyperlipidemic mice demonstrated the same types of reduction after treatment with the agents. The agents would effectively lower lipids in tissue based on the inhibition of regulatory enzymes in pigs. These findings should help improve domestic meat supplies from fowl and pigs. The amine-carboxyboranes were effective anti-inflammatory agents against septic shock, induced edema, pleurisy, and chronic arthritis at 2.5 to 8 mg/kg. Lysosomal and proteolytic enzyme activities were also inhibited. More significantly, the agents were dual inhibitors of prostaglandin cyclooxygenase and 5'-lipoxygenase activities. These compounds also affected cytokine release and white cell migration. Subsequent studies showed that the amine-carboxyboranes were potent anti-osteoporotic agents reducing calcium resorption as well as increasing calcium and proline incorporation into mouse pup calvaria and rat UMR-106 collagen.","['Hall, I H', 'Chen, S Y', 'Rajendran, K G', 'Sood, A', 'Spielvogel, B F', 'Shih, J']","['Hall IH', 'Chen SY', 'Rajendran KG', 'Sood A', 'Spielvogel BF', 'Shih J']","['Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Natural Products, School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill 27559-7360.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boranes)', '0 (Hypolipidemic Agents)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Boranes/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hyperlipidemias/*drug therapy', 'Hypolipidemic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Inflammation/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Obesity/*drug therapy']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.94102s721 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1994 Nov;102 Suppl 7:21-30. doi: 10.1289/ehp.94102s721.,30,,,,,,PMC1566643,,,,,,,,,,,

At the molecular level the translocation results in the fusion of the 5' region of the AML1 gene on chromosome 21 and almost the entire CDR gene (also ETO or MTG8) on chromosome 8. The translocation can be demonstrated by techniques such as Southern blot analysis of DNA and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of mRNA. Neither of these methods demonstrates the translocation in individual cells. To detect the translocation at the single cell level, we used two probes, a cosmid clone containing the first five exons of AML1 and a P1 clone containing the entire CDR gene. Hybridization of the two probes to the distal and proximal side of the translocation breakpoint on chromosome 8 was expected to highlight the 8q-derivative in an interphase cell. To demonstrate the ability to identify the translocation in interphase cells using two-color FISH, these two probes were hybridized simultaneously to the Kasumi-1 cell line containing the 8;21 translocation and to t(8;21)-positive leukemic cells from a patient. Each probe was detected with a different color so that their relationship in the sample could be determined within the same interphase cell. Simultaneous hybridization of the CDR and AML1 probes to interphase cells resulted in one red and one green hybridization signal randomly located in the cell, from the hybridization to the normal chromosomes (8, 21), and one red-green pair of signals from the close hybridization of the two probes to the fusion gene on the derivative 8q-chromosome, indicating the translocation. This technique may be a useful complement for the analysis of the t(8;21), since critical information can be obtained from samples not suited for RT-PCR and conventional cytogenetic techniques.

To elucidate the cytotoxic mechanism in tumors other than melanoma, several pairs of CTLs and tumor lines were established. The authors report that HLA-A31 may present a tumor rejection antigen that is recognized by the human autologous gastric signet ring cell carcinoma-specific CTL. They also briefly describe the in vitro enhancing effect of interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) on the lysis of tumor cells by autologous CTL. METHODS: The MHC Class I-restricted CTL clone, TcHST-2, and autologous gastric signet ring cell carcinoma line, HST-2, were established. Cytotoxicity blocking assays of antibodies reacting against the MHC Class I nonpolymorphic determinant and HLA-A, B, and C haplotype elements, which are expressed on the HST-2 cells, were performed. RESULTS: Lysis of the autologous tumor cells (HST-2) by the CTL clone (TcHST-2) was enhanced when the tumor cells were pretreated with IFN-gamma. This lysis was selectively inhibited by the anti-nonpolymorphic MHC Class I determinant monoclonal antibody (MoAb) and anti-HLA-A31 haplotype-specific MoAb. However, TcHST-2 clone was not cytotoxic to HLA-A31+ allogeneic leukemia lines. CONCLUSION: Pretreatment of target cells with IFN-gamma may be a necessary procedure for the efficient lysis of HST-2 cells by autologous TcHST-2 CTL. The data indicate that TcHST-2 was MHC Class I-restricted HST-2 tumor-specific CTL and suggest that the HLA-A31 haplotype element is an antigen-presenting molecule. Also discussed is the nature of the antigenic peptides in gastric signet ring cell carcinoma.","['Yasoshima, T', 'Sato, N', 'Hirata, K', 'Kikuchi, K']","['Yasoshima T', 'Sato N', 'Hirata K', 'Kikuchi K']","['Department of Pathology, Sapporo Medical University, School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A31 antigen)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Carcinoma, Signet Ring Cell/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'HLA-A Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/03/15 00:00,1995/03/15 00:01,['1995/03/15 00:00'],"['1995/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19950315)75:6+<1484::aid-cncr2820751517>3.0.co;2-w [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1995 Mar 15;75(6 Suppl):1484-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19950315)75:6+<1484::aid-cncr2820751517>3.0.co;2-w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found no difference in sICAM-1 concentration with or without PAF or PF4. CONCLUSIONS: The eosinophil chemotactic factors PAF and PF4 not only may attract eosinophils, but they may enhance the expression of ICAM-1 on eosinophils at the site of the lesion.

As the toxicity of second BMT is very high, other treatments have been considered: complete remissions were reported after sudden discontinuation of the immunosuppressive therapy. Interferon-alpha has been used for chronic myeloid leukemia patients and may achieve hematological and cytogenetic complete remission. More recently, donor leucocytes transfusions have been proposed and at least in some cases, have led to molecular complete remission (polymerase chain reaction with double amplification) in chronic myeloid leukemia patients.

We evaluated the results of allogeneic PBSC transplantation (allo-PBSCT) in 9 patients with refractory leukemia or lymphoma receiving myeloablative therapy followed by allo-PBSCT from an HLA-identical sibling donor. Three patients had relapsed 11 to 21 months after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) and underwent allo-PBSCT using the same donor. Six patients received PBSCs as their initial allogeneic transplant. Filgrastim-mobilized PBSCs were collected from the donors in 3 to 4 aphereses and cryopreserved. The apheresis collections contained a median nucleated cell count of 16.5 x 10(8)/kg (range, 10.8 to 28.7 x 10(8), 10.7 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg (range, 7.5 to 22.5 x 10(6)), and 300.0 x 10(6) CD3+ cells/kg (range, 127.8 to 1,523.2 x 10(6)). The median recovery of CD34+ progenitor cells after freezing, thawing, and washing was 106.4% (range, 36.7% to 132.0%). All patients received filgrastim posttransplant through engraftment, and cyclosporine and methylprednisolone were used for GVHD prophylaxis. Neutrophil recovery to greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L and greater than 1.0 x 10(9)/L occurred at a median of 9 (range, 8 to 10) and 9 days (range, 8 to 11) posttransplant, respectively, which was similar to historical controls after allo-BMT and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor therapy. Platelets recovered to greater than 20 x 10(9)/L and greater than 50 x 10(9)/L at a median of 12 (range, 8 to 25) and 15 days (range, 11 to 59), respectively, which was significantly more rapid than for the controls (P < .01). Donor cell engraftment was documented by cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and/or restriction fragment length polymorphisms with longest follow-up of 283 + days. Three patients developed grade 2 acute GVHD involving only the skin. Three of five evaluable patients show limited chronic GVHD. Cryopreserved, filgrastim-stimulated allogeneic PBSCs may be a suitable alternative to allogeneic marrow for transplantation with the advantage of more rapid platelet recovery. Acute GVHD was minimal despite the infusion of 1 log more CD3 cells than with marrow allografts. Further studies are required to assess long-term risks of chronic GVHD.","['Korbling, M', 'Przepiorka, D', 'Huh, Y O', 'Engel, H', 'van Besien, K', 'Giralt, S', 'Andersson, B', 'Kleine, H D', 'Seong, D', 'Deisseroth, A B']","['Korbling M', 'Przepiorka D', 'Huh YO', 'Engel H', 'van Besien K', 'Giralt S', 'Andersson B', 'Kleine HD', 'Seong D', 'Deisseroth AB', 'et al.']","['Section of Bone Marrow Transplantation, U.T.M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1995/03/15 00:00,1995/03/15 00:01,['1995/03/15 00:00'],"['1995/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68780-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Mar 15;85(6):1659-65.,,,['Blood. 1995 Jul 15;86(2):836-7.

An additional proposed mechanism for inactivation of wt-p53 is amplification of the murine double minute 2 (MDM2) gene and overexpression of the MDM2 protein, which binds to p53 and eliminates its tumor suppressor function. To investigate a potential role for MDM2 in the inactivation of wt-p53 in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we examined the expression of MDM2 and p53, as well as the occurrence of p53 mutations and possible amplification of the MDM2 gene, in 19 pediatric ALL cell lines and one pediatric acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) line. Although we did not find significant amplification of the MDM2 gene in any of the leukemic lines, we detected overexpression of MDM2 in all 10 lines that expressed wt-p53. Of the 10 lines without overexpression of the MDM2 gene, six (including the AML line) did not express p53, and four expressed mutant p53 with single point mutations in exons 7 and 8. To determine whether primary leukemic cells showed a similar correlation, we analyzed the original cryopreserved leukemic bone marrow cells from seven patients from whom cell lines were established. We obtained similar results from both the primary leukemic cells and the corresponding cell lines: overexpression of MDM2 was present in primary cells that expressed wt-p53 but not in cells that lacked expression of wt-p53. These findings suggest an important role for MDM2 in the pathogenesis of pediatric ALL in which leukemic cells express wt-p53.","['Zhou, M', 'Yeager, A M', 'Smith, S D', 'Findley, H W']","['Zhou M', 'Yeager AM', 'Smith SD', 'Findley HW']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Child', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Mutation', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/03/15 00:00,1995/03/15 00:01,['1995/03/15 00:00'],"['1995/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68773-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Mar 15;85(6):1608-14.,,,,,['P01 CA 40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['MDM2', 'p53']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent improvements in fluorescence in situ hybridization (ISH) techniques have provided an alternative approach for the detection of chromosome aberrations. Here, an interphase cytogenetic study was performed to analyze the incidence and prognostic significance of a p53 gene deletion in B-CLL and related disorders. We studied mononuclear cells from 100 patients with chronic B-cell leukemias [B-CLL, 90 patients; B-prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL), 7; Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM), 3] by fluorescence ISH with a genomic p53 DNA probe. In a subset of patients, additional G-banding analysis and single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was performed. Seventeen of the 100 patients [17%; B-CLL, 11 of 90 (12%); WM, 1 of 3; B-PLL, 5 of 7] exhibited a monoallelic p53 gene deletion by ISH. G-banding analysis demonstrated abnormalities of chromosome 17 in 13 of these 17 patients, all leading to loss of band 17p13. SSCP analysis showed aberrant bands in 9 of 14 patients with a p53 gene deletion. None of 12 patients with a p53 gene deletion compared with 20 of 36 patients (56%) without a deletion responded to therapy with fludarabine or pentostatin (P < .001). The difference in survival probabilities from the time of diagnosis and from the start of treatment with purine analogs between the two groups was highly significant (P < .001). In multivariate analysis, p53 gene deletion was the strongest prognostic factor for survival. In conclusion, p53 gene deletion predicts for non-response to therapy with purine analogs and for poor survival in chronic B-cell leukemias.","['Dohner, H', 'Fischer, K', 'Bentz, M', 'Hansen, K', 'Benner, A', 'Cabot, G', 'Diehl, D', 'Schlenk, R', 'Coy, J', 'Stilgenbauer, S']","['Dohner H', 'Fischer K', 'Bentz M', 'Hansen K', 'Benner A', 'Cabot G', 'Diehl D', 'Schlenk R', 'Coy J', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'et al.']","['Medizinische Klinik, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pentostatin/therapeutic use', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Survival Rate', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1995/03/15 00:00,1995/03/15 00:01,['1995/03/15 00:00'],"['1995/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68769-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Mar 15;85(6):1580-9.,,,,,,['p53'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies showing the activation by various ligands of a group of proteins called Stat (signal transducers and activators of transcription) proteins raised the possibility that such proteins may also be involved in the Epo signal transduction pathway. In this report, we show that Epo induces factors that specifically bind to the sis-inducible element and the gamma response region of the Fc gamma receptor factor I gene in the Epo-dependent mouse erythroleukemia cell line HCD-57. These factors contain phosphotyrosine and antibodies against Stat1 and Stat3 proteins reacted with them. In HCD-57 cells infected with Friend spleen focus-forming virus, which now grow in an Epo-independent manner, the DNA-binding factors were constitutively activated even in the absence of Epo. These results suggest that the factors induced by Epo contain components identical or related to known Stat proteins. It is also suggested that continuous activation of these DNA-binding factors may be responsible for the ability of spleen focus-forming virus to abrogate the Epo-dependence of HCD-57 cells and cause erythroleukemia in susceptible mice.","['Ohashi, T', 'Masuda, M', 'Ruscetti, S K']","['Ohashi T', 'Masuda M', 'Ruscetti SK']","['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702-1201.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, IgG/genetics', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/03/15 00:00,1995/03/15 00:01,['1995/03/15 00:00'],"['1995/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68753-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Mar 15;85(6):1454-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To gain new insight as to the origin of this virus in Japan and especially in the southern islands of the archipelago, we investigated the long terminal repeat (LTR) of 67 newly isolated HTLV-I proviral DNAs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HTLV-I-infected individuals for their restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The specimens were from Japanese living in different geographical areas (Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu, or the Ryukyu Islands) of Japan (59 cases) or Americans of Japanese ancestry living in Hawaii (8 cases). The analysis of the results, together with data for the 19 previously published LTR sequences, demonstrated the existence of 2 subtypes of HTLV-I in Japan. The first, which we propose to name Japanese subtype (previously named subtype III), is more frequent (67 of 86: 78%) than the second, the cosmopolitan subtype (previously named subtype II) (19 of 86: 22%). In parallel, a fragment of 413 base pairs of the U3/R region (nucleotide 22 to 434) was cloned and sequenced from 10 of the new Japanese samples. The alignment of these sequences and their comparison and phylogenetic analysis with previously published LTR HTLV-I sequences, demonstrated clearly the existence of the two distinct molecular subtypes of HTLV-I in Japan, diverging in this LTR region by about 1.6%. Furthermore, the study of the geographical distribution of the 2 subtypes among the 80 samples from patients whose place of residence in Japan was known showed an uneven distribution. While the Japanese subtype was present in all parts of Japan, the cosmopolitan subtype seemed to cluster in the southern islands of the archipelago (i.e., Kyushu and the Ryukyu Islands) as well as in immigrants from those areas who had lived in Hawaii for decades. These new molecular data raise questions and suggest hypotheses, discussed here, concerning the origin and means of dissemination of these human retrovirus subtypes in Japan.","['Vidal, A U', 'Gessain, A', 'Yoshida, M', 'Mahieux, R', 'Nishioka, K', 'Tekaia, F', 'Rosen, L', 'De The, G']","['Vidal AU', 'Gessain A', 'Yoshida M', 'Mahieux R', 'Nishioka K', 'Tekaia F', 'Rosen L', 'De The G']","[""Unite d'Epidemiologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'HTLV-I Infections/epidemiology/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/aid.1994.10.1557 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1994 Nov;10(11):1557-66. doi: 10.1089/aid.1994.10.1557.,,,,,['RR03061/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been identified as Ins(1,2,3)P3 by a combination of oxidation to ribitol, a structurally diagnostic polyol, and ammoniacal hydrolysis to identified inositol monophosphates. 3. Ins(1,2,3)P3 concentration in HL60 cells changed little during stimulation by ATP or fMetLeuPhe or during neutrophilic or monocytic differentiation, and Ins(1,2,3)P3 was unresponsive to vasopressin in WRK1 cells. 4. Ins(1,2,3)P3 was usually more abundant than Ins(1,4,5)P3, often being present at concentrations between approximately 1 microM and approximately 10 microM. 5.

Malignant lymphoma is classified into the following five major categories: aggressive lymphoma, indolent B-lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, T-lymphoblastic lymphoma and adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL). In aggressive lymphoma of advanced stages, recent multicenter phase III studies revealed that first-generation CHOP therapy remains the best available treatment. By multivariate analysis on prognostic factors of non-ATL lymphoma patients who were treated by the second generation LSG 4 protocol, CRP and total number of involved lesions were found to be significantly unfavorable factors. In non-ATL lymphoma, mainly B-lymphoma, three risk groups (low, intermediate and high) were identified. Similarly, the International Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Prognostic Factors Project proposed a new predictive model for survival of aggressive lymphoma patients. Such predictive models would be very useful in the design of future chemotherapy trials for aggressive lymphoma. In advanced-stage Hodgkin's disease, about two-thirds of patients are expected to be long-term survivors, thanks to state-of-the-art chemotherapy. A recent phase III study conducted by CALGB disclosed that MOPP/ABVD and ABVD are superior to MOPP. In ATL and indolent B-lymphoma, no state-of-the-art chemotherapy has been established. In order to improve the prognosis of both diseases, innovative treatment strategies should be pursued.","['Tobinai, K']",['Tobinai K'],"['Dept. of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

C57BL/6 mice are resistant to Leishmania amazonensis (La) infection but susceptible to LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus (MuLV) infection. MuLV infection leads to a state of immunodeficiency characterized by severe compromise of cell-mediated immunity. When infected with La alone, C57BL/6 mice developed a small transient lesion that evolved to spontaneous healing or a lesion with extremely slow growth. Lesions were predominantly comprised of a lympho-macrophagic infiltrate with few parasitized macrophages. When infected with La and, 4 weeks later, with MuLV (La-MuLV), the mice developed a large uncontrolled nonhealing lesion containing vacuolated and heavily parasitized macrophages. In contrast, mice infected with MuLV first and La 4 weeks later (MuLV-La) developed a small but persistent lesion, characterized histologically by a small number of heavily parasitized macrophages and few lymphocytes. Eight weeks after MuLV infection, both had similar immunological profiles with decreased lymphocyte proliferation, diminished production of interferon-gamma, and high production of interleukins 4 and 10. At the time of L. amazonensis infection, La-MuLV animals have a normal T cell function whereas in MuLV-La mice this function is already impaired; this may influence the recruitment of macrophages to the site of leishmania injection.","['Barral-Netto, M', 'da Silva, J S', 'Barral, A', 'Reed, S']","['Barral-Netto M', 'da Silva JS', 'Barral A', 'Reed S']","['School of Medicine, Federal University of Bahia, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Disease Susceptibility/etiology', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Leishmaniasis/*etiology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*complications/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*metabolism']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1995 Mar;146(3):635-42.,,,,,['AI 30639/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC1869162,,,,,,,,,,,

(2) In situ nick translation (ISNT) was performed with DNA polymerase 1 and biotin-7-dATP, to label single strand segments of DNA (peroxidase/DAB). Both methods were tested to be negative in ischemic and tumor necrosis, and negative for mitotic figures. In 26 centroblastic Non Hodgkin lymphomas (CB) (monomorphous subtype [n = 9], polymorphous subtype [n = 7], secondary [n = 10]), 14 chronic lymphocytic leukemias and two immunocytomas these methods were employed to quantify the rate of cell death. ISNT proved to be more sensitive than end labelling. By ISNT, CB had a mean cell death rate of 250/10HPF (monomorphous type: 429/10HPF, polymorphous type: 222/10HPF, secondary: 111/10HPF). CLL showed a significantly lower rate (28/10HPF). These data suggest, that the low rate of cell turnover in CLL is indicated by a low rate of cell proliferation and a low rate of programmed cell death. In CB the high proliferation rate was accompanied by a high level of cell death. In CB/monomorphous a high turnover state with a very high proliferation and cell death rate was found, whereas CB/polymorphous represents an expansive state as indicated by a lower rate of cell death. CB/secondary showed almost no programmed cell death and therefore was interpreted as a high expansive state neoplasia.","['Funk, A', 'Rudel, J', 'Fellbaum, C', 'Hofler, H']","['Funk A', 'Rudel J', 'Fellbaum C', 'Hofler H']","['Institut fur Pathologie, Technischen Universitat Munchen.']",['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Verh Dtsch Ges Pathol,Verhandlungen der Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Pathologie,7503704,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase I)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Division', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Polymerase I/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/*pathology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Verh Dtsch Ges Pathol. 1994;78:318-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Spezifische in situ Markierung von Apoptosen zeigt unterschiedliche Raten von programmiertem Zelltod in Non Hodgkin Lymphomen.,,,,

In addition, the kinetics of infection and virus distribution were evaluated. To simulate the natural route of virus transmission, the calves were infected by transferring two different infectious doses of whole blood from a BLV infected cow. The establishment of infection was determined by the double PCR and syncytia formation assay and by indirect serological methods including indirect ELISA, gp51/p24 ELISA, agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) and Western blotting. BLV antibodies were first detected in ELISA on post infection (p.i.) day 26. Close agreement was found between the results of the various indirect methods. BLV infection was first detected in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) by the PCR on p.i. day 7. No animal became seropositive to BLV prior to direct detection of BLV infection by the PCR. At slaughter, urine and saliva specimens as well as various organs were collected from the calves and tested by the double PCR. Several of the organs yielded positive results: e.g. spleen, uterus, liver, kidney, abomasum, and lymph nodes. Nine out of eleven spleen suspensions were positive by the PCR, including the spleen from one calf, which otherwise remained negative in all tests throughout the experiment. This phenomenon indicates that an animal may be infected without detectable levels of BLV proviral DNA in PBLs and without circulating antibodies, further emphasizing the diagnostic importance of the PCR. The findings indicate that the PCR is the most rapid method for the early detection of BLV infection in cattle and a valuable tool for studying the tropism of the virus.","['Klintevall, K', 'Ballagi-Pordany, A', 'Naslund, K', 'Belak, S']","['Klintevall K', 'Ballagi-Pordany A', 'Naslund K', 'Belak S']","['Department of Virology, National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vet Microbiol,Veterinary microbiology,7705469,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/immunology/*virology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Lymphocytes/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Specificity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/*veterinary', 'Proviruses/*genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Time Factors', 'Viremia/immunology/veterinary/virology']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0378-1135(94)90018-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0378-1135(94)90018-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Microbiol. 1994 Nov;42(2-3):191-204. doi: 10.1016/0378-1135(94)90018-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myotoxin II caused a dose-dependent cytolytic effect on all cell types tested, characterized by rapid release of cytoplasmic lactic dehydrogenase and drastic morphological cell alterations. Quantitative differences in the susceptibility to myotoxin II among cell types fell within a relatively narrow range, and in general, the toxin was cytolytic at concentrations of 50-100 micrograms/ml (3-7 microM), when assays were performed using culture medium as a diluent. Toxin activity was markedly enhanced if phosphate-buffered saline was utilized instead of medium. The cytotoxic activity of myotoxin III, an aspartate-49 isoform from the same venom, on both endothelial cells and skeletal muscle myoblasts was higher than that of myotoxin II, suggesting that, although phospholipase A2 activity is clearly not required for the induction of cell damage, it may have an enhancing role. In contrast to B. asper myotoxins, other basic phospholipases A2 with myotoxic activity in vivo (notexin from Notechis scutatus, and two enzymes isolated from Vipera russelli venom) did not affect endothelial cells and myoblasts. Pretreatment of cells with neuraminidase, tunicamycin, or protamine, did not alter their susceptibility to myotoxin II. At low temperatures (2-4 degrees C) myotoxin II was devoid of cytolytic effect. Washing and neutralization experiments using heparin with low affinity for antithrombin or mouse monoclonal antibody MAb-3 suggest that at low temperatures myotoxin II binds very weakly to the cells, and that its normal interaction with the putative target is probably not only based on charge, but that a membrane penetration event may be required.","['Lomonte, B', 'Tarkowski, A', 'Hanson, L A']","['Lomonte B', 'Tarkowski A', 'Hanson LA']","['Instituto Clodomiro Picado, Facultad de Microbiologia, Universidad de Costa Rica, San Jose.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Toxicon,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,1307333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Crotalid Venoms)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Neurotoxins)', '0 (Protamines)', '0 (Reptilian Proteins)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Group II Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (myotoxin II, Bothrops asper)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', '*Bothrops', 'Colonic Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Crotalid Venoms/*enzymology', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/enzymology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Group II Phospholipases A2', 'Heparin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Muscle, Skeletal/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neuraminidase/pharmacology', 'Neurotoxins/isolation & purification/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Phospholipases A/isolation & purification/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Protamines/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Reptilian Proteins', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/embryology/metabolism', 'Spleen/cytology/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0041-0101(94)90408-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Toxicon. 1994 Nov;32(11):1359-69. doi: 10.1016/0041-0101(94)90408-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper presents the HIV seroprevalence in hematologic patients other than hemophiliacs who received multiple blood transfusion at Ramathibodi Hospital. The retrospective analysis was done on 167 patients: 132 thalassemia, 19 leukemia, 5 aplastic anemia, 5 ITP, 2 pure red cell aplasia, 2 congenital non spherocytic hemolytic anemia, 1 hereditary spherocytosis and 1 autoimmune hemolytic anemia patients, who received blood transfusion during January 1, 1987 till February 29, 1992 at the Department of Pediatrics, Ramathibodi Hospital. The number of blood or BC transfused in each patient was 1-154 units with the average of 23 units per patient per 5 years with a total 4,000 units. All were HIV sero-negative. Anti-HIV screening was performed periodically in these patients about 1-2 times per year or as necessary. The results were HIV seronegative in all cases. The reason for negative results cannot be explained clearly. It should be noted that our thalassemic patients receive leukocyte poor blood and avoid a hypertransfusion program. Patients with other blood diseases received both whole blood and BC. The HIV contaminated blood in the window period was estimated to be 1:10,000 in Thailand which showed HIV antigen positive but antibody negative. These patients may be fortunately received HIV non contaminated blood.","['Mahaphan, W', 'Hathirat, P', 'Isarangkura, P', 'Chuansumrit, A', 'Atnaseo, P', 'Panthangkura, W', 'Chiewsilp, P']","['Mahaphan W', 'Hathirat P', 'Isarangkura P', 'Chuansumrit A', 'Atnaseo P', 'Panthangkura W', 'Chiewsilp P']","['Department of Pediatrics, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Thailand,Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health,The Southeast Asian journal of tropical medicine and public health,0266303,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*HIV Seroprevalence', 'Hematologic Diseases/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infection Control', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thailand', '*Transfusion Reaction']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health. 1993;24 Suppl 1:187-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clear distinctions were revealed in size of megakaryocytes, nuclear lobulation, clustering, and the nuclear size and shape of megakaryocytes. Nuclear size and cellular size were significantly less in CML (range of means of cellular size: 220-360 microns2) than in the other three Ph1-negative groups (range of means: 480-750 microns2). Nuclear lobulation was more distinct in PTH than in P. vera, and especially in CMGM.

Cold polymerization of methylmethacrylate].,28-33,"A patented low-temperature polymerization method for methylmethacrylate (MMA) infiltrated bone marrow biopsies is described: it has been developed from our previous MMA technique and is a patented procedure. Differences from the previous method are (1) removal of stabilizer from the MMA monomer before its application, (2) the use of a different starter, (3) avoidance of O2 influence during polymerization by means of vacuum exchange with N2, and (4) polymerisation in a water bath to draw off residual heat. After this procedure, all immunohistochemical reactions are possible provided that the previous fixation is adequate. The effects of different fixatives are reviewed briefly without detailed analysis. Technically, this plastic embedding can be performed at least as rapidly as the classic paraffin embedding after decalcification. The advantages over the latter method are: (1) the cells can be better differentiated because semi-thin sections can be made; (2) the immunoreactions can also be performed on the basis of semithin sections, which means they can be interpreted more easily; (3) morphometric analyses yield more reliable results because of the constant thickness of sections; (4) osteological examination of bone trabeculae, especially the search for mineralisation deficiencies, is possible; (5) the plastic embedding procedure is less dependent on individual instabilities in the quality of performance of the staff members involved. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the costs for additional equipment necessary remain below DM 100,000 including an excellent microtome.","['Georgii, A', 'Bernhards, J', 'Werner, M']","['Georgii A', 'Bernhards J', 'Werner M']","['Pathologisches Institut, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Pathologe,Der Pathologe,8006541,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Fixatives)', '0 (Methylmethacrylates)', '196OC77688 (Methylmethacrylate)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cold Temperature', 'Fixatives', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', '*Histological Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology', 'Methylmethacrylate', '*Methylmethacrylates', 'Tissue Embedding/*methods']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002920050072 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathologe. 1995 Jan;16(1):28-33. doi: 10.1007/s002920050072.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Die neue Hannover-Methode zur Kunststoffeinbettung von Knochenmark.

In order to avoid shrinkage, loss of antigens, and fading of ferritin iron and enzymes, a fixative has been designed that is composed of an aqueous solution of calcium acetate (10(-1) M), glutaraldehyde (0.5%), and formaldehyde (1%; CGF). CGF-fixated specimens are decalcified in an aqueous solution of 10% di-sodium ethylene-diaminotetraacetate (EDTA) neutralized by tris[hydroxy]methylaminomethane and embedded in paraffin. Tissue prepared in this manner allows histochemical detection of naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase in the neutrophilic cell line and in tissue mast cells, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase in hairy cells and certain other low malignant B-cell lymphomas, in Gaucher cells, and in osteoclasts, and a specific platelet esterase in megakaryocytes and leukaemic megakaryoblasts. A broad panel of antigens is well preserved. Beside haemosiderin, cytosolic ferritin can be detected by Perls' reaction in acute phase-stimulated macrophages. Emphasis is placed on the diagnostic impact of plasma cell siderosis and lysosomal sideroblastocytosis in haemochromatosis and in alcoholism respectively.

For this reason, sensitive (LOVO109 and CEM) and MDR (LOVO DX and CEM VLB) cell lines were exposed to HHT with or without some MDR modifiers, namely, Cyclosporine A (CyA), the Cyclosporine derivative SDZ PSC 833 (PSC), and the D-isomer of Verapamil (DVRP). It was found that MDR cells were about 15 times more resistant to HHT than non-MDR cells, and that resistance to HHT was significantly decreased by all the MDR modifiers that were tested. This in vitro study showed that HHT belongs to the category of MDR-related drugs, like anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, epipodophylline derivatives, and taxol.","['Russo, D', 'Michelutti, A', 'Melli, C', 'Damiani, D', 'Michieli, M G', 'Candoni, A', 'Zhou, D C', 'Marie, J P', 'Zittoun, R', 'Baccarani, M']","['Russo D', 'Michelutti A', 'Melli C', 'Damiani D', 'Michieli MG', 'Candoni A', 'Zhou DC', 'Marie JP', 'Zittoun R', 'Baccarani M']","['Department of Medical and Morphologic Research, Udine University Hospital, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*physiology', 'Adenocarcinoma/pathology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Gene Amplification', 'Harringtonines/*pharmacology', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Mar;9(3):513-6.,,,,,,['mdr1'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We have isolated a lambda EMBL3 C57BL/6 genomic subclone (pJB1) which hybridizes to the AP-PCR probe and is located on the Y chromosome. Southern blot analyses using the pJB1 probe indicate that the genomic sequence was deleted in five of 14 leukaemias. Cytogenetic analyses of 31 X-ray induced leukaemias in male CBA/H mice revealed, in addition to the characteristic partial deletion of chromosome 2 (28/31 leukaemias), a high incidence (16/31) of the loss of an intact Y chromosome. Comparison of the Southern blot and cytogenetic analyses of the leukaemias demonstrate a significant lack of correspondence between the loss of an intact Y chromosome and Y chromosome-specific DNA sequences, suggesting that Y chromosome aberrations are complex. Whereas partial deletion of chromosome 2 can be detected in 6% of bone marrow cells within 6-11 days of irradiation, no Y chromosome involvement was detected, indicating that Y chromosome aberrations are a late event in radiation-induced leukaemogenesis.

The in vivo effects of cyclophosphamide (CP) resulted in a dramatic increase of the SCE frequency (20.5 +/- 3.76). This increased SCE level of lymphocytes might reflect an instability of DNA or a deficiency of DNA repair. One could suggest that lymphocytes of children with ALL might have a higher susceptibility to harmful influences; and this could be a co-factor towards the development of the malignant disease. However, immediately 1 week after the administration of CP, the SCE rate decreased. This decline of SCE frequency correlated with a severe reduction of the absolute number of T lymphocytes. The observed reduction of SCE frequency may be due to a loss of T lymphocytes, or SCE became repaired during 1 week.","['Mertens, R', 'Rubbert, F', 'Bussing, A']","['Mertens R', 'Rubbert F', 'Bussing A']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Technical University Aachen, FRG.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'AIEOP acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', '*Lymphocyte Count', '*Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', '*Sister Chromatid Exchange/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Mar;9(3):501-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Translocations may activate nearby cellular genes involved in the control of proliferation or differentiation. One mechanism by which genes become activated or overexpressed is by their juxtaposition with the genes coding for the lymphoid antigen receptors (immunoglobulins or T cell receptors). The majority of the translocated genes appear to encode transcription factors, the expression of which might become deregulated due to the influence of regulatory elements in the antigen receptor loci. A second general type of chromosomal translocation by which proto-oncogenes can be activated results in the synthesis of fusion genes. Here, chimera proteins containing portions of two different proteins are generated following exon-exon juxtaposition of two genes lying at the sites of translocation. The list of such tumor-associated fusion genes generated by specific translocations has greatly increased over the last years. A wide variety of leukemia-lymphoma cell lines have been established to act both as genetic resources and as model systems for the different disease types and stages providing an inexhaustible source of replicate material. For many translocations, DNA spanning the breakpoint was isolated by using cell lines carrying the particular abnormality. The cloning of the genes disrupted by the translocations has led to the availability of probes useful for diagnosis and monitoring of patients, eg with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Here, we review the cytogenetic and molecular data of chromosomal aberrations associated with leukemia-lymphoma and indicate a panel of human cell lines carrying such specific chromosomal abnormalities.","['Drexler, H G', 'MacLeod, R A', 'Borkhardt, A', 'Janssen, J W']","['Drexler HG', 'MacLeod RA', 'Borkhardt A', 'Janssen JW']","['DSM-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/physiology', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Mar;9(3):480-500.,247,,,,,"['ALK', 'AML-1', 'BCL1', 'BCL2', 'BCL6', 'BLC3', 'E2A', 'EAP', 'EVI1', 'HOX11', 'IL3', 'LCK', 'LYL1', 'LYT10', 'MDS', 'MTCP1', 'MYC', 'PBX1', 'RCK', 'SIS', 'TAL1', 'TAL2', 'TAN1', 'TTG11', 'TTG2']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied two patients with AILD that subsequently progressed into immunoblastic lymphoma (IBL) in order to investigate whether the LMP1 deletion mutant was implicated in progression of AILD into IBL. Immunohistology and in situ hybridization were performed on diagnostic biopsies. DNA extracted from fresh frozen material was used for rearrangement studies and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based amplification and sequencing of portions of the LMP1 gene. Immunohistochemistry revealed B cell origin of both cases of IBL. In the first patient clonal rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene was present in IBL but not in AILD. In this patient, scattered immunoblasts of AILD and numerous tumor cells of B-IBL were shown to contain EBV transcripts (EBER1) and to express LMP1. Sequence analysis of the LMP1 gene from AILD and IBL in the first, and from IBL in the second patient, revealed identical deletions and point mutations. This LMP1 deletion mutant is identical to those which have been reported in HD and NPC. Its association with evolution of AILD into B-IBL, aggressive HD and NPC, suggests that this particular mutant is more widespread than originally thought and is clinically relevant.","['Knecht, H', 'Martius, F', 'Bachmann, E', 'Hoffman, T', 'Zimmermann, D R', 'Rothenberger, S', 'Sandvej, K', 'Wegmann, W', 'Hurwitz, N', 'Odermatt, B F']","['Knecht H', 'Martius F', 'Bachmann E', 'Hoffman T', 'Zimmermann DR', 'Rothenberger S', 'Sandvej K', 'Wegmann W', 'Hurwitz N', 'Odermatt BF', 'et al.']","['Department of Internal Medicine, CHUV University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Viral Structural Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Viral/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Viral', '*Herpesviridae Infections/virology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/classification/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy/*pathology/virology', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Oncogenes', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology/virology', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/virology', '*Sequence Deletion', '*Tumor Virus Infections/virology', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/*genetics', 'Viral Structural Proteins/*genetics']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Mar;9(3):458-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We subdivided 165 consecutive adults with AML de novo into distinct clinical, morphological, and cytogenetic subsets and then tested for statistically significant associations with specific HLA antigens. Both morphology and cytogenetic pattern identified subsets of patients with important clinical features and different outcomes.

Certain HLA antigens were significantly correlated with more favorable remission rates, remission duration and survival. Possible mechanisms for the association of HLA antigens with particular subtypes of AML include the linkage or co-inheritance of an oncogene, the facilitation of binding of a transforming virus, toxin, or cytokine, or a permissive role involving impaired immune recognition of an emerging neoplasm.

We studied whether or not the spontaneous expression of IL-1 beta and IL-6 is due to an increased transcription rate of the cytokine gene and associated with a spontaneous expression of two transcription factors that play an important role in IL-1 beta and IL-6 gene transcription, namely activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B). In eight of the 19 AML patients a spontaneous expression of IL-1 beta mRNA was observed, whereas IL-6 mRNA was expressed in seven of the cases. Expression of IL-6 mRNA correlated nicely with the secretion of IL-6 protein. Nuclear run-on experiments showed that spontaneous expression of IL-1 beta and IL-6 was at least partly due to an increased transcription rate of the respective genes compared to the results from healthy unstimulated monocytes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that especially spontaneous expression of NF-kappa B is associated with spontaneous cytokine expression. However, the spontaneous expression of transcription factors is not due to the endogenous secretion of IL-1 since the addition of anti-IL-1 monoclonal antibody did not affect the expression of NF-kappa B. Finally, supershift experiments were performed that demonstrated that the NF-kappa B consists of the p50 and the p65 subunits. In summary, these results demonstrate that the spontaneous expression of cytokines is frequently associated with an increased transcription rate and a spontaneous expression of transcription factors.","['Dokter, W H', 'Tuyt, L', 'Sierdsema, S J', 'Esselink, M T', 'Vellenga, E']","['Dokter WH', 'Tuyt L', 'Sierdsema SJ', 'Esselink MT', 'Vellenga E']","['Department of Medicine, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (Thiocarbamates)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '25769-03-3 (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamic acid)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Immediate-Early', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Pyrrolidines/pharmacology', 'Thiocarbamates/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Mar;9(3):425-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate the expression of IL-2R alpha and IL-R beta on the CML blast cell line K562 by FACS analysis and cross-linking assay. Furthermore, we examined the effect of IL-2 on leukemic progenitor growth, employing K562 as a model. Clonogenic growth was assessed after 3 days of culture by colony formation in a serum-free, semi-solid assay system. IL-2 was found to exhibit a dose-dependent suppressive effect on K562 clonogenicity with 48% inhibition of colony formation at 250 U IL-2 and 60% inhibition at 1000 U IL-2. Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive K562 cells possess multiple copies of the bcr/abl fusion gene whose transcript and protein product (p210) is thought to confer growth advantage to CML cells. We therefore investigated IL-2-dependent modulation of bcr/abl mRNA accumulation and p210 protein levels in K562 cells. After 4 h of culture in the presence of IL-2, a 3-15-fold reduction of bcr/abl mRNA accumulation was demonstrated by competitive reverse PCR. Reduction of bcr/abl fusion protein levels was demonstrated at 24 h of IL-2-supplemented cell culture, employing p210 recognizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in FACS analysis. Levels of proliferation marker Ki67 were only marginally affected. We conclude: (1) K562 cells express both IL-2R alpha and IL-R beta; (2) IL-2 inhibits clonogenic growth of K562 in a dose-dependent manner; and (3) IL-2-mediated inhibition of K562 proliferation is preceded by a reduction of bcr/abl mRNA accumulation and p210 protein levels.","['Dilloo, D', 'Hanenberg, H', 'Lion, T', 'Burdach, S']","['Dilloo D', 'Hanenberg H', 'Lion T', 'Burdach S']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Programme, Heinrich Heine-University Medical Center, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Ki-67 Antigen', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Mar;9(3):419-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent investigations, using serum-free grown HL60 cells, we observed that all-trans RA, at 10(-7) M, did not induce neutrophil differentiation and that all-trans RA, at 10(-8) M, reduced the D3 concentration required for monocyte differentiation to 5 x 10(-9) M. In this study, co-operative interactions between all-trans and 9-cis RA and D3 which promote neutrophil and monocyte differentiation of HL60 cells have been analysed in detail. Treatment of serum-free grown HL60 cells with 5 x 10(-7) M all-trans RA or 9-cis RA resulted in sub-optimal neutrophil differentiation (up to 25% mature cells). As shown for all-trans RA, 9-cis RA cooperated with D3 to promote monocyte differentiation. Culture of HL60 cells in 5 x 10(-7) M 9-cis RA together with a wide range of concentrations of D3 resulted in promotion of neutrophil differentiation at 10(-15)-10(-12) D3, a failure to differentiate and apoptosis at 10(-11)-10(-10) M D3, followed by co-operativity between 9-cis RA and 5 x 10(-9) M D3 in inducing monocyte differentiation in the absence of neutrophil differentiation. Similar results were obtained when HL60 cells were treated with 5 x 10(-7) all-trans RA together with a wide range of concentrations of D3. Cross titration analyses of the effects of 9-cis RA and D3 on HL60 cell differentiation were undertaken to determine the boundaries of the concentrations of each agent, alone and in combination, that give rise to optimal neutrophil and monocyte differentiation of HL60 cells. The observed cooperativities between either 9-cis RA or all-trans RA and D3 have important implications for the use of combinations of these agents in differentiation therapy.","['Bunce, C M', 'Wallington, L A', 'Harrison, P', 'Williams, G R', 'Brown, G']","['Bunce CM', 'Wallington LA', 'Harrison P', 'Williams GR', 'Brown G']","['Department of Immunology, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', '*Monocytes', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', '*Neutrophils', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/drug effects/physiology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/drug effects/physiology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Mar;9(3):410-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can stimulate acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells to proliferate in vitro and in vivo. Log phase HL-60 cells were exposed to ara-C (10 microM x 3 h) and/or ASNase (10 U/ml during the last 2 h of ara-C). Ara-C and/or ASNase was removed and cells were incubated with or without GM-CSF (10 ng/ml). After 24, 48 and 72 h of GM-CSF there was no significant difference in the S phase fraction of cells exposed to ASNase prior to GM-CSF. Soft agar cloning efficiency was determined after retreatment with ara-C +/- ASNase 24 h into the GM-CSF incubation. GM-CSF enhanced cytotoxicity for all combinations, although this effect was of borderline significance (P = 0.0621); addition of ASNase to the treatment regimen significantly (P = 0.0229) enhanced cytotoxicity without any evidence of a negative interaction with GM-CSF. In addition, ara-C metabolism was assessed during simultaneous exposure to ara-C (10 microM x 3 h) +/- ASNase (10 U/ml the last 2 h) +/- GM-CSF (10 ng/ml beginning 24 h prior to ara-C). Ara-C incorporated into DNA (P = 0.0302) and ara-CTP formation (P = 0.0084 and P = 0.0003 at 2 and 3 h timepoints, respectively) were both increased significantly by GM-CSF, with modest non-significant increases with ASNase exposures. Neither ASNase nor GM-CSF inhibited the effects of the other in this in vitro model. Therefore, when appropriately scheduled, both GM-CSF and ASNase may potentiate ara-C cytotoxicity.","['Powell, B L', 'Wang, L M', 'Gregory, B W', 'Case, L D', 'Kucera, G L']","['Powell BL', 'Wang LM', 'Gregory BW', 'Case LD', 'Kucera GL']","['Department of Medicine, Wake Forest University, Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157-1082.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Asparaginase/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Mar;9(3):405-9.,,,,,['CA-12197-21/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preliminary observations in limited series also suggested that ALL-1 gene configuration is an important prognostic factor in this leukemic subset. We have now extended our study to a series of 45 AL patients aged between 0 and 18 months. The genomic configuration of ALL-1 in leukemic DNAs was determined by Southern blot hybridization and correlated with biological and clinical features at presentation, as well as with treatment outcome. Twenty-nine out of 45 (64%) patients showed ALL-1 rearrangements, including 4/11 (36%) infants aged between 13 and 18 months. Considering morphological types, 24/38 cases with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 5/7 patients with acute myeloid leukemia showed ALL-1 rearrangements. The features more frequently found in association with ALL-1 rearrangements were hyperleukocytosis (P < 0.007) and CD19+/CD10- blast immunophenotype (P < 0.02). ALL-1 status was an independent prognostic marker of event-free survival (EFS) in a multivariate model including age, sex and WBC count, and maintained its statistical significance when FAB morphology was considered in the analysis by including AML patients. Considering the ALL cases the actuarial EFS was 57 and 9% for infants with germline and rearranged ALL-1 configuration, respectively (P = 0.008). A high frequency of ALL-1 gene alterations in infant AL is confirmed by this study. In addition, our results emphasize the need for extending the analysis of ALL-1 gene status to infants with AL aged > 12 months. We show that this genetic lesion is the most important variable negatively affecting prognosis in a multivariate model including other known risk factors. This latter observation should influence the choice of risk-adapted treatment strategies in this AL subset.","['Cimino, G', 'Rapanotti, M C', 'Rivolta, A', 'Lo Coco, F', ""D'Arcangelo, E"", 'Rondelli, R', 'Basso, G', 'Barisone, E', 'Rosanda, C', 'Santostasi, T']","['Cimino G', 'Rapanotti MC', 'Rivolta A', 'Lo Coco F', ""D'Arcangelo E"", 'Rondelli R', 'Basso G', 'Barisone E', 'Rosanda C', 'Santostasi T', 'et al.']","['Dipartimento di Biopatologia Umana, Universita La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/embryology/*genetics/mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Prognosis', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transcription Factors']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Mar;9(3):391-5.,,,,,,"['ALL-1', 'HRX', 'HTRX', 'MLL']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic analysis revealed inversion of chromosome 14(q11q32.1). A total of 500 mg OKT3 (maximum dose 50 mg/day) was given. A decrease of lymphoblasts in the blood and a reduction of spleen size was observed. Complement levels dropped remarkably. Despite increasing serum levels of tumor necrosis factor, treatment was well tolerated overall. CD3 therapy induced strong IL-2 responsiveness of the lymphoblasts. Thus, OKT3 antibody treatment not only significantly decreased CD3-positive tumor cells, but also induced IL-2-mediated proliferation.

Forty-nine (4.3%) of the MDS and AML studied cytogenetically at our institution over a period of 11 years had detectable 17p deletion, through monosomy 17 (14 cases) or rearrangements of chromosome 17 (generally unbalanced translocations between 17p and another chromosome) (35 cases). Most of the patients had additional complex cytogenetic findings, and 10 cases were therapy related. In 70% of the patients with 17p deletion, a particular type of dysgranulopoiesis, combining pseudo-Pelger-Huet anomaly and small vacuolated neutrophils was seen in > 5% marrow neutrophils, whereas 69% of the patients had a p53 mutation, generally in a missense mutation involving exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene. FISH analysis, performed in eight cases, confirmed loss of one P53 allele in all of them. No DNA fragmentation suggesting increased apoptosis was found in marrow samples. Response to chemotherapy was almost uniformly poor and median survival was only 3 months. Analysis of dysgranulopoiesis and p53 mutations were also made in 'control' groups of MDS and AML without 17p deletion. 'Typical' dysgranulopoiesis, combining pseudo-Pelger-Huet anomaly and small vacuolated neutrophils in > 5% marrow neutrophils, was not seen in any of the 47 MDS and AML without 17p deletion analyzed and without p53 mutation (P = 10(-4) with patients having 17p deletion), and was seen in one of five patients without 17p deletion but with a p53 mutation. Only 3.1% of 256 MDS and AML without 17p deletion had a p53 mutation (P = 10(-4) with patients having 17p deletion). These findings suggest that 17p deletion, in MDS and AML, is strongly correlated to the presence of a particular type of dysgranulopoiesis and to a high incidence of p53 mutations, and that MDS and AML with 17p deletion could constitute a new morphological-cytogenetic-molecular entity in myeloid disorders.","['Lai, J L', 'Preudhomme, C', 'Zandecki, M', 'Flactif, M', 'Vanrumbeke, M', 'Lepelley, P', 'Wattel, E', 'Fenaux, P']","['Lai JL', 'Preudhomme C', 'Zandecki M', 'Flactif M', 'Vanrumbeke M', 'Lepelley P', 'Wattel E', 'Fenaux P']","['Service de Cytogenetique, C.H.U., Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*ultrastructure', 'Female', '*Genes, p53', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monosomy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Mar;9(3):370-81.,,,,,,['p53'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to its N- and C-terminal deletions, v-Myb contains a number of amino acid substitutions relative to c-Myb. We have previously shown that neither overexpression of c-Myb nor introduction of these amino acid substitutions into c-Myb is sufficient for transformation of myelomonocytic cells. However, a doubly truncated form of c-Myb which lacked these substitutions transformed myeloblastic cells that appeared to be committed to the granulocytic pathway. We demonstrate here that mutations in both the DNA-binding and transcriptional activation domains of v-Myb are required for transformation of rapidly growing monoblasts rather than more slowly growing myeloblasts. These rapidly growing monoblasts do not express mim-1, a target gene for the Gag-Myb-Ets protein of E26 leukemia virus, or C/EBP proteins which cooperate with Myb to activate mim-1 expression. Furthermore, v-Myb proteins which contain both sets of these mutations are weaker transcriptional activators relative to proteins which lack these mutations. These results support a model in which amino acid substitutions in v-Myb have been selected for their ability to activate only a subset of those genes which can be activated by a doubly truncated form of c-Myb. In particular, mim-1 appears to represent a class of genes whose expression was selected against during the development of an increasingly virulent strain of avian myeloblastosis virus by passage in animals.","['Dini, P W', 'Eltman, J T', 'Lipsick, J S']","['Dini PW', 'Eltman JT', 'Lipsick JS']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University, California 94305-5324.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-myb)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (mim-1 protein, Gallus gallus)']",IM,"['*Acetyltransferases', 'Base Sequence', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Oncogene Proteins v-myb', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.4.2515-2524.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Apr;69(4):2515-24. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.4.2515-2524.1995.,,,,,"['5T32 CA09151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA28146/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA56509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC188928,,,,,,,,,,,

The two proteins are 62% identical in their amino acid sequences and are predicted to have 10 transmembrane domains and five extracellular loops. A stretch of nine amino acids (region A) in the predicted fourth extracellular loop was previously shown to be critical for the function of Glvr1 as receptor for GALV and FeLV-B. Glvr1 and -2 show clusters of amino acid differences in several of their predicted extracellular loops, with the highest degree of divergence in region A. Chimeras were made between the two genes to further investigate the role of Glvr1 region A in defining receptor specificity for GALV and FeLV-B and to map which regions of Glvr2 control receptor specificity for A-MLVs. Region A from Glvr1 was sufficient to confer receptor specificity for GALV upon Glvr2, with the same chimera failing to act as a receptor for FeLV-B. However, introduction of additional N- or C-terminal Glvr1-encoding sequences in addition to Glvr1 region A-encoding sequences resulted in functional FeLV-B receptors. Therefore, FeLV-B is dependent on Glvr1 sequences outside region A for infectivity. The receptor specificity of Glvr2 for A-MLV could not be mapped to a single critical region; rather, N-terminal as well as C-terminal Glvr2-encoding sequences could confer specificity for A-MLV infection upon Glvr1. Surprisingly, though GALV/FeLV-B and A-MLV belong to different interference groups, some chimeras functioned as receptors for all three viruses.","['Pedersen, L', 'Johann, S V', 'van Zeijl, M', 'Pedersen, F S', ""O'Hara, B""]","['Pedersen L', 'Johann SV', 'van Zeijl M', 'Pedersen FS', ""O'Hara B""]","['Lederle Laboratories, American Cyanamid Company, Pearl River, New York 10965.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.4.2401-2405.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Apr;69(4):2401-5. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.4.2401-2405.1995.,,,,,,['glvr1'],PMC188913,,,,,,,,,,,

The long 5' untranslated region, the leader, is formed of independent well-structured domains involved in key steps of the viral life cycle such as the initiation of proviral DNA synthesis, genomic RNA dimerization and packaging, and the initiation of gag translation. These functional features and the presence of stable secondary structures between the cap and the gag initiation codon suggested that translation initiation of gag might proceed through a mechanism different from the canonical ribosome scanning process. Interestingly enough, murine leukemia viruses code also for a glycosylated gag precursor, named glyco-gag, initiated at a CUG codon upstream and in the same open reading frame as the AUGgag. We have investigated the translation initiation of gag and glyco-gag precursors of Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MLV) in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and in murine cells. Through site-directed mutagenesis of gag and glyco-gag initiation codons, we show that initiation of gag and glyco-gag synthesis does not utilize the classical ribosome scanning. When poliovirus protease 2A is coexpressed in murine cells, expression of MLV-lacZ RNA is not modified, indicating that translation initiation of MLV gag precursors is a cap-independent mechanism. In addition, the F-MLV leader was inserted between two genes in a dicistronic neo-MLV-lacZ mRNA, and its ability to promote expression was examined in vitro and in vivo. Results obtained demonstrate that an internal ribosome entry mechanism promotes translation of F-MLV gag precursors. This finding led us to construct a new dicistronic retroviral vector in which the F-MLV leader can promote both packaging of recombinant genomic RNA and expression of the 3' gene.","['Berlioz, C', 'Darlix, J L']","['Berlioz C', 'Darlix JL']","['LaboRetro, Unite de Virologie Humaine (INSERM-ENS U412), Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Codon', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Gene Products, gag/*genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Precursors/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/chemistry/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribosomes/*metabolism']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.4.2214-2222.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Apr;69(4):2214-22. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.4.2214-2222.1995.,,,,,,['lacZ'],PMC188890,,,,,,,,,,,

The long-latency phenotype of 61B has been mapped to four mutations in the extracellular domain of the envelope transmembrane protein, and we report here that these mutations cause a defect in envelope protein processing. Immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that the 61B gp85 envelope precursor was produced but that further processing to generate the surface protein (SU/gp70) and the transmembrane protein (TM/p15E) did not occur. The 61B precursor was not expressed on the cell surface and appeared to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus. Two of the four 61B-specific amino acid changes are located within a putative cysteine loop in a region of TM that is conserved among retroviruses. Introduction of these two amino acid changes into a replication-competent highly cytopathic virus resulted in the production of noninfectious virus that exhibited an envelope-protein-processing defect. This analysis suggests that mutations in a conserved region within a putative cysteine loop affect retroviral envelope protein maturation and viral infectivity.","['Burns, C C', 'Poss, M L', 'Thomas, E', 'Overbaugh, J']","['Burns CC', 'Poss ML', 'Thomas E', 'Overbaugh J']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Defective Viruses/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.4.2126-2132.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Apr;69(4):2126-32. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.4.2126-2132.1995.,,,,,"['CA51080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA62771-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC188879,,,,,,,,,,,

In a single round of infection, Vif- virus is approximately 25 (from CEMx174 cells) to 100 (from H9 cells) times less infectious than wild-type virus produced from these cells or than the Vif- mutant produced from HeLa cells. Vif- virions recovered from restrictive cells, but not from permissive cells, are abnormal both in terms of morphology and viral protein content. Notably, they contain much reduced quantities of envelope proteins and altered quantities of Gag and Pol proteins. Although wild-type and Vif- virions from restrictive cells contain similar quantities of viral RNA, no viral DNA synthesis was detectable after acute infection of target cells with phenotypically Vif- virions. To examine the possible role of Vif in viral entry, attempts were made to rescue the Vif- defect in H9 cells by pseudotyping Vif+ and Vif- HIV particles with amphotropic murine leukemia virus envelope. Vif- particles produced in the presence of HIV envelope could not be propagated when pseudotyped. In contrast, when only the murine leukemia virus envelope was present, significant propagation of Vif- HIV particles could be detected.

The RH/K30 cell line contained two integrated proviruses, an intact HTLV-I genome and an apparently defective provirus with an in-frame stop codon in the env gene. A genomic DNA fragment containing the intact HTLV-I provirus was cloned into bacteriophage lambda (K30 phi) and subcloned into a plasmid vector (K30p). HTLV-I p24gag protein was detected in culture supernatants of human and rabbit T-cell and fibroblast lines transfected with these clones, at levels comparable to those of the parental cell line RH/K30. Persistent expression of virus was observed in one of these lines, RL-5/K30p, for more than 24 months. Biologic characterization of this cell line revealed the presence of integrated HTLV-I provirus, spliced and unspliced mRNA transcripts, and typical extracellular type C retrovirus particles. As expected, these virus particles contained HTLV-I RNA and reverse transcriptase activity. The transfected cells also expressed surface major histocompatibility complex class II, whereas no expression of this molecule was detected in the parental RL-5 cell line. Virus was passaged by cocultivation of irradiated RL-5/K30p cells with either rabbit PBMC or human cord blood mononuclear cells, demonstrating in vitro infectivity. The virus produced in these cells was also infectious in vivo, since rabbits injected with RL-5/K30p cells became productively infected, as evidenced by seroconversion, amplification of HTLV-I-specific sequences by PCR from PBMC DNA, and virus isolation from PBMC. Availability of infectious molecular clones will facilitate functional studies of HTLV-I genes and gene products.","['Zhao, T M', 'Robinson, M A', 'Bowers, F S', 'Kindt, T J']","['Zhao TM', 'Robinson MA', 'Bowers FS', 'Kindt TJ']","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, NIAID Twinbrook II Facility, Rockville, Maryland 20852.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rabbits', 'Transfection']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.4.2024-2030.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Apr;69(4):2024-30. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.4.2024-2030.1995.,,['GENBANK/L03561'],,,,,PMC188867,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-three patients enrolled onto three Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) phase II trials of amonafide (300 mg/m2 daily for 5 days) were studied, using a limited sampling strategy (45 minutes and 24 hours) to estimate the amonafide area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). Concentrations of N-acetyl-amonafide, an active metabolite, were also determined. RESULTS: The primary determinant of toxicity at a fixed dose of amonafide was the extent of N-acetylation. Fast acetylators (36% of patients) had significantly greater toxicity than slow acetylators (64% of patients), with median WBC nadirs of 500/microL and 3,400/microL, respectively (P < or = .001). In a multivariate analysis, lower pretreatment WBC count, lower albumin level, and nonwhite race were also independently associated with toxicity. Further analysis of interracial differences demonstrated that minority women had slower clearance of amonafide (P = .026) and a higher incidence of grade 4 leukopenia (P = .042). CONCLUSION: The highly variable toxicity of amonafide is primarily due to genetic differences in N-acetylation. Other genetic (race) and acquired factors (baseline WBC count and albumin level) also appear to influence the extent of toxicity observed following administration of this agent.","['Ratain, M J', 'Rosner, G', 'Allen, S L', 'Costanza, M', 'Van Echo, D A', 'Henderson, I C', 'Schilsky, R L']","['Ratain MJ', 'Rosner G', 'Allen SL', 'Costanza M', 'Van Echo DA', 'Henderson IC', 'Schilsky RL']","['University of Chicago, IL 60637.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imides)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Naphthalimides)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '1Q8D39N37L (amonafide)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Adenine', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imides/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Isoquinolines/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Naphthalimides', 'Organophosphonates', 'Racial Groups', 'Regression Analysis', 'Serum Albumin/metabolism', 'United States']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.3.741 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Mar;13(3):741-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.3.741.,,,,,"['CA-31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-44691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of 499 Hodgkin's disease patients treated between 1962 and 1993 were reviewed. There were 385 adolescents (> or = 10 years of age at diagnosis) and 114 preadolescents (< 10 years). Most patients (n = 346) were treated with radiation plus multiagent chemotherapy, while 30 received only chemotherapy and 123 only radiation therapy. Radiation doses ranged from 20 to 42 Gy. RESULTS: At a median follow-up duration of 9 years (range, 0.1 to 27.4), 25 patients have had second malignancies: 19 solid tumors, four acute nonlymphoblastic leukemias (ANLLs), 1 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and one chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Three patients have had a third malignancy. The estimated cumulative risk of second malignancies increased from 1.5% at 5 years to 7.7% at 15 years. All but two of the patients with second malignancies were > or = 10 years of age at initial diagnosis, which reflects the higher risk among patients treated for Hodgkin's disease as adolescents (P = .01). Second malignancies were more common among female patients (P = .0002), even when those breast cancer were excluded (P = .007), and in those treated for recurrent Hodgkin's disease (P = .02). Patients with ANLL/NHL were older at diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease than those with solid tumors, (median age, 18.3 v 13.8 years; P = .04). There was no difference between groups treated with radiation therapy alone, chemotherapy alone, or radiation plus multiagent chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Adolescents treated for Hodgkin's disease are at greater at risk of second malignancies than younger patients. Overall, adolescent females treated for recurrent Hodgkin's disease appear to be at greatest risk, while preadolescents appear to be protected from this late complication.","['Beaty, O 3rd', 'Hudson, M M', 'Greenwald, C', 'Luo, X', 'Fang, L', 'Wilimas, J A', 'Thompson, E I', 'Kun, L E', 'Pratt, C B']","['Beaty O 3rd', 'Hudson MM', 'Greenwald C', 'Luo X', 'Fang L', 'Wilimas JA', 'Thompson EI', 'Kun LE', 'Pratt CB']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101-0318.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors']",1995/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.3.603 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Mar;13(3):603-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.3.603.,,,['J Clin Oncol. 1995 Aug;13(8):2143.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-six patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL, n = 26), Hodgkin's disease (HD, n = 17), or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 13) with a history of previous radiation therapy were treated with cyclophosphamide (7.2 g/m2), carmustine (300 mg/m2 or 600 mg/m2), and etoposide (2,400 mg/m2; CBV) followed by allo BMT. RESULTS: Nine of 56 patients are alive and disease-free a median of 1,091 (range, 512 to 1,784) days post-transplant. The probabilities of transplant-related mortality, relapse, and event-free survival at 2 years for the entire group of 56 patients were .62, .59, and .17, respectively. Patients who received 600 mg/m2 of carmustine had a higher incidence of grade 3 or 4 regimen-related toxicities (RRTs) (14 of 22) than did patients who received 300 mg/m2 (12 of 33; P < .04), whereas there was no difference in relapse (.34 and .53, respectively, P = .73). Fourteen of 16 patients who received allo BMT for advanced disease (n = 12) or less-advanced disease (n = 4) but who were also eligible for auto BMT relapsed (n = 4) or died of transplant-related complications (n = 10). CONCLUSIONS: Allo BMT following a high-dose CBV regimen resulted in long-term disease-free survival in 17% of patients with lymphoid malignancies who had received prior dose-limiting radiotherapy. A high incidence of transplant-related complications, especially fatal idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) and a high relapse rate limited success. Morbidity and mortality associated with carmustine 600 mg/m2 were high and were not associated with a decrease in relapse. The number of patients in this study eligible for either allo or auto BMT was limited and precluded meaningful analysis of relative effectiveness.","['Demirer, T', 'Weaver, C H', 'Buckner, C D', 'Petersen, F B', 'Bensinger, W I', 'Sanders, J', 'Clift, R A', 'Lilleby, K', 'Anasetti, C', 'Martin, P']","['Demirer T', 'Weaver CH', 'Buckner CD', 'Petersen FB', 'Bensinger WI', 'Sanders J', 'Clift RA', 'Lilleby K', 'Anasetti C', 'Martin P', 'et al.']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'CBV protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.3.596 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Mar;13(3):596-602. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.3.596.,,,,,"['CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 47748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a phase II trial of 2-CdA in previously untreated CLL patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 2-CdA was administered to 20 patients with previously untreated CLL as a 0.1-mg/kg/d 7-day continuous intravenous infusion every 28 to 35 days until maximum response or prohibitive toxicity. RESULTS: A median of four courses (range, one to nine) was administered to each patient. Five patients (25%) achieved a complete response and 12 (60%) achieved a partial response, for an overall response rate of 85%. The median response follow-up duration was 8+ months (range, 3 to 27). Myelosuppression was the principal toxicity. Four of 20 patients (20%) experienced grade III or IV thrombocytopenia. Three patients, all of whom received corticosteroid therapy, developed opportunistic infections at a median of 19 months following discontinuation of 2-CdA therapy. CONCLUSION: 2-CdA has major activity in patients with previously untreated CLL, and the lower response rates seen in previously treated patients may be due in part to poor marrow reserve from prior therapy. Determination of the relative effectiveness of 2-CdA, fludarabine, and chlorambucil in the treatment of CLL patients will require a randomized trial.","['Saven, A', 'Lemon, R H', 'Kosty, M', 'Beutler, E', 'Piro, L D']","['Saven A', 'Lemon RH', 'Kosty M', 'Beutler E', 'Piro LD']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Ida M. and Cecil H.

In 1987, we initiated a prospective multiinstitution study designed to improve long-term survival in adults with AML. METHODS: We modified the usual 7-day treatment scheme of daunorubicin and cytarabine with high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) on days 8 through 10 (3 + 7 + 3). Allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was offered to all patients who entered complete remission (CR) to decrease the rate of leukemic relapse. Data were analyzed by intention to treat. RESULTS: CRs were achieved in 84 of 94 patients (89%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 83 to 95). Because of the high remission rate, factors previously thought to predict outcome, such as cytogenetics, WBC count, French-American-British (FAB) classification, sex, and age, were not useful prognostic variables. The overall survival rate for the entire cohort of patients from data of diagnosis is 55% at 5 years. Sixty percent of all patients who achieved a CR underwent marrow grafting. There was no significant difference in event-free survival (EFS) at 5 years comparing patients assigned to receive allogeneic BMT with patients assigned to receive autologous BMT (56% v 45%, P = .54). CONCLUSION: The long-term disease-free survival observed in this study is excellent compared with historical data. This improvement in survival is probably due to the high rate of remission induction, as well as to the effective nature of the consolidation therapy.","['Mitus, A J', 'Miller, K B', 'Schenkein, D P', 'Ryan, H F', 'Parsons, S K', 'Wheeler, C', 'Antin, J H']","['Mitus AJ', 'Miller KB', 'Schenkein DP', 'Ryan HF', 'Parsons SK', 'Wheeler C', 'Antin JH']","[""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Regression Analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'United States']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.3.560 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Mar;13(3):560-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.3.560.,,,"['J Clin Oncol. 1995 Jul;13(7):1828-30.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-five adults with Ph-positive CML received intensive chemotherapy with daunorubicin and high-dose cytarabine (ara-C) (DAUNO-HDAC; 26 patients) or fludarabine, high-dose ara-C, and mitoxantrone (FAM; 29 patients). Collections of the peripheral mononuclear cells were initiated when the WBC count was > or = 0.8 x 10(3)/microL. Simultaneous peripheral and marrow samples were subjected to cytogenetic studies. RESULTS: Thirty-eight of 55 patients (69%) were able to undergo the PSC collections. The rate of collection was higher in chronic phase (26 of 30 patients; 87%) than in accelerated (11 of 17; 65%) and blastic phases (1 of 8; 12%). Among the 30 patients in chronic phase, cytogenetic analyses of PSC showed cytogenetic responses (Ph-positive < 95%) in 60%, which were major (Ph < 35%) in 43% and complete (Ph = 0%) in 27%. Seven of 19 patients with simultaneous studies (37%; 23% of total) had a significantly lower percentage of Ph-positive cells in the peripheral collection compared with the marrow collection; one had the reverse phenomenon (5%; 3% of total). Cytogenetic responses were modest in both peripheral and marrow collections in CML accelerated and blastic phases. Myelosuppression-associated complications were frequent, resulting in febrile episodes in 76% of patients.

Clinical presentation is highlighted and a brief review of the childhood leukemias and common clinical features are outlined. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 16-yr-old black male was seen after suffering from leg and knee pains for 7 months. Exquisite tibial pain, normal radiographs and an abnormal CBC led to the diagnosis of leukemia. Subsequent referral for bone marrow examination confirmed the final diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: The patient was referred to a pediatric hematologist-oncologist for medical management of his condition. He is currently receiving chemotherapy and the search for a suitable donor for bone marrow transplant is in progress. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates the importance of considering one of the more common pediatric malignancies, such as leukemia, in the differential diagnosis of children with musculoskeletal complaints. Chronic myelogenous leukemia accounts for only 3-5% of cases of childhood onset. Its rare incidence in childhood constitutes the basis for this case report.","['Plezbert, J A', 'Bose, M', 'Carlisle, G']","['Plezbert JA', 'Bose M', 'Carlisle G']","['Clinical Science Faculty, New York College of Chiropractic, Seneca Falls 13148-0800.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Manipulative Physiol Ther,Journal of manipulative and physiological therapeutics,7807107,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Chiropractic', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Knee Joint', 'Leg', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Pain/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Referral and Consultation']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Manipulative Physiol Ther. 1994 Nov-Dec;17(9):610-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It encodes a nuclear protein of 21 kD which inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase activity. Constitutive p21WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 mRNA expression was detected in neoplastic cells from patients with various hematological malignancies as well as in normal bone marrow mononuclear cells and in myeloid and lymphoid cell lines independent of their p53 status. Induced differentiation of the p53-deficient promyelocytic HL-60 cells along the monocytic lineage by phorbol ester or 1a,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 resulted in a marked increase of both p21WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 mRNA and protein expression due to enhanced mRNA stability. Differentiation towards the granulocytic lineage by all-trans retinoic acid or dimethylsulfoxide failed to produce this effect. p21WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 is an immediate early gene since its upregulation occurred independently of de novo protein synthesis. The induction of p21WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 expression and its regulation in p53-deficient differentiating leukemic cells support the idea of an additional, p53-independent role of p21WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 in human hematopoiesis.","['Schwaller, J', 'Koeffler, H P', 'Niklaus, G', 'Loetscher, P', 'Nagel, S', 'Fey, M F', 'Tobler, A']","['Schwaller J', 'Koeffler HP', 'Niklaus G', 'Loetscher P', 'Nagel S', 'Fey MF', 'Tobler A']","['Laboratory for Clinical and Experimental Research, University of Berne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Granulocytes/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Monocytes/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI117806 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1995 Mar;95(3):973-9. doi: 10.1172/JCI117806.,,,,,"['CA-26038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-42792/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC441429,,,,,,,,,,,

Novel intrapituitary regulation of adrenocorticotropin hormone synthesis and secretion.,1288-98,"Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) gene expression was detected in human fetal pituitary tissue by expression of LIF mRNA transcripts, protein immunocytochemistry, and immunoelectron microscopy. Fetal LIF immunoreactivity colocalized with 30% of ACTH-expressing cells, approximately 20% of somatotrophs, and approximately 15% of non-hormone-expressing cells. LIF was also strongly expressed in normal adult pituitary and in four growth hormone-producing and two ACTH-producing adenomas, but not in eight nonfunctioning pituitary tumors. Culture of fetal cells expressing surface LIF-binding sites demonstrated predominance of in vitro ACTH secretion as compared with other pituitary hormones. In AtT-20 murine cells, LIF (ED50 10 pM) stimulated basal proopiomelanocortin mRNA levels by 40% and corticotropin-releasing hormone-induced ACTH secretion (two- to threefold), as did oncostatin M (ED50 30 pM), a related peptide. ACTH responses were not further enhanced by both cytokines together, which is consistent with their shared receptor. Anti-LIF antiserum neutralized basal and LIF-induced ACTH secretion, suggesting autocrine regulation of ACTH by LIF. The results show that human pituitary cells express the LIF gene and LIF-binding sites, predominantly in corticotrophs. Pituitary LIF expression and LIF regulation of proopiomelanocortin and ACTH reflect an intrapituitary role for LIF in modulating early embryonic determination of specific human pituitary cells and as a paracrine or autocrine regulator of mature ACTH.","['Akita, S', 'Webster, J', 'Ren, S G', 'Takino, H', 'Said, J', 'Zand, O', 'Melmed, S']","['Akita S', 'Webster J', 'Ren SG', 'Takino H', 'Said J', 'Zand O', 'Melmed S']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center-UCLA School of Medicine 90048.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', '9015-71-8 (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone)']",IM,"['Adenoma/metabolism', 'Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Pituitary Gland/drug effects/embryology/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI117779 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1995 Mar;95(3):1288-98. doi: 10.1172/JCI117779.,,,,,['DK-42792/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC441468,,,,,,,,,,,

Rho participates in the regulation of the microfilament cytoskeleton. Decrease in ADP-ribosylation of Rho occurs in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and precedes the toxin A-induced destruction of the actin cytoskeleton. Action of toxin A is not due to proteolytical degradation of Rho or to an inherent ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of toxin A. Toxin A-induced decrease in ADP-ribosylation is observed also in cell lysates and with recombinant RhoA protein. A heat stable low molecular mass cytosolic factor is essential for the toxin effect on Rho.

These results suggest that ferritin has dual functions; it promotes the growth of leukemia cells with low concentrations of FCS, but suppresses their growth with high concentrations of FCS.","['Kikyo, N', 'Hagiwara, K', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Okabe, T']","['Kikyo N', 'Hagiwara K', 'Yazaki Y', 'Okabe T']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Ferritins/*pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01202216 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1995;121(2):76-8. doi: 10.1007/BF01202216.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we describe changes in O2(-)-generating activity and expression of O2(-)-generating components during differentiation of human monoblastic leukemia U937 cells to macrophage-like cells. Undifferentiated U937 cells generated no O2- in response to a stimulation, although they expressed the three components other than the cytochrome b558 large subunit. When U937 cells were cultured with agents that induced the cell differentiation, such as vitamin D3, retinoic acid, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor, O2(-)-generating activity increased 5- to 200-fold depending on the agent used. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that the amounts of the four protein components essential for O2- generation increased, although their induction levels were significantly different between inducers. Among the four protein components, the cytochrome subunits were induced in low levels by all agents tested, which may explain why the O2(-)-generating activity of differentiated U937 cells was much lower than that of neutrophils from peripheral blood.","['Kikuchi, H', 'Fujinawa, T', 'Kuribayashi, F', 'Nakanishi, A', 'Imajoh-Ohmi, S', 'Goto, M', 'Kanegasaki, S']","['Kikuchi H', 'Fujinawa T', 'Kuribayashi F', 'Nakanishi A', 'Imajoh-Ohmi S', 'Goto M', 'Kanegasaki S']","['Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Cytochrome b Group)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '9064-78-2 (cytochrome b558)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antibodies', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytochrome b Group/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', '*NADPH Oxidases', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Superoxides/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a124590 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem. 1994 Oct;116(4):742-6. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a124590.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The estimated doses were used to determine if a higher incidence of leukemia among residents of Utah could have been attributed to exposure to radioactive fallout from above-ground nuclear weapons tests conducted at the Nevada Test Site. The objective of the dosimetry methodology was to estimate absorbed dose to active marrow specific to each case and each control subject. Data on the residence of each subject were available from records of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Deposition of fallout was determined from databases developed using historical measurements and exposure for each subject from each test was estimated using those data. Exposure was converted to dose by applying an age-dependent dose conversion factor and a factor for shielding. The median dose for all case and control subjects was 3.2 mGy. The maximum estimated mean dose for any case or control was 29 +/- 5.6 mGy (a resident of Washington County, UT). Uncertainties were estimated for each estimated dose.

Kinetic characterization and specificity analyses have been reported for several retroviral PR using oligopeptide substrates. In this study, we performed a comparative analysis of PR from avian, bovine, simian and human retroviruses using polyproteins of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 or avian leukosis virus as substrates. Polyproteins were derived from immature virus-like particles purified from culture medium of transfected or recombinant baculovirus-infected cells. Specific cleavage to the correct size intermediate and end products occurred in the presence of detergent and homologous PR. HIV-1 PR cleaved its Gag precursor to completion at a concentration of approximately 25 nM but cleaved the Gag-Pol precursor incompletely even at fourfold higher PR concentration. In contrast to the requirement for high ionic strength for peptide cleavage reported previously, we found that Gag protein cleavage by HIV-1 PR proceeded best at low ionic strength, for both of the protein substrates tested. HIV-2 PR was approximately sixfold less active than HIV-1 PR. PR from avian myeloblastosis-associated virus (MAV) yielded efficient cleavage of the HIV-1 polyprotein only at concentrations above 1 microM. Both enzymes were stimulated by high salt and their cleavage products were identical or very similar to those of HIV-1 PR. A mutant of MAV PR engineered to cleave HIV-1 peptide substrates did not cleave the HIV-1 polyprotein at a concentration of 0.4 microM. The PR of Mason Pfizer monkey virus cleaved this polyprotein very poorly, whereas PR of bovine leukemia virus cleaved it, albeit at different sites.","['Konvalinka, J', 'Heuser, A M', 'Hruskova-Heidingsfeldova, O', 'Vogt, V M', 'Sedlacek, J', 'Strop, P', 'Krausslich, H G']","['Konvalinka J', 'Heuser AM', 'Hruskova-Heidingsfeldova O', 'Vogt VM', 'Sedlacek J', 'Strop P', 'Krausslich HG']","['Angewandte Tumorvirologie, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-pol)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Alpharetrovirus/enzymology', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/enzymology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endopeptidases/*physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-pol/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/*metabolism', 'HIV/enzymology', 'Retroviridae/*enzymology']",1995/02/15 00:00,1995/02/15 00:01,['1995/02/15 00:00'],"['1995/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.tb20249.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1995 Feb 15;228(1):191-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.tb20249.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In both systems, neoplastic B lymphocytes show a defective antigen-presenting function, which is more evident with disease progression. Such a defect cannot be ascribed to a decreased MHC class II molecule expression nor to an abnormal IL-1 beta production, but it can be partially accounted for by a low B7 expression. Pretreatment of neoplastic B cells with interleukin-4 (IL-4) restores primary MLR, but has little effect on the response to TT. The effect of IL-4 is not mediated by quantitative modifications of class II and B7 molecule expression or of IL-1 beta production.","['Dazzi, F', ""D'Andrea, E"", 'Biasi, G', 'De Silvestro, G', 'Gaidano, G', 'Schena, M', 'Tison, T', 'Vianello, F', 'Girolami, A', 'Caligaris-Cappio, F']","['Dazzi F', ""D'Andrea E"", 'Biasi G', 'De Silvestro G', 'Gaidano G', 'Schena M', 'Tison T', 'Vianello F', 'Girolami A', 'Caligaris-Cappio F']","['Istituto di Semeiotica Medica, Quarta Cattedra di Medicina Interna, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,Clinical immunology and immunopathology,0356637,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Tetanus Toxoid)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Antigen Presentation', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'HLA-DR Antigens/physiology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Isoantigens/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Solubility', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tetanus Toxoid/immunology/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0090122985710483 [pii]', '10.1006/clin.1995.1048 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 1995 Apr;75(1):26-32. doi: 10.1006/clin.1995.1048.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of exponentially growing WiDr human colon carcinoma cells to AZT resulted in synchronization of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. Following treatment with AZT at 50 or 200 microM, 62% +/- 3% or 82% +/- 4% of the cells were in the S phase as compared with 36% +/- 2% in the control. Bromodeoxyuridine uptake studies revealed that the synchronized cells actively synthesized DNA. At concentrations of up to 200 microM, AZT produced a cytostatic rather than cytotoxic effect as indicated by viability and cell growth measurements. At 200 microM, AZT-induced synchronization was significant (P = < 0.001) after 12 h of drug exposure, reached a maximum at 24 h, and reversed to baseline levels by 72 h even in the continued presence of the drug. This indicates that AZT-induced cytostasis is a transient and reversible effect. The cell-cycle events seen with AZT in WiDr cells were also observed in eight of nine human tumor cell lines tested. Isobologram analysis of WiDr cells preexposed to AZT for 24 h and then exposed to either AZT-5-fluorouracil or AZT-methotrexate for a further 72 h revealed synergy between AZT and the anticancer agents, indicating that AZT-induced synchronization may have therapeutic benefits.","['Chandrasekaran, B', 'Kute, T E', 'Duch, D S']","['Chandrasekaran B', 'Kute TE', 'Duch DS']","['Division of Cell Biology, Wellcome Research Laboratories, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Carcinoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Melanoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'S Phase/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zidovudine/therapeutic use/*toxicity']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00686833 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1995;35(6):489-95. doi: 10.1007/BF00686833.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, PML was shown to concentrate within subnuclear domains, referred to as nuclear bodies, that are disorganized in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. This observation provided the first evidence that alteration of a nuclear structure may play a role in human pathogenesis. In an attempt to clarify the role of PML and, more generally, of the associated nuclear bodies, we used immunohistochemistry to explore the expression of PML in normal, inflammatory, and neoplastic human tissues. With the exception of endothelial cells and macrophages that contain a high amount of PML protein, a weak speckled labeling pattern was observed in the nucleus of all cell types analyzed. By contrast to normal tissues, the level of PML expression was considerably enhanced in inflammatory tissues, predominantly around the mononuclear cell infiltrate, as well as during either normal or pathological proliferative states, in particular in tumoral pathology. Surprisingly, in most hepatocellular carcinoma, a cytoplasmic delocalization of PML was observed. Finally, the number of PML nuclear bodies increased up to twice their normal value as quiescent cultured cells were stimulated to grow upon serum addition. Altogether these results strongly suggest that the PML-associated nuclear bodies are implicated both in the inflammatory process and in cell growth control.","['Terris, B', 'Baldin, V', 'Dubois, S', 'Degott, C', 'Flejou, J F', 'Henin, D', 'Dejean, A']","['Terris B', 'Baldin V', 'Dubois S', 'Degott C', 'Flejou JF', 'Henin D', 'Dejean A']","['Department of Pathology, Hopital Beaujon, Clichy, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*chemistry', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/chemistry', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*chemistry', 'Cell Cycle', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/chemistry', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/chemistry', 'Female', '*Hepatitis', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/chemistry', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Neoplasms/*chemistry', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/chemistry']",1995/04/01 00:00,1995/04/01 00:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Apr 1;55(7):1590-7.,,,,,,['PML'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined a series of 14 hematopoietic cell lines and 117 primary lymphoid tumors for deletion and mutation of these genes.

Unexpectedly both the continuous down-regulation of c-myc expression caused by exposure to c-myc AS PS-ODN and up-regulation after its withdrawal influenced apoptosis. We found that continuous suppression of c-myc expression by 10 microM c-myc AS PS-ODN could decrease the proliferation of HL-60 cells to approximately 60% of the control growth after 3 days of suspension culture, and when assessed morphologically the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis was 3.5%. Evidence either of cell cycle arrest or cell cycle prolongation was not detected. It is likely that apoptosis induced by the sustained down-regulation of c-myc expression with AS PS-ODN treatment was solely sufficient to explain the inhibition of cell proliferation. Up-regulation of c-myc expression was observed within 1 h after c-myc AS PS-ODN withdrawal. This up-regulation further enhanced induction of apoptosis and involved up to 32% of the cells. These results suggest that while the continuous suppression of c-myc expression caused a constant effect on the induction of apoptosis, its abrupt up-regulation could rapidly drive a considerable number of HL-60 cells into the apoptotic pathway.","['Kimura, S', 'Maekawa, T', 'Hirakawa, K', 'Murakami, A', 'Abe, T']","['Kimura S', 'Maekawa T', 'Hirakawa K', 'Murakami A', 'Abe T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/analysis/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/03/15 00:00,1995/03/15 00:01,['1995/03/15 00:00'],"['1995/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Mar 15;55(6):1379-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We further investigated biochemical and molecular features of topoisomerase I in the resistant cell line. Sequence analyses of the top1 cDNA from CEM/C2 identified mutations corresponding to two amino acid substitutions, Met370Thr and Asn722Ser.

Western blotting revealed that granulocytic maturation in DMSO-treated HL-60 human leukemia cells was accompanied by a 5-fold decrease in topo I polypeptide content. Consistent with this result, 3- to 5-fold higher concentrations of the topo I poison camptothecin were required to stabilize topo I-DNA adducts in DMSO-treated HL-60 cells compared to untreated cells. Northern blotting revealed that these changes occurred without any decrease in topo I message. Immunolocalization studies revealed that these quantitative changes were accompanied by redistribution of topo I away from the nucleoli, where it was prominently accumulated in untreated HL-60 cells, to a more uniform nuclear distribution in DMSO-treated cells. Similar changes occurred during granulocytic maturation in human marrow in vivo. Western blotting revealed that topo I levels in normal progranulocytes were 50% as high as those in HL-60 cells, levels in metamyelocytes were 35% as high as HL-60 cells, and levels in peripheral blood granulocytes were 5% as high as HL-60 cells. Two other polypeptides that are concentrated in nucleoli, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and B23/nucleophosmin, also decreased during the course of granulocytic maturation. These changes were accompanied by an alteration in topo I localization similar to that observed in HL-60 cells during the course of granulocytic maturation. Conversely, treatment of human lymphocytes with the mitogenic lectin concanavalin A resulted in a 3-fold increase in topo I polypeptide content concomitant with a prominent increase in the amount of nucleolar antigen. These observations not only provide a context for understanding the recent observation that topo I levels are higher in human leukemia specimens than in normal marrow but also raise the possibility that elevated topo I levels in other cells might reflect alterations in nucleolar structure and function.","['Kaufmann, S H', 'Charron, M', 'Burke, P J', 'Karp, J E']","['Kaufmann SH', 'Charron M', 'Burke PJ', 'Karp JE']","['Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*analysis', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*enzymology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology']",1995/03/15 00:00,1995/03/15 00:01,['1995/03/15 00:00'],"['1995/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Mar 15;55(6):1255-60.,,,,,['CA06974/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The p27 gene product is thought to control the leukocyte cell cycle and the 12p13 chromosomal band is known to be deleted in leukemias, suggesting that the p27 gene may act as a tumor suppressor gene in leukemias. Although p27 was found to reside in the minimal region of chromosomal loss in hematological malignancies, no mutations of p27 were observed in leukemia samples. Haploinsufficiency of p27 may confer a growth advantage to leukemia cells.","['Pietenpol, J A', 'Bohlander, S K', 'Sato, Y', 'Papadopoulos, N', 'Liu, B', 'Friedman, C', 'Trask, B J', 'Roberts, J M', 'Kinzler, K W', 'Rowley, J D']","['Pietenpol JA', 'Bohlander SK', 'Sato Y', 'Papadopoulos N', 'Liu B', 'Friedman C', 'Trask BJ', 'Roberts JM', 'Kinzler KW', 'Rowley JD', 'et al.']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, Maryland 21231.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1995/03/15 00:00,1995/03/15 00:01,['1995/03/15 00:00'],"['1995/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Mar 15;55(6):1206-10.,,"['GENBANK/S76986', 'GENBANK/S76988']",,,"['CA 43460/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['p27<up>kip1</up>'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Unexpectedly, combination of CY and Act D did not result in prolongation of mice survival, due mainly to substantial cumulative toxic effects that led to death in several cases. Immunotherapy with TNF-alpha and M phi, injected i.t. on day 4 following inoculation of leukemic cells, did not give significant therapeutic effect, either when used alone or when used in conjunction.

The incidence of such infections has been documented, but few studies have assessed potential risk factors, and to the authors' knowledge, none have measured the effect of neutropenia upon the incidence of these infections. METHODS: A cohort of 71 adult patients with cancer with long-dwelling tunnelled central venous catheters was followed for a total of 12,410 catheter days until catheter removal, death, or end of study for the occurrence of catheter-related infection or sepsis of unknown origin. Fifteen factors were assessed for association with these infections. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (18%) experienced a catheter-related infection (1.0/1000 catheter days), and 23 (32%) experienced sepsis of unknown origin. Neutropenia was associated significantly with risk for catheter-related infection (relative risk [RR] = 15.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.7-86.9) and sepsis of unknown origin (RR = 10.3, 95% CI 4.0-26.8). Inpatient status, acute leukemia, and cytosine arabinoside therapy also were associated with sepsis of unknown origin, but not when adjusted for neutropenia. CONCLUSION: Of the 15 potential risk factors studied, neutropenia was the only independent risk factor for infection related to long-dwelling tunnelled central venous catheters and for sepsis of unknown origin.","['Howell, P B', 'Walters, P E', 'Donowitz, G R', 'Farr, B M']","['Howell PB', 'Walters PE', 'Donowitz GR', 'Farr BM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville 22908.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/complications/therapy', 'Neutropenia/*complications/etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis/complications/*etiology', 'Statistics as Topic']",1995/03/15 00:00,1995/03/15 00:01,['1995/03/15 00:00'],"['1995/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19950315)75:6<1367::aid-cncr2820750620>3.0.co;2-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1995 Mar 15;75(6):1367-75. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19950315)75:6<1367::aid-cncr2820750620>3.0.co;2-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of the CHRF-288-11 infected cells with phorbol esters, which induces megakaryocytic differentiation, increases expression of the lacZ transgene. The staining pattern of the lacZ reaction product was perinuclear and punctate in the CHRF-288-11 cells, whereas it was uniform throughout the cytoplasm of the K562 cells, suggesting different sorting mechanisms for bacterial beta-galactosidase in these two cell types.

Missing data in longitudinal studies is frequently handled by excluding from analyses those cases for whom data are incomplete. This approach to missing data is not optimal.

On the other hand, if data are not missing at random, then dropping incomplete cases leads to biased parameter estimates and hypothesis tests that may be internally and externally invalid. This study uses three years of follow-up data from a longitudinal investigation of neuropsychological outcomes of cancer in children to demonstrate the problems presented by missing data in repeated measures designs and some solutions. In evaluating potential biasing effects of attrition, the study extends previous research on neuropsychological outcomes in pediatric cancer by inclusion of patients whose disease had relapsed, and by comparison of surviving and nonsurviving patients.

F-ara-ATP serves as an inhibitory alternative substrate in several key processes involved in DNA synthesis. The enzymes required in DNA synthesis and affected by F-ara-ATP are ribonucleotide reductase, DNA primase, DNA polymerases, 3'-5' exonuclease activity of DNA polymerases delta and epsilon, and DNA ligase I. The action of fludarabine on DNA replication provides a compelling rationale to use this agent for leukemias where target cells are actively synthesizing DNA, for example acute myelogenous leukemia. Additionally, the role of F-ara-ATP to potentiate the activity of deoxycytidine kinase makes it an appropriate candidate to use in combination with other nucleoside analogs which require deoxycytidine kinase for their activation. The present article reviews the effect of fludarabine on enzymes involved in DNA synthesis and the role of fludarabine in combination with arabinosylcytosine for the treatment of diseases other than indolent leukemias.","['Gandhi, V', 'Huang, P', 'Plunkett, W']","['Gandhi V', 'Huang P', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409052689 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994;14 Suppl 2:3-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199409052689.,49,,,,"['CA 28596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigators of the Childrens Cancer Group.,645-53,"Whether low level radiation exposure before conception increases the risk of leukemia in offspring has been much debated. No study has specifically evaluated the effect of parental preconception diagnostic X-ray exposure in the development of leukemia among infants. Mothers of 302 infant leukemia cases (diagnosed at < or = 18 months of age) and 558 individually matched regional controls, and fathers of 250 cases and 361 controls, were independently interviewed to obtain information on X-ray exposures. Paternal preconception X-ray exposure was associated with an increased risk of infant leukemia, higher risks being linked to exposures closer to conception. X-ray related leukemia risk varied with exposure site and histopathological type, the highest risk being for acute lymphocytic leukemia related to two or more X-rays of the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract and lower abdomen (odds ratio, 3.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.49-9.64). A positive association was observed between acute lymphocytic leukemia and number of paternal X-rays of the lower GI and lower abdomen (trend test, P < 0.01), upper GI (P = 0.04), and chest (P = 0.08). Exposures of head and neck and limbs were unrelated to risk. The risk of acute myelogenous leukemia was unrelated to paternal X-ray exposure, except for a marginally significant association (trend test, P = 0.07) for upper GI X-rays. No consistent association between maternal X-ray exposure and infant leukemia was observed. The results of this study suggest that paternal low level radiation exposure before conception is associated with an increased risk of infant leukemia, although the nature of this association needs to be further evaluated.","['Shu, X O', 'Reaman, G H', 'Lampkin, B', 'Sather, H N', 'Pendergrass, T W', 'Robison, L L']","['Shu XO', 'Reaman GH', 'Lampkin B', 'Sather HN', 'Pendergrass TW', 'Robison LL']","['Division of Pediatric Epidemiology/Clinical Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Digestive System/radiation effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Paternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Radiography/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 1994 Dec;3(8):645-53.,,,,,['CA4279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified 406 patients without known exposure to mutagens (group I) and 37 patients with prior significant exposure to Rx (group II). In comparison to patients of group I, those of group II showed particular clinical and hematological features: significantly lower incidence of bulky splenomegaly (p < 0.05) and hyperleukocytosis (WBC > 100 x 10(9)/l; p < 0.05); significantly higher incidence of anemia (Hb < 10 g/dl; p < 0.01).

Plasma vincristine levels after intravenous (i.v.) injection are elevated more than 100-fold in the liposomal formulation compared with free drug in tumour-bearing as well as non-tumour-bearing mice over 24 h. Biodistribution studies demonstrate that the extent and duration of tumour exposure to vincristine is dramatically improved when the drug is administered i.v. in liposomal form. Specifically, 72 h trapezoidal area under the curve values for liposomal vincristine in the murine L1210 ascitic and B16/BL6 solid tumours are 12.9- to 4.1-fold larger, respectively, than observed for free drug. Similar to previous results with the L1210 model, increased drug delivery to the B16 tumour results in significant inhibition of tumour growth, whereas no anti-tumour activity is observed with free vincristine. Comparisons of drug and liposomal lipid accumulation in tumour and muscle tissue indicate that the enhanced efficacy of liposomal vincristine is related predominantly to drug delivered by liposomes to the tumour site rather than drug released from liposomes in the circulation. Consequently, improvements in liposomal vincristine formulations must focus on factors that increase uptake of liposomes into tumour sites as well as enhance liposomal drug retention in the circulation.","['Mayer, L D', 'Masin, D', 'Nayar, R', 'Boman, N L', 'Bally, M B']","['Mayer LD', 'Masin D', 'Nayar R', 'Boman NL', 'Bally MB']","['British Columbia Cancer Agency, Division of Medical Oncology, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Carriers', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Melanoma, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Vincristine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1995.98 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1995 Mar;71(3):482-8. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1995.98.,,,,,,,PMC2033637,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of novel endogenous retinol metabolites have been identified recently. The response of many cell types to retinoid treatment is mediated by retinoid receptors, and involves changes in gene expression, cell growth and cell differentiation. The gene encoding one of the retinoic acid receptors is disrupted by the chromosome translocations associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia, and the expression of another is altered in epithelial tumors; both of these findings have important implications for the use of retinoids as anti-carcinogenic agents.

Within each series, which contained four homologs, potency increased (optimal dose decreased) as alicyclic ring size increased incrementally from cyclopropane to cyclohexane. All analogs were active at maximally tolerated doses against L1210/0 (%T/C = 125-426), with good associated therapeutic ratios of 2 to > 8 that, like the therapeutic index, provided indications of the drug's safety margin. Most complexes had activities that were similar to cisplatin (%T/C = 239) and tetraplatin (%T/C = 310). Antitumor activities were seen for all four platinum(II) complexes against L1210/DDP cells (%T/C = 133-167). In the three platinum(IV) series, on the other hand, only cyclopentane (C5) and cyclohexane (C6) analogs met or exceeded the minimum criterion for activity. These activities were similar to that seen with the positive control agent tetraplatin (%T/C = 133), but higher than that of cisplatin (%T/C = 94). Long-term survivors, which were frequently observed with these complexes in the L1210/0 model, were also seen in the L1210/DDP model, but to a lesser extent. Against L1210/DACH cells, which were sensitive to cisplatin (%T/C = 155), but resistant to tetraplatin (%T/C = 113), the C5 and C6 congeners in the platinum(IV) series were effective with %T/C in the range 148-189, while corresponding members in the platinum(II) series were only marginally active. In the solid M5076 model, complexes C5 in platinum(II) and in the acetato- and hydroxoplatinum(IV) series, and C6 from the hydroxo-platinum(IV) series, were as effective or more effective than cisplatin, which itself gave a tumor growth delay of 27.5 days. In summary, the results indicate that alicyclic ring size and, in the platinum(IV) series, axial ligand, are important modulators of efficacies of ammine/cycloalkylamine platinum congeners in both sensitive and platinum-resistant models. However, the cyclopentylamine or cyclohexylamine carrier ligand with acetato or hydroxo axial ligands in the platinum(IV) configuration are optimal combinations for circumventing both cisplatin and tetraplatin resistances.","['Siddik, Z H', 'Thai, G', 'Yoshida, M', 'Zhang, Y P', 'Khokhar, A R']","['Siddik ZH', 'Thai G', 'Yoshida M', 'Zhang YP', 'Khokhar AR']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,"['0 (Amines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclohexanes)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (Platinum Compounds)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'SFK1SGY8V1 (ormaplatin)']",IM,"['Amines/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/therapeutic use', 'Cyclohexanes/chemistry', 'Cyclopentanes/chemistry', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/therapeutic use', 'Platinum Compounds/administration & dosage/chemistry/*therapeutic use']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1994 Dec;9(6):495-509.,,,,,"['P030 CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA41581/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA50380/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Active orally, this drug is effective against a wide range of fungal pathogens that includes Aspergillus species, and its use in leukemic and AIDS patients is currently on the increase. Oral itraconazole absorption presents up to threefold interindividual variation in man and is reduced in AIDS patients. Consequently an individual itraconazole adjusting dosage is necessary to ensure adequate clinical antifungal activity. Itraconazole undergoes extensive metabolism and the main isolated metabolite, hydroxyitraconazole, is found in plasma at concentrations 2-3-fold higher than parent drug and presents in vitro the same antifungal activity. At present, despite the contribution of this metabolite to the overall activity of the drug, no well-documented assay was reported in the literature for the codetermination of itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole in plasma. Due to the wide variety of coadministered drugs to patients receiving itraconazole, the purpose of the developed method was to obtain a specific assay sensitive enough for itraconazole therapeutic monitoring. Therefore, a three-step liquid-liquid extraction procedure following by reversed-phase chromatography and spectrofluorimetric detection was performed. This assay allowed determination of 20 ng/ml of both itraconazole and its active metabolite with an acceptable precision using a 0.5-ml plasma sample; no analytic interference was encountered from 45 coadministered drugs tested.","['Poirier, J M', 'Lebot, M', 'Descamps, P', 'Levy, M', 'Cheymol, G']","['Poirier JM', 'Lebot M', 'Descamps P', 'Levy M', 'Cheymol G']","['Service of Pharmacology, Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0X2BAV045O (hydroxyitraconazole)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications/drug therapy', 'Administration, Oral', 'Antifungal Agents/*blood', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods', 'Drug Monitoring/methods', 'Humans', 'Itraconazole/*analogs & derivatives/*blood/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Reproducibility of Results']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007691-199412000-00011 [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 1994 Dec;16(6):596-601. doi: 10.1097/00007691-199412000-00011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have demonstrated that PECAM-1 is initially expressed at high levels on CD34+ multipotential progenitors in the bone marrow, but is subsequently downregulated in more committed precursors of all lineages. Interestingly, although PECAM-1 expression is high on circulating monocytes and neutrophils, little is known about the upregulation of PECAM-1 expression during terminal myelomonocytic differentiation. We have further characterized this process by examining PECAM-1 expression during chemically-induced differentiation of the U937, HL-60 and HEL cell lines. Quantitative Western blot analysis of cellular lysates indicated that PECAM-1 expression could be upregulated in U937 and HL-60 cells by phorbol esters or dimethyl sulfoxide. Northern blot analysis showed that PECAM-1 mRNA levels appeared to increase in parallel with that of PECAM-1 protein. We also observed a marked difference in the apparent molecular mass of PECAM-1 that was lineage-specific, both in differentiated leukemic cell lines and in their corresponding leukocyte population. Immunofluorescence localization indicated that the cellular distribution of PECAM-1 in U937 and HL-60 cells was similar to that of their normal circulating counterparts, and that the pattern of distribution again displayed lineage fidelity. The ability to induce the expression of PECAM-1 molecules having different glycosylation and surface expression patterns may prove useful for further elucidation of the role of PECAM-1 in hematopoiesis, as well as studies of the cell lineage-specific modulation of PECAM-1 function.","['Goldberger, A', 'Middleton, K A', 'Newman, P J']","['Goldberger A', 'Middleton KA', 'Newman PJ']","['Blood Research Institute, Blood Center of Southeastern Wisconsin.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*biosynthesis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1399-0039.1994.tb02397.x [doi]'],ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 1994 Nov;44(5):285-93. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0039.1994.tb02397.x.,,,,,['HL-40926/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differentiation of the cells into neutrophilic cells progressed in a time- and dose-dependent fashion with ATRA or DMSO, as confirmed by the characteristic appearance of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction and phagocytic activities, without induction of nonspecific esterase activity. TM antigen and cofactor activity for thrombin-dependent protein C activation were not detected in untreated HL-60 cells and the cells cultured with DMSO, but were expressed in a time-dependent manner in the cells cultured with ATRA. The level of TM expression in the HL-60 cells was not dose-dependent on ATRA concentrations, but maximum TM expression was obtained at 10(-7) M ATRA. TM expression levels decreased in cells cultured with greater than 10(-6) M ATRA, although the extent of cell differentiation into neutrophilic cells progressed at the higher ATRA concentrations. Since the TM antigen levels in the ATRA-treated cells also paralleled the TM mRNA levels, the data suggests that TM induction in the HL-60 cells cultured with ATRA reflected the levels of TM biosynthesis and was independent of HL-60 differentiation into neutrophilic cells. It was postulated that the appearance of TM with cofactor activity in neutrophilic cells differentiated from leukemic cells may contribute to prevention of vascular thrombosis in differentiation therapy of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia by ATRA.","['Kizaki, K', 'Ishii, H', 'Horie, S', 'Kazama, M']","['Kizaki K', 'Ishii H', 'Horie S', 'Kazama M']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Teikyo University, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Thrombomodulin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', '*Neutrophils', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Thrombomodulin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Thromb Haemost. 1994 Oct;72(4):573-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neither cell type appears to express receptors for PGI2, but human neutrophils and not differentiated HL-60 cells express receptors for PGD2.

In this report, we show that I kappa B alpha acts as a cellular inhibitor of human retroviral replication through a discrete mechanism, independent of its effect on HIV transcription. I kappa B alpha inhibited HIV replication and gp160 expression by negatively regulating Rev function, most likely acting through a cellular factor involved in Rev transactivation. A similar effect was observed with human T leukemia virus I, in which I kappa B alpha inhibited Rex function. In contrast, no effect was observed on the replication of a DNA virus, adenovirus type 5. The NF-kappa B/I kappa B regulatory pathway therefore modulates human retroviral replication by regulating a program of cellular gene expression required for several steps in the viral life cycle, including not only viral transcription but also RNA export. This interaction between cellular and viral gene products suggests that NF-kappa B plays a broader role in the regulation of human retroviral replication, providing a previously unrecognized link between two important regulators of HIV gene expression and common NF-kappa B-dependent programs of gene expression used by human retroviruses.","['Wu, B Y', 'Woffendin, C', 'Duckett, C S', 'Ohno, T', 'Nabel, G J']","['Wu BY', 'Woffendin C', 'Duckett CS', 'Ohno T', 'Nabel GJ']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor 48109-0650.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp160)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RELB protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '147337-75-5 (Transcription Factor RelB)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, env/genetics', 'Gene Products, rev/*physiology', 'Gene Products, rex/physiology', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp160', 'HIV-1/growth & development', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Protein Precursors/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factor RelB', '*Transcription Factors', '*Virus Latency', '*Virus Replication', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1995/02/28 00:00,1995/02/28 00:01,['1995/02/28 00:00'],"['1995/02/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/28 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.5.1480 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Feb 28;92(5):1480-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.5.1480.,,,,,"['AI-08598/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-29179/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['env', 'rev']",PMC42543,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-7 mRNA expression and IL-7 gene transcription were down regulated, however, when B-CLL cells were placed in culture at 37 degrees C for 4 hr. Down regulation of the IL-7 gene was prevented in cells maintained at 4 degrees C. Continued culture of B-CLL cells at 37 degrees C resulted in programmed cell death, or apoptosis, as evidenced by DNA fragmentation. The coincident kinetics of IL-7 gene down regulation and apoptosis suggested that IL-7 gene expression may be required for maintenance of CLL viability in vivo. Signals for IL-7 gene regulation and apoptosis induction were thus examined. Activation of normal B cells through their immunoglobulin receptors did not result in upregulation of IL-7 gene expression. Reagents required for CLL cell purification and culture also did not contribute to IL-7 gene regulation and apoptosis induction. IL-7 gene expression was retained and apoptosis was prevented, however, in CLL cells cultured on a monolayer of EA.hy926 human umbilical cord endothelial hybrid cells. Signals specifically presented by EA.hy926 cells supported both CLL cell viability and IL-7 gene expression, whereas culture of CLL cells on A549/8 carcinoma cells, the fusion partner used to generate the EA.hy926 cells, did not. Cell-cell contact was required, as culture supernatants did not prevent apoptosis. Specifically, IL-7 mRNA expression was retained and apoptosis was prevented only by contact with the endothelial cell hybrids. Preliminary data indicated that integrins expressed on CLL cells affected modulation of apoptosis and IL-7 gene regulation, suggesting that integrins may play significant roles in regulating viability of CLL cells.","['Long, B W', 'Witte, P L', 'Abraham, G N', 'Gregory, S A', 'Plate, J M']","['Long BW', 'Witte PL', 'Abraham GN', 'Gregory SA', 'Plate JM']","[""Department of Medicine, Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-7/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/02/28 00:00,1995/02/28 00:01,['1995/02/28 00:00'],"['1995/02/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/28 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.5.1416 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Feb 28;92(5):1416-20. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.5.1416.,,,,,,,PMC42530,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we sought to determine, in mice, the role of LIF in septic shock. During sublethal endotoxemia, serum LIF levels, as determined by radio-receptor competition assay, peaked at 2 h and were low (3 ng/ml), whereas in lethal Escherichia coli septic shock serum LIF levels rose progressively (> 30 ng/ml) in the premorbid phase coincident with the development of tissue injury. Single i.v. injections of high doses (up to 50 micrograms per mouse) of recombinant murine LIF had no obvious acute detrimental effects, whereas continued i.p. administration (30 micrograms per mouse per day) for 3-4 days induced a fatal catabolic state without evidence of preceding hemodynamic collapse or shock. Simultaneous or subsequent administration of high doses of LIF had no effect on mortality from sublethal and lethal E. coli septic shock, whereas prior administration conferred significant protection against lethality (P << 0.001 by log-rank test), an effect that was dose and interval dependent. This protective effect resembled endotoxin tolerance and was characterized by suppression of E. coli-induced serum tumor necrosis factor concentration (P < 0.05), reduction in the number of viable bacteria (P < 0.05), and prevention of sepsis-induced tissue injury.

Cancer and Leukemia Group B Thoracic Surgery Group.,473-83; discussion 483-5,"From October 1989 to February 1992, 74 patients with mediastinoscopically staged IIIA (N2) non-small-cell lung cancer from 30 CALGB-affiliated hospitals received two cycles of preresectional cisplatin and vinblastine chemotherapy. Patients with responsive or stable disease underwent standardized surgical resection and radical lymphadenectomy. Patients who underwent resection received sequential adjuvant therapy with two cycles of cisplatin and vinblastine, followed by thoracic irradiation (54 Gy after complete resection and 59.4 Gy after incomplete resection or no resection at 1.8 Gy per fraction). There were no radiographic complete responses to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy, although 65 (88%) patients had either a response or no disease progression. During induction chemotherapy, disease progressed in seven patients (9%). Sixty-three patients (86%) had exploratory thoracotomy, and 46 of those (75%) had resectable lesions. A complete surgical resection was accomplished in 23 patients, and 23 patients had an incomplete resection with either a diseased margin or diseased highest node resected. Operative mortality was 3.2% (2/63). In 10 patients (22% of the 46 having resection) the disease was pathologically downstaged. There was no correlation between radiographic response to the induction chemotherapy and downstaging at surgical resection. The full protocol was completed by 33 patients (45% of original cohort). Overall survival at 3 years was 23%. Patients undergoing resection had significantly improved survival at 3 years compared with patients not having resection: 46% for complete resection (median 20.9 months), 25% for incomplete resection (median 17.8 months), and 0% for no resection (median 8.5 months). Five deaths occurred during the treatment period. A total of 18 of the 46 (39%) patients who underwent resection are either alive and disease-free or have died without recurrence.","['Sugarbaker, D J', 'Herndon, J', 'Kohman, L J', 'Krasna, M J', 'Green, M R']","['Sugarbaker DJ', 'Herndon J', 'Kohman LJ', 'Krasna MJ', 'Green MR']","[""Division of Thoracic Surgery, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,0376343,"['5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/mortality/*surgery/*therapy', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/adverse effects', 'Cisplatin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/mortality/*surgery/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/epidemiology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant/adverse effects', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vinblastine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022522395001528 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-5223(95)70278-4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 1995 Mar;109(3):473-83; discussion 483-5. doi: 10.1016/s0022-5223(95)70278-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The membrane fluidity, the quantity of ConA binding sites on the cell membrane surface, and the protein tyrosine kinase (Tyr-PK) activity existing in NP-40 membrane extract and cytoplasma extract were determined respectively. The activity of tumour-derived immunosuppressive factor (TDSF) secreted by HL-60 cells into culture supernatant was also determined. The results demonstrated that: (1) HL-60 cells were capable of undergoing differentiation onto the myeloid pathway in the presence of DMSO. The growth of DMSO-treated HL-60 cells became slow and synthesis rate of DNA decreased by about 50%. (2) Both membrane fluidity and the quantity of ConA binding sites on membrane were obviously lower after induced with DMSO than those before induction. (3) The Tyr-PK activity in the NP-40 membrane extract increased during the period of induced differentiation. The phosphorylation level of endogenous protein in cytoplasma extract decreased with the process of induced differentiation. It may be reasoned that the phosphatase activity is much higher than the phosphorylase activity. (4) The secretive level of TDSF by HL-60 cells during the period of induced differentiation revealed no change. The preliminary results showed that the malignant phenotypes of tumour cells we used may undergo reversible changes with induced differentiation of tumour cells except the secretion of TDSF.","['Yang, Y Z', 'Zhang, X H', 'Zhou, R Z', 'Xia, Q S', 'Liu, L', 'Chen, Z C']","['Yang YZ', 'Zhang XH', 'Zhou RZ', 'Xia QS', 'Liu L', 'Chen ZC']","['Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Tongji Medical University, Wuhan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,J Tongji Med Univ,Journal of Tongji Medical University = Tong ji yi ke da xue xue bao,8605495,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Membrane Fluidity/*drug effects', 'Phenotype', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02888049 [doi]'],ppublish,"J Tongji Med Univ. 1994;14(1):7-11, 15. doi: 10.1007/BF02888049.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The extent to which HLOC beliefs match the control realities in a situation (Reality Matching hypothesis) as well as the degree of threat (Threat hypothesis) posed by the situation were hypothesized to moderate the HLOC-distress relationship. Distress, disease severity (i.e., threat), and HLOC were assessed in 69 individuals with malignant disease undergoing evaluation for bone marrow transplantation. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that the HLOC-distress relationship was moderated by disease severity and treatment history (i.e., whether an individual had failed prior cancer therapy). However, in some instances, the specific interaction relationships obtained differed from those evident in previous research with ESRD patients. It was concluded that there is no simple main effect relationship between HLOC beliefs and psychological adjustment.

To test the effectiveness of PNP gene transfer in T lymphocytes, a retroviral vector (LmPSN-2) was designed and constructed to express the murine PNP cDNA under transcriptional regulation of the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat. LmPSN-2 was first used to mediate gene transfer and expression of electrophoretically distinct murine PNP in normal (PNP-positive) human PBL. Peripheral blood leukocytes were then obtained from a PNP deficient patient and characterized phenotypically. Despite their paucity and general mitogenic unresponsiveness, T lymphocytes from this patient were successfully grown in culture by using anti-CD3 with rIL-2 and then transduced with LmPSN-2. Elevated PNP enzyme activity was observed in the transduced cell population. Mitogenic and allogeneic responses, normally depressed in PNP-deficient patients' cells, were partially corrected in the transduced cell population relative to nontransduced cells. These results suggest the possibility of effecting improved immunologic function in PNP-deficient T lymphoid cells by retroviral-mediated gene transfer as therapy for PNP deficiency.","['Nelson, D M', 'Butters, K A', 'Markert, M L', 'Reinsmoen, N L', 'McIvor, R S']","['Nelson DM', 'Butters KA', 'Markert ML', 'Reinsmoen NL', 'McIvor RS']","['Institute of Human Genetics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,['EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)'],IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/biosynthesis/deficiency/*genetics', 'Retroviridae', 'T-Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Transfection/*genetics']",1995/03/15 00:00,1995/03/15 00:01,['1995/03/15 00:00'],"['1995/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1995 Mar 15;154(6):3006-14.,,,,,['AI27416/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

An essential role for GATA-2 in the development of hematopoietic stem cells has recently been shown in gene targeting experiments in mice. Here we show that GATA-2 exists in hematopoietic progenitor cells as a phosphoprotein. Stimulation of progenitors with interleukin-3 (IL-3) results in enhanced phosphorylation of GATA-2 which occurs within 5 min. IL-3 is known to signal in part through mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and evidence for MAP kinase signaling in the control of GATA-2 phosphorylation was obtained by genetically manipulating the MAP kinase pathway in COS cells using either constitutively activating or interfering mutants of MAP kinase kinase. Furthermore, using an interfering mutant of MAP kinase kinase, we directly demonstrated a critical role for the MAP kinase pathway in the IL-3-dependent phosphorylation of GATA-2 in hematopoietic progenitor cells. Finally, in vitro phosphorylation experiments using recombinant GATA-2 raise the possibility that MAP kinase itself may phosphorylate GATA-2. Our results provide evidence for phosphorylation via the MAP kinase pathway constituting a cytoplasmic link between GATA-2 and growth factor receptors and are consistent with the hypothesis that GATA-2 is involved in the growth factor responsiveness and proliferation control of hematopoietic progenitor cells.","['Towatari, M', 'May, G E', 'Marais, R', 'Perkins, G R', 'Marshall, C J', 'Cowley, S', 'Enver, T']","['Towatari M', 'May GE', 'Marais R', 'Perkins GR', 'Marshall CJ', 'Cowley S', 'Enver T']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1995/02/24 00:00,1995/02/24 00:01,['1995/02/24 00:00'],"['1995/02/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/24 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.8.4101 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)94903-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Feb 24;270(8):4101-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.8.4101.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transcription factor Stat1/p91 has been shown to be activated by GH. Here we show that acute phase response factor or Stat3 f1p4an antigenically related protein), is also activated by GH. Stat3 has been implicated in the interleukin-6-dependent induction of acute phase response genes. GH promotes in 3T3-F442A fibroblasts the tyrosyl phosphorylation of a protein immunoprecipitated by antibodies to Stat3. This protein co-migrates with a tyrosyl phosphorylated protein from cells treated with leukemia inhibitory factor, a cytokine known to activate Stat3. Tyrosyl phosphorylated Stat3 is also observed in response to interferon-gamma. Stat3 is present in GH-inducible DNA-binding complexes that bind the sis-inducible element in the c-fos promoter and the acute phase response element in the alpha 2-macroglobulin promoter. The ability of GH to activate both Stat1 and Stat3 (i.e. increase their tyrosyl phosphorylation and ability to bind to DNA) suggests that gene regulation by GH involves multiple Stat proteins. Shared transcription factors among hormones and cytokines that activate JAK kinases provide an explanation for shared responses, while the ability of the different ligands to differentially recruit various Stat family members suggests mechanisms by which specificity in gene regulation could be achieved.","['Campbell, G S', 'Meyer, D J', 'Raz, R', 'Levy, D E', 'Schwartz, J', 'Carter-Su, C']","['Campbell GS', 'Meyer DJ', 'Raz R', 'Levy DE', 'Schwartz J', 'Carter-Su C']","['Department of Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor 48109-0622.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Growth Hormone/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism']",1995/02/24 00:00,1995/02/24 00:01,['1995/02/24 00:00'],"['1995/02/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/24 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.8.3974 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)94887-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Feb 24;270(8):3974-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.8.3974.,,,,,"['R01-DK34171/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI28900/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07315/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK042932/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK034171/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ex vivo evaluation of these gene transfer vectors would be facilitated by a cell system that lacks bilirubin-UGT, but expresses differentiated liver functions, including ASGR. We immortalized primary Gunn rat hepatocytes by transduction with a recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus expressing a thermolabile mutant SV40 large T antigen (tsA58). At 33 degrees C, the immortalized hepatocyte clones expressed SV40 large T antigen, synthesized DNA, and doubled in number every 2 to 3 days. At this temperature, differentiated hepatocyte markers, e.g., albumin, ASGR, and androsterone-UGT, were expressed at 5% to 10% of the levels found in primary hepatocytes maintained in culture for 24 hours. Glutathione-S-transferase Yp (GST-Yp), an oncofetal protein, was expressed in these cells at 33 degrees C, but was undetectable in primary hepatocytes. In contrast, when the cells were cultured at 39 degrees C or 37 degrees C, the large T antigen was degraded, DNA synthesis and cell growth stopped, and morphologic characteristics of differentiated hepatocytes were observed. The expression of albumin, ASGR, and androsterone-UGT, and their corresponding mRNAs, increased to 25% to 40% of the level in primary hepatocytes, whereas GST-Yp expression decreased. Functionality of ASGR was demonstrated by internalization of Texas red-labeled asialoorosomucoid, and binding and degradation of 125I-asialoorosomucoid. After liposome-mediated transfer of a plasmid containing the coding region of human bilirubin-UGT1, driven by the SV40 large T promoter, active human bilirubin-UGT1 was expressed in these cells. The immortalized cells were not tumorigenic after transplantation into severe combined immunodeficiency mice.

To determine the mechanisms whereby hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs) modulate apoptosis in human myeloid leukemic cells, we evaluated the roles of protein and mRNA synthesis for altering apoptosis in growth factor-stimulated vs. quiescent leukemic TF1 cells. Lysates of cells from the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-dependent myeloid leukemic cell line TF1 were separated into high molecular weight (HMW) pellets of intact DNA and supernatants of fragmented low MW (LMW) DNA, and the DNA purified from these fractions was quantified. In the absence of both GM-CSF and fetal bovine serum (FBS), 70% of the DNA was fragmented after 3 days in culture, with a characteristic apoptotic ladder-like pattern on agarose gel electrophoresis, whereas this proportion had initially been < 5%. In contrast, less than 5% of the DNA was fragmented in cells incubated with GM-CSF plus FBS or GM-CSF alone. Delayed addition of GM-CSF, but not FBS, permitted partial rescue of the cells, inhibiting increasing rates of accumulation of fragmented DNA. When the macro-molecular synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) or actinomycin D (Act D) was present for 26 hours in the absence of GM-CSF and FBS, apoptosis was inhibited. In contrast, in the presence of GM-CSF or FBS, apoptosis was enhanced upon addition of CHX or Act D. The latter effect persisted even with the late addition of CHX. These findings indicate that disparate mechanisms of enhancing or inhibiting apoptosis exist in myeloid leukemic cells related to environmental conditions, including HGF-regulated cellular synthesis of distinct proteins and mRNA.","['Han, J H', 'Gileadi, C', 'Rajapaksa, R', 'Kosek, J', 'Greenberg, P L']","['Han JH', 'Gileadi C', 'Rajapaksa R', 'Kosek J', 'Greenberg PL']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford Medical Center, CA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 Mar;23(3):265-72.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activin A/EDF induced AchE activity of F55 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Erythroid differentiation of F55 cells, which was characterized by an increase in dianisidine-positive cells, was also induced by activin A/EDF. The effect of activin A/EDF on hemoglobin synthesis appeared more slowly compared with the effect on AchE activity. Erythroid differentiation induced by activin A/EDF was affected by the initial cell density, but AchE activity was not. Sodium orthovanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, markedly inhibited activin A/EDF-induced erythroid differentiation but not activin A/EDF-induced AchE activity. Other erythroid differentiation inducers, sodium butyrate and butyrylcholine chloride, mildly increased AchE activity in F55 cells, but N,N'-hexamethylene-bis-acetamide (HMBA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and genistein did not. Dexamethasone inhibited HMBA-induced erythroid differentiation but did not affect activin A/EDF or sodium butyrate action.

In addition, the therapeutic effect of recombinant human interleukin-2 (rhIL-2)-administered postsyngeneic and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was examined. SJL/J mice inoculated with mAML cells were exposed later to total body irradiation (TBI) and transplanted with bone marrow cells (BMC) mixed with spleen cells derived from normal syngeneic (SJL/J), congenic (B10.S), or allogeneic (C57BL/6) donor mice. One-half of the mice in each group received low dose rhIL-2 for 3 days starting 1 day post-BMT. Spleen cells from treated recipients were transferred to secondary naive SJL/J mice for in vivo detection of residual tumor cells. At a tumor load of 10(5) cells per animal, none of the mice rescued with SJL/J or B10.S cells was cured since 100% of secondary recipients developed leukemia. Concomitant treatment of recipients of B10.S cells with rhIL-2 induced GVL effects since none of the secondary recipients developed leukemia after 2 years. All adoptive recipients of mice rescued with C57BL/6 cells remained free of leukemia after 2 years whether or not rhIL-2 was injected. The potency of the GVL effects observed across mHA and MHC were tumor-cell dose dependent since fewer animals inoculated with 10(6) mAML cells were cured. Only marginal GVL effects were noticed following syngeneic BMT and rhIL-2. Our results sustain the importance of the GVL effects in the treatment of myeloid leukemia and demonstrate that immunotherapy with rhIL-2 following BMT can enhance the therapeutic effect induced by the allograft.","['Vourka-Karussis, U', 'Karussis, D', 'Ackerstein, A', 'Slavin, S']","['Vourka-Karussis U', 'Karussis D', 'Ackerstein A', 'Slavin S']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah-Hebrew University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Spleen/pathology']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 Mar;23(3):196-201.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of these 14 patients had severe anemia. Their bone marrow cells exhibited trilineage dysplasia and some morphological abnormalities in the eosinophils, including disproportion of eosinophilic granules, basophilic granules, a ring-shaped nucleus, and vacuolation in the cytoplasm. However, these abnormalities were less prominent than those of acute myelomonocytic leukemia with eosinophilia (FAB: M4Eo). Three of the 14 MDS-Eo patients had refractory anemia (RA), seven had RA with excess of blasts (RAEB), and four had RAEB in transformation. Cytogenetic analysis revealed chromosomal abnormalities in 12 of 13 MDS-Eo patients (92%), in particular, there were major karyotypic abnormalities (MAKA) in eight patients (62%). Cytotoxic agents were not effective in the treatment of four patients after leukemic transformation occurred. These four patients died of the leukemic transformation while seven died of bone marrow failure. The other three MDS-Eo patients are still alive; two of them have already transformed to a leukemic phase. The duration of survival of these patients was significantly shorter than that of the other MDS patients. These findings suggest that bone marrow eosinophilia in MDS may be a poor prognostic factor that is strongly related to the existence of MAKA.","['Matsushima, T', 'Murakami, H', 'Tsuchiya, J']","['Matsushima T', 'Murakami H', 'Tsuchiya J']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Gunma University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Anemia, Refractory/complications', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Eosinophilia/genetics/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*pathology']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409049753 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Nov;15(5-6):491-7. doi: 10.3109/10428199409049753.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In situ hybridization studies of EBV were also done. Twenty-six cases of HD were compared with 15 cases of non-specific lymphadenitis, 7 with incipient adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), and 4 T-cell rich B-cell lymphomas (TRBL), all of which histologically resembled HD. EBV genes were detected in 20 of 26 HD patients (77%) and in 7 of 15 patients with non-specific lymphadenitis (47%), 5 of 7 with incipient ATLL (71%), and 1 of 4 with TRBL (25%). In contrast to specimens of non-specific lymphadenitis, TRBL, and incipient ATLL, only one EBV genotype was evident in the specimens of HD. EBV latent membrane protein (LMP) was detected immunologically in 16 of 26 HD patients (62%), one of four TRBL (25%) and one of seven incipient ATLL (14%), but it was not evident in non-specific lymphadenitis. The LMP positive cases showed amplified EBV genomes. Only one of the 26 cases of HD had a bcl-2 gene rearrangement by PCR, but this was not seen in any other disease. The bcl-2 protein was detected immunologically in seven of the 26 HD patients (27%) and in one of the seven incipient ATLL cases (14%). EBV has been reported to upregulate bcl-2 expression, but in this study the presence of bcl-2 protein did not correlate with the presence of the t(14;18) translocation or EBV-LMP. All TRBLs showed rearrangement of the immunoglobulin genes by PCR and/or Southern blot, and the giant cells were of B-cell type. All incipient ATLLs displayed rearrangement of the TCR genes, and the giant cells were of T-cell origin. In seven of 26 HD cases, the giant cells were weakly stained with T-cell antibodies, in another seven positive with B-cell antibodies and in 18 instances polyclonally positive for both kappa and lambda. However, PCR and Southern blot displayed only two cases of TCR gene rearrangement, while two others had very weak rearrangements of immunoglobulin gene positive only by PCR. Thus the T and B-cell genotype did not correlate with the T and B-cell phenotype recorded in these cases. The absence of Ig and TCR gene rearrangements seems to be common in HD, compared with in TRBL and incipient ATLL.","['Ohshima, K', 'Kikuchi, M', 'Shibata, T', 'Sumiyoshi, Y', 'Kobari, S', 'Yoneda, S', 'Takeshita, M', 'Kimura, N']","['Ohshima K', 'Kikuchi M', 'Shibata T', 'Sumiyoshi Y', 'Kobari S', 'Yoneda S', 'Takeshita M', 'Kimura N']","['Department of Pathology and Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genes, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Hodgkin Disease/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409049750 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Nov;15(5-6):469-79. doi: 10.3109/10428199409049750.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With further investigations to clarify the nature of these interactions, it should be possible to design rational strategies for the cytokine therapy of human PTLD.","['Randhawa, P S', 'Demetris, A J', 'Nalesnik, M A']","['Randhawa PS', 'Demetris AJ', 'Nalesnik MA']","['Department of Pathology, Presbyterian University Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA 15213.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Cell Communication', 'Cytokines/*physiology', '*Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/etiology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/etiology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*etiology/virology', 'Transplantation/adverse effects']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409049740 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Nov;15(5-6):383-7. doi: 10.3109/10428199409049740.,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This property has resulted in their incorporation into chemotherapy regimens used in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Studies at the molecular and cellular levels have demonstrated that the hormone-induced cytolytic response is mediated through a highly specific cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The GR has been cloned and sequenced and found to be organized into a discrete series of domains which mediate the receptor functions of hormone binding, nuclear translocation, DNA binding and transcriptional modulation. Thus, the binding of glucocorticoids by the GR induces a series of cellular events which result in the activation or repression of a network of glucocorticoid responsive genes and produces a specific cellular response. Prolonged exposure to glucocorticoids ultimately causes resistance to develop; thereby limiting the usefulness of this class of drugs. Studies addressing the mechanism of resistance have shown that the GR is the primary target of genetic alterations that lead to resistance to cytolysis. Using mouse and human cell lines as model systems, it has been shown that the vast majority of glucocorticoid resistant mutants express low levels or altered forms of the GR. Similarly, in vivo studies on patients have suggested that low GR levels are associated with a poor response to glucocorticoid based therapies. Recently, aberrant GR isolated from a patient with multiple myeloma resistant to glucocorticoids were found to harbor deletions in their hormone binding domains. Sequencing of the receptors suggested that each arose as a result of alternate splicing events. In both cases, the latter event produces a receptor unable to bind hormone leading to the speculation that alternate splicing may serve as a mechanism by which a cell evades the effects of glucocorticoids. The therapeutic implications for patients expressing aberrant receptors is discussed.","['Moalli, P A', 'Rosen, S T']","['Moalli PA', 'Rosen ST']","['Robert H.

The pattern of polymorphism at the DPB1 locus makes it difficult to unambiguously assign all genotypes in a typing system using one single pair of generic primers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We apply here a simple technique based on the reverse dot blot analysis to the typing of HLA-DPB1 alleles. In order to increase its resolution, a group-specific amplification based on sequence variations of the polymorphic region F was used subdividing the HLA-DPB1 alleles in 2 nonoverlapping families. A separate analysis was then performed within each group of alleles. RESULTS: Using these 2 primer pairs, 21 group 1 and 30 group 2 alleles were separately amplified. From 1,378 possible allele combinations for DPB1*0101-5301 only 33 gave ambiguous typing results compared to 61 using a single pair of generic primers. CONCLUSIONS: This procedure provides a rapid and simple HLA-DPB1 genotyping. Especially in heterozygotes the hybridization patterns were easier to interpret. The utilization of group-specific amplification substantially reduced ambiguous typing results.","['Blasczyk, R', 'Mohr, M', 'Zimmermann, R', 'Schwella, N', 'Huhn, D']","['Blasczyk R', 'Mohr M', 'Zimmermann R', 'Schwella N', 'Huhn D']","['Blutbank, Abteilung fur Innere Medizin mit Schwerpunkt Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Rudolf Virchow, Freie Universitat, Berlin.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Infusionsther Transfusionsmed,Infusionstherapie und Transfusionsmedizin,9209406,"['0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DP beta-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DPB1 antigen)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Gene Amplification/*genetics', '*Genotype', 'HLA-DP Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-DP beta-Chains', 'Heterozygote', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', '*Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000223019 [doi]'],ppublish,Infusionsther Transfusionsmed. 1994 Dec;21(6):401-4. doi: 10.1159/000223019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The abnormal regulation of the CD23 antigen in response to IL-4, IFNs alpha and gamma results in CD23 over-expression on B-CLL cells. Our present study shows that the two CD23 isoforms are differentially and abnormally regulated on B-CLL cells. IL-4 selectively up-regulates CD23 type A mRNA in five different B-CLL patients, whereas in normal B cells it enhances CD23 type A and is the most potent inducer of type B. In contrast, phorbol esters (PMA) up-regulate both CD23 isoforms in the malignant B cells and specifically increases type B in normal B cells. We next postulated that cytokines other than IL-4 regulate CD23 B isoform in B-CLL cells and therefore examined the effect of IL-2, IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha. We found that the ability of a given cytokine to induce B-CLL growth (i.e. IL-2 and IFN alpha) is concurrent with a selective up-regulation of CD23 type B mRNA, whereas lymphokines that have no B cell growth activity (i.e. IL-4 and IFN-gamma) specifically increase CD23 type A mRNA. We next showed that IL-4 and IFN gamma prevent hydrocortisone-induced programmed cell death and that the rescued malignant B cells mainly express CD23 type A. Given that CD23 molecule has been reported to play a role in normal B cell proliferation and survival, it is therefore proposed that in B-CLL cells the expression of CD23 type A may be related to cell viability and that of type B to cell proliferation. These data suggest that the CD23 molecule may contribute to the physiopathology of the disease which is characterized by the accumulation of long-lived and slow-dividing monoclonal B cells.","['Fournier, S', 'Yang, L P', 'Delespesse, G', 'Rubio, M', 'Biron, G', 'Sarfati, M']","['Fournier S', 'Yang LP', 'Delespesse G', 'Rubio M', 'Biron G', 'Sarfati M']","['Allergy Research Laboratory, Notre-Dame Hospital Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Isoantigens/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, IgE/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb03314.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Feb;89(2):373-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb03314.x.,,,,,['NCI 3924/CI/NCPDCID CDC HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

During this time the results of treatment have improved steadily but are consistently superior in girls when compared with boys; the 5-year event-free survival in girls improving from 51% to 71% and in boys from 31% to 57%. These results were independent of age and presenting leucocyte count. Boys not only had a testicular relapse rate of 10% but an excess of bone marrow relapse, particularly evident after 2 years from diagnosis. Other prognostic factors included organomegaly and the morphology of leukaemic blast cells; immunophenotype of the leukaemia, however, had no independent significance after allowance for age, sex and leucocyte count. The influence of sex on prognosis was reaffirmed when we examined various methods of identifying children at highest risk of treatment failure for whom alternative therapy such as bone marrow transplantation might be justified. In MRC UKALL X children had been deemed 'high risk' on the basis of leucocyte count alone, but with further follow-up it has become apparent that girls with an initial leucocyte count of > 100 x 10(9)/l have a similar prognosis to boys with a lower count. We therefore derived a risk score based on sex, age and count which has given better discrimination between standard risk (66% 5-year survival) and poor risk (39%) survival than other methods. This group of worse-risk children includes 16% of boys but only 3% of all girls. Gender remains an important prognostic factor in UKALL trials and there are very few girls who are at highest risk of treatment failure.

Expression analysis of the cyclin A gene was included to examine cellular proliferation activity. The expression of gapdh served as an internal standard. Calculating the mean values we found: (i) a distinctly lower mdr1 gene expression in primary ALL and first relapses compared to bone marrow from healthy donors, (ii) no change in mdr1 and mrp, but a decreased topoisomerase II alpha gene expression in first relapses of ALL compared to the primary leukaemia, and (iii) increased mdr1 and mrp levels combined to decreased topoisomerase II alpha levels in recurrent relapses of ALL showing significant correlations (mdr1/mrp: rs = +0.6833, P < 0.05; mdr1/topoII alpha: rs = -0.6727, P < 0.05). The expression of the topoisomerase II alpha gene was correlated to that of cyclin A, indicating a link of its expression to cellular proliferation. Our findings suggest that a multifactorial MDR including mrp appears particularly in recurrent relapses of ALL, which often do not respond to chemotherapy. Nonetheless, some individual samples showed gene expression levels very different from the mean values calculated for a particular state of the leukaemia, indicating the need of an individual expression analysis of MDR-associated genes.","['Beck, J', 'Handgretinger, R', 'Dopfer, R', 'Klingebiel, T', 'Niethammer, D', 'Gekeler, V']","['Beck J', 'Handgretinger R', 'Dopfer R', 'Klingebiel T', 'Niethammer D', 'Gekeler V']","['Universitats-Kinderklinik, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb03312.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Feb;89(2):356-63. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb03312.x.,,,,,,"['mdr1', 'mrp']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present paper was to analyse in 204 AML patients at diagnosis the proliferative rate (assessed by the number of S-phase cells) of peripheral blood (PB) (126 cases) and bone marrow (BM) (78 cases) cells in order to explore its relationship with disease characteristics. A strong parallelism was observed regarding the relationship between the proliferative rate of the blast cells both in PB and in BM and the disease characteristics. Cases with a high proliferative rate were associated with advanced age, high WBC counts and LDH serum levels, monocytic leukaemias (assessed both by morphological and immunophenotypic criteria) and NK-associated antigens (CD56, CD16). The proliferative activity did not influence the CR rate; in contrast, cases with a high number of S-phase cells had shorter survival. In addition, multivariate analysis showed that age, the expression of CD11b, and the S-phase counts are the only three prognostic factors displaying an independent impact on survival.","['Vidriales, M B', 'Orfao, A', 'Lopez-Berges, M C', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Lopez-Macedo, A', 'Ciudad, J', 'Lopez, A', 'Garcia, M A', 'Hernandez, J', 'Borrego, D']","['Vidriales MB', 'Orfao A', 'Lopez-Berges MC', 'Gonzalez M', 'Lopez-Macedo A', 'Ciudad J', 'Lopez A', 'Garcia MA', 'Hernandez J', 'Borrego D', 'et al.']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Universidad de Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/mortality/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', '*S Phase']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb03310.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Feb;89(2):342-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb03310.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A human eosinophilic leukaemia cell line, EoL-1, has been shown to differentiate into mature eosinophilic granulocytes by treatment with the culture supernatant of a human T-cell line, HIL-3. In this study we have studied whether the EoL-1 cell line has potential to differentiate into cell lineage other than eosinophils. We found that EoL-1 cells cultured in the presence of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (10 u/ml) and interferon (IFN)-gamma (1000 u/ml) for 2-4 d differentiated into macrophage-like cells in morphology, and expressed CD14 antigen on their cell surface. It is possible that the small subpopulation of EoL-1 cells which contains non-specific esterase (NSE) activity may be preferentially differentiated by TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. To clarify this issue, we have cloned the EoL-1 cell line and obtained NSE negative and positive sublines. Both EoL-1 sublines differentiated into monocyte/macrophage-like cells, because: (a) EoL-1 sublines were induced to express CD14 antigen, and (b) they attached firmly to the plastic wells; (c) after differentiation they became strongly positive for NSE staining, and secreted TNF-alpha in response to the stimulation with lipopolysaccharide; and (d) they exhibited potent phagocytic activity. Therefore, we found that the EoL-1 cell line has the ability to differentiate not only into mature eosinophilic cells but also into monocyte/macrophage cell lineage, suggesting that EoL-1 cells represent immature cells with ability to differentiate into multiple cell lineages.","['Nakajima, T', 'Yamashita, N', 'Matsui, H', 'Suzuki, N', 'Kaneoka, H', 'Mizushima, Y', 'Sakane, T']","['Nakajima T', 'Yamashita N', 'Matsui H', 'Suzuki N', 'Kaneoka H', 'Mizushima Y', 'Sakane T']","['Institute of Medical Science, St Marianna University, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (Monokines)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['CD11 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*pathology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Monokines/drug effects', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb03298.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Feb;89(2):258-65. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb03298.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the expression of this protein in samples of bone marrow from healthy individuals and patients with different types of leukaemias by using immunocytochemical staining and flow cytometric quantitation. In normal bone marrow the enzyme was found in promyelocytes, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, band forms and polymorphonuclear neutrophils, correlating with the synthesis of neutrophil serine proteinases during myeloid maturation. No staining was found within the lymphoid, erythroid and megakaryocytic lineage. In the leukaemic samples, only those of acute myeloid and chronic myeloid leukaemia patients were labelled with the antiproteinase 3 antibody. Cases of acute lymphoblastic and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, as well as other malignant lymphomas, were consistently negative, indicating that P3 may be used as a specific marker for the discrimination between myeloid and lymphoid leukaemias. In addition, immunoreactivity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) was investigated and the expression of P3 and MPO correlated with the French-American-British (FAB) classification. P3 was not detected in minimally differentiated M0 and M1 cases but was in predominantly labelled cells of M2 and M3 subtypes plus half of the M4 and one out of six M5 cases but not those of M6. These findings correspond to the differentiation stage in which P3 is expressed and stored in the primary granules. Therefore the enzyme may also be used as an adjunct to the classic morphological and cytochemical methods to elucidate further the stage at which the differentiation arrest of the leukaemic clone has occurred.","['Dengler, R', 'Munstermann, U', 'al-Batran, S', 'Hausner, I', 'Faderl, S', 'Nerl, C', 'Emmerich, B']","['Dengler R', 'Munstermann U', 'al-Batran S', 'Hausner I', 'Faderl S', 'Nerl C', 'Emmerich B']","['Abteilung fur Hamatologie und Onkologie, Medizinische Klinik Innenstadt, Universitat Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*enzymology/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Myeloblastin', 'Neutrophils/enzymology', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*analysis']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb03297.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Feb;89(2):250-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb03297.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used a specific radioimmunoassay to measure the level of IL-6 in 239 serum samples in which a monoclonal gammopathy was identified for the first time. The same sample was used for the measurement of serum C reactive protein and serum albumin. Then, an inventory of clinical and biological features allowed us to classify these patients into five groups: monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS:128), multiple myeloma (MM:66), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia (WM:27), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL:11) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL:7). The number of patients with serum IL-6 (S-IL-6) level > 0.335 ng/ml (upper limit in normal sera) was significantly higher in the MM group (35%; Confidence Interval (CI) 23.5-46.5) compared with the MGUS group (15%; CI 8.8-21.2). The distribution of S-IL-6 levels was also significantly different between the groups (Mann-Whitney test: P < 0.01). High S-IL-6 levels were measured in 5/11 patients with NHL and 9/27 patients with WM. The distribution of S-IL-6 levels in these groups was the same as that in MGUS or MM groups. In patients with MM, elevated S-IL-6 levels were associated with haemoglobin level < 100 g/l (P < 0.005), bone marrow plasmocytosis > 50% (P < 0.005) and stages II and III in the Durie & Salmon staging system (P < 0.005). The S-IL-6 level was also related to light chain component excretion in urine (P < 0.01) and M component serum level for IgA (P < 0.01). In patients with MGUS, the S-IL-6 level correlated with serum CRP level (P < 0.05), serum lactate dehydrogenase (P < 0.05) and serum ferritin (P < 0.01). We conclude that the S-IL-6 level is a marker of high tumour burden in multiple myeloma. However, S-IL-6 level can be increased in patients with MGUS in relation to inflammatory parameters. Therefore the S-IL-6 level does not demonstrate high predictive value for the diagnosis of MM in patients with newly identified monoclonal gammopathy.","['DuVillard, L', 'Guiguet, M', 'Casasnovas, R O', 'Caillot, D', 'Monnier-Zeller, V', 'Bernard, A', 'Guy, H', 'Solary, E']","['DuVillard L', 'Guiguet M', 'Casasnovas RO', 'Caillot D', 'Monnier-Zeller V', 'Bernard A', 'Guy H', 'Solary E']","['Laboratory of Biochemistry, C.H.U.

Such derivatives are anticipated to be hydrolysed to MTX by appropriate aminopeptidases localized (over-expressed naturally or targeted as anti-tumor antibody conjugates) in the vicinity of the tumor. The L-leucyl, L-valyl, L-isoleucyl, D-alanyl and L-pyroglutamyl derivatives were assessed as to their suitability as prodrugs. Except for the L-pyroglutamyl compound, all derivatives decomposed slowly when incubated in phosphate buffer, pH 7.3; the formation of MTX was minimal. No major differences were observed when serum was included in the incubation medium, except for the L-leucyl compound, which was hydrolysed to MTX. The L-leucyl, L-valyl and L-isoleucyl derivatives were hydrolysed readily to MTX by aminopeptidase M (EC 3.4.11.2), while the L-pyroglutamyl and D-alanyl compounds were activated by pyroglutamate aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.19.3) (from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens) and D-aminopeptidase (from Ochrobactrum anthropi), respectively. When tested for inhibition of the target enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR; EC 1.5.1.3), 2-L-valyl-MTX showed inhibition two orders of magnitude poorer than that given by MTX, in agreement with the expectation that acylation of the 2-amino group reduces binding to DHFR. After treatment of this derivative with aminopeptidase M, the extent of inhibition correlated with the amount of MTX formed. MTX derivatives alone or in combination with the complementary peptidase were tested for cytotoxicity on murine L1210 cells in culture. The above-listed derivatives were considerably less cytotoxic than MTX, except for the L-leucyl derivative which showed considerable cytotoxicity. When the appropriate exogenous peptidase was included, the cytotoxicity of the activated prodrugs approached that of MTX. These results indicate that 2-L-leucyl-MTX is unsuitable as a prodrug since it is activated prematurely by serum enzymes. Although the L-valyl and L-isoleucyl derivatives do not hydrolyse to MTX in serum and are readily activated, they are not ideal prodrugs since they decompose under physiological conditions; the properties of the decomposition product will have a bearing on the ultimate suitability of these compounds. 2-L-Pyroglutamyl-MTX is the best candidate prodrug, showing stability and ready activation by the appropriate aminopeptidase.","['Smal, M A', 'Dong, Z', 'Cheung, H T', 'Asano, Y', 'Escoffier, L', 'Costello, M', 'Tattersall, M H']","['Smal MA', 'Dong Z', 'Cheung HT', 'Asano Y', 'Escoffier L', 'Costello M', 'Tattersall MH']","['Department of Pharmacy, University of Sydney, N.S.W., Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Buffers)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Prodrugs)', 'EC 3.4.11.- (Aminopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.19.3 (Pyroglutamyl-Peptidase I)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Aminopeptidases', 'Animals', 'Blood', 'Buffers', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Stability', 'Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Prodrugs/*pharmacology', 'Pyroglutamyl-Peptidase I/pharmacology']",1995/02/14 00:00,1995/02/14 00:01,['1995/02/14 00:00'],"['1995/02/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/14 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(94)00456-V [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(94)00456-v [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1995 Feb 14;49(4):567-74. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(94)00456-v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Catalase (CAT) activity in Se(-) cells was unaffected up to this point, but thereafter began to increase. Two manifestations of this increase have been differentiated for both cell lines: (a) short-term induction of CAT (up to approx. twofold) after 2-3 weeks, followed by (b) long-term selection for cells that irreversibly express much higher levels of CAT, e.g., > 100 times (L1210) and > 10 times (HL-60) the levels observed in Se(+) controls after approximately 20 weeks. Although superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase, and glucose-6-P dehydrogenase activities were unchanged in Se(-) cells, GSH levels were elevated by 50-100%; like short-term CAT elevation, this could be reversed by supplying Se. Short-term Se(-) cells were more sensitive to H2O2-induced killing than Se(+) cells, evidently because SePX activity was important for peroxide detoxification. However, long-term Se(-) cells were markedly more resistant to H2O2 than Se(+) counterparts, consistent with the much higher levels of CAT in the former. Southern blot analysis revealed that the copy number of CAT DNA in a clone of long-term Se(-) L1210 cells was four- to fivefold greater than that in an Se(+) clone. Northern blot analysis of RNA from the same Se(-) clone showed a CAT mRNA level that was at least 40 times higher than that of the Se(+) control. Similar trends were observed for HL-60 cells. These results suggest that elevated CAT during long-term Se deprivation is a reflection of amplification and greater transcription of the CAT gene.","['Lin, F', 'Jackson, V E', 'Girotti, A W']","['Lin F', 'Jackson VE', 'Girotti AW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 56226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Selenoproteins)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Catalase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Peroxidases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Selenium/deficiency', 'Selenoproteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/02/20 00:00,1995/02/20 00:01,['1995/02/20 00:00'],"['1995/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003986185711290 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1995.1129 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1995 Feb 20;317(1):7-18. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1995.1129.,,,,,['CA49089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major HEL sulfated proteins were a doublet at 88 and 92 kDa and several closely spaced bands between 125 and 160 kDa and more acidic proteins of 210 kDa. Treatment with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) for 24 h almost completely inhibited labeling of sulfated proteins, and up to 48 h, labeling was found almost entirely in a band at 125 kDa. Treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) nearly eliminated labeling of the 88- and 92-kDa bands and resulted in the appearance of a large amount of labeling between 96 and 108 kDa. Sulfated proteins of 135 and 210 kDa were immunoprecipitated by an antibody against platelet GP Ib. A 130-kDa protein was immunoprecipitated by an antibody against the beta-1 integrin subunit. The major proteins labeled in CHRF cells were at 68, 90, 98, 125, and 148 kDa. Treatment with PMA greatly reduced the labeling of the 148-kDa band, eliminated the labeling of the 68-kDa band, and markedly enhanced labeling of the 92-kDa region. The major proteins labeled in K562 cells were at 110, 120-130, and 145 kDa. PMA reduced the labeling of the 110- and 145-kDa proteins and extensively increased labeling of bands at 120-130, 78, and 84 kDa, and DMSO caused decreased labeling of the 120- to 130-kDa proteins. This is the first demonstration of sulfation of specific proteins in hematopoietic cell lines and of the alteration of sulfation of specific proteins in any cells in response to treatment with differentiation-inducing agents. We hypothesize that changes in sulfation of proteins may be relevant to the maturation or malignant growth of megakaryocytic cells.","['Schick, B P', 'Tang, R P', 'Jacoby, J A']","['Schick BP', 'Tang RP', 'Jacoby JA']","['Cardeza Foundation for Hematologic Research, Department of Medicine, Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Sulfates)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Sulfates/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology']",1995/02/20 00:00,1995/02/20 00:01,['1995/02/20 00:00'],"['1995/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(85)71153-8 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1995.1153 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1995 Feb 20;317(1):191-200. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1995.1153.,,,,,['HL-29282/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

An in vitro Bacillus subtilis well-agar diffusion assay was employed to test the hypothesis that himastatin was enzymatically inactivated. The activity of himastatin against B. subtilis was inhibited when himastatin was mixed with mouse liver S9 fraction and microsomes. However, subsequent investigations demonstrated that the markedly decreased antibacterial activity was not enzymatic in nature but was related to the presence of certain fatty acid salts. Saturated fatty acid sodium salts with a carbon chain number of 8 or more reduced the antimicrobial activity of himastatin 50 to 100 times. If antibiotics such as ampicillin, bacitracin, chloramphenicol, and tunicamycin were used in place of himastatin, no meaningful reduction in antibacterial activity occurred. However, the antibacterial activity of the membrane-active peptide antibiotic polymyxin B, but not that of polymyxin E (colistin), was reduced in a manner similar to that of himastatin. Importantly, the activity of himastatin against HCT-116 colon adenocarcinoma cells in soft agar was markedly reduced in the presence of sodium palmitate as the reference fatty acid salt. The data indicate that himastatin may be trapped in micelles in vitro. It may be speculated that the lack of distal site antitumor activity resulted from similar complex formation between himastatin and lipids in vivo. The results also suggest that the cancer cytotoxic and antimicrobial effects of himastatin may result from interactions with the cell membrane.","['Mamber, S W', 'Brookshire, K W', 'Dean, B J', 'Firestone, R A', 'Leet, J E', 'Matson, J A', 'Forenza, S']","['Mamber SW', 'Brookshire KW', 'Dean BJ', 'Firestone RA', 'Leet JE', 'Matson JA', 'Forenza S']","['Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Wallingford, Connecticut 06492.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Palmitic Acids)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Salts)', '0 (Steroids)', '126775-74-4 (himastatin)', '2V16EO95H1 (Palmitic Acid)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Bacillus subtilis/*drug effects', 'Fatty Acids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Palmitic Acid', 'Palmitic Acids/chemistry', 'Peptides, Cyclic/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Phospholipids/pharmacology', 'Salts', 'Steroids/pharmacology', 'Streptomyces/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/AAC.38.11.2633 [doi]'],ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1994 Nov;38(11):2633-42. doi: 10.1128/AAC.38.11.2633.,,,,,,,PMC188254,,,,,,,,,,,

The combination of TNF and DXR produced synergistic growth inhibition in B16, K562 and, particularly, also in the MDR sublines of these two tumors. In addition, TNF and DXR induced synergistically erythroid differentiation in K562 and multidirectional differentiation in K562-DXR.

We addressed the question of whether R123 could compete with substrates or inhibitors (vinblastine, colchicine, verapamil) of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) overexpressed in MDR cells, using fluorescence image cytometry. Verapamil caused a dose-dependent increase in R123 accumulation. R123 accumulation was increased by vinblastine only at high levels and colchicine had no effect on R123 accumulation. Treatments with two drugs altered R123 accumulation depending on drug concentration ratio. The results indicate that vinblastine, R123 and verapamil can compete for outward transport by Pgp. A dual effect of vinblastine suggests that vinblastine can activate Pgp at low concentrations and inhibit R123 transport at higher concentrations.","['Lautier, D', 'Canitrot, Y', 'Salmon, J M']","['Lautier D', 'Canitrot Y', 'Salmon JM']","['Laboratoire de Chimie Physique, Universite de Perpignan, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colchicine/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/*pharmacology']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1994 Nov-Dec;14(6B):2589-95.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied a patient with acute myeloid leukemia whose only sign of relapse was bilateral anterior uveitis with pseudohypopyon that was refractory to topical and systemic corticosteroids. METHODS: A 26-year-old woman with acute myeloid leukemia in remission, who had bilateral anterior uveitis and increased intraocular pressure at initial examination, was studied clinically. Blood films, bone marrow smears, and preparations were examined by using immunoperoxidase staining. RESULTS: Although there was no evidence of leukemia in the blood or bone marrow samples, the cells obtained from the anterior chamber showed myeloblastic leukemic cells with morphologic characteristics similar to those present in the original bone marrow biopsy obtained 14 months previously. Irradiation and chemotherapy were used to kill the malignant cells in the eye and central nervous system. The persisting glaucoma resolved after anterior chamber washout of necrotic tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: Unusual features of uveitis in this patient indicated that she had a masquerade syndrome, despite normal results of bone marrow and blood film tests. Aspiration of intraocular cellular infiltrate for cytopathologic examination was required to obtain the correct diagnosis and enable treatment to commence without delay.","['Ayliffe, W', 'Foster, C S', 'Marcoux, P', 'Upton, M', 'Finkelstein, M', 'Kuperwaser, M', 'Legmann, A']","['Ayliffe W', 'Foster CS', 'Marcoux P', 'Upton M', 'Finkelstein M', 'Kuperwaser M', 'Legmann A']","['Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Boston 02114.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Ophthalmol,American journal of ophthalmology,0370500,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anterior Chamber/*pathology', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intraocular Pressure', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Leukemic Infiltration/pathology', 'Ocular Hypertension/etiology', 'Radiotherapy', 'Recurrence', 'Suppuration/diagnosis', 'Uveitis, Anterior/*diagnosis']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9394(14)71181-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9394(14)71181-x [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Ophthalmol. 1995 Mar;119(3):361-4. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9394(14)71181-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow examination revealed both CLL and large cell immunoblastic lymphoma (Richter's syndrome). As expected, the CLL was of B-cell lineage. The neoplasm expressed low-density monotypic IgM lambda, the pan-B-cell antigens CD19, CD20, and CDw75, and the CD5 and CD43 antigens. The large cell immunoblastic lymphoma was of T-cell lineage, positive for the CD45RB, CD3, CD45RO, and CD43 antigens, and negative for the CD20 and CDw75 antigens. Both neoplastic components were negative for Epstein-Barr virus RNA and latent membrane protein. Although 3% to 5% of patients with B-cell CLL may develop higher-grade lymphoma, usually the lymphoma is of B-cell lineage and often represents a histologic manifestation of clonal evolution. Less commonly, B-CLL patients may develop transformation to a higher grade tumor that resembles Hodgkin's disease. Both the usual form of Richter's syndrome and particularly the Hodgkin's variant of Richter's syndrome may be associated with Epstein-Barr virus. Patients with B-cell CLL rarely develop a higher grade lymphoma of T-cell lineage. To our knowledge, only one other example has been reported in the literature. Epstein-Barr virus was not associated with either neoplasm in this case.","['Lee, A', 'Skelly, M E', 'Kingma, D W', 'Medeiros, L J']","['Lee A', 'Skelly ME', 'Kingma DW', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Department of Pathology, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence 02903.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Immunoblastic/*etiology/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*etiology/immunology/pathology']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/103.3.348 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1995 Mar;103(3):348-52. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/103.3.348.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the elimination of the donor T cells results in a higher frequency of graft failure, secondary infections and, in case of leukaemia, relapse. We found, that, in contrast to normal spleen cells, spleen cells from A or B10 donor mice pretreated with xenogeneic antithymocyte serum (ATS) in vivo did not induce GVHD in non-irradiated (B10 x A)F1 hybrids. Spleen cells of ATS-pretreated A donors did not cause GVHD in allogeneic CBA mice made neonatally tolerant to the A donor strain either. Furthermore, spleen cells from ATS-treated donors did not cause GVHD in irradiated F1 hybrid recipients, moreover, they decreased the lethal effect of irradiation. The in vivo ATS pretreatment improved the repopulating capacity of spleen cells in irradiated syngeneic recipients, too. The effect of the ATS treatment does not rely solely upon the elimination of T cells, since flow cytofluorometric analysis revealed only a partial depletion of both the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of the ATS-pretreated animals.

The anti-LBC antibodies reacted with components of 14, 16 and 27 kDa present on LB tumour cells, LBC cell line and normal thymocytes, but not with normal lymph node cells. Furthermore, immunization of the autologous hosts with LBC cells partially protected them against subsequent challenge with the original LB leukaemic cells. These findings demonstrate that culture conditions induced modifications in the antigenic properties of the leukaemic cells, allowing LBC cells to stimulate an immune response directed against components expressed at early stages during T cell maturation.

We investigated to which extent flow cytometric analysis of leukemia-associated marker combination may contribute to sensitive follow-up in patients with acute leukemia. For this purpose dilution experiments were performed, in which artificial mixtures of normal peripheral blood lymphocytes and leukemia cells from a patient with leukemia-associated phenotype were prepared and analyzed for double positive cells. Our results showed that the sensitivity of double color immunofluorescence assay was 3 in 10(4) cells. Sequential studies of residual disease were evaluated in five acute leukemia patients with leukemia-associated markers combinations at diagnosis. In three of them morphologic relapse was preceded by the immunologic detection of small amounts of leukemia cells, while in two other cases, in which no double positive cells for leukemia-associated markers were found, patients are still in hematologic remission. This approach to the study of minimal residual disease could be valuable in monitoring the efficiency of chemotherapy, as well as in evaluating the quality control of bone marrow before autografting.

Addition of sphinganine (SP), an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) enhanced (2-3 fold) the VP-16, MXT, MMC or Act-D-induced differentiation but not the NOVO-induced differentiation. No induction of differentiation was observed with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the absence or presence of SP. The addition of SP in the fresh medium after the removal of VP-16, MXT, or MMC (0.5 h treatment) enhanced the induction of differentiation. In contrast, SP post-treatment did not have any effect on enhancing the differentiation which was induced by Act-D short exposure (0.5 h). In an attempt to characterize the biochemical requirements for potentiation of VP-16-induced differentiation, we examined the effects of calcium depletion using calcium chelator ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) or calcium channel blocker verapamil. Potentiation of VP-16-induced differentiation by SP was not observed in EGTA- or verapamil-treated cells. Calcium supplementation to the cells during the treatment with EGTA restored the SP-potentiation of VP-16-induced differentiation. Our results also showed that the induction of differentiation was accompanied by a decrease in PKC activity (70% of the control). PKC activity decreased to a greater extent (50% of control) in SP potentiation of differentiation induction. Our results suggested that calcium-dependent biological action of antitumor agents and the inhibition of PKC activity are required for SP-potentiation of differentiation induction.","['Yung, B Y']",['Yung BY'],"['Department of Pharmacology, Chang Gung Medical College, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,0326264,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'OWA98U788S (safingol)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00173029 [doi]'],ppublish,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol. 1994 Nov;350(5):575-81. doi: 10.1007/BF00173029.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies were based on a flow cytometric assay that detects efflux of the fluorescent dye rhodamine 123 (Rh123), which is transported from the cell by the P-170 pump. Dual-fluorescence staining with Rh123 and phycoerythrin-labeled monoclonal antibodies allowed selective measurement of Rh123 efflux in blast cells. Samples were scored positive when the fraction of blast cells showing Rh123 efflux exceeded 10% after a 120-min incubation. Activity of P-170 was observed in 19 (54%) of the 35 AML cases and was completely blocked in the presence of multidrug resistance inhibitors. Efflux activity was significantly higher in CD34-positive AML samples (p < 0.02). All AML patients with the FAB-subtype M5 (n = 5) lacked Rh123 pumping activity (p < 0.03). The complete remission rate in response to induction chemotherapy was significantly higher for Rh123-negative (11/13, 85%) than for Rh 123-positive AML patients (4/15, 27%) (p < 0.007). At a median follow-up of 9 months overall survival was significantly shorter for Rh123-positive than for Rh123-negative patients (p < 0.05). In contrast to AML, we could detect Rh123 efflux in only two (8%) out of 24 ALL cases. The immunological subtypes of these two positive cases was of B-ALL and pre-T-ALL. Bone marrow cryostat sections from 13 AML and five ALL patients were further analyzed for staining with monoclonal antibodies MM4.17 and JSB1. Ten of 13 AML and two of five ALL cases expressed the MDR protein. Our results indicate that there is a rather low frequency of P-170 pumping activity in ALL compared with AML. Further, functional activity of P-170 contributes to chemoresistance in de novo AML.","['Ludescher, C', 'Eisterer, W', 'Hilbe, W', 'Gotwald, M', 'Hofmann, J', 'Zabernigg, A', 'Cianfriglia, M', 'Thaler, J']","['Ludescher C', 'Eisterer W', 'Hilbe W', 'Gotwald M', 'Hofmann J', 'Zabernigg A', 'Cianfriglia M', 'Thaler J']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Rhodamine 123', '*Rhodamines/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Feb;9(2):350-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcript numbers were compared in 29 paired specimens of blood and marrow collected contemporaneously from 18 patients at differing stages of disease. In general, the numbers of BCR-ABL transcripts detected in marrow in blood were not significantly different (p = 0.1). However, in four samples BCR-ABL transcripts (< 10-1000/micrograms RNA) were detected in the marrow while the blood was negative; the reverse, positive blood and negative marrow, was not seen. In a further three samples the number of BCR-ABL transcripts was more than 10-fold higher in the marrow. We measured the number of ABL transcripts/micrograms RNA in all samples as an internal standard in order to control for variations in sample quality and other parameters. For two out of the four discordant samples in which blood was PCR negative, the number of ABL transcripts/micrograms RNA detected in the marrow was substantially higher than in the blood, suggesting poor quality blood specimens. However, the ratio of BCR-ABL to ABL in marrow and blood was similar for the three discordant samples in which both tissues were PCR positive. We conclude that in general, blood and marrow contain similar BCR-ABL transcript numbers in Ph-positive ALL but some samples are discordant. Marrow is therefore the preferred tissue for residual disease studies. Quantification of ABL mRNA as an internal control is useful in the interpretation of competitive PCR data and may serve as a robust way to standardize results between laboratories.","['van Rhee, F', 'Marks, D I', 'Lin, F', 'Szydlo, R M', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Treleaven, J', 'Delord, C', 'Cross, N C', 'Goldman, J M']","['van Rhee F', 'Marks DI', 'Lin F', 'Szydlo RM', 'Hochhaus A', 'Treleaven J', 'Delord C', 'Cross NC', 'Goldman JM']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blood Cells/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/genetics/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Feb;9(2):329-35.,,,,,,"['ABL', 'BCR-ABL']",,,,,,,,,,,,

While the current PCR strategies for estimating the amount of residual leukemia claim a detection sensitivity of one leukemia cell amongst 10(5) or 10(6) normal cells, a rigorous assessment of the relative error associated with these techniques has not been presented. We have developed a method of estimating the amount of residual leukemia in remission marrows that is analogous to the limiting dilution assays used to determine the frequency of immunocompetent cells in a responder cell population. Using this method we measured the fraction of all-or-none (i.e. positive or negative) reactions of the PCR amplification of the leukemia-specific IgH gene rearrangement in replicate samples of serial dilutions of DNA obtained from diagnostic bone marrow specimens from 15 children with B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A sigmoid curve representing the fraction of positive PCR reactions at a given dilution of leukemia DNA was found to be the best fit to the data. The narrowness of the log-linear region of this curve prevents the direct application of the analysis methodology that has previously been described for limiting dilution assays. However, the residual leukemia burden during morphological remission in these 15 patients and in two additional patients who experienced relapse could be estimated by the described dilution analysis method using the best-fit equation. Furthermore, the data generated for diagnostic, remission and relapse marrow samples exhibited a small interspecimen variation. The results suggest that this method can reliably estimate residual leukemia over a range of five orders of magnitude. Although the PCR reaction appears to be one of the most sensitive methods for detecting residual leukemia, all techniques based on this procedure, including our own, must exhibit limitations inherent to the amplification process. Our estimates or relative error suggest that a realistic limit for the PCR estimation of residual leukemia lies in the range of one leukemia cell per 10(5) normal cells. The suggested method is rapid, technically simple and relatively inexpensive. Furthermore, the principles that it is based upon can be applied to any PCR-based strategy.","['Ouspenskaia, M V', 'Johnston, D A', 'Roberts, W M', 'Estrov, Z', 'Zipf, T F']","['Ouspenskaia MV', 'Johnston DA', 'Roberts WM', 'Estrov Z', 'Zipf TF']","['Division of Pediatrics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Examination/*methods', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Feb;9(2):321-8.,,,['Leukemia. 1996 May;10(5):920-2.

For the majority of cases current PCR protocols allow the reliable detection of one neoplastic cell among 10(4) to 10(6) normal counterparts. Occasionally, however, PCR analysis fails to reach this level of sensitivity. Here we demonstrate by means of three representative ALL cases how modifications of PCR protocols can overcome some of the limitations. Thus usage of biotinylated PCR products of TCR delta junctional regions and their direct application as templates for the generation of clonospecific probes allows the introduction of a selection step and results in a significant reduction of unspecific background signals. According to our experience as well as data from other laboratories we also recommend the usage of synthetic oligonucleotides representing TCR gamma junctions as clone-specific primers for a consecutive round of amplification rather than as clonospecific probes. Both modifications improve and facilitate the detection of MRD in leukemias characterized by TCR gamma and TCR delta recombinations.","['Seriu, T', 'Hansen-Hagge, T E', 'Erz, D H', 'Bartram, C R']","['Seriu T', 'Hansen-Hagge TE', 'Erz DH', 'Bartram CR']","['Department of Pediatrics II, University of Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Biotin', 'Child', 'Clone Cells/chemistry', 'DNA Primers', '*Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/*chemistry']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Feb;9(2):316-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By means of the RHPA, the spontaneous and stimulated secretion of TGF-beta 1 and PDGF could be analyzed at the single cell level. According to morphometric analysis, predominantly small megakaryocytes including precursors (pro- and megakaryoblasts) secrete TGF-beta 1 and PDGF under physiological conditions. Furthermore, the proportion of actively secreting megakaryocytes increased significantly following treatment with recombinant human (rh) IL-3 for 8 h. A slight induction was also appreciated after stimulation with interleukins rhIL-1 or rhIL-11.

In this study, we examined the effect of RA isomers, including ATRA, 13-cis RA and 9-cis RA, on the proliferation and differentiation of NB4 cells. A number of parameters such as cell growth curve, dynamics of cell cycle, expression of clusters of differentiation and reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) as well as immunofluorescence staining of PML were used to evaluate the effects of three isomers at two concentrations (10(-8) M and 10(-7) M). It has been shown that during the first 48 h of RA treatment, the APL cell differentiation was coupled with the cell proliferation. Although similar effects of proliferation inhibition and differentiation induction were observed among the three isomers at 10(-7) M, significant differences appeared at a concentration of 10(-8) M, 9-cis RA showed a higher activity than that of ATRA, while ATRA showed better results than 13-cis RA.

IL-6 also failed to phosphorylate Hsp27 when cells had been deactivated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as genistein. The capacity of cellular extracts to phosphorylate Hsp27 could be, however, restored when either immunoprecipitated activated MAP kinase or purified MAPKAP kinase 2 was added to cell lysates. These findings suggest that IL-6-mediated phosphorylation of Hsp27 results from activation of MAPKAP kinase 2, a serine/threonine kinase which is activated by MAP kinase.

In eight cases we used FISH with AML1 cosmid probes on metaphase chromosomes as well as RT-PCR to detect the junctions of MAL1/CDR (ETO,MTG8). Five cases were analyzed by FISH alone and ten cases by RT-PCR alone. By FISH we could identify three groups according to the distribution of the fluorescent signal. Signals were found in group 1 on chromosomes 21 and 21q+, in group 2 on chromosomes 21, 21q+ and 8q- and in group 3 on chromosomes 21 and 8q-. In all groups we could detect an identical AML1/CDR fusion transcript. This transcript showed splicing of AML1 exon 5 onto CDR.

Bone marrow cells from 121 consecutive patients with multiple myeloma were analyzed cytogenetically by standard banding techniques including RHG, GTG and CBG banding.

Der(16) was identified at diagnosis in five patients, during disease progression in two additional patients, and at the time of a relapse in the two last cases. The t(1;15)(q10;p10) translocation was always unbalanced, resulting in a monosomy 16q in all cases. The CBG banding did not demonstrate dicentric chromosomes and the whole chromosome painting confirmed the der(16). A large number of other chromosomal abnormalities were associated with der(16), including chromosomal rearrangements involving the 8q24 band in five cases. Four of these five cases were Burkitt's-type translocations.

Southern blot analysis using the JH probe showed different rearranged bands at each crisis, although the same rearranged bands of the BCR gene were observed. We amplified and sequenced the IgH V region gene of the leukemia cells by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the primers corresponding to the consensus 5'VH and mu constant regions. The dominant leukemia clone at each crisis had a unique VH-D-JH rearrangement; VH4A (V79)-DLR2-J5 (clone-1), VH4B (DP70)-DK4-J6 (clone-2) and VH4A (V79)-DN4-J6 (clone-3) at the first, second and third crises, respectively. Further analysis by PCR amplification using the consensus 5'VH and clone-specific primers revealed that clone-1 underwent VH4-->VH3 replacement at the second crisis, and that clone-3 was already in existence at the first crisis. Moreover, the DN4-J6 joining clone, in which the sequence was the same as that of clone-3, was identified at the first and third crises by PCR amplification using primers corresponding to the region upstream of the DN4 segment and DN4-J6 boundary of clone-3. These observations suggest that multiple clones were generated from the progenitor cells of blast crisis, which were transformed at a very early stage of B-lymphocyte ontogeny, by continuing rearrangement mechanisms of the IgH genes, and that the dominant clone at each crisis was undergoing change.","['Kiyoi, H', 'Fukutani, H', 'Yamauchi, T', 'Kubo, K', 'Ohno, R', 'Yamamori, S', 'Naoe, T']","['Kiyoi H', 'Fukutani H', 'Yamauchi T', 'Kubo K', 'Ohno R', 'Yamamori S', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Medicine, Branch Hospital Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Disease Progression', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Testis/pathology']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Feb;9(2):265-70.,,,,,,"['BCR', 'J<down>H</down>', 'J<down>K</down>']",,,,,,,,,,,,

All-trans retinoic acid (RA) has been shown to produce brief remissions by a novel differentiating mechanism in most patients with APL. M195, a mouse monoclonal antibody (moAb) reactive with the cell-surface antigen CD33, can target myeloid leukemia cells in patients and reduce large leukemic burdens when labeled with 131I. We studied whether 131I-M195 could safely reduce minimal residual disease and prolong remission and survival durations in patients with relapsed APL after they had attained remission with all-trans RA. Seven patients with relapsed APL in second remission were treated with either 70 (n = 2) or 50 (n = 5) mCi/m2 of 131I-M195. As a measure of minimal residual disease, we serially monitored PML/RAR-alpha mRNA by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. There was no immediate toxicity. Late toxicity was limited to myelosuppression, but no episodes of febrile neutropenia were seen. Six patients had detectable PML/RAR-alpha mRNA after all-trans RA therapy; two had single negative RT-PCR determinations following 131I-M195. Median disease-free survival of the seven patients was 8 months (range 3-14.5). Four patients with median follow-up of 24 months remain alive, and median overall survival exceeds 21+ months (range 5.5-33+). This regimen based on targeted therapy compares favorably to other approaches for the treatment of relapsed APL, including that used in the immediately preceding trial in which patients were induced into remission and maintained with all-trans RA, as well as other chemotherapy-based regimens.

We analyzed, with emphasis on both disease- and therapy-related prognostic factors, the results from a 9-year trial in 65 adults with M3 and M3v APL, treated homogenously with a short-term therapy (STT) program excluding maintenance. STT comprised a maximum of six courses with doxorubicin, cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), and 6-thioguanine. Sixty-five APL patients formed the study group, M3v accounting for 25% of cases. In M3v, the absolute blast cell count was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) and early hemorrhagic deaths were more frequent (p = 0.05). The blast count correlated inversely with the probability of remission (p = 0.005), poor-risk patients being those with > 10 x 10(9)/l blast cells. During the study, the median survival improved from 0.1 to 2.7 years (p = < 0.005). In first place, response to chemotherapy increased from 42 to 84% (p = 0.006), by giving daily prophylactic platelet transfusions (to > 30 x 10(9)/l) and no heparin (course I), and by avoiding too toxic high-dose ara-C and deferring treatment in infected/neutropenic patients showing the atypical differentiative bone marrow pattern (course II). Secondly, the probability of first unmaintained remission differed significantly between patients given intentionally more than four total chemotherapy courses or intermediate/high-dose ara-C consolidation (0.59 at 5 years) and those treated less intensively (0.21) (p < 0.005). Intensive STT was very effective for the management of adult APL patients at standard hemorrhagic risk and receiving optimal supportive care. In high-risk patients with hyperleukocytosis and M3v, induction results could be improved by the concomitant use of ATRA. M3v in adults must be recognized promptly because of the very high early hemorrhagic risk.","['Bassan, R', 'Battista, R', 'Viero, P', ""d'Emilio, A"", 'Buelli, M', 'Montaldi, A', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Tremul, L', 'Dini, E', 'Barbui, T']","['Bassan R', 'Battista R', 'Viero P', ""d'Emilio A"", 'Buelli M', 'Montaldi A', 'Rambaldi A', 'Tremul L', 'Dini E', 'Barbui T']","['Division of Hematology, Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/ultrastructure', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/etiology', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/etiology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/classification/complications/*drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Feb;9(2):238-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, colony growth of L8057 cells, which had been maintained in serum-containing culture, was enhanced, but to a lesser extent, by the addition of these cytokines except rhEPO (the cultures were supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. Among the cytokines that showed growth-enhancing effects on L8057 cells, the expression of mRNAs encoding receptors for EPO, IL-6 and IL-3 was examined by northern blot analysis or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In both cell lines, mRNAs for EPO-R, IL-6R, gp130, IL-3R alpha and beta chains were constitutively expressed. The results suggest that L8057 and L8057Y5 cell lines have characteristics of megakaryoblastic cells in their biological responses to cytokines, as well as in the expression of cytokine receptor mRNAs, and that the growth-enhancing effects of these cytokines on the cell lines may be achieved through specific receptors. Our findings show the value of these cell lines for investigating the mechanisms of growth signal transduction in megakaryopoiesis.","['Sasaki, H', 'Hirabayashi, Y', 'Ishibashi, T', 'Inoue, T', 'Matsuda, M', 'Kai, S', 'Ikuta, K', 'Yokoyama, K', 'Yokota, T', 'Maruyama, Y']","['Sasaki H', 'Hirabayashi Y', 'Ishibashi T', 'Inoue T', 'Matsuda M', 'Kai S', 'Ikuta K', 'Yokoyama K', 'Yokota T', 'Maruyama Y', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yokohama City University, School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Megakaryocytes/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['014521269400121P [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(94)00121-p [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1995 Feb;19(2):95-102. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)00121-p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A method for leukemia induction in mice has been developed using a cell line isolated following in vitro infection with the slowly transforming murine radiation leukemia virus (RadLV). The CI-V13D cell line represents a lymphoid precursor cell type at an early stage in cell transformation and can develop subcutaneous tumors in irradiated syngeneic hosts but not in allogeneic mice even after sublethal irradiation. Selective growth in allogeneic (CBA/H) mouse thymus has been demonstrated, but this requires preirradiation of the recipient. Upon reisolation from CBA/H thymus, C1-V13D progeny clones displayed increased tumorigenic potential in comparison to the 'parental' CI-V13D cell line. Tumorigenicity was shown to increase with serial passage through thymus and electron micrographs of clones also revealed increased production of C-type retroviruses. This new model for oncogenic progression should be more amenable to analysis of early genetic changes occurring during replication of leukemia in the thymus.","['Ho, E S', ""O'Neill, T J"", ""O'Neill, H C""]","['Ho ES', ""O'Neill TJ"", ""O'Neill HC""]","['Molecular Immunology Laboratory, John Curtin School of Medical Research, Canberra, ACT, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', '*Radiation Leukemia Virus', 'Retroviridae Infections/*etiology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*etiology']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(94)00120-Y [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(94)00120-y [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1995 Feb;19(2):83-93. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)00120-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the immunological effector cells are not yet clearly defined. The present study was designed to investigate the presence of cytotoxic precursor cells in active AML and to identify phenotypical and functional characteristics of autologous anti-leukemic cytotoxic effector cells. For this purpose, mononuclear cells (MNC) containing at least 70% leukemic blasts were isolated from bone marrow of untreated AML and cultured in the presence of 3000 IU/ml recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2) for 6-8 weeks. Under these conditions, T-cells were selected in the bone marrow cultures and overgrew the leukemic blasts. The resulting T-cell populations were cloned by limiting dilution and the clones obtained were characterized for their phenotypical and functional patterns. Totally, cloning resulted in 68 clones and a few cell lines. The clonality was verified by RT PCR analysis of TCR V beta gene expression. All clones obtained stained positive for CD2, CD3, DR and CD56. The vast majority (68%) of T-cell clones/lines was CD4+, a few clones expressed CD8 (19%) or CD4 and CD8, and four clones were of TCR gamma delta origin. Seven of 15 clones tested, including three CD4+, two CD8+ and two TCR gamma delta(+)-clones were found to be cytotoxic against autologous leukemic blast cells. All except one clone expressed oncolytic activities against allogeneic blasts too. One of the TCR gamma delta(+)-clones demonstrated NK activity by lysis of K562 targets. The majority of the T-cell-clones released IL-2, IL-8, TNF-alpha, GM-CSF but only a few IFN gamma and expressed high levels of mRNA for IL-2, TGF-beta and IL-10. None of the clones was found to produce IL-3, IL-4, IL-7 and TNF-beta.

In seven recent cases treated with a new chemotherapy regimen in combination with G-CSF administration, survival was longer than in previous cases and tumor involvement as a cause of death decreased (one case, 14%). However, CMV pneumonia inclined to increase (six cases, 86%). Therefore, we tried to retrospectively detect CMV DNA in the serum of ATL patients using a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). CMV pneumonia was reliably diagnosed in eleven ATL patients, whereas CMV DNA was detected in all patients at the time of clinical onset of pneumonia and CMV DNA was detected only in eight patients from 7-35 days before the onset of pneumonia. These findings suggest that the nested PCR assay is a useful tool to early diagnosis CMV pneumonia in ATL patients. 2) Recently, several cases of ATL with CD30 antigen have been reported, but its clinical relevance remains unknown. Accordingly, we studied CD30 antigen expression in 36 ATL patients who had monoclonal integration of HTLV-I provirus in the tumor cells and demonstrated the immunohistochemical and clinical characteristics of these patients.

High levels of CD38 expression on immature lymphoid cells suggest its role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, but there is no evidence demonstrating a functional activity of CD38 on these cells. We used stroma-supported cultures of B cell progenitors and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (T16 and IB4) to study CD38 function. In cultures of normal bone marrow CD19+ cells (n = 5), addition of anti-CD38 markedly reduced the number of cells recovered after 7 d. Cell loss was greatest among CD19+ sIg- B cell progenitors (mean cell recovery +/- SD = 7.2 +/- 11.7% of recovery in control cultures) and extended to CD19+CD34+ B cells (the most immature subset; 7.6 +/- 2.2%). In contrast, CD38 ligation did not substantially affect cell numbers in cultures of normal peripheral blood or tonsillar B cells. In stroma-supported cultures of 22 B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases, anti-CD38 suppressed recovery of CD19+ sIg- leukemic cells. CD38 ligation also suppressed the growth of immature lymphoid cell lines cultured on stroma and, in some cases, in the presence of stroma-derived cytokines (interleukin [IL] 7, IL-3, and/or stem cell factor), but did not inhibit growth in stroma- or cytokine-free cultures. DNA content and DNA fragmentation studies showed that CD38 ligation of stroma-supported cells resulted in both inhibition of DNA synthesis and induction of apoptosis. It is known that CD38 catalyzes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) hydrolysis into cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and ADPR. However, no changes in NAD+ hydrolysis or cADPR and ADPR production after CD38 ligation were found by high-performance liquid chromatography; addition of NAD+, ADPR, or cADPR to cultures of lymphoid progenitors did not offset the inhibitory effects of anti-CD38. Thus, anti-CD38 does not suppress B lymphopoiesis by altering the enzymatic function of the molecule. In conclusion, these data show that CD38 ligation inhibits the growth of immature B lymphoid cells in the bone marrow microenvironment, and suggest that CD38 interaction with a putative ligand represents a novel regulatory mechanism of B lymphopoiesis.","['Kumagai, M', 'Coustan-Smith, E', 'Murray, D J', 'Silvennoinen, O', 'Murti, K G', 'Evans, W E', 'Malavasi, F', 'Campana, D']","['Kumagai M', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Murray DJ', 'Silvennoinen O', 'Murti KG', 'Evans WE', 'Malavasi F', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '119340-53-3 (Cyclic ADP-Ribose)', '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*physiology', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclic ADP-Ribose', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'NAD/metabolism']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.181.3.1101 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1995 Mar 1;181(3):1101-10. doi: 10.1084/jem.181.3.1101.,,,,,"['P01-CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA 58297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2191914,,,,,,,,,,,

With red cell targets, cytolysin expression conferred potent hemolytic activity, which was not influenced by coexpression of granzymes. With tumor targets, RBL cells expressing cytolysin alone were weakly cytotoxic, but both cytolytic and nucleolytic activity were enhanced by coexpression of granzyme B. RBL cells expressing all three CTL granule components showed still higher cytotoxic activities, with apoptotic target death. Analysis of the cytotoxic activity of individual transfectant clones showed that cytolytic and nucleolytic activity correlated with granzyme expression but was independent of cytolysin expression within the range examined. A synergism between granzymes A and B was apparent when the triple transfectant was compared with RBL cells expressing cytolysin and one granzyme.

The rate of 125I-labeled acLDL degradation was about 2-fold greater in cells plated at the lower density (105 vs. 60 ng/h per mg cell protein). Northern analysis showed a 2-fold reduction in the expression of human scavenger receptor mRNA in density plated cells, and immunoprecipitation also demonstrated a 2-fold decrease in scavenger receptor protein. Conditioned media did not differentially affect EC formation at either cell density. Fatty acid supplementation increased EC formation and the proportion of esterified sterol content only in cell plated at the higher density. The fatty acid effect was also seen when cells were exposed to beta-VLDL, which induced comparable levels of EC accumulation by non-scavenger receptor-mediated processes in densely plated cells.

The ED50 values of hIL-5 for both TF-1 and JYTF-1 cell lines remained similar. However, when cells were grown in an optimal concentration of IL-5, some TF-1 cells but not JYTF-1 cells died via apoptosis. Although the rates of DNA synthesis were similar for TF-1 and JYTF-1 cells grown in IL-5, [3-H]thymidine releasing of pulse-labeled DNA analysis indicated that the viable TF-1 cells in IL-5 were more apoptosis-prone than were JYTF-1 cells. Therefore, in the JYTF-1 variant, the ability to suppress apoptosis has apparently been restored. The following findings suggest that overexpression of the hIL-5 receptor alpha-chain may be responsible for restoring the apoptosis suppression ability of IL-5: 1) the growth of JYTF-1 cells remained cytokine-dependent; 2) the proliferation of JYTF-1 cells in IL-5 was not mediated by autocrine secretion; 3) JYTF-1 and TF-1 cells responded similarly to other cytokines such as human erythropoietin; 4) Northern blot analysis revealed that JYTF-1 cells expressed approximately eightfold more IL-5 receptor alpha-chain mRNA than did TF-1.

In the present study we analyzed apoptosis in camptothecin-treated HL60 leukaemia cells, and in freshly isolated mouse thymocytes treated with dexamethasone. The process was first quantified and time monitored by flow cytometry. Subsequently the specimens were processed for morphological examination in order to investigate the behaviour of the different nuclear domains. To follow DNA and RNA localization, we utilized osmium ammine and DNase-colloidal gold cytochemical reactions. The concentration of most DNA in the cap-shaped structures was demonstrated by these reactions. Confocal microscopy of cells processed by in situ nick-translation suggested that DNA was firstly cleaved and subsequently condensed in cup-shaped structures. Despite the strong nuclear modifications, nucleoli could be clearly recognized until the late apoptotic stages.","['Falcieri, E', 'Zamai, L', 'Santi, S', 'Cinti, C', 'Gobbi, P', 'Bosco, D', 'Cataldi, A', 'Betts, C', 'Vitale, M']","['Falcieri E', 'Zamai L', 'Santi S', 'Cinti C', 'Gobbi P', 'Bosco D', 'Cataldi A', 'Betts C', 'Vitale M']","['Istituto di Morfologia Umana Normale, Universita di Chieti, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Histochemistry,Histochemistry,0411300,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/*ultrastructure', 'DNA/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Thymus Gland/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00268899 [doi]'],ppublish,Histochemistry. 1994 Sep;102(3):221-31. doi: 10.1007/BF00268899.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In both models used, Friend virus leukemia (FV) and BM5 complex (lymphadenopathy and immune deficiency), the drug combination was able to reduce mortality and splenomegaly. While increasing mean survival time of those animals that did not survive infection by FV, when compared to infected control mice or mice treated with AZT alone, Met-ENK used alone at 1 and 3 mg/kg/mouse had no effect in reducing morbidity or mortality due to either virus. This suggested that Met-ENK had no direct antiviral effect at the concentrations used. In fact, mice treated with either single drug therapy or the combination still yielded virus in their spleen, even when splenomegaly was absent.

Aldolase B immunoreactivities were predominantly high in adult normal liver, while aldolase A was distinctly low. Aldolase A was high, while aldolase B was low in neonatal liver compared with the adult liver. Aldolase A immunoreactivities were almost the same as those of aldolase B in fetal liver (28 weeks). Aldolase A was predominantly found in human hepatoma tissues, whereas aldolase B was distinctly low in the same hepatoma tissues.

In CML cells, CFU-GM colony formation was relatively more resistant to orthovanadate than that in normal bone marrow cells and orthovanadate, surprisingly, increased BFU-E colony formation.

The TBI treatment involved 4 days of irradiation. The largest changes in breath ethane occurred on Day 2. The increased levels of breath ethane on Day 2 were correlated to clinical manifestations of toxicity. The correlation of the onset of gastrointestinal side effects with higher levels of breath ethane suggests that breath ethane may be a clinically useful measure of the toxicity of various TBI fractionation treatment protocols currently in use at different medical centers. The levels of breath ethane on the other days of treatment were lower, suggesting that the oxidative-antioxidative balance of the patient may be important in protection against free radical mediated injury.

Furthermore, it has been proposed that Bcl-2 acts to inhibit apoptosis induced by a wide variety of stimuli by preventing the production of oxygen-derived free radicals. Since the generation of oxygen free radicals is dependent upon oxygen concentration, this hypothesis would lead to the prediction that the concentration of oxygen should affect the induction of apoptosis. In order to test this prediction, we have examined the induction of apoptosis in T-lymphoma cell lines S49.1 and WEHI 7.1 by dexamethasone and by withdrawal of serum from myc-immortalized fibroblasts in 95% oxygen, atmospheric oxygen (20%), and hypoxic conditions of up to 125-fold less oxygen. Culture in 95% oxygen induced apoptosis in all cells tested, confirming that oxidative damage can lead to apoptosis. However, for one cell line, WEHI 7.1, hypoxia also induced apoptosis. Furthermore, for the other cell lines tested, induction of apoptosis by either dexamethasone or by serum withdrawal was not affected by hypoxia.

Apoptotic DNA fragmentation after exposure to TNF-alpha and C2-ceramide was also associated with down-regulation of Bcl-2 mRNA in HL-60 and U-937 cells, while Bcl-X mRNA production was unaffected.

The frequency of Ts11 is significantly higher in PCTs induced in pristane-conditioned mice infected by Abelson-murine leukemia virus (52%) compared to those induced by pristane alone (8.1%). Although the significance of Ts11 in mouse plasmacytomagenesis is not clearly understood it is hypothesized that a gene or genes located on chromosome (Chr) 11 may specifically promote the development of PCTs in which both oncogenes, c-myc and v-abl, are abundantly expressed. To test this assumption we induced PCTs by three highly effective plasmacytomagenic retroviruses: ABL-MYC, J3V1, and RIM. Nearly 90% of PCTs that arose in BALB/c, (BALB/c x DBA/2N)F1, BALB/c-nu/nu, and 5-month-old SCID mice infected with ABL-MYC virus were trisomic for Chr 11. In contrast, < 10% of PCTs induced by J3V1 or RIM retroviral constructs encompassing either v-myc and v-raf or c-myc and v-Ha-ras oncogenes, respectively, contained Ts11. We have also investigated whether the entire Chr 11 or any particular subregion is preferentially duplicated in the process of ABL-MYC plasmacytomagenesis. By inducing PCTs in F1 heterozygous mice that are carriers of reciprocal translocations involving Chr 11 we found that the duplicated chromosomal region is located distal to the T4Dn breakpoint (11B5 band) on the telomeric segment of Chr 11. The regular duplication of this chromosomal segment strongly suggests the presence of a gene or genes whose amplification is of critical importance for v-abl associated murine plasmacytomagenesis.","['Wiener, F', 'Coleman, A', 'Mock, B A', 'Potter, M']","['Wiener F', 'Coleman A', 'Mock BA', 'Potter M']","['Microbiology and Tumorbiology Center, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Female', '*Genes, Viral', '*Genes, abl', '*Genes, myc', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, SCID', 'Plasmacytoma/*genetics/*virology', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', '*Trisomy']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Mar 1;55(5):1181-8.,,,,,,"['Pvt-1', 'c-myc', 'v-Ha-ras', 'v-abl', 'v-myc', 'v-raf']",,,,,,,,,,,,

While individual hematopoietic growth factors tested did not show any effect on HOX-11 gene expression, a drastic increase in HOX-11 RNA was observed under the induction of phytohemagglutinin. In the presence of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, phytohemagglutinin-induced HOX-11 up-regulation was suppressed, indicating that HOX-11 acts as a delayed early response gene which requires protein synthesis. The HOX-11 gene expression was also suppressed by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors tryphostin and lavendustin A.

One of the derivatives of SPM (SPM-D), KRN5500, has a wide range of antitumor activity against human cancer cell lines. We examined the cytotoxicity of SPM-D in small and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and colony assays. SPM-D was active against a wide range of lung cancer cell lines. All three cisplatin (CDDP)-resistant cell lines established in our laboratory (PC-9/CDDP, PC-14/CDDP, and H69/CDDP) showed collateral sensitivity to SPM-D with relative resistance values of 0.43, 0.34, and 0.32, respectively. Intracellular SPM-D in PC-14/CDDP was 35% higher than that for PC-14 suggesting that intracellular accumulation can explain the collateral sensitivity to SPM-D at least in PC-14/CDDP. On the other hand, in PC-9/CDDP cells, no increase of intracellular SPM-D accumulation was observed, but the conversion ratio of a metabolite (the amino nucleoside moiety of spicamycin binding with glycine, SAN-G) from SPM-D evaluated by TLC was higher as compared with that of parental PC-9 cells (45.5% versus 37%; PC-9/CDDP versus PC-9). The increased intracellular metabolism of SPM-D could explain the mechanism of collateral sensitivity in PC-9/CDDP cisplatin-resistant cell lines. To elucidate the determinant of the SPM-D-induced cytotoxicity, we established SPM-D-resistant cell lines, PC-9/SPM-D, PC-14/SPM-D, and H69/SPM-D, by exposing cells to stepwise increases in SPM-D concentration. The relative resistances of these sublines were more than 5000, 46.6, and 37.8 times those of the parental cell lines, respectively. The intracellular concentration of the active metabolite, SAN-G, was found to be decreased in the SPM-D-resistant sublines. This result indicates that the intracellular metabolism of SPM-D to SAN-G is one of the determinants of cellular sensitivity to SPM-D in these SPM-D-resistant cell lines. In conclusion, both drug accumulation and metabolism may contribute to the sensitivity/resistance to SPM-D and both may merit investigation.","['Lee, Y S', 'Nishio, K', 'Ogasawara, H', 'Funayama, Y', 'Ohira, T', 'Saijo, N']","['Lee YS', 'Nishio K', 'Ogasawara H', 'Funayama Y', 'Ohira T', 'Saijo N']","['Pharmacology Division National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '8VH13L5K20 (KRN 5500)', 'KOO5CM684H (Digitonin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Digitonin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Purine Nucleosides/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Mar 1;55(5):1075-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three distinct isoforms of fusion gene transcripts were discovered: ela2, b2a2 and b3a2. In 10 cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), only two types (b2a2 and b3a2) were observed. However, in 8 cases of Ph1 chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph1 + ALL), all three types were detected, including two cases characterized by the coexistence of ela2 and b2a2 or b3a2 types. Moreover, the RT/PCR procedure established in the present study proved to be a very sensitive method, allowing the detection of one leukemic cell among 10(5)-10(6) normal cells. Thus, a positive RT/PCR result was obtained in two Ph1 + ALL cases just after chemotherapy-induced clinical remission (CR), suggesting the presence of residual disease. One case remained RT/PCR positive four months after achieving CR and relapsed in the fifth month, while the other case converted to RT/PCR negative eight months later and is now in CR for 18 months.

Current therapy includes the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitor trimethoprim which is selective but only a relatively weak inhibitor of the enzyme for P. carinii. Determination of the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme should form the basis for design of more potent and selective therapeutic agents for treatment of the disease. RESULTS: The structure of P. carinii DHFR in complex with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and trimethoprim has accordingly been solved by X-ray crystallography. The structure of the ternary complex has been refined at 1.86 A resolution (R = 0.181). A similar ternary complex with piritrexim (which is a tighter binding, but less selective inhibitor) has also been solved, as has the binary complex holoenzyme, both at 2.5 A resolution. CONCLUSIONS: These structures show how two drugs interact with a fungal DHFR. A comparison of the three-dimensional structure of this relatively large DHFR with bacterial or mammalian enzyme-inhibitor complexes determined previously highlights some additional secondary structure elements in this particular enzyme species. These comparisons provide further insight into the principles governing DHFR-inhibitor interaction, in which the volume of the active site appears to determine the strength of inhibitor binding.","['Champness, J N', 'Achari, A', 'Ballantine, S P', 'Bryant, P K', 'Delves, C J', 'Stammers, D K']","['Champness JN', 'Achari A', 'Ballantine SP', 'Bryant PK', 'Delves CJ', 'Stammers DK']","['Physical Sciences Department, Wellcome Research Laboratories, Beckenham, Kent, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Structure,"Structure (London, England : 1993)",101087697,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Ligands)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', 'AN164J8Y0X (Trimethoprim)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology/genetics', 'Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/genetics', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Structure', 'NADP/chemistry', 'Pneumocystis/*enzymology/genetics', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Folding', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*chemistry/genetics', 'Trimethoprim/chemistry/pharmacology']",1994/10/15 00:00,1994/10/15 00:01,['1994/10/15 00:00'],"['1994/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0969-2126(94)00093-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0969-2126(94)00093-x [doi]']",ppublish,Structure. 1994 Oct 15;2(10):915-24. doi: 10.1016/s0969-2126(94)00093-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results indicated that in both developmental stages the M20-derived inhibitor reversibly blocked cell proliferation without interfering with cell differentiation.","['Fibach, E', 'Rigel, M', 'Peled, T', 'Treves, A J', 'Barak, V']","['Fibach E', 'Rigel M', 'Peled T', 'Treves AJ', 'Barak V']","['Department of Hematology, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Monocytes/chemistry/cytology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409049731 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Oct;15(3-4):327-32. doi: 10.3109/10428199409049731.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We were able to demonstrate that CsA inhibits cytokine-induced proliferation, as measured by [3H]-thymidine incorporation, in all cases responsive to TNF-alpha or IL-2 as well as in spontaneous proliferation. CsA did not increase the fraction of trypan blue positive cells or apoptosis. Growth inhibition by CsA occurred in a dose dependent manner: 100 ng/ml CsA was the optimal concentration which blocked about 90% of cytokine induced or spontaneous proliferation. We could also demonstrate that the effect of CsA was reversible and that no blocking effect was observed when CsA was added later than 48 hours after stimulation. Cell cycle analysis using propidium iodide as a DNA stain demonstrated that CsA prohibited the progression of B-CLL cells from the G1-phase to the S-phase of the cell cycle. However, we were also able to show that TNF-alpha induced proliferation of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) was not affected by CsA. This observation indicates that the inhibitory activity of CsA seems to be restricted to only a few haematological diseases such as B-CLL.","['Schmid, M', 'Merk, B', 'Porzsolt, F']","['Schmid M', 'Merk B', 'Porzsolt F']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409049730 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Oct;15(3-4):317-25. doi: 10.3109/10428199409049730.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One patient underwent a course of repeated targeted therapy following his initial treatment. Acute toxicity was manifest in five patients by a transient aseptic meningitis. Myelosuppression was observed in four children. Pharmacokinetic studies investigated whole body, blood and CSF clearance of radioisotope. Progressively more rapid systemic clearance of 131I was noted in the patient receiving repeated therapy, indicating the development of the human anti-mouse Ig (HAMA) response. Dosimetric studies revealed a radiation dose to the red bone marrow of between 0.6 and 2.2 Gy. The dose to the subarachnoid CSF was between 12.2 and 25.3 Gy, over six times higher than that to the surface tissue of the brain and spinal cord and between 40 and 140 times higher than that to the whole brain.

To facilitate investigations regarding the association between FPGS content of tumor tissues and the sensitivity of tumors to antifolates, we developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based gene expression quantitation assay for measuring relative amounts of FPGS mRNA in tumor tissue specimens. From the known sequence of the human gene, FPGS-specific PCR primers were chosen that flanked a 263-base segment of the FPGS gene. The PCR carried out with these primers was linear over at least a three orders of magnitude range of starting cDNA concentration. The amount of cDNA required per assay corresponded to the quantity of RNA contained in nanogram to microgram amounts of tissue, depending on the level of gene expression. In CHO AUXB1 (FPGS) cell lines transfected with human DNA and expressing different levels of human FPGS, FPGS gene expression measured by this assay was linear with the FPGS enzyme activity in the cells. In human head and neck cell lines, which contained naturally varying levels of FPGS enzyme activity, FPGS gene expressions were also linearly proportional to FPGS enzyme content as measured both by activity in cell-free extracts and by intracellular methotrexate polyglutamate formation. Among leukemic cells from 11 acute lymphocytic leukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia patients, FPGS expression varied by over 500-fold.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Lenz, H J', 'Danenberg, K', 'Schnieders, B', 'Goeker, E', 'Peters, G J', 'Garrow, T', 'Shane, B', 'Bertino, J R', 'Danenberg, P V']","['Lenz HJ', 'Danenberg K', 'Schnieders B', 'Goeker E', 'Peters GJ', 'Garrow T', 'Shane B', 'Bertino JR', 'Danenberg PV']","['Kenneth T.

After 30 min incubation of effector and target cells together, gold-labeled cytoplasmic granules were often seen concentrated in the area of the LGL adjacent to the bound YAC-1 target. Within 60 min, the granules were observed to move to the cell border near the conjugated site. At this point, the granules were fused with the cell membrane, and subsequently released the gold-labeled contents into the junction between the LGL and the target cell. Gold particles could be seen at the E-T interface, on the LGL surface, or sometimes on the target cell surface.

Significant elevation of both TAT and PIC was observed in all cases of DIC. Most elevated levels of TAT were seen in DIC with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) and sepsis. The highest levels of PIC were seen in DIC with APL but were much lower in sepsis. A significant elevation in active PAI was observed in DIC due to acute leukaemia (apart from APL), chronic myeloid leukaemia and sepsis, but not in APL, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and cancer. Active PAI was higher in patients with multiple organ failure (MOF) than in those without MOF while PIC was lower in patients with this complication. Thus, the balance of coagulation and fibrinolysis varied according to the underlying cause of DIC; APL had more dominant activation of fibrinolysis, while sepsis had greater activation of coagulation.

Plasma levels of SF correlated well with the DIC score, which is determined according to the 'DIC Scoring Guideline' proposed by the DIC Study Group under the Japanese Ministry of Public Welfare in 1988. It also correlated well with the serum levels of FDP. Normal values of plasma SF ranged between 0 and 9.50 micrograms/ml.

These clones were CYP2A6, CYP2A7 and an alternatively spliced version of CYP2A7 (CYP2A7AS). The latter clone was missing exon 2, but contained a 10 bp segment of intron 1. Translation of CYP2A7AS resulted in an in-frame deletion of 51 amino acids. The expression of these cDNAs in COS-7 cells showed that both CYP2A6 and CYP2A7 generated a protein of molecular mass 49 kDa, whereas the protein product of CYP2A7AS was about 44 kDa. Only the CYP2A6 had coumarin hydroxylase activity. The relative level of CYP2A7 and CYP2A7AS mRNA was investigated by reverse transcription followed by PCR (RT-PCR) using human liver RNAs and an RNA sample from a human skin fibroblast cell line. In one of five liver RNAs studied, the aberrantly spliced CYP2A7 mRNA was 3-4-fold more abundant than the normal mRNA. The other samples contained very low levels of this mRNA species. Interestingly, CYP2A7AS mRNA was the major CYP2A7 mRNA detected in the fibroblast cell line. In this case only a protein band of 44 kDa was observed by Western-blot analysis. The relative of mRNA encoding CYP2A6 and CYP2A7 was established in seven human liver samples by RT-PCR and found to range between 1:0.5 and 1:3. These data strength the previous findings that alternative splicing is an important factor in determining the levels of many human P-450s and that this may be subject to tissue-specific effects. Whether in this case the protein product has some function remains to be determined.","['Ding, S', 'Lake, B G', 'Friedberg, T', 'Wolf, C R']","['Ding S', 'Lake BG', 'Friedberg T', 'Wolf CR']","['Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee, Scotland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP2A7 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P450 Family 2)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', '*Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cytochrome P450 Family 2', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Fibroblasts', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection']",1995/02/15 00:00,1995/02/15 00:01,['1995/02/15 00:00'],"['1995/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3060161 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1995 Feb 15;306 ( Pt 1):161-6. doi: 10.1042/bj3060161.,,,,,,,PMC1136496,,,,,,,,,,,

We have found that in the presence of ATP and Mg2+, exogenously added substrates such as phosvitin and poly(Glu4-Tyr) are phosphorylated by intact K562 erythroleukemia, HL60 promyelocytic leukemia, and U937 histiocytic leukemia human cells. Phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that phosvitin, histone H2B, casein, and protamine are phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues, whereas poly(Glu4-Tyr) is phosphorylated on tyrosine. We also present evidence showing that the C9 complement protein, a key component of the membranolytic protein complex of the complement system, is exclusively phosphorylated by the K562 cells on serine residues. Phosphorylation of poly(Glu4-Tyr) is markedly enhanced by Mn2+, whereas C9 phosphorylation is rather inhibited by Mn2+. It is concluded that human leukemic cells express on their surface two types of ecto-PK, one phosphorylating serines and threonines and one specific to tyrosines. The ecto-PKs are spontaneously shed from fully viable cells into the medium in a temperature-dependent manner. Upon sedimentation of cell supernatants at 100,000g, the ecto-PKs are found sedimented with small membrane vesicles. Treatment of intact K562 cells or of released membrane vesicles with bacterial phospholipase C, but not with trypsin or pronase, releases the two types of ecto-PK from the cell or vesicle membrane, respectively. This is accompanied by a marked increase in the released phosphorylating activity. It is, therefore, suggested that these ecto-PKs are either covalently linked to phospholipids or strongly attached to lipid-anchored molecules in the cell surface membrane. Several endogenous proteins in the released membranes are phosphorylated by the ecto-PKs on serines and to a lesser extend on threonines. Two proteins (PTP79 and PTP54) are phosphorylated in a manganese-dependent manner on tyrosines.","['Paas, Y', 'Fishelson, Z']","['Paas Y', 'Fishelson Z']","['Department of Chemical Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9008-96-2 (Phosvitin)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (ectoprotein kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Magnesium/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosvitin/metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(85)71104-6 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1995.1104 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1995 Feb 1;316(2):780-8. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1995.1104.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study examined the roles played by cell birth and cell death rates in generating this paradox. Cell kinetics from BM biopsies of 35 MDS patients were measured using intravenous infusions of either iododeoxyuridine or bromodeoxyuridine, or both. Degree of apoptosis or programmed cell death (PCD) was estimated using in situ end-labeling of DNA directly from BM biopsies, which were simultaneously double-labeled from proliferation/PCD. MDS were found to be highly proliferative disorders with large numbers of myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocytic cells synthesizing DNA. Median cycling time (Tc) of myeloblasts was more rapid than that of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (44.1 hr vs. 56.0 hr). Interestingly, most marrow cells of all three lineages in 32 of 34 evaluable cases were undergoing PCD. In 19 of 32 patients, greater than 75% cells were apoptotic. Surprisingly, large numbers of S-phase cells were found to be simultaneously undergoing PCD, as were stromal cells of the BM microenvironment. We conclude that the extensive apoptosis in hematopoietic cells effectively cancels the high birth rate resulting in ineffective hematopoiesis and accounting for deficient bone marrow function.","['Raza, A', 'Mundle, S', 'Iftikhar, A', 'Gregory, S', 'Marcus, B', 'Khan, Z', 'Alvi, S', 'Shetty, V', 'Dameron, S', 'Wright, V']","['Raza A', 'Mundle S', 'Iftikhar A', 'Gregory S', 'Marcus B', 'Khan Z', 'Alvi S', 'Shetty V', 'Dameron S', 'Wright V', 'et al.']","[""Division of Hematology, Rush Cancer Institute, Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, Illinos 60612.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology/*physiopathology']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830480302 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1995 Mar;48(3):143-54. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830480302.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the testicular sonograms of eight male patients 5-74 years old (mean age, 43 years) with pathologically proved testicular leukemia or lymphoma. All patients presented with testicular enlargement. Gray-scale sonograms were obtained to determine the presence or absence of a mass, focal nodule, or diffuse infiltration, as well as the degree of parenchymal echogenicity. Color Doppler sonography was applied in each case to determine the degree of vascularity compared with normal ipsilateral or contralateral testicular parenchyma. In patients with focal, measurable lesions, the size was correlated with its color Doppler sonographic appearance. RESULTS: Gray-scale sonograms showed either homogeneously hypoechoic testes in patients with diffuse round-cell infiltration or multifocal hypoechoic lesions of various sizes. Five patients had a total of 11 focal lesions that ranged in size from 8 mm to 26 mm in maximum diameter (mean diameter, 16 mm). Color Doppler sonography revealed increased intralesional flow in all areas of lymphomatous or leukemic involvement irrespective of lesion size. CONCLUSION: Our results show that testicular lymphoma and leukemia are hypervascular on color Doppler sonograms regardless of the size of the tumor. Although color Doppler sonography may provide useful information, differentiating round-cell infiltration from inflammatory processes of the testes remains difficult.","['Mazzu, D', 'Jeffrey, R B Jr', 'Ralls, P W']","['Mazzu D', 'Jeffrey RB Jr', 'Ralls PW']","['Department of Radiology, Stanford University Medical Center, CA 94305.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,AJR Am J Roentgenol,AJR.

One view, based on in vitro studies, sees erythroblastosis as the product of a failure in the differentiation of virus-infected stem cells to mature erythrocytes, as a result of cell 'transformation'. The results of some in vivo studies, however, point to a resemblance of the disease to a haemolytic anaemia, where cellular death is an important component. It seems probable that the disease is the result of transformation of cells of the erythroblastic series followed by the death of many of these cells due to influences that have not yet been determined. Determination of the causes of this cellular death may prove to be as important for our understanding of the problem of leukaemia as the work that has already been accomplished in explaining the causes of cell transformation. It is also suggested that the tendency of gs amino acid sequences of the avian leukosis viruses and mouse leukaemia viruses to form fusion proteins with a variety of proto-oncogenes may be part of a wider phenomenon, and that these sequences may fuse with other proteins, altering their properties. More work is required on the possibility that there is an undiscovered immunological component in the progression of the L/S diseases.","['Darcel, C']",['Darcel C'],"['Palliser Animal Health Laboratories Ltd, Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Vet Res Commun,Veterinary research communications,8100520,,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Alpharetrovirus/genetics/immunology', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/genetics/immunology/pathology/*virology', 'Chickens', 'Sarcoma, Avian/*virology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01839290 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Res Commun. 1994;18(5):397-415. doi: 10.1007/BF01839290.,143,,,,,"['erb-A', 'erb-B', 'ets', 'myb', 'myc', 'src']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 5088 men who had worked for at least one year between 1920 and 1991 for any of eight participating companies which produce and distribute hydroelectric power in Norway. The occupational exposure of these workers included extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields. Incident cancer cases identified from the Cancer Registry of Norway were analyzed on the basis of the standardized incidence ratio with the Norwegian male population as reference. RESULTS: The incidence of cancer was close to unity for the cohort. The standardized incidence ratio for lymphoma was below unity, whereas those for leukemia and brain tumors were similar to those expected. Calculated cumulative exposure to electric or magnetic fields was not associated with the incidence of leukemia or brain tumors, but an excess of malignant melanoma was shown for the highest category of magnetic field exposure. An analysis of combined possible exposure to oils containing polychlorinated biphenyls and exposure to magnetic fields or possible exposure to electric sparks gave standardized incidence ratios of 265 and 280, respectively, for the higher exposure category. CONCLUSIONS: These results do not support the assumption of a possible association between exposure to electromagnetic fields and leukemia and brain tumors.

RESULTS: The overall analysis for standardized mortality ratios (SMR) showed a significantly decreased mortality from all causes, mainly due to a deficit of cardiovascular diseases and malignant neoplasms. Nonsignificantly increased risks for esophageal cancer [SMR 241, 90% confidence interval (90% CI) 82-551], brain cancer (SMR 195, 90% CI 77-401) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (SMR 173, 90% CI 47-448) were found for the men; mortality due to lung cancer and leukemia was lower than expected, and no kidney cancer death was recorded. Among the attendants of small stations (characterized by a small number of employees and high sales of gasoline per full-time employee), the SMR values for esophageal cancer (for men SMR 351, 90% CI 120-803) and brain cancer (for men and women SMR 266, 90% CI 105-559) showed increased values. CONCLUSIONS: Filling station attendants are exposed to gasoline vapors and seem at risk of cancer of various sites. Due to the power limitations of this study, however, a precise estimate of the risk for many causes of death was not achievable. Further cohort studies of greater size are warranted.","['Lagorio, S', 'Forastiere, F', 'Iavarone, I', 'Rapiti, E', 'Vanacore, N', 'Perucci, C A', 'Carere, A']","['Lagorio S', 'Forastiere F', 'Iavarone I', 'Rapiti E', 'Vanacore N', 'Perucci CA', 'Carere A']","['National Health Institute, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Finland,Scand J Work Environ Health,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",7511540,['0 (Gasoline)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gasoline/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Population Surveillance']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['1389 [pii]', '10.5271/sjweh.1389 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Work Environ Health. 1994 Oct;20(5):331-8. doi: 10.5271/sjweh.1389.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

K562, an erythroleukemia cell line, was used as a target in a 4 hr 51Cr release assay. 3. Ethanol at 0.3% (V/V) and cortisol at 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 microgram/ml concentrations, added directly to a mixture of effector and target cells significantly suppressed the NK activity of cord blood lymphocytes in a dose dependent fashion, whereas similar concentrations of either EtOH or cortisol did not manifest significant immunoregulatory effects on NK cell activity of normal adult lymphocytes. 4. Pre-treatment of the target with either EtOH or cortisol for 4 hours did not affect cytotoxicity. Inhibition of cytotoxicity was also not due to direct toxicity of effector cells because lymphocytes treated with either EtOH or cortisol showed normal 51Cr release and their viability was comparable to that of untreated control cells. 5. This suggests a selective inhibitory effect of EtOH and cortisol on NK activity of neonatal lymphocytes that may be of clinical significance.","['Nair, M P', 'Kronfol, Z A', 'Greden, J F', 'Chadha, K C', 'Dumaswala, U J', 'Sweet, A M', 'Schwartz, S A']","['Nair MP', 'Kronfol ZA', 'Greden JF', 'Chadha KC', 'Dumaswala UJ', 'Sweet AM', 'Schwartz SA']","['Dept of Medicine, SUNYAB, Buffalo, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,8211617,"['0 (Chromium Radioisotopes)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line', 'Chromium Radioisotopes/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects/immunology', 'Ethanol/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/*pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/blood', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Male']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0278-5846(94)90094-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0278-5846(94)90094-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry. 1994 Dec;18(8):1293-305. doi: 10.1016/0278-5846(94)90094-9.,,,,,"['1RO1 MH 47225/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', '2R01CA 35922/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '51R01 42988/PHS HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such metaphase cells were collected from x-irradiated mice during the period of transformation of some of the normal hematopoietic cells to the fully developed leukemic phenotype. A group of 250 CBA/Ca male mice (10-12 weeks old) were exposed to a single dose of 2 Gy of 250-kilovolt-peak x-rays; 42 age-matched male mice served as controls. Groups of randomly selected mice were sacrificed at 20 hr, 1 week, and then at intervals of 3 months up to 24 months after x-irradiation. Slides for cytogenetic, hematological, and histological examination were prepared for each animal at each sacrifice time. An expansion of cells with lesions on one copy of chromosome 2 was evident in 20-25% of treated mice at each sacrifice time. The majority of such lesions were translocations at 2F or 2H, strongly suggesting hypermutability of these sites on mouse chromosome 2. No lesions were found in control mice. The finding leads to the possibility that genomic lesions close to 2D and 2E are aberrants associated with radiation leukemogenesis, whereas a single clone of cells with a del2(D-E) may lead directly to overt leukemia. The data also indicate that leukemic transformation arises from the cumulative effects of multiple genetic events on chromosome 2, reinforcing the thesis that multiple steps of mutation occur in the pathogenesis of cancer.","['Rithidech, K', 'Bond, V P', 'Cronkite, E P', 'Thompson, M H', 'Bullis, J E']","['Rithidech K', 'Bond VP', 'Cronkite EP', 'Thompson MH', 'Bullis JE']","['Brookhaven National Laboratory, Associated Universities, Inc., Upton, NY 11973-5000.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Animals', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*genetics']",1995/02/14 00:00,1995/02/14 00:01,['1995/02/14 00:00'],"['1995/02/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/14 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.4.1152 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Feb 14;92(4):1152-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.4.1152.,,,,,,,PMC42656,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, the sequence specificity of a lead compound of this series, amonafide, in stimulating DNA cleavage by murine topoisomerase II has been studied. Amonafide-stimulated cleavage intensity patterns were markedly different from those of other antitumor drugs by using pBR322 and SV40 DNAs. This drug had an unusually high site selectivity since about 60% of DNA cleavage was observed at only one site in pBR322 DNA, and at two sites in SV40 DNA. A total of ninety-four drug-stimulated sites were collected, and a statistical analysis of their sequences showed that amonafide highly prefers a cytosine, and excludes guanines and thymines instead, at position -1. A lower preference for an adenine at position +1 was also noted. In agreement with the statistical analysis, the DNA sequences of the three sites stimulated by amonafide at exceptionally high levels showed that the drug requirements of a cytosine (-1) and adenine (+1) were present in both the two strands. In addition, a particular feature of these prominent cleavage sites was the presence of an inverted repeat from position -3 to +7. Comparison of amonafide stimulation of DNA cleavage in oligonucleotides bearing base mutations at positions -2, -3 and/or +6, +7 suggested that DNA sequence, and not a putative cruciform structure, was critical for drug action. Moreover, the results showed that, for strong cleavage stimulation, the primary drug requirements at -1 and +1 positions were not sufficient and that the sequence 5'-WRC decreases A-3' (W, A or T; R, A or G) is required from -3 to +1 positions at both strands. The results suggest that the exceptionally high sequence specificity of amonafide is the result of optimal drug interactions with both the two enzyme subunits.","['De Isabella, P', 'Zunino, F', 'Capranico, G']","['De Isabella P', 'Zunino F', 'Capranico G']","['Division of Experimental Oncology B, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Imides)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Naphthalimides)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '1Q8D39N37L (amonafide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/metabolism', 'Imides/*pharmacology', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Naphthalimides', 'Organophosphonates', '*Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Simian virus 40/genetics']",1995/01/25 00:00,1995/01/25 00:01,['1995/01/25 00:00'],"['1995/01/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/25 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['4c0201 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/23.2.223 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1995 Jan 25;23(2):223-9. doi: 10.1093/nar/23.2.223.,,,,,,,PMC306658,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been reported that wild-type p53 (wt-p53) protein induces apoptosis in leukemia cells. To assess whether p53 is involved in the apoptotic process of normal hematopoietic cells, we introduced the temperature-sensitive p53Val135 mutant into the murine myeloid precursor cell line 32Dcl3. These are diploid, non-tumorigenic cells whose survival and proliferation are dependent upon growth factor supply (IL-3 and serum). Overexpression of wt-p53 protein does not affect morphology and proliferation of 32D cells as long as they are maintained in the presence of IL-3. However, after IL-3 withdrawal, wt-p53 overexpression significantly accelerates apoptosis. This phenomenon is IL-3 specific since no differences in death rates induced by serum starvation are found between parental cells and p53-transfectants. When the latter experiments are carried out at 37 degrees C with p53 protein in mutant conformation, an extended survival of 32D cells is observed after IL-3 deprivation, but not after serum withdrawal. Taken together, these results show that wt-p53 actively mediates the apoptosis due to the absence of specific growth factors, such as IL-3, suggesting that p53 might be involved in the response of myeloid precursors to environmental cytokines for the maintenance of the hematopoietic homeostasis.","['Blandino, G', 'Scardigli, R', 'Rizzo, M G', 'Crescenzi, M', 'Soddu, S', 'Sacchi, A']","['Blandino G', 'Scardigli R', 'Rizzo MG', 'Crescenzi M', 'Soddu S', 'Sacchi A']","['Molecular Oncogenesis Laboratory, Regina Elena Cancer Institute, C.R.S., Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'DNA Damage', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-3/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",1995/02/16 00:00,1995/02/16 00:01,['1995/02/16 00:00'],"['1995/02/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/16 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1995 Feb 16;10(4):731-7.,,,,,,['p53'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that SCL, GATA-1 and GATA-2 are expressed in multipotent progenitors prior to lineage commitment, but are down-regulated during granulocyte/monocyte differentiation. The phenomenon of gene extinction in cell hybrids may reveal negative regulatory mechanisms operating during normal differentiation. We have therefore analysed the regulation of SCL, GATA-1, GATA-2 and GATA-3 in cell hybrids formed by the fusion of cell lines representing different haemopoietic lineages. Expression of GATA-3 was extinguished in both human and murine erythroid x T cell hybrids, an observation which suggests that erythroid cells contain factors capable of repressing GATA-3 expression. By contrast expression of SCL, GATA-1 and GATA-2 was not extinguished in erythroid x T or in erythroid x B cell hybrids. These data suggest that T cells and B cells do not contain trans-acting factors capable of down-regulating expression of SCL, GATA-1 or GATA-2, and therefore raise the possibility that a 'hit and run' mechanism may repress these genes during normal haemopoiesis.

We have previously identified cytidine-rich (C-rich) segments in the human alpha-globin mRNA 3' untranslated region (alpha-3'UTR) which are critical in the maintenance of mRNA stability in transfected erythroid cells. In the present studies, we have detected trans-acting factors which interact with these cis elements to mediate this stabilizing function. A sequence-specific ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex is assembled after incubation of the alpha-3'UTR with a variety of cytosolic extracts. This so-called alpha-complex is sequence specific and is not formed on the 3'UTR of either beta-globin or growth hormone mRNAs. Furthermore, base substitutions within the C-rich stretches which destabilize alpha-globin mRNA in vivo result in a parallel disruption of the alpha-complex in vitro. Competition studies with a series of homoribopolymers reveals a striking sensitivity of alpha-complex formation to poly(C), suggesting the presence of a poly(C)-binding activity within the alpha-complex. Three predominant proteins are isolated by alpha-3'UTR affinity chromatography. One of these binds directly to poly(C). This cytosolic poly(C)-binding protein is distinct from previously described nuclear poly(C)-binding heterogeneous nuclear RNPs and is necessary but not sufficient for alpha-complex formation. These data suggest that a messenger RNP complex formed by interaction of defined segments within the alpha-3'UTR with a limited number of cytosolic proteins, including a potentially novel poly(C)-binding protein, is of functional importance in establishing high-level stability of alpha-globin mRNA.","['Wang, X', 'Kiledjian, M', 'Weiss, I M', 'Liebhaber, S A']","['Wang X', 'Kiledjian M', 'Weiss IM', 'Liebhaber SA']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104-6145.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '30811-80-4 (Poly C)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'DNA Primers', 'Fibroblasts', 'Globins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Growth Hormone/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Point Mutation', 'Poly C/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/*chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleoproteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.15.3.1769 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1995 Mar;15(3):1769-77. doi: 10.1128/MCB.15.3.1769.,,,,,['P60-HL38632/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC230401,,,,,,,,['Mol Cell Biol 1995 Apr;15(4):2331'],,,

Polyclonal antibodies against the alpha and beta subunits of PEBP2 were raised in rabbits and hamsters. Immunofluorescence labeling of NIH 3T3 cells transfected with PEBP2 alpha and -beta cDNAs revealed that the full-size alpha A1 and alpha B1 proteins, the products of two related but distinct genes, are located in the nucleus, while the beta subunit is localized to the cytoplasm. Deletion analysis demonstrated that there are two regions in alpha A1 responsible for nuclear accumulation of the protein: one mapped in the region between amino acids 221 and 513, and the other mapped in the Runt domain (amino acids 94 to 221) harboring the DNA-binding and the heterodimerizing activities. When the full-size alpha A1 and beta proteins are coexpressed in a single cell, the former is present in the nucleus and the latter still remains in the cytoplasm. However, the N- or C-terminally truncated alpha A1 proteins devoid of the region upstream or downstream of the Runt domain colocalized with the beta protein in the nucleus. In these cases, the beta protein appeared to be translocated into the nucleus passively by binding to alpha A1. The chimeric protein containing the beta protein at the N-terminal region generated as a result of the inversion of chromosome 16 colocalized with alpha A1 to the nucleus more readily than the normal beta protein.

A hallmark of neoplastic transformation is the loss of anchorage dependence which usually accompanies the loss of growth factor requirement. The Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase of human leukemias is shown here to abrogate only the anchorage, not the growth factor, requirement. Bcr-Abl-transformed cells grow in soft agar but do not proliferate in serum-free media. Bcr-Abl does not activate the mitogenic pathway, as indicated by its inability to induce enhancers such as the serum response element or the tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate response element (TRE). However, Bcr-Abl can alleviate the anchorage requirement for the induction of the TRE enhancer; i.e., it allows serum to activate the TRE in detached cells. This activity is dependent on the association of an active Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase with the actin filaments. Despite its association with the adapter protein Grb2, Bcr-Abl's effect on the TRE enhancer is not blocked by dominant negative Ras or Raf.

Moreover, neither BSO nor verapamil used alone completely reversed the resistance to DXR of this cell line; their combination was more efficient and increased its drug sensitivity to a level closer to that of the parental counterpart.

To characterize the factor(s) further, we first examined the possibility that products of nonparenchymal cells (NPCs) included in small number in the hepatocyte cultures were involved in the inhibitory activity. We prepared cultures of purified adherent NPCs, mostly Kupffer cells, and sinusoidal endothelial cells, and culture supernatants of NPCs pretreated with IFN-alpha/beta were tested for the inhibitory activity for FLC multiplication. IFN did not induce any inhibitory activity in NPC cultures, whereas LPS-stimulated NPCs cultivated in parallel released several inhibitory factors including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). To explore the possibility that IFN augmented the release of hepatocyte cytosolic proteins, including arginase, we compared the inhibitory activity in culture supernatant of IFN-treated hepatocytes with that found in hepatocyte extract by anion-exchange chromatography. The IFN-induced inhibitory activity was eluted at relatively high salt concentration as a single peak, while the inhibitory activity in hepatocyte extract was co-eluted with arginase at low salt concentration. These results suggested that IFN induced production by hepatocytes of an inhibitor of FLC multiplication.","['Yasui, H', 'Takikawa, O', 'Oku, T', 'Yoshida, R']","['Yasui H', 'Takikawa O', 'Oku T', 'Yoshida R']","['Department of Cell Biology, Osaka Bioscience Institute, Suita, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Interferon Res,Journal of interferon research,8100396,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-beta/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Liver/cytology/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Retroviridae Infections/*therapy', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*therapy']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jir.1994.14.245 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Res. 1994 Oct;14(5):245-50. doi: 10.1089/jir.1994.14.245.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability to enhance drug cytotoxicity with ultrasound would be valuable in creating locally intense chemotherapy while minimizing effects peripheral to the treatment site. The effects of continuous wave ultrasound (US) (985 kHz; 0.5-2.5 W/cm2) were evaluated on cultured HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells alone and with a noncytotoxic DMF dose (0.11 M). The cells were insonified in a configuration that created no cell lysis without the introduction of albumin-stabilized microbubbles into the exposure chamber. When microbubbles were introduced, US with bubbles induced cell lysis, and the presence of DMF significantly increased the lysis induced by ultrasound with bubbles. The necessary presence of microbubbles for the DMF-US synergism to occur suggests that a likely mechanism is acoustic cavitation, initiated by the presence of microbubbles as nuclei. Detection of subharmonics confirmed the presence of cavitation, and cell lysis was well correlated with the subharmonic amplitude. The results show that albumin-stabilized microbubbles, similar to those currently used as US contrast agents, may provide a significant source of nuclei and improve prospects for cancer therapy using acoustic cavitation. The evidence presented supports the hypothesis that cell damage is due to a sonochemical rather than to a sonomechanical process.","['Jeffers, R J', 'Feng, R Q', 'Fowlkes, J B', 'Hunt, J W', 'Kessel, D', 'Cain, C A']","['Jeffers RJ', 'Feng RQ', 'Fowlkes JB', 'Hunt JW', 'Kessel D', 'Cain CA']","['Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48019.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Acoust Soc Am,The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,7503051,['8696NH0Y2X (Dimethylformamide)'],IM,"['Cell Membrane/diagnostic imaging/*drug effects', 'Culture Techniques', 'Dimethylformamide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1121/1.412289 [doi]'],ppublish,J Acoust Soc Am. 1995 Jan;97(1):669-76. doi: 10.1121/1.412289.,,,,,['CA55357-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent advances in the transplantation of human normal and transformed hematopoietic cells into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice provide an opportunity to study the biologic and molecular events that mediate resistance. We studied the engraftment of several human myelogenous leukemia cell lines sensitive and resistant to amsacrine (mAMSA), vincristine, hycamptamine, methotrexate, or doxorubicine (KBM3/AMSA, K562/Vcr, HL60/Hy10, K562/MTX, HL60/Dox). The distribution and growth potential of these cells was evaluated using molecular and histologic techniques. Inoculation of 2 x 10(7) leukemic cells led to manifestation of disease, and subsequent tissue analysis showed evidence of leukemia. The survival of mice varied from 21 to 135 days. Terminally, the animals showed symptoms of wasting, development of local tumors, or both. Massive leukemic dissemination with infiltration of bone marrow and various organs including lungs, spleen, liver, ovaries, and brain was detected in most cases. No differences were observed in the tissue distribution of sensitive as compared to resistant leukemia cells. These findings demonstrated that human leukemic cells retain, in SCID mice, the clinico-pathologic picture of the original disease in humans. The development of numerous drug-resistant phenotypes in vitro does not alter the subsequent behavior of resistant cells in vivo when compared with sensitive counterparts. The levels of resistance are not modified by passage through SCID mice. This model offers an opportunity for developing new preclinical in vivo systems for modulation of drug resistance, and the combination of this in vivo model with gene transfer methods will also provide an important system for testing the molecular alterations involved in drug resistance and leukemic progression.","['Beran, M', 'Pisa, P', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Porwit, A', 'Bjorkholm, M']","['Beran M', 'Pisa P', 'Kantarjian H', 'Porwit A', 'Bjorkholm M']","['Department of Hematology, Karolinska Hospital and Institute Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hematol Pathol,Hematologic pathology,8707764,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA-DQ Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DQ alpha-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DQA1 antigen)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*immunology', 'Female', 'HLA-DQ Antigens/genetics', 'HLA-DQ alpha-Chains', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/immunology/pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Pathol. 1994;8(4):135-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As patient survival has improved, attention has focused on long-range treatment side effects. One such adverse effect, neuropsychological impairment, is incompletely understood. Much of the extant research has been directed at childhood leukemia survivors treated with low-dose whole-brain radiation. Less is known about the effects of high-dose focal or whole-brain radiation used in the treatment of brain lesions. This article reviews the scientific literature in this area, with greatest emphasis on methodologically rigorous studies. Research design considerations are discussed. Review findings suggest that low-dose whole-brain radiation (18 to 24 Gy) in children is associated with mild delayed IQ decline, with more substantial deficits occurring in children treated at a young age. A high incidence of learning disabilities and academic failure is observed in this population and may be caused by poor attention and memory rather than low intellectual level. Children who receive higher dose radiation for treatment of brain tumors experience more pronounced cognitive decline. At higher doses, whole-brain radiation, in particular, is linked to deleterious cognitive outcomes. Remarkably little is known about cognitive outcomes in irradiated adults. Preliminary findings indicate that certain cognitive functions, including memory, may be more vulnerable to decline than others.

Herbimycin a, which effectively reduced intracellular phosphorylation by bcr-abl tyrosine kinase, preferentially inhibited the growth of Ph1-positive leukemia cell lines. Injection of Ph1-positive and -negative leukemia cell lines into mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) resulted in the death of all mice due to leukemia, although the severity of illness varied according to the cell lines used. Administration of herbimycin A significantly enhanced the survival of mice inoculated with the Ph1-positive leukemia cell lines tested but barely affected the survival of mice inoculated with the Ph1-negative leukemia cell lines tested. These results suggest that herbimycin A and related compounds may be useful for the treatment of Ph1-positive leukemia. The disease that developed using the Ph1-positive leukemia cell line NALM-20 resembled human Ph1-positive acute lymphoid leukemia. There was an inverse relationship between the survival time of mice and the number of cells inoculated. The SCID mouse-NALM-20 human leukemia chimera would be a good experimental model for screening tyrosine kinase inhibitors as therapeutic agents against Ph1-positive leukemia.","['Honma, Y', 'Matsuo, Y', 'Hayashi, Y', 'Omura, S']","['Honma Y', 'Matsuo Y', 'Hayashi Y', 'Omura S']","['Department of Chemotherapy, Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Quinones)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzoquinones', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinones/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1995/03/03 00:00,1995/03/03 00:01,['1995/03/03 00:00'],"['1995/03/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/03 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910600519 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1995 Mar 3;60(5):685-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910600519.,,,,,,"['abl', 'bcr', 'bcr-abl', 'c-abl']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the different cell types can easily be identified in vitro by clonal culture assays and simple staining procedures, this leukemia is a useful model for the study of the interactions between different cell compartments in a leukemic clone. Our analysis of the impact of mature leukemic macrophages on the proliferation of stem cells was facilitated by the establishment of long-term cultures producing new stem cells over prolonged periods of time. A prerequisite was the development of an adherent layer of fibroblasts and leukemic macrophages. Enumeration of adherent cells revealed a good correlation between the number of macrophages and the number of stem cells generated, and expansion of the macrophage population by treatment with interleukin 3 (IL-3) resulted in a significant improvement of the culture conditions. Leukemic macrophages were also able to induce the formation of stem-cell colonies in agar culture, suggesting a role for humoral mediators. Antibody neutralization experiments and bioassays identified IL-7 and IL-6 as factors cooperating in the stimulation of stem-cell self-renewal. Feed-back stimulation of leukemic stem cells by mature leukemic cells may also be relevant to human leukemias and have implications for differentiation therapy.","['Duhrsen, U', 'Knieling, G', 'Hossfeld, D K']","['Duhrsen U', 'Knieling G', 'Hossfeld DK']","['Abteilung fur Onkologie und Hamatologie, Universitatskrankenhaus Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1995/03/03 00:00,1995/03/03 00:01,['1995/03/03 00:00'],"['1995/03/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/03 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910600515 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1995 Mar 3;60(5):652-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910600515.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neutralizing MAbs could be developed into immunotherapeutics to reverse clinical intoxications from immunotoxin or to counteract the use of ricin as a terrorist or biological warfare weapon. Two hybridomas, UNIVAX 70 and 138, producing MAbs against ricin were identified by Western blot strip analysis. The antibodies were IgG1 and were specific for the ricin A chain with no ricin B chain cross-reactivity. The MAbs neutralized ricin in vitro in an EL-4 mouse leukemia cell assay and in an in vivo mouse model. The two antibodies recognized the same epitope or overlapping epitopes, based on a competition with one another. All further characterization proceeded on the assumption that they were the same. The MAb UNIVAX 70/138 was characterized in vivo by titrating it against an 18 micrograms/kg (> six LD50) i.v. challenge and by titrating the i.v. toxin challenge against a constant dose of 100 micrograms of passive antibody per mouse. A 4:1 molar ratio of MAb to ricin led to neutralization of > or = 90% of the toxin in vitro. The MAb recognized ricin toxoid prepared by formaldehyde treatment and after conjugation of low molecular weight haptens (based on ELISA) equally as well as it recognized ricin and ricin A chain. The affinity and specificity of UNIVAX 70/138 give it excellent reagent potential, and the toxin-neutralizing capacity makes it at least a log and a half better than the next best candidate immunotherapeutic.","['Lemley, P V', 'Amanatides, P', 'Wright, D C']","['Lemley PV', 'Amanatides P', 'Wright DC']","['Toxinology Division, United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Fort Detrick, Frederick, Maryland 21702-5011.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hybridoma,Hybridoma,8202424,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Toxoids)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Ricin/*immunology', 'Toxoids/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hyb.1994.13.417 [doi]'],ppublish,Hybridoma. 1994 Oct;13(5):417-21. doi: 10.1089/hyb.1994.13.417.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the events leading from the activated receptor to cell lysis are not understood. A prevailing hypothesis postulates induction of so-called 'lysis genes' by the activated receptor. In this study, we show that an activation-deficient glucocorticoid receptor mutant is as effective as the wild-type receptor in repression of AP-1 activity, inhibition of interleukin-2 production, inhibition of c-myc expression and induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that retinoic acid can also induce apoptosis in these cells through the retinoic acid receptor, whose repressive functions but not target site specificity, are similar to those of the glucocorticoid receptor. Therefore, the primary effect of the receptor in glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis correlates with transcriptional repression rather than activation and could be mediated by interference with other transcription factors required for cell survival.","['Helmberg, A', 'Auphan, N', 'Caelles, C', 'Karin, M']","['Helmberg A', 'Auphan N', 'Caelles C', 'Karin M']","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0636.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tretinoin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1995 Feb 1;14(3):452-60.,,,,,['P01-CA 50528/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC398103,,,,,,,,,,,

Under cell-free conditions, no modifications were induced by KBrO3 alone, but extensive DNA damage was observed in the presence of glutathione (GSH). The DNA damage was found to consist mostly of base modifications sensitive to Fpg protein (formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase). HPLC analysis demonstrated that many of the modifications were 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine(8-hydroxyguanine) residues. Single-strand breaks, sites of base loss (AP sites) and base modifications sensitive to endonuclease III (5,6-dihydropyrimidine derivatives) were formed in only low amounts. This 'damage profile' and experiments with various scavengers (catalase, superoxide dismutase, deferoxamine, azide, tert-butanol) and D2O as solvent excluded the involvement of hydroxyl radicals and single oxygen in the damage production, but were consistent with a radical mechanism involving bromine radicals. In L1210 mouse leukemia cells and LLC-PK1 porcine kidney cells, KBrO3 alone gave rise to a DNA damage profile similar to that observed after treatment of cell-free DNA with KBrO3 plus GSH, i.e. base modifications sensitive to Fpg protein were formed in high excess of all other lesions quantified. In LLC-PK1 cells (derived from the target organ of KBrO3-induced carcinogenesis) the level of DNA damage was twice that in the L1210 cells. DNA damage was partially prevented by depletion of intracellular GSH with diethylmaleate, indicating that GSH played an activating role in the cells similar to that seen under cell-free conditions. The Fpg-sensitive base modifications induced by KBrO3 were repaired with only moderate efficiency (38 +/- 10% of the lesions were still present after 18 h in full medium) under conditions that did not influence cell proliferation.","['Ballmaier, D', 'Epe, B']","['Ballmaier D', 'Epe B']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Wurburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Bromates)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '04MB35W6ZA (potassium bromate)', '3352-57-6 (Hydroxyl Radical)', '5614-64-2 (8-hydroxyguanine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'SBV4XY874G (Bromine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bromates/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Bromine/metabolism/toxicity', 'Carcinogens/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Cattle', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cells, Cultured', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Viral/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Free Radical Scavengers', 'Free Radicals', 'Glutathione/toxicity', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis', 'Hydroxyl Radical/metabolism/toxicity', 'Kidney/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism/toxicity']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/16.2.335 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1995 Feb;16(2):335-42. doi: 10.1093/carcin/16.2.335.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rev. Immunol. 4:419-470]. Receptor crosslinking also induces phosphorylation of the light and heavy chains of myosin II with kinetics similar to that of secretion [Ludowyke et al., 1989: J. Biol. Chem. 264:12492-12501]. Here we show that myosin II localization changes after activation with similar kinetics. Furthermore, these changes are coincident with changes in cell shape and increase in motile activity induced by activation. Within 2 min, activated cells begin to flatten, spread on their substratum, and extend lamellipodia which show active ruffling. Quantitation of the extent of cell spreading from video micrographs shows that 48% of the cells increase significantly in surface area by 5 min and 71% by 15 min. Myosin II is uniformly distributed in unactivated cells but is deficient in newly formed lamellipodia that start to appear at 2 min after activation. In contrast these lamellipodia show strong staining for actin. Further changes in myosin organization are detected by 15 min after activation when myosin reappears in the cell periphery, is concentrated in the perinuclear area, and is also organized in punctate linear arrays that extend from the nucleus to the cell periphery. The kinetics of the early cell shape changes and formation of the myosin-deficient lamellipodia correlate well with, and may relate to, the increase in the level of myosin II phosphorylation reported by Ludowyke et al. [1989: J. Biol. Chem. 264:12492-12501]. Changes in the distribution of cell surface-bound IgE also occur upon antigen activation, and they correlate with the myosin distribution in a manner that suggests that they may be driven by myosin II.","['Spudich, A']",['Spudich A'],"['Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Motil Cytoskeleton,Cell motility and the cytoskeleton,8605339,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '17466-45-4 (Phalloidine)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)']",IM,"['Actins/analysis/ultrastructure', 'Animals', 'Cell Membrane/ultrastructure', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Size', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/chemistry/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Microscopy, Video', 'Myosins/*analysis/ultrastructure', 'Phalloidine/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cm.970290407 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Motil Cytoskeleton. 1994;29(4):345-53. doi: 10.1002/cm.970290407.,,,,,"['GM46551/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'MH 45324/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Liposome-encapsulated clodronate (dichloromethylene bisphosphonate) also is known to inactivate phagocytic cells in vivo, and inhibit the growth of macrophage-like RAW 264 cells in vitro. The macrophage suppressive effect of liposomal clodronate is of interest in autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis, in which phagocytic cells are involved in inflammatory processes. Earlier in vivo studies suggested that liposomal clodronate is a far more potent inactivator of macrophages than liposomal forms of two other bisphosphonate compounds, pamidronate (3-amino-1-hydroxypropylidene bisphosphonate), and etidronate (1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate). We examined the growth inhibitory properties of these three bisphosphonates with macrophage-like RAW 264 cells and with other types of cells in vitro. All three bisphosphonates encapsulated in liposomes effectively inhibited the growth of RAW 264 and CV1-P cells, while free drugs were 20-1000 times less potent growth inhibitors. Also, high extracellular calcium concentrations enhanced the potency of bisphosphonates for RAW 264 cells, indicating that, in addition to liposomes, the uptake of bisphosphonates by macrophages is mediated also by calcium. In all formulations, pamidronate was the most potent compound for the cells, with the exception of CV1-P cells, for which liposomal clodronate was the most potent. The effects of liposomal drugs were selective for highly endocytotic cells. The results suggest that liposome-encapsulated bisphosphonates could provide a specific tool to affect the function of macrophages and all three of these bisphosphonates are potentially effective as macrophage suppressors in autoimmune diseases.","['Monkkonen, J', 'Taskinen, M', 'Auriola, S O', 'Urtti, A']","['Monkkonen J', 'Taskinen M', 'Auriola SO', 'Urtti A']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Kuopio, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Drug Target,Journal of drug targeting,9312476,"['0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0813BZ6866 (Clodronic Acid)', 'M2F465ROXU (Etidronic Acid)', 'OYY3447OMC (Pamidronate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Clodronic Acid/administration & dosage/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Delayed-Action Preparations', 'Diphosphonates/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Carriers', 'Etidronic Acid/administration & dosage/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Leukemia', 'Liposomes', 'Macrophages/cytology/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Pamidronate', 'Phagocytes/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10611869409015910 [doi]'],ppublish,J Drug Target. 1994;2(4):299-308. doi: 10.3109/10611869409015910.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tetrandrine (TET, a Ca2+ antagonist of Chinese herbal origin) and thapsigargin (TSG, an endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump inhibitor) concentration-dependently mobilized Ca2+ from intracellular stores of HL-60 cells, with EC50 values of 20 microM and 0.8 nM, respectively. After intracellular Ca2+ release by 30 nM TSG, there was no more discharge of Ca2+ by TET (100 microM), and vice versa. 2. Pretreatments with 100 nM rauwolscine (alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist), 100 nM prazosin (alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist), 10 nM phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, a protein kinase C activator) or 100 nM staurosporine (a protein kinase C inhibitor) had no effect on 100 microM TET-induced intracellular Ca2+ release. 3. After intracellular Ca2+ release by 30 nM TSG in Ca(2+)-free medium, readmission of Ca2+ caused a substantial and sustained extracellular Ca2+ entry. The latter was almost completely inhibited by 100 microM TET (IC50 of 20 microM) added just before Ca2+ readmission. In Ca(2+)-containing medium, 30 nM TSG caused a sustained phase of cytosolic Ca2+ elevation, which could be abolished by 100 microM TET. TET was also demonstrated to retard basal entry of extracellular Mn2+ and completely inhibit TSG-stimulated extracellular Mn2+ entry. 4. TSG-induced extracellular Ca2+ entry was insensitive to the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, nifedipine (1 microM), but was completely inhibited by the non-selective Ca2+ channel blocker La3+ (300 microM). Depolarization with 100 mM KCl did not raise the cytosolic Ca2+ level. 5.

Nevertheless, the most part of applications consists in stand-alone systems, concerning a very limited domain. On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence research has outlined Blackboard Architectures as the basis for building expert systems in which several knowledge sources, in general built with different formalisms, cooperate to the solution of a complex task. This paper addresses the use of influence diagrams as knowledge sources of such a system, and particularly faces the problem of reusing the same influence diagram in different inference phases. We will show that, specially in planning tasks, the modularity requirement of keeping the knowledge sources separated, may imply that an influence diagram must call another influence diagram to solve itself and to maintain the coherence of the whole set of decisions underlying the plan. Conditions for the correctness of this concatenation of knowledge sources will be provided, and an example from the medical domain of therapy planning for Acute Myeloid Leukemia will be shown, as an implemented prototype exploiting these ideas.","['Bellazzi, R', 'Quaglini, S']","['Bellazzi R', 'Quaglini S']","['Dipartimento di Informatica e Sistemistica, Universita di Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Artif Intell Med,Artificial intelligence in medicine,8915031,"['83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/blood/therapeutic use', '*Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Cyclosporine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Expert Systems', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/therapy', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood', 'Models, Biological', '*Neural Networks, Computer', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Prognosis', 'Sex Factors', 'Systems Integration']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0933-3657(94)90026-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Artif Intell Med. 1994 Dec;6(6):483-500. doi: 10.1016/0933-3657(94)90026-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results indicate that distinct populations of donor T cells respond to recipient leukaemic and non-leukaemic cells, and provide the basis for a clinically applicable technique to selectively deplete donor GVHD reacting cells while conserving GVL.","['Datta, A R', 'Barrett, A J', 'Jiang, Y Z', 'Guimaraes, A', 'Mavroudis, D A', 'van Rhee, F', 'Gordon, A A', 'Madrigal, A']","['Datta AR', 'Barrett AJ', 'Jiang YZ', 'Guimaraes A', 'Mavroudis DA', 'van Rhee F', 'Gordon AA', 'Madrigal A']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1994 Oct;14(4):517-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Australian Leukemia Study Group.,79-84,"The aim of this study was to assess the influence of dose and dose intensity (DI) of induction and consolidation chemotherapy on relapse rates in 264 de novo patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Patients were randomised to receive cytosine arabinoside (ARAC) 100 mg/m2 continuous infusion for 7 days and daunorubicin (DNR) 50 mg/m2 IV day 1-3 (7-3) or the same drugs with the addition of etoposide 75 mg/m2 IV days 1-7 (7-3-7). Cox proportional hazards regression models were used throughout to identify prognostic factors, including dose delivery parameters, influencing the rate of relapse. Of 152 patients who achieved a complete remission (CR), 104 have relapsed with a median duration of CR of 15.8 months. Actual dose delivered was prospectively documented. Cox regression analysis identified the most significant prognostic factors jointly influencing duration of CR as performance status groups (p < 0.0001), percentage peripheral blasts (p = 0.0015), 7-3-7 arm (p = 0.0075), age < 40 years (p = 0.022) and induction dose ARA-C plus DNR (p = 0.029). In this analysis patients randomized to the 7-3-7 arm had an estimated 43% reduction in the relapse rate and each 10% reduction of doses ARA-C and DNR was associated with an estimated 45% increase in the relapse rate. The number of induction courses, delays in treatment and induction dose intensity did not significantly influence the duration of CR nor did any of the consolidation treatment parameters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Bishop, J F', 'Matthews, J P', 'Young, G', 'Szer, J', 'Joshua, D E', 'Dodds, A', 'Laidlaw, C R', 'Cobcroft, R', 'Herrman, R', 'Ma, D']","['Bishop JF', 'Matthews JP', 'Young G', 'Szer J', 'Joshua DE', 'Dodds A', 'Laidlaw CR', 'Cobcroft R', 'Herrman R', 'Ma D', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409051681 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Sep;15(1-2):79-84. doi: 10.3109/10428199409051681.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is thought to be due to both clinical and biological factors, such as high white blood cell (WBC) counts at diagnosis, irregular or immature phenotypes, and molecular and cytogenetical abnormalities. In order to focus the significance of immunophenotypic analysis, we have reviewed the immunophenotypic studies of 145 infants under 18 months of age treated at the AIEOP centers from 1984 to 1992. Children have been divided in three age groups of six months each; WBC count at diagnosis has been evaluated both as mean values and within different categories (< 10.10(9)/L, > 100.10(9)/L). These have been studied in correlation with immunophenotype and with the expression of single, specific markers. A significant correlation has been found between young age, high WBC count and immature phenotypes. Common ALL was more frequent in older children and showed lower WBC counts. Moreover, event-free survival was significantly better in older children with WBC count < 100.00/mm3, with CD10+, MyAg- ALL. Therefore, we suggest that immunophenotypic analysis is still an important prognostic factor and can be usefully used, together with simple clinical data, to plan therapy for ALL in infants.","['Basso, G', 'Rondelli, R', 'Covezzoli, A', 'Putti, M']","['Basso G', 'Rondelli R', 'Covezzoli A', 'Putti M']","['Dipartimento di Pediatria, University of Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Life Tables', 'Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Male', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409051677 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Sep;15(1-2):51-60. doi: 10.3109/10428199409051677.,66,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA degradation provides a convenient way to quantify apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Extensive apoptosis can be induced rapidly in undifferentiated HL-60 cells without prevention by cycloheximide or actinomycin D. Therefore, HL-60 cells appear to express constitutively the apoptotic machinery that may be kept under control of a yet unknown repressor. The absence of the tumor suppressor p53 and the presence of bcl-2 are in contrast with the sensitivity of these cells to apoptosis. Agents that modify chromatin structure (zinc, poly[ADPribose] inhibitors, spermine) can block DNA fragmentation without affecting cell survival. By contrast macrophage-like differentiation by phorbol esters suppresses apoptosis without affecting topoisomerase-induced DNA damage. Better understanding of the apoptotic regulation in the widely used and characterized HL-60 cell line should allow the identification of new mechanisms and parameters of cellular sensitivity and resistance to the cytotoxic activity of anticancer agents.","['Solary, E', 'Bertrand, R', 'Pommier, Y']","['Solary E', 'Bertrand R', 'Pommier Y']","['Laboratory of Oncohematology, University of Medicine, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromatin/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/physiology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency/genetics/physiology']",1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199409051674 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Sep;15(1-2):21-32. doi: 10.3109/10428199409051674.,140,,,,,"['bcl-2', 'p53']",,,,,,,,,,,,

FISH documented that 6/42 patients with CLL in fact had trisomy 12 in 15-49% interphase cells. Sequential FISH studies were performed in 2 cases, showing an increase of percentage of trisomic cells over a 2-month to 4-year period. Two out of 10 patients with HCL, one of whom had morphologic features consistent with a diagnosis of HCL variant, showed 5.5 and 10% interphase nuclei with three fluorescent signals, a finding suggestive of the presence of trisomy 12. Combined immunophenotyping and FISH staining in these patients with HCL documented that trisomic cells were CD11c-positive, CD13-negative, and CD2-negative.

At a median follow-up of 25 months (range, 0.6 to 66), the cumulative probability of 2-year overall and disease-free survival (DFS) of all 85 patients is 75% (95% confidence interval [CI] 64% to 84%) and 58% (95% CI 47% to 69%), respectively. Three independent prognostic variables were identified by univariate analysis: number of prior chemotherapy regimens, prior radiotherapy, and extranodal disease at ABMT. Multivariate stepwise Cox regression identified the number of prior chemotherapy regimens as the only significant prognostic factor predicting for both relapse and DFS. There were no significant differences in the outcome of the treatment between the two preparative regimens. Our results confirm that high-dose therapy and ABMT is an effective therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory HD. Earlier transplantation is recommended before the development of drug resistance and end organ damage that results from repeated attempts of salvage therapy.","['Nademanee, A', ""O'Donnell, M R"", 'Snyder, D S', 'Schmidt, G M', 'Parker, P M', 'Stein, A S', 'Smith, E P', 'Molina, A', 'Stepan, D E', 'Somlo, G']","['Nademanee A', ""O'Donnell MR"", 'Snyder DS', 'Schmidt GM', 'Parker PM', 'Stein AS', 'Smith EP', 'Molina A', 'Stepan DE', 'Somlo G', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68819-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Mar 1;85(5):1381-90.,,,,,"['CA 30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Characterization of the two genes involved in the inv(16)(p13q22), CBF beta and MYH11, has allowed the detection of fusion transcripts by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We have analyzed CBF beta-MYH11 fusion transcripts by RT-PCR in myelomonocytic leukemias, with or without eosinophilia, to determine whether their presence correlates with morphology. Fifty-three cases (11 AML M4Eo; 1 AML M4 with atypical abnormal eosinophils (AML M4 ""Eo""); 29 AML M4; 8 AML M5; 3 CMML; and 1 AML M2 with eosinophilia) were analyzed. All 11 typical AML M4Eo were CBF beta-MYH11 positive. The single case of AML M4 with distinctive eosinophil abnormalities was negative by karyotype, RT-PCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Three of 29 (10%) AML M4 without abnormal eosinophils were CBF beta-MYH11 positive, 1 of which did not show any apparent chromosome 16 abnormalities by classical metaphase analysis (2 not tested). Both cases tested also showed MYH11 genomic rearrangement. None of the other leukemias were RT-PCR positive. Follow-up of three patient showed residual positivity in apparent complete remission. These data show that CBF beta-MYH11 fusion transcripts occur not only in the vast majority of typical AML M4Eo, but also in approximately 10% of AML M4 without eosinophilic abnormalities, a much higher incidence than the sporadic reports of chromosome 16 abnormalities in AML M4 would suggest. Taken together with the detection of CBF beta-MYH11 transcripts in the absence of apparent chromosome 16 abnormalities by classical banding techniques, these data show that additional screening by either RT-PCR or FISH should be performed in all AML M4, regardless of morphologic features, to allow accurate evaluation of the prognostic importance of this fusion transcript.","['Poirel, H', 'Radford-Weiss, I', 'Rack, K', 'Troussard, X', 'Veil, A', 'Valensi, F', 'Picard, F', 'Guesnu, M', 'Leboeuf, D', 'Melle, J']","['Poirel H', 'Radford-Weiss I', 'Rack K', 'Troussard X', 'Veil A', 'Valensi F', 'Picard F', 'Guesnu M', 'Leboeuf D', 'Melle J', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, CHU Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RUNX2 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*ultrastructure', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Eosinophils/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/classification/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myosins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68809-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Mar 1;85(5):1313-22.,,,,,,"['AML1', 'CBF&Bgr;', 'MYH11', 'PEBP2&Bgr;']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To define the pattern of Prh expression within the human hematopoietic system, we have analyzed its constitutive expression in purified cells obtained from normal hematopoietic tissues, its levels of transcription in a number of leukemia/lymphoma cell lines representing different lineages and stages of hematolymphopoietic differentiation, and its regulation during in vitro maturation of human leukemic cell lines. Prh transcripts were not detected in leukemic cells of T-lymphoid lineage, irrespective of their maturation stage, and in resting or activated normal T cells from peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues. In contrast, high levels of Prh expression were shown in cells representing early stages of B lymphoid maturation, being maintained up to the level of circulating and tissue mature B cells. Terminal B-cell differentiation appeared to be conversely associated with the deactivation of the gene, since preplasmacytic and plasmocytoma cell lines were found not to express Prh mRNA. Prh transcripts were also shown in human cell lines of early myelomonocytic, erythromegakaryocytic, and preosteoclast phenotypes. Prh expression was lost upon in vitro differentiation of leukemic cell lines into mature monocyte-macrophages and megakaryocytes, whereas it was maintained or upregulated after induction of maturation to granulocytes and osteoclasts. Accordingly, circulating normal monocytes did not display Prh mRNA, which was conversely detected at high levels in purified normal granulocytes. Our data, which show that the acquisition of the differentiated phenotype is associated to Prh downregulation in certain hematopoietic cells but not in others, also suggest that a dysregulated expression of this gene might contribute to the process of leukemogenesis within specific cell lineages.","['Manfioletti, G', 'Gattei, V', 'Buratti, E', 'Rustighi, A', 'De Iuliis, A', 'Aldinucci, D', 'Goodwin, G H', 'Pinto, A']","['Manfioletti G', 'Gattei V', 'Buratti E', 'Rustighi A', 'De Iuliis A', 'Aldinucci D', 'Goodwin GH', 'Pinto A']","['Dipartimento di Biochimica, Biofisica Chimica delle Macromolecole, Universita di Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HHEX protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', '*Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)68799-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Mar 1;85(5):1237-45.,,,,,,"['HB24', 'HB9', 'HOX', 'HOX A', 'HOX B', 'HOX C', 'HOX11', 'Prh', 'c-myb']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group.,1202-6,"We conducted a multicenter trial of treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in the AML-92 study and compared it with our previous study with standard intensive chemotherapy, the AML-89 study, in the view of complete remission (CR) rate, incidence of early death, and event-free survival (EFS). Patients were scheduled to receive oral ATRA 45 mg/m2 daily until CR. If patients had leukocyte counts above 3 x 10(9)/L at the start of therapy, they received daunorubicine (DNR) 40 mg/m2 for 3 days and behenoyl cytosine arabinoside (BHAC) 200 mg/m2 for 5 days in addition to ATRA. During the ATRA therapy, if patients showed myeloblast plus promyelocyte counts higher than 1 x 10(9)/L in the peripheral blood, they received additional DNR and BHAC in the same schedule, as well. A total of 110 patients were entered into the study. Median age was 43 years (range, 16 to 74). Twenty-eight (26%) of 109 patients (one died before the start of therapy) received ATRA alone. Ninety-seven patients (89%) achieved CR; 48 of 49 (98%) aged less than 40 years, 44 of 52 (84%) aged between 40 and 69, and 5 of 8 (63%) aged above 70 achieved CR, respectively; 25 of 28 (89%) with ATRA alone, 46 of 51 (90%) with ATRA plus initial chemotherapy and 26 of 30 (87%) with ATRA plus later chemotherapy attained CR, respectively. Nine (8%) patients died within 28 days after the start of therapy. In contrast, 44 of 62 patients (71%) attained CR, and 13 (21%) died within 28 days in the AML-89 study with the combination of DNR, BHAC, 6-mercaptopurine and prednisolone. Seven developed retinoic acid syndrome and one died of it in the present study. Other toxicities associated with this drug included cheilitis, desquamation, muscle pain, and hypertriglyceridemia. Predicted 23 months EFS for all ATRA-treated patients and disease-free survival (DFS) in the CR cases were 75% and 81%, respectively, in a median follow-up period of 21 months. Compared to the AML-89 study, there was a highly significant difference in remission rate (P = .004), EFS (P = .0007), and also early mortality rate (P = .02).

Results have improved modestly with more intensive postremission chemotherapy and with tailoring of protocols in individuals with specific subsets of ALL. The use of growth factors may further improve treatment results. The performance of allogeneic BMT in first remission is clearly effective in some individuals, eg, those with Ph1-positive ALL, but it is unclear whether it is advantageous in most individuals. There are little data supporting the effectiveness of autotransplantation, as currently performed in ALL, despite its theoretical potential. Advances in understanding the biology of ALL have led to new approaches currently under basic and clinical investigation. These include serial studies of minimal residual disease by a variety of techniques to tailor treatment, the development of conjugated MoAbs to lymphoid cell antigens and immunologic and biochemical approaches to chimeric RNA and peptides generated by abnormal fusion genes. It seems likely that substantial improvement in the treatment of adult ALL awaits better characterization of the biology of this disease.

Two of the four patients with chemotherapy-induced remission had detectable PML-RAR alpha only before treatment.

Two patients were resistant to chemotherapy and achieved remission by all-trans-retinoic acid; PML-RAR alpha was detectable in them for a few months during consolidation chemotherapy.

It has an important role in regulation of the balance of cell proliferation and cell death. The pharmacologic manipulation of apoptosis offers new possibilities for the prevention and treatment of cancer. One of the independent prognostic factors in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the sensitivity of the leukemic cells to corticosteroids. Apoptosis after glucocorticoid therapy is suggested as a prognostic factor in children with leukemia. Peripheral blood of children with acute leukemia was taken for morphologic and flow cytometric studies before and after the onset of prednisolone monotherapy. In most of the cases a positive correlation was observed between the decrease of blast numbers and the increase in apoptotic ratio in peripheral blood.

Cyclophosphamide (CP) is a cytostatic drug widely used in the treatment of haematological malignancies and solid tumours. Because CP requires bioactivation to become cytotoxic, an in vivo approach was chosen to generate a subline of the Brown Norway rat acute myelocytic leukaemia (BNML/CPR) highly resistant to CP to serve as a model to investigate the molecular mechanism(s) of cyclophosphamide resistance. The role of the CP-detoxifying enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) in the molecular mechanism of CP resistance in this subline of the BNML has been investigated. Compared to the parent BNML cell line, the BNML/CPR cell line displayed an approximately 6-fold higher level of ALDH enzyme activity. Pretreatment of leukaemic rats with the ALDH inhibitor disulfiram resulted in a restoration of CP sensitivity of animals carrying the BNML/CPR cells. Furthermore, in vitro incubation of BNML/CPR cells with disulfiram prior to incubation with the activated CP derivative mafosfamide resulted in an extra 2-3 log cell kill as indicated by the survival time of rats which were injected with disulfiram pretreated BNML/CPR cells compared to non-pretreated BNML/CPR cells. Data on the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) isozyme profiles of cytoplasmic liver and spleen extracts of BNML- and BNML/CPR-carrying leukaemic rats indicated that the total GST enzyme amount was lower in BNML/CPR cells than in parent BNML cells.

Molecular methods utilizing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect BCR/ABL mRNA transcripts has been useful for detecting minimal residual disease (MRD) after treatment, as well as for establishing the diagnosis of CML. Amplification-based assays for the BCR/ABL transcript, however, have shown variable reproducibility and sensitivity. This variability may be largely due to technical differences and insufficient controls. In this report, we describe the development of a highly controlled, reproducible, and sensitive PCR assay to detect Ph1 that is well suited to clinical and research applications. A validation study of 82 samples was performed consisting of 25 dilutions of K562 cells (Ph1+) into normal cultured B cells, 26 pre- and post-transplant peripheral blood samples from CML patients, 16 peripheral blood samples for diagnosis of CML, and 15 peripheral blood samples from healthy individuals. RNA isolated from 3 to 5 million leukocytes was reverse transcribed (RT) and amplified by nested primer PCR. The products were characterized using agarose gel electrophoresis. Approximately 1000 Ph1-positive cells admixed with 10(6) normal cells were detectable after one round of amplification. In 60% of assays where one Ph1-positive cell was admixed with 10(6) normal cells, a BCR/ABL product was detectable after nested primer PCR. Specific measures to ensure accurate results in routine testing included (a) assessing RNA integrity and adequate cDNA preparation by detection of the constitutively expressed ABL mRNA, (b) monitoring sensitivity with the addition and detection of K562 RNA mixed with RNA from unknown samples (failure to detect the ""spiked"" K562 RNA indicates the presence of inhibitors or ribonucleases within the unknown RNA sample), (c) detection of nucleic acid contaminants by using negative controls in every assay, and (d) duplicate analysis of all samples and controls. Internally, this assay was 100% reproducible. Our results verify that nested primer RT-PCR is a fast, sensitive alternative to cytogenetic or Southern blot analysis for monitoring MRD after treatment and for diagnosis of CML. In addition, the highly controlled detection scheme presented here can be used as a general model for the development of other amplification-based detection assays.","['Hessner, M J', 'Roth, M S', 'Drobyski, W R', 'Baxter-Lowe, L A']","['Hessner MJ', 'Roth MS', 'Drobyski WR', 'Baxter-Lowe LA']","['Blood Center of Southeastern Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53233.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Genet Anal Tech Appl,"Genetic analysis, techniques and applications",9004550,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['1050-3862(94)90045-0 [pii]', '10.1016/1050-3862(94)90045-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Genet Anal Tech Appl. 1994;11(4):90-4. doi: 10.1016/1050-3862(94)90045-0.,,,,,['R29DK43470/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],['BCR/ABL'],,,,,,,,,,,,

These proteins exhibit overlapping biological properties and with the exception of G-CSF, they all appear to utilize gp130 as a signaling component of their high affinity receptor complexes. Recently it has been demonstrated that monomeric, membrane bound gp130 can directly bind OM. To further investigate the binding properties of gp130 we generated a soluble form of gp130, sgp130-Rg, to investigate potential gp130 interactions with OM and other members of this cytokine family. Using chemical crosslinking techniques we demonstrate that OM and LIF but not CNTF or IL-6 directly interact with sgp130-Rg. Since OM signaling can be prevented by binding gp130 with anti gp130 mAbs we also investigated the potential of sgp130-Rg to prevent the biological activities of both LIF and OM. Here we demonstrate that sgp130-Rg can bind LIF and OM preventing their biological activities on the TF-1 erythroleukemia cell line. This property suggests that sgp130-Rg may have therapeutic value in the specific prevention of LIF or OM mediated pathologies.","['Modrell, B', 'Liu, J', 'Miller, H', 'Shoyab, M']","['Modrell B', 'Liu J', 'Miller H', 'Shoyab M']","['Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Seattle, WA 98121.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Growth Factors,"Growth factors (Chur, Switzerland)",9000468,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, CD', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines', 'Growth Inhibitors/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nerve Growth Factors/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transfection/methods']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08977199409001050 [doi]'],ppublish,Growth Factors. 1994;11(2):81-91. doi: 10.3109/08977199409001050.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once fully differentiated, blood neutrophils are programmed to die rapidly and are removed by tissue macrophages. In normal myeloid cells, the death mechanism seems to be coupled to the differentiation pathway and is accomplished by a process termed apoptosis. In the present study, we have examined the role of Bcl-2 in the differentiation pathways of the promyelocytic cell line HL-60. Treatment of HL-60 with retinoic acid or phorbol ester, which induced neutrophil or macrophage-like cell differentiation, respectively, resulted in progressive loss of cellular viability and internucleosomal DNA degradation. In HL-60, differentiation and apoptosis were coupled to down-regulation of the Bcl-2 protein. Overexpression of Bcl-2 by gene transfer inhibited apoptosis triggered by terminal differentiation of HL-60. Yet, Bcl-2 did not alter the expression of surface markers or other phenotypic changes that are induced upon myeloid differentiation. In contrast to HL-60, another immature myeloid cell line, K562, did not produce Bcl-2 but expressed a related protein, Bcl-xL, that functions as a repressor of apoptotic cell death. K562 has been shown to be relatively resistant to a variety of apoptotic stimuli. Incubation of HL-60 and K562 with inhibitors of macromolecular synthesis induced apoptosis, which appeared earlier in HL-60 than in K562. Interestingly, Bcl-2 overexpression protected K562 cells from apoptosis induced by inhibitor of macromolecular synthesis but it had little or no effect on HL-60 cells. We conclude that although differentiation and apoptosis proceed simultaneously, they can be uncoupled by expression of Bcl-2. Down-regulation of Bcl-2 appears to be part of the differentiation pathway and may serve to facilitate the apoptotic response.","['Benito, A', 'Grillot, D', 'Nunez, G', 'Fernandez-Luna, J L']","['Benito A', 'Grillot D', 'Nunez G', 'Fernandez-Luna JL']","['Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Plasmids', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1995 Feb;146(2):481-90.,,,,,,['Bcl-x'],PMC1869853,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, 20 cases of paraffin-embedded T cell lymphomas and 5 cases of reactive hyperplasia were also studied. Clonal TCR-gamma rearrangements were identified on DGGE by the presence of a predominant band. Results obtained from 5 T cell lines and 12 lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas containing known TCR-gamma gene rearrangements revealed 100% concordance in detecting clonal rearrangements between DGGE and traditional Southern blot analysis. Of the remaining 34 lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma cases studied by DGGE alone, 30 were positive. DGGE analysis of 10 lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma cases with known group IV gamma to J gamma 1 or J gamma 2 rearrangement sequences confirmed that the electrophoretic migration was dependent on the tumor-specific rearranged TCR-gamma sequence. In addition, 17 of 20 cases of paraffin-embedded T cell lymphomas were positive by DGGE, 6 of which had the clonal population also identified in fresh tissue DNA.

In vitro studies have shown enhanced proliferation of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells in response to IL-7. On the other hand, tumor cell lines transfected with a functioning IL-7 gene and subsequently transplanted into mice resulted in a prominent inflammatory infiltrate and reduced tumorigeneicity. These data suggest an important role of this cytokine in the pathophysiology of lymphoid neoplasms. Because little is known about the in vivo expression of this cytokine in various neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions of the lymphoid system, we examined frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue samples of normal, reactive, and malignant lymphoid lesions using in situ hybridization with a 35S-labeled RNA probe specific for IL-7. Tumor cells of nodular sclerosing and mixed cellularity type of Hodgkin's disease displayed IL-7-specific signals in 24 of 31 cases. Among reactive lesions, only thymic tissue showed labeling within both cortex and medulla (4 of 7 cases), whereas in tonsils clear-cut IL-7-specific signals could not be found. Tissues infiltrated by B-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia or T- or B-type lymphoblastic lymphoma showed cytokine-specific signals in only one case of lymphoblastic lymphoma in rare reactive cells. In conjunction with the finding of elevated levels of IL-7 in the serum of many patients with Hodgkin's disease, our data suggest an important role of this cytokine in the pathogenesis of Hodgkin's disease. The prominent reactive infiltrate observed in most cases of Hodgkin's disease could be a consequence of elevated local levels of this cytokine as similar infiltrates are also observed in tumors in mice resulting from injection of tumor cell lines transfected with a functioning IL-7 gene.","['Foss, H D', 'Hummel, M', 'Gottstein, S', 'Ziemann, K', 'Falini, B', 'Herbst, H', 'Stein, H']","['Foss HD', 'Hummel M', 'Gottstein S', 'Ziemann K', 'Falini B', 'Herbst H', 'Stein H']","['Institute of Pathology, Benjamin Franklin Clinic, Free University of Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-7/analysis/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology', 'Palatine Tonsil/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Thymus Gland/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1995 Jan;146(1):33-9.,,,,,,,PMC1870751,,,,,,,,,,,

Results suggest that the time of exposure may be an additional factor (along with field strength, and perhaps frequency) in ascertaining the safety of EMF exposure.","['Marino, A A']",['Marino AA'],"['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Louisiana State University Medical Center, Shreveport 71130-3932.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am Ind Hyg Assoc J,American Industrial Hygiene Association journal,0371160,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],IM,"['Blood/*radiation effects', 'Blood Cell Count/radiation effects', 'Cohort Studies', '*Electromagnetic Fields/adverse effects', 'Erythrocyte Count/radiation effects', 'Headache/etiology', 'Hemoglobins/analysis/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count/radiation effects', 'Male', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Radar', 'Radio Waves', 'Time Factors']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15428119591017231 [doi]'],ppublish,Am Ind Hyg Assoc J. 1995 Feb;56(2):189-92. doi: 10.1080/15428119591017231.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out on 21,135 patients included in the Bone Marrow Study Registry of the Jimenez Diaz Foundation along 35 years (1959-1993). The data were grouped into seven five-year periods. Of these, in the first three the study was performed on bone-marrow aspirates; after 1976 the histopathological study of bone-marrow biopsies was introduced, and since 1979 the karyotype has been regularly examined. The MDS were classified in accordance with the FAB system. With these premises borne in mind, the following aspects were considered: diagnostic interpretation of MDS along the years; diagnostic incidence of MDS, AML and AP in each of the five-year periods; relative frequency of those diagnosis with respect to the total number of cases; evolutive profile of sex and age at diagnosis; quantitative significance of secondary MDS-AL and toxic AP along the years; MDS subtypes and their epidemiologic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 510 MDS, 610 AML and 223 AP cases were identified. With respect to the sex of the MDS patients, some changes have been seen along the years, from an M/F ratio of 1.9 to 1.0; and the mean age at diagnosis raised from 53.3 years (with only 1.7% of the cases over 65 years of age) to 71.4 years (with 76.9% of the cases over 65 years of age), all this within the 1959-1989 period. The incidence of AML and AP has remained stable for the last 20 years; on the contrary, MDS have been increasing continuously along the 35 years of the study, which poses for a higher number of new cases in every period (from 35 to 119) and also for a higher relative frequency in the registry (from 1.37% to 4.40%) within the period 1959-1989. Valuable toxic history was progressively increasing in secondary MDS-AML and progressively decreasing in AP. With respect to the FAB subtypes of MDS, and taking into account the last of the five-year periods, the most frequently diagnosed were RA and RSA followed by RAEB, CMML and RAEB-T. CONCLUSIONS: The increment of the incidence of MDS cases correlates significantly with the increment of the patients aged over 65 years. This incidence appears to be scarcely influenced by previous mutagenic agents (radiotherapy, chemotherapy) and might be due to a better understanding of MDS.","['Sanchez Fayos, J', 'Outeirino Perez, J J', 'Prieto, E', 'Roman, A', 'Olavarria, E', 'Cabello, A', 'Soto, C', 'Calabuig, T', 'Paniagua, C', 'Sanz, B']","['Sanchez Fayos J', 'Outeirino Perez JJ', 'Prieto E', 'Roman A', 'Olavarria E', 'Cabello A', 'Soto C', 'Calabuig T', 'Paniagua C', 'Sanz B', 'et al.']","['Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Autonoma, Madrid.']",['spa'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Distribution', 'Spain/epidemiology']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1994 Dec;39(6):441-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Perfil epidemiologico evolutivo de los sindromes mielodisplasicos (1959-1993).

Meta-analytic study].,435-9,"PURPOSE: To study the usefulness of different published epidemiological and analytic parameters to decide the treatment with human recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEPO) of anaemic patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have revised 10 published series compiling 115 patients, studying age, sex, initial diagnosis, route of administration and posology, criteria of response, duration of the study, dosis with the response was obtained, response according to initial diagnosis, duration of responses, and effect of the treatment on other hematopoietic series. We have made a comparison between responders and non-responders based on epidemiological and analytical parameters. RESULTS: We have compiled 115 patients with a rate of global response of 23.5%. We have not found significative differences between the route (s.c. or i.v.) or frequency of administration, however the number of responses was higher when rHuEPO was administered three times weekly. A great variability in the criteria of response was observed among the different studies. Most of studies have a duration of three months but we have observed significative differences in the number of responses when the study is longer. We have not found significative differences between responders and non-responders with respect to age, sex, used dosis, transfusional dependency and degree of transfusional dependency, basal serum erythropoietin, time since diagnosis, transfusional period, haemoglobin level among non-transfusion dependent patients and haemoglobin level among transfusion dependent patients. We have found significative differences with respect to initial diagnosis, a higher rate of responses was observed in the refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) group. We have not found a higher rate of transformations into acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) among these patients. The effects of the treatment on other haematopoietic series can be considered as anecdotical. CONCLUSION: The different epidemiological and analytic parameters published up to now are not useful in the decision of including an anaemic patient with MDS in the treatment with rHuEPO. Those patients with RAEB can be benefited with the treatment with rHuEPO. The concomitant use of other cytokines could improve these results.","['Rodriguez, J N', 'Dieguez, J C', 'Muniz, R', 'Martino, M L', 'Fernandez-Jurado, A', 'Amian, A', 'Canavate, M', 'Prados, D']","['Rodriguez JN', 'Dieguez JC', 'Muniz R', 'Martino ML', 'Fernandez-Jurado A', 'Amian A', 'Canavate M', 'Prados D']","['Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Juan Ramon Jimenez, Huelva.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Anemia/etiology/*therapy', 'Erythropoietin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1994 Dec;39(6):435-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Eritropoyetina recombinante humana en el tratamiento de la anemia de los sindromes mielodisplasicos.

If the articular disease has been persistent or recurrent for 15 days to 3 months, and because of the urgency of the treatment, it should be unacceptable not to recognize a leukaemia or a metastatic neuroblastoma; the same is true for bacterial origins and some of the vascular alterations of growth cartilage. Reactive arthritis, frequently due to a digestive infection, has also to be considered. The localised articular lesions of traumatic or malformative origin, may be diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging and arthroscopy. When the duration of the articular disease exceeds 3 months, the diagnosis of juvenile chronic arthritis, spondylarthropathy and connectivitis (disseminated lupus, panarteritis, dermatomyositis) or of some rare systemic diseases (Behcet, sarcoidosis, periodic disease) has to be considered.

Among these latter conditions alpha-IFN must be considered as the treatment of choice of the early chronic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia (LMC) in patients not eligible for allogenic bone marrow transplantation because its ability to induce a greater number of clinical remission and cytogenetic responses when compared to the classical chemotherapeutic agents. A myelosuppressive, non-leukemogenic effect and a more selective activity on the neoplastic hemopoiesis appear to be the most important advantages of alpha-IFN therapy. Based on the results obtained in LMC the use of alpha-IFN has been extended to the other SMP, essential thrombocytemia (TE), polycythemia vera (PV), idiopathic myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM). alpha-IFN is able to control thrombocytosis which often characterize the SMP so it appears to be particularly effective in TE. Actually a relatively limited literature is available about the alpha-IFN treatment of PV and MMM and so it is difficult to draw a final conclusion about the effectiveness of the treatment in these disorders.

Lymphoblastic lymphoma is classified into lymphocytic lymphomas (or non-Hodgkin) with a higher grade of malignancy. These lymphomas have, in 40% of cases, an initially extra-lymph node localization: among these, the renal or perirenal localization is not very frequent. The concomitant presence of a pericarditis of hemorrhagic type is also less frequent. Unlike Hodgkin's lymphomas, lymphocytic lymphomas are frequently in an advanced stage at the moment of diagnosis, and their evolution is of acute-subacute, often fatal type. The case report is about a 70 year old male, who arrived at the clinical investigation for the subjective presence of asthenia, dyspnea, tachycardia and the objective evidence of jugular turgor, hepatomegaly and distal edemas, hypophonesis of right lung basis, according to a clinical picture of systemic venous congestion which instrumental examinations confirm to be of pericardial origin.

PTX alone in the above concentration did not exert any significant cytotoxic effect on sensitive or resistant cell lines in the absence of vincristine. Resistance of L1210/VCR cell line was found previously to be accompanied with overexpression of drug transporting P-glycoprotein. Indeed, lower level of 3H-vincristine accumulation by resistant L1210/VCR cell line in comparison with sensitive L1210 cell line was observed. Accumulation of 3H-vincristine by L1210/VCR cell line was significantly increased in the presence of PTX. PTX in the same condition did not exert any considerable effect on accumulation of 3H-vincristine by nonresistant L1210 cells.

Nephrotoxicity of cis-DDP alone and in combination with DDTC or NAC was evaluated. On both of the investigated tumor models clastogenic effects in bone marrow cells were detected. DNA synthetic and mitotic activity of L1210 cells in vivo were evaluated by 3H-thymidine incorporation and cytogenetic analysis. Amelioration of the platinum induced nephrotoxicity and preservation of the antitumor activity of cis-DDP through combined application with DDTC or NAC were obtained at the L1210 model. Maximal inhibition of the DNA synthesis in L1210 cells was detected with the cis-DDP treatment.

Many other functions have been attributed to lactoferrin, including immunomodulation and cell growth regulation (reviewed in ref. 4). Some of these functions appear to be at least in part independent of the iron-binding activity of lactoferrin. It also has been consistently observed that lactoferrin interacts avidly with nucleic acids. Lactoferrin enhancement of the activity of natural killer and lymphokine-activated killer cells in vitro is inhibited by RNA and DNA. Lactoferrin taken up by K562 human myelogenous leukaemia cells appears in the nucleus where it is bound to DNA.

Two years before a colon adenocarcinoma (Class C1 of Duke) had been resected. There were no clinical signs of hypopituitarism or galactorrea. The laboratory findings showed deficiency of cortocotropin (ACTH), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and slight hyperprolactinemia (PRL). Cerebral magnetic resonance image (MRI) revealed an intra and suprasellar mass which extended to the hypothalamus. Chest X-ray film and computed tomographic scanning (TC) confirmed a macronodular mass at the apical segment of the inferior left lung lobule with mediastinal hypertrophic lymph nodes. A non functional pituitary tumor was diagnosed and transphenoidal surgery was carried out. At microscopic examination a malignant proliferation was found suggesting colonic differentiation.

In separate experiments, when fused alone to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4, amino acids 289 to 322 of Tax conferred trans activation ability.

There are two forms of gp55 in SFFV-infected cells: an intracellular form (more than 95% of the total protein), which is localized within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, and a cell surface form (about 3 to 5%). Because both forms of the viral proteins bind to EPO-R, it is not clear whether the viral protein induces mitogenesis intracellularly or at the cell surface. To address this question, we constructed an EPO-R mutant that contained a 6-amino-acid (DEKKMP) C-terminus ER retention signal. Biochemical and functional analyses with this mutant indicated that it was completely retained in the ER and not expressed at the cell surface. Further analysis showed that the mutant, like the wild-type EPO-R, interacted with SFFV gp55. However, this apparent intracellular interaction between the two proteins failed to induce growth factor-independent proliferation of Ba/F3 cells. Furthermore, spontaneous variants of the ER-retained EPO-R selected on the basis of their ability to induce cell proliferation when coexpressed with gp55 were exclusively expressed at the cell surface. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that the mitogenic activation of the EPO-R by gp55 requires the interaction of the two proteins at the cell surface.","['Li, J P', 'Hu, H O', 'Niu, Q T', 'Fang, C']","['Li JP', 'Hu HO', 'Niu QT', 'Fang C']","['Department of Microbiology, New York University Medical Center, New York 10016.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein gp55, Friend spleen focus-forming virus)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*metabolism', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*metabolism']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.3.1714-1719.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Mar;69(3):1714-19. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.3.1714-1719.1995.,,,,,['CA57335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC188774,,,,,,,,,,,

The central nervous system (CNS) infection is wide-spread, involving several different cell types, whereas the lesions are localized to motor areas of the brain and spinal cord. Inoculation of FrCasE at 10 days of age (P10) results in viremia, but infection of the CNS is restricted and neurological disease is not observed (M. Czub, S. Czub, F. McAtee, and J. Portis, J. Virol. 65:2539-2544, 1991). In this study, we used this developmental resistance to restrict the extent and the distribution of FrCasE in the brain to examine whether the spongiform degeneration is a consequence of infection of cells in proximity to the lesions. Two approaches were used to infect the brain on or after P10. First, mice were inoculated with FrCasE at P10 to induce viremia and then at P17 were subjected to focal CNS injury within brain regions known to be susceptible to virus-induced spongiform degeneration. The injury resulted in local inflammation, glial activation, migration of inflammatory cells into the wound site, and high-level parenchymal infection about the wound site. However, no evidence of spongiform neurodegeneration was observed over a period of 3 months. The second approach involved the implantation of FrCasE-infected microglia into the CNS at > or = P10. This resulted in microglial engraftment and focal CNS infection unilaterally at the implantation sites and bilaterally along white matter tracts of the corpus callosum and pons and in cells of the subventricular layers of the lateral cerebral ventricles. Strikingly, focal spongiform degeneration colocalized with the sites of infection. In contrast to the wounding experiments, the implantation model was not associated with an inflammatory response or significant glial activation. Results of these studies suggest that (i) the developmental resistance of the CNS to infection lies at the blood-brain barrier and can be bypassed by direct introduction into the brain of virus-infected cells, (ii) the neuropathology induced by this virus is a consequence of local effects of the infection and does not appear to require endothelial or neuronal infection, and (iii) elements of the inflammatory response and/or glial activation may modulate the expression of neuropathology induced by neurovirulent retroviruses.","['Lynch, W P', 'Robertson, S J', 'Portis, J L']","['Lynch WP', 'Robertson SJ', 'Portis JL']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases, Hamilton, Montana 59840.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Microglia/*microbiology/transplantation', '*Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous System Diseases/*microbiology/pathology']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.69.3.1408-1419.1995 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Mar;69(3):1408-19. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.3.1408-1419.1995.,,,,,,,PMC188727,,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE: This study was designed to characterize further the risks for cancers other than lung cancer (i.e., non-lung cancers) from atmospheric radon. METHODS: Mortality from non-lung cancer was examined in a collaborative analysis of data from 11 cohorts of underground miners in which radon-related excesses of lung cancer had been established. The study included 64,209 men who were employed in the mines for 6.4 years on average, received average cumulative exposures of 155 working-level months (WLM), and were followed for 16.9 years on average. RESULTS: For all non-lung cancers combined, mortality was close to that expected from mortality rates in the areas surrounding the mines (ratio of observed to expected deaths [O/E] = 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.95-1.07, based on 1179 deaths), and mortality did not increase with increasing cumulative exposure. Among 28 individual cancer categories, statistically significant increases in mortality for cancers of the stomach (O/E = 1.33; 95% CI = 1.16-1.52) and liver (O/E = 1.73; 95% CI = 1.29-2.28) and statistically significant decreases for cancers of the tongue and mouth (O/E = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.26-0.93), pharynx (O/E = 0.35; 95% CI = 0.16-0.66), and colon (O/E = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.63-0.95) were observed. For leukemia, mortality was increased in the period less than 10 years since starting work (O/E = 1.93; 95% CI = 1.19-2.95) but not subsequently. For none of these diseases was mortality significantly related to cumulative exposure. Among the remaining individual categories of non-lung cancer, mortality was related to cumulative exposure only for cancer of the pancreas (excess relative risk per WLM = 0.07%; 95% CI = 0.01-0.12) and, in the period less than 10 years since the start of employment, for other and unspecified cancers (excess relative risk per WLM = 0.22%; 95% CI = 0.08-0.37). CONCLUSIONS: The increases in mortality from stomach and liver cancers and leukemia are unlikely to have been caused by radon, since they are unrelated to cumulative exposure. The association between cumulative exposure and pancreatic cancer seems likely to be a chance finding, while the association between cumulative exposure and other and unspecified cancers was caused by deaths certified as due to carcinomatosis (widespread disseminated cancer throughout the body) that were likely to have been due to lung cancers. This study, therefore, provides considerable evidence that high concentrations of radon in air do not cause a material risk of mortality from cancers other than lung cancer. IMPLICATIONS: Protection standards for radon should continue to be based on consideration of the lung cancer risk alone.","['Darby, S C', 'Whitley, E', 'Howe, G R', 'Hutchings, S J', 'Kusiak, R A', 'Lubin, J H', 'Morrison, H I', 'Tirmarche, M', 'Tomasek, L', 'Radford, E P']","['Darby SC', 'Whitley E', 'Howe GR', 'Hutchings SJ', 'Kusiak RA', 'Lubin JH', 'Morrison HI', 'Tirmarche M', 'Tomasek L', 'Radford EP', 'et al.']","['Imperial Cancer Research Fund, University of Oxford, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mining', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Radon/*adverse effects']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/87.5.378 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1995 Mar 1;87(5):378-84. doi: 10.1093/jnci/87.5.378.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was anticipated that 1c would be hydrolyzed in vivo by carboxylate esterase (E.C. 3.1.1.1) to the labile 4-hydroxy analogue 2a, which should penetrate cells by passive diffusion and ring open to the aldehyde 3a. Spontaneous elimination of acrolein from 3a would then generate the free nucleotide, FdUMP. 1c might also penetrate cells directly and undergo the same degradation sequence after hydrolysis by cellular esterases. 1c was prepared by condensing 2-hydroxy-2-oxo-4-(pivaloyloxy)-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinane with 2'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (FUdR) in the presence of triphenylphosphine and diethyl azodicarboxylate. 1c was moderately stable in aqueous buffers over the pH range 1-7.4 (T1/2 > 30 h). In the presence of carboxylate esterase, however, it was degraded, in a concentration-dependent manner, to FdUMP. No intermediates were detected in the incubation mixture. In mouse plasma, 1c was degraded first to FdUMP and then to FUdR. The latter is presumably formed by dephosphorylation of FdUMP by plasma 5'-nucleotidases or phosphatases. 1c and FU inhibited the growth of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in culture at a concentration of 5 x 10(-6) M. 1c was equally potent against a CHO variant that was 20-fold resistant to FU. Administered intraperitoneally for 5 consecutive days, 1c was as effective as FU at prolonging the life span of mice bearing P-388 leukemia. In the presence of 2-mercaptoehtanesulfonic acid, an acrolein scavenger, 1c was equally effective against a P-388 mutant cell line that was resistant to FU. Collectively, these data suggest that 1c acts as a membrane-permeable prodrug of FdUMP. This prodrug strategy may be generally useful for introducing dianionic phosphates and phosphonates into cells.","['Farquhar, D', 'Chen, R', 'Khan, S']","['Farquhar D', 'Chen R', 'Khan S']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"[""0 (5'-(4-(pivaloyloxy)-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinan-2-yl)-2'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine)"", '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '134-46-3 (Fluorodeoxyuridylate)', 'EC 3.1.- (Esterases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Esterases/metabolism', 'Fluorodeoxyuridylate/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Prodrugs/*chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Swine']",1995/02/03 00:00,1995/02/03 00:01,['1995/02/03 00:00'],"['1995/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00003a012 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1995 Feb 3;38(3):488-95. doi: 10.1021/jm00003a012.,,,,,['AI 28213/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the mechanisms involved in these effects by studying the influence of morphine on the pathogenesis of murine Friend retrovirus infection. The response to this opiate varied greatly according to the treatment schedule. Daily intraperitoneal administration of morphine (50 mg/kg) for 16 to 27 days attenuated pathological manifestations in infected animals without modifying the mortality rate. The protective effect increased proportionately with the duration of treatment and depended on the time of treatment initiation relative to inoculation. Naloxone (100 mg/kg/day i.p.) inhibited the morphine-induced decrease in both splenomegaly and viral titer. Mifepristone--a glucocorticoid receptor inhibitor--had no significant effect on the morphine-induced attenuation of splenomegaly. The influence of the infection on acute morphine toxicity was also analyzed using a nonlethal dose in noninfected mice (200 mg/kg). Susceptibility to morphine increased in parallel to the development of the infection, with mortality rates ranging from 20% on day 14 to 90% on day 21. Simultaneous administration of naloxone (20-100 mg/kg) reduced the mortality rate and postponed death. Administration of mifepristone, terfenadin, phentolamine or propranolol did not modify mortality at the doses used. These findings show that the influence of morphine on the development of Friend virus infection in mice depends on the conditions of administration. The transient protective effect seen in certain conditions of administration appears to be due essentially to the direct effects of morphine on its specific receptors.","['Veyries, M L', 'Sinet, M', 'Desforges, B', 'Rouveix, B']","['Veyries ML', 'Sinet M', 'Desforges B', 'Rouveix B']","['Departement de Pharmacologie Clinique, Hopital Claude Bernard, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U13, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Receptors, Opioid)', '36B82AMQ7N (Naloxone)', '76I7G6D29C (Morphine)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Morphine/*pharmacology', 'Naloxone/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Opioid/drug effects/physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1995 Feb;272(2):498-504.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The distributions of these receptor components explain the known target cell specificity of CNTF, and have also helped identify new and unexpected targets of CNTF action. In addition to including a CNTF-specific component, known as CNTFR alpha, the CNTF receptor complex utilizes two receptor components, gp130 and LIFR beta, that are shared with members of a family of broadly acting cytokines, including leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin-6 (IL6). The finding that the CNTF receptor complex shares components with this family of cytokines has led to the realization that CNTF should also be considered a cytokine--but one that differs from its relatives in that its actions are largely limited to cells of the nervous system due to the restricted expression of one of its receptor components, CNTFR alpha. CNTFR alpha does not play a direct role in signaling, but instead forms a complex with CNTF that promotes its binding to the signal transducing ""beta"" receptor components, gp130 and LIFR beta. Thus CNTF utilizes identical signal transducing receptor components in neurons that its relatives use on nonneuronal cells to elicit strikingly dissimilar responses, indicating that different cells interpret the same cell surface signal in dramatically different ways. The three CNTF receptor components are initially unassociated on the cell surface, and are brought together in step-wise fashion upon CNTF binding. CNTF first binds to CNTFR alpha, then recruits gp130, and finally complexes with LIFR beta. It is this last step in complex formation, involving heterodimerization between ""beta"" components, that activates intracellular signaling. Signal initiation is due to activation of members of a family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, known as the Jak/Tyk kinases, which are preassociated with the beta components in an inactive state and then become activated upon beta component dimerization; the Jak/Tyk kinases, in turn, activate a variety of intracellular signaling molecules, such as members of the STAT family of DNA binding transcriptional activators. A detailed understanding of the mechanism of activation of the CNTF receptor complex has led to the realization that all members of the CNTF family of cytokines activate signaling in much the same way, by inducing either homo- or heterodimerization of beta receptor components and thus activation of the preassociated Jak/Tyk kinases; this mode of receptor activation may prove to be more generally applicable to all cytokine receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Stahl, N', 'Yancopoulos, G D']","['Stahl N', 'Yancopoulos GD']","['Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, New York 10591.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Neurobiol,Journal of neurobiology,0213640,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biotransformation', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*physiology', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/neu.480251111 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurobiol. 1994 Nov;25(11):1454-66. doi: 10.1002/neu.480251111.,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, to define the impact of a second LDT in both untreated and treated patients. DESIGN: Retrospective study of LDT in previously untreated patients with CLL. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Sixty patients diagnosed over a 13-year period at a county hospital. In forty-five of the 60 patients, an LDT could be defined. These patients were included in the final analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: LDT below and above 12 months, progression-free and overall survival. RESULTS: Patients in Binet stages B and C had a median LDT of 4 months as compared to 26 months in stage A patients (P < 0.01). The projected progression-free survival at 3 years was 24% in patients with an LDT of < 12 months. The corresponding figure for the remaining patients was 68% (P < 0.01). The overall 5-year survival did not differ significantly between patients with an LDT below and above 12 months, respectively. In seven untreated patients, a second LDT could be calculated which was shorter than the first recorded LDT. A second LDT was also identified in five patients post treatment that was consistently shorter than their first LDT.

Stimulation of the leukemic T cell line Jurkat with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and the calcium ionophore ionomycin rapidly and transiently increased LDL receptor mRNA levels. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide (CHX) or puromycin resulted in superinduction of LDL receptor mRNA levels by mitogenic stimulation. The increase in LDL receptor mRNA levels resulted from increased gene transcription rather than stabilization of mRNA half-life. Thus, similar results were obtained when reporter gene expression was assessed in Jurkat cells transfected with LDL receptor promoter constructs and mRNA half-life was not significantly altered by the stimuli. Neither mitogenic induction nor superinduction of LDL receptor mRNA levels in Jurkat cells was prevented by sterol downregulation of LDL receptor gene expression. The protein synthesis inhibitors CHX and anisomycin, but not puromycin, also directly stimulated LDL receptor mRNA levels, suggesting that these compounds could provide a signal required for LDL receptor gene transcription. Taken together, these data indicate that various non-sterol stimuli, including activation of protein kinase C, increases in intracellular calcium, inhibition of protein synthesis, and signals generated by the protein synthesis inhibitors CHX and anisomycin, induce LDL receptor gene expression. Thus, transcription of the LDL receptor gene is not only regulated by ambient sterols but also by a variety of influences that govern the various primary response or immediate early genes.

We demonstrated previously that ML-1 cells require IGF-1 plus transferrin (TF) for growth and transforming growth factor beta or tumor necrosis factor alpha plus TF for differentiation. We now found that CK II is activated only when the cells are exposed to both IGF-1 and TF or when TF is replaced in this combination with relatively high levels of iron salts. Induction of differentiation with TGF-beta and TF did not result in CK II activation. These results show that CK II activation in ML-1 cells requires the application of both components of the growth signal, IGF-1 and TF, demonstrating that the growth factor alone is incapable of enhancing the activity of the enzyme.","['Wang, L G', 'Liu, X M', 'Wikiel, H', 'Bloch, A']","['Wang LG', 'Liu XM', 'Wikiel H', 'Bloch A']","['Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Grace Cancer Drug Center, Buffalo, NY 14213.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Ferrous Compounds)', '0 (Transferrin)', '39R4TAN1VT (ferrous sulfate)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Casein Kinase II', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Ferrous Compounds/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Transferrin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.57.2.332 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1995 Feb;57(2):332-4. doi: 10.1002/jlb.57.2.332.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Assessment of the role of ARF and of a 50-kDa cytosolic protein in phospholipase D activation.,3172-8,"Phospholipase D (PLD) activation by guanine nucleotides requires protein cofactors in both the plasma membrane and the cytosol. HL-60 cytosol was fractionated by ammonium sulfate and gel-permeation chromatography. Two cytosolic protein fractions were found to reconstitute the GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate)-stimulated PLD in a reconstitution assay consisting of 3H-labeled HL-60 membranes and eluted column fractions. The major peak of reconstituting activity was in the region of 50 kDa, and a second discrete peak of PLD reconstitution activity was observed in the region of 18 kDa. Rho GDP/GTP exchange inhibitor, Rho GDI, comigrated with Rac2 and RhoA, but not Rac1. RhoA and Rac2 were entirely complexed with Rho GDI and eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa by gel filtration chromatography. The partial overlap between cytosolic Rac2 and RhoA with the 50-kDa peak of reconstituting activity was not consistent with the participation of cytosolic Rho-related GTPases in the activation of PLD by guanine nucleotides. However, recombinant Rho GDI, which inhibits nucleotide exchange on the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins, reduced GTP gamma S-stimulated PLD activity in HL-60 homogenates. The stimulatory exchange factor, Smg GDS, which is active on Rho and Rac, could be partially separated from the PLD-stimulating factor(s) by gel-permeation chromatography. Moreover, recombinant Smg GDS failed to stimulate GTP-dependent PLD activity. Cytosolic ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) was exclusively located in the 18-kDa peak of reconstitution activity. Faint amounts of membrane-bound ARF were also detected using the monoclonal antibody 1D9. The effects of the 50-kDa and 18-kDa PLD-inducing factors on the salt-extracted PLD activity were synergistic. The weak stimulatory effect of ARF alone suggested that the GTP gamma S-stimulated PLD activity is dependent on the presence of another protein(s), presumably ARF-regulatory proteins. We propose that a membrane-bound GTP-binding protein, possibly ARF, may be involved in the activation of PLD when combined with the component(s) of the 50-kDa fraction.","['Bourgoin, S', 'Harbour, D', 'Desmarais, Y', 'Takai, Y', 'Beaulieu, A']","['Bourgoin S', 'Harbour D', 'Desmarais Y', 'Takai Y', 'Beaulieu A']","['Centre de Recherche en Rhumatologie et Immunologie, Centre de Recherche du CHUL, Sainte-Foy, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '146-91-8 (Guanosine Diphosphate)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ADP-Ribosylation Factors)']",IM,"['ADP-Ribosylation Factors', 'Carrier Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/pharmacology"", 'Guanosine Diphosphate/pharmacology', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Phospholipase D/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/02/17 00:00,1995/02/17 00:01,['1995/02/17 00:00'],"['1995/02/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/17 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.7.3172 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)82907-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Feb 17;270(7):3172-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.7.3172.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Continuously cultured cells are ascorbate deficient due to the lability of the vitamin in solution and to the fact that daily supplementation of media with ascorbate is unusual. We found that ascorbate repletion alone did not alter ferritin synthesis. However, ascorbate-replete human hepatoma cells, Hep3B and HepG2, as well as K562 human leukemia cells achieved a substantially higher cellular ferritin content in response to a challenge with iron than did their ascorbate-deficient counterparts grown under standard culture conditions. Most of the elevation in ferritin content was due to an increase in de novo ferritin synthesis of greater than 50-fold, as shown by in vivo labeling with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitation. RNA-blot analysis showed only minor changes in steady state levels of ferritin mRNA, suggesting that ascorbate enhances iron-induced ferritin synthesis primarily by post-transcriptional events. Transient gene expression experiments using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene constructs showed that the ascorbate effect on ferritin translation is not mediated through the stem-loop near the translational start site that transduces ferritin synthesis in response to cytokines. The data suggest that ascorbate possibly modifies the action of the iron-responsive element on ferritin translation, although more precise structure-function studies are needed to clarify this issue. These data demonstrate a novel role of ascorbate as a signaling molecule in post-transcriptional gene regulation. The mechanism by which ascorbate modulates cellular iron metabolism is complex and requires additional detailed investigation.","['Toth, I', 'Rogers, J T', 'McPhee, J A', 'Elliott, S M', 'Abramson, S L', 'Bridges, K R']","['Toth I', 'Rogers JT', 'McPhee JA', 'Elliott SM', 'Abramson SL', 'Bridges KR']","[""Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Ascorbic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Ferritins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Iron/*physiology', 'Leukemia', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/02/10 00:00,1995/02/10 00:01,['1995/02/10 00:00'],"['1995/02/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/10 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.6.2846 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(17)30742-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Feb 10;270(6):2846-52. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.6.2846.,,,,,"['AI 32717/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 45794/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one children with ALL manifesting an isolated CNS relapse between 1984 through 1989 underwent serial evaluations of intellectual function. Neurocognitive function was measured by the full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) as determined by the age-appropriate Wechsler Intelligence Scale and by achievement in reading, math, and spelling as assessed by the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT). Intelligence testing was initiated following isolated CNS relapse after clearance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology but prior to CSI and continued at annual intervals for a minimum of 4 years postmeningeal failure. Protocol treatment for isolated CNS relapse consisted of reinduction and maintenance systemic therapy, intrathecal (IT) triple-agent chemotherapy, and early CSI (cranium to 24 Gy and spine to 15 Gy at 1.5 Gy/fraction) as outlined on the institutional ""Total XI"" trial. RESULTS: All 21 children attained secondary CNS remission and underwent the planned additional systemic/IT chemotherapy and CSI. Fourteen of the 21 children remain in secondary continuous remission, while the remaining 7 experienced a second relapse and were removed from further neurocognitive assessment. For the eight female and six male long-term survivors, mean ages at original diagnosis and at CSI were 5.7 years (range = 0.6-16.2) and 7.0 years (range = 1.8-17.0), respectively. At a median follow-up interval of 4.6 years (ranges 1.7-6.8) post-CNS relapse, comparison of group mean initial to final FSIQs revealed no statistically significant difference between the two measures (94.5 vs. 95.9, respectively, n = 11, p = 0.52). None of the children are functioning in the mentally retarded range. Final FSIQ outcome directly correlated with initial FSIQ (p = 0.00005, n = 11), age at diagnosis (p = 0.009, n = 14), and age at CSI (p = 0.011, n = 14). In addition, change between initial and final FSIQ scores inversely correlated with age at diagnosis (p = 0.009) and age at CSI (p = 0.018) but not with baseline IQ score (p = 0.41). Initial FSIQ scores were not influenced by either age at diagnosis (p = 0.12) or age at CSI (p = 0.14). Final group mean (range) WRAT scores in reading, math, and spelling were measured to be 94.7 (68-132), 95.6 (69-126), and 93.7 (77-122), respectively (n = 13). Final reading and math scores directly correlated with both age at diagnosis (p = 0.01) and age at CSI (p = 0.009). Spelling outcome did not correlate with either age at diagnosis (p = 0.25) or age at CSI (p = 0.24). Nine children are placed in regular classrooms, while the remaining five require a mixed classroom environment. CONCLUSION: In our study, children with ALL experiencing an isolated CNS relapse tolerated additional systemic/IT chemotherapy and CSI without apparent deterioration of group serial intellectual scores. However, longitudinal analyses of group intellectual measures obscured the independent impact of initial FSIQ, age at original diagnosis, and age at CSI upon individual neurocognitive outcome. Early and more intensive psychoeducational stimulation may be needed in very young children presenting with low initial FSIQ scores who are treated with CSI and additional chemotherapy following isolated CNS relapse in ALL.","['Kumar, P', 'Mulhern, R K', 'Regine, W F', 'Rivera, G K', 'Kun, L E']","['Kumar P', 'Mulhern RK', 'Regine WF', 'Rivera GK', 'Kun LE']","[""Department of Radiation Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cognition', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intelligence', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Spinal Cord/*radiation effects']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(94)00432-K [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(94)00432-K [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1995 Feb 1;31(3):561-6. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(94)00432-K.,,,,,['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

SFGM. Societe Francaise de Greffe de Moelle.,509-17,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the importance of fractionating total body irradiation (TBI) in patients receiving an allogenic bone marrow transplant (BMT) for an acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR1). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1983 and 1990, 171 consecutive patients received either single dose TBI (STBI) (n = 65) or fractionated TBI (FTBI) (n = 106) after being conditioned with cyclophosphamide and before receiving a non-T-depleted Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA)-identical marrow. Both groups were comparable except for date of BMT and diagnosis-to-BMT interval (D-BMT). RESULTS: After 63 months median follow-up, transplant-related mortality (TRM), probability of relapse, and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) were 0.38 and 0.27 (p = 0.04), 0.29 and 0.26 (p = 0.22), 0.43 and 0.56 (p = 0.06), respectively, for STBI and FTBI. The supposed influence of the schedule of TBI disappeared in the multivariate analysis: TRM was enhanced by severe acute graft vs. host disease (p = 0.0002), early years of transplant (before January 1, 1987) (p = 0.0003), and longer D-BMT intervals (p = 0.038). Relapse was linked to early years of transplant (p < 0.00001), and the absence of chronic GVHD (p = 0.007). Longer DFSs were observed for later years of transplant (after January 1, 1987 and later) (p = 0.001), milder acute GVHD (p = 0.005), and shorter D-BMT intervals (p = 0.045). Important improvements of the results were made during the 7-year observation period: TRM, probability of relapse, and DFS were, respectively, 0.36, 0.28, and 0.46 for patients transplanted before January 1, 1987 vs. 0.21, 0.15, and 0.67 after that date. CONCLUSION: Our data strongly suggest that allogenic BMT is the best postremission treatment for AML in CR1, and the results are better when BMT shortly follows the achievement of remission. The schedule of TBI was of little importance compared with the improvements made in the management of patients undergoing BMT during the 1980s, and, therefore, reports concerning data prior to 1985 should be interpreted cautiously.","['Resbeut, M', 'Cowen, D', 'Blaise, D', 'Gluckman, E', 'Cosset, J M', 'Rio, B', 'Pene, F', 'Milpied, N', 'Cuillere, J C', 'Reiffers, J']","['Resbeut M', 'Cowen D', 'Blaise D', 'Gluckman E', 'Cosset JM', 'Rio B', 'Pene F', 'Milpied N', 'Cuillere JC', 'Reiffers J', 'et al.']","['Department of Radiotherapy, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Lung Diseases, Interstitial/etiology', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Recurrence', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(94)00446-R [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(94)00446-r [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1995 Feb 1;31(3):509-17. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(94)00446-r.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following isolated CNS relapse, all 18 patients were treated on a prospective contingency of ""Study XI"" trial consisting of intensified reinduction chemotherapy, weekly intrathecal methotrexate/hydrocortisone/Ara-C x 4-6 injections, craniospinal irradiation (cranium to 24.0 Gy and spine to 15.0 Gy at 1.5 Gy/fraction) and maintenance systemic therapy for a minimum of 1 year. RESULTS: Ten of 18 patients remain in continuous complete secondary remission at 17 to 50 months post-CNS relapse. Second sites of relapse in the remaining eight children were as follows: CNS in four, bone marrow in three, and bilateral testicular in one patient. Each of these eight patients died of progressive leukemia. At a median followup of 40 months post-initial CNS relapse, the 3-year secondary Kaplan-Meier survival and event-free survival are 72% and 56%, respectively. Minimal long-term neurotoxicity was associated with the treatment regimen. The most important prognostic factors predicting continuous secondary remission included white blood cell count at diagnosis (p = 0.05), and duration of initial remission (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: This trial demonstrates that more than one-half of patients may be successfully salvaged with intensified chemotherapy and craniospinal irradiation without significant morbidity following an isolated CNS relapse, despite previous multiagent chemotherapy though virtually no prior PCI in childhood ALL.","['Kumar, P', 'Kun, L E', 'Hustu, H O', 'Mulhern, R K', 'Hancock, M L', 'Coffey, D', 'Rivera, G K']","['Kumar P', 'Kun LE', 'Hustu HO', 'Mulhern RK', 'Hancock ML', 'Coffey D', 'Rivera GK']","[""Department of Radiation Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Spinal Cord/*radiation effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(94)00344-K [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(94)00344-K [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1995 Feb 1;31(3):477-83. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(94)00344-K.,,,"['Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1995 Feb 1;31(3):673-4.

Using cultured sympathetic neurons as a bioassay for cholinergic differentiation factors, we and others found that extracts containing soluble proteins from developing and adult footpads caused the same changes in transmitter properties in sympathetic neurons in vitro that the target does in vivo. In the present studies, using footpads from Tabby mutant mice that lack sweat glands, we found that the presence of sweat glands is correlated with the presence of cholinergic differentiation activity in footpad extracts. We examined the conditions necessary for secretion of differentiation activity from primary cultures of sweat gland cells. Surprisingly, sweat gland cells cultured alone do not produce or secrete cholinergic differentiation activity. When grown in the presence of sympathetic neurons, however, gland cells induce cholinergic function, increase vasoactive intestinal peptide content, and reduce catecholamine production in the neurons. Medium conditioned by sweat gland/neuron cocultures has a similar effect on the transmitter properties of cultured sympathetic neurons, indicating that the target influence on phenotype is mediated by a secreted factor(s). The innervation-dependence of cholinergic differentiation factor production provides evidence that reciprocal interactions between neurons and sweat glands are necessary for acquisition of the mature transmitter phenotype.","['Habecker, B A', 'Tresser, S J', 'Rao, M S', 'Landis, S C']","['Habecker BA', 'Tresser SJ', 'Rao MS', 'Landis SC']","['Department of Neurosciences, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44106-4975.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', 'EC 2.3.1.6 (Choline O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Choline O-Acetyltransferase/metabolism', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Sweat Glands/*innervation/*metabolism', 'Sympathetic Nervous System/physiology', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/analysis']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/dbio.1995.1025 [doi]', 'S0012-1606(85)71025-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 1995 Jan;167(1):307-16. doi: 10.1006/dbio.1995.1025.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The number of physicians with special training in the interpretation of these studies is limited. A knowledge-based computer system has been designed to aid in the interpretation of immunophenotyping and DNA flow cytometry results in hematopoietic disease. The system, known as ""Professor Fidelio,"" is a heuristic classification system that reasons on the basis of defined diagnostic patterns. In this study, Fidelio was tested as a stand-alone system on 366 specimens from two large tertiary medical centers. Fidelio's interpretation was considered to be appropriate in all cases. In 300 of 366 (82%) specimens, the system's interpretation agreed with the diagnosis of record. Many of the disagreements could be traced to errors in the recording of the original diagnosis and minor differences in diagnostic criteria between Fidelio's knowledge base and the criteria in use at the medical centers. When used in a stand-alone mode, Fidelio's interpretation was less specific than the diagnosis of record in certain lymphoproliferative disorders that require morphologic information for subclassification. Professor Fidelio is one module in a workstation for the diagnostic hematology laboratory. This workstation is designed for interpretive reporting, education, and database functions for clinical research. Clinical and morphologic information are shared between Fidelio and the other modules for peripheral blood analysis, bone marrow morphology, and lymph node interpretation by means of a relational database. The system will be useful in hospitals that lack individuals specially trained in flow cytometry.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Diamond, L W', 'Nguyen, D T', 'Andreeff, M', 'Maiese, R L', 'Braylan, R C']","['Diamond LW', 'Nguyen DT', 'Andreeff M', 'Maiese RL', 'Braylan RC']","['Department of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['*Artificial Intelligence', 'Cell Division', 'DNA/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Ploidies', '*Software']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990170310 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1994 Nov 1;17(3):266-73. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990170310.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the distribution of a general test statistic, based on weighted residual sum of squares for testing a general interaction in a 2 x k factorial experiment, we describe the relationship between the power of the test and the size of the sample. In a simulation study, we evaluate the behavior of three commonly used estimators as methods for estimating the parameters of the test statistic. These are the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) method, a method (O/E) based on the ratio of the observed to expected number of events, and the maximum likelihood (MLE) method. We show that in most cases nominal test sizes and appropriate powers are attained using the MLE and MH methods, whereas the O/E method yielded test sizes and powers less than expected. With both large baseline hazard rates and large differences in relative hazard rates, the difference between the simulated and asymptotic powers for all three methods become larger; however, the size of this difference is small and unlikely to seriously affect the use of either the MLE or MH methods. The proposed methods could also be used to calculate the power and sample size for testing a treatment-covariate interaction in a stratified data analysis.","['Xiang, A H', 'Sather, H N', 'Azen, S P']","['Xiang AH', 'Sather HN', 'Azen SP']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90033.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Control Clin Trials,Controlled clinical trials,8006242,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Prednisone/*therapeutic use', '*Research Design', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/*therapeutic use']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0197-2456(94)90006-X [pii]', '10.1016/0197-2456(94)90006-x [doi]']",ppublish,Control Clin Trials. 1994 Dec;15(6):489-502. doi: 10.1016/0197-2456(94)90006-x.,,,,,"['1-P50-HL44404/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY3040/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The efficacy theta E of an experimental treatment E is evaluated relative to that of a standard treatment S based on data from an uncontrolled trial of E, an informative prior for theta S, and a noninformative prior for theta E. The trial continues until E is shown with high posterior probability to be either promising or not promising, or until a predetermined maximum sample size is reached. Operating characteristics are evaluated under fixed values of the success probability of E. In this paper, we propose two extensions of this decision structure, describe sample size and monitoring criteria, and provide numerical guidelines for implementation. The first extension gives criteria from early termination of trials unlikely to yield conclusive results, based on the marginal (predictive) distribution of the observed success rate. The second extension allows early termination only if E is found to be not promising compared to S. Operating characteristics of each of these designs are evaluated numerically over a range of design parameterizations. We also examine the effects of intermittent monitoring on the design's properties. An application of this approach to a leukemia biochemotherapy trial is described.","['Thall, P F', 'Simon, R']","['Thall PF', 'Simon R']","['Department of Biomathematics, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Control Clin Trials,Controlled clinical trials,8006242,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents', '*Bayes Theorem', 'Drug Therapy', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Research Design', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0197-2456(94)90004-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0197-2456(94)90004-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Control Clin Trials. 1994 Dec;15(6):463-81. doi: 10.1016/0197-2456(94)90004-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to determine if the defenses against oxidant stress in MDR human leukemia cells (HL-60/AR) that overexpress multidrug-resistance-associated protein (MRP), but not Pgp, contribute to the mechanism of drug resistance in this cell line. METHODS: HL-60/AR cells were evaluated in comparison with wild-type cells with respect to sensitivity to the oxidants hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH), the activities and amounts of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and the effects that manipulation of the activities of these enzymes may have on cellular sensitivity to the oxidants and to daunorubicin. We also evaluated the ability of the cells to generate daunorubicin semiquinone free radical as measured by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. RESULTS: HL-60/AR cells were > 10-fold resistant to the cytotoxic effects of the H2O2 or t-BuOOH as compared with parental, drug-sensitive HL-60 cells. This phenomenon could be attributed largely to elevated activity and protein levels of catalase in HL-60/AR cells. Furthermore, inhibition of catalase by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AT) diminished the resistance of HL-60/AR to these oxidants by > 80% or > 50%, respectively. Despite these findings, AT was incapable of causing sensitization of HL-60/AR cells to the cytotoxic effects of daunorubicin. We found that the activity and amount of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) was no greater in HL-60/AR cells than in HL-60 cells. Cultivation of cells in selenium-deficient medium caused a marked reduction in GSH-Px activity in HL-60/AR cells and a profound inhibition of GSH-redox cycling manifested by a decrease in baseline hexose monophosphate shunt activity (HMPS) and markedly blunted stimulation of the HMPS by the oxidant t-BuOOH in both wild-type and resistant cells. These variations in GSH-Px activity and GSH-redox cycling, however, were not associated with an alteration in cellular sensitivity to daunorubicin. The failure of catalase inhibition or selenium manipulation of GSH-Px activity to affect daunorubicin cytotoxicity was not due to the inability of these cells to produce free-radical species of daunorubicin, since ESR studies revealed that the generation of daunorubicin semiquinone free radical by HL-60/AR cells was equal to and, in fact, 3-fold that obtained with HL-60 cells. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with parental HL-60 cells, MRP-overexpressing HL-60/AR cells have demonstrable alterations in antioxidant defenses that are manifested by cellular resistance to the cytotoxic effects of H2O2 and t-BuOOH and by elevated protein levels and activity of catalase. Whether these alterations are epiphenomena or are related to overexpression of MRP remains to be determined. However, it does appear that the enhanced antioxidant defenses observed in HL-60/AR cells do not contribute to the resistance to daunorubicin manifested by this cell line. Although HL-60/AR cells generate daunorubicin semiquinone free radical to an extent equal to or greater than that observed in HL-60 cells, the failure of alterations in GSH-Px activity or inhibition of catalase to change the sensitivity of HL-60/AR cells to daunorubicin suggests that the cytotoxicity of daunorubicin in these cells in not mediated through H2O2 or other peroxide species detoxified by these enzymes.","['Lenehan, P F', 'Gutierrez, P L', 'Wagner, J L', 'Milak, N', 'Fisher, G R', 'Ross, D D']","['Lenehan PF', 'Gutierrez PL', 'Wagner JL', 'Milak N', 'Fisher GR', 'Ross DD']","['Division of Developmental Therapeutics, University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore 21201.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Peroxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '955VYL842B (tert-Butylhydroperoxide)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*biosynthesis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Catalase/antagonists & inhibitors/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Computer Simulation', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidants/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Pentose Phosphate Pathway/drug effects/physiology', 'Peroxides/metabolism/toxicity', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'tert-Butylhydroperoxide']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050250 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1995;35(5):377-86. doi: 10.1007/s002800050250.,,,,,"['1 T32 CA09633-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0-1-CA53491/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-1-CA40188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the hope of overcoming this problem, various cis-DDP-derived compounds have been synthesized, and their pharmacological activity was compared with that of cis-DDP. In this paper we report on studies on the cytotoxic activity induced by cis-diamminechloro-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl-4-aminobenzoate, N4]- chlorideplatinum(II) monohydrochloride monohydrate (DPR), a new complex of platinum containing procaine. All experiments were carried out on murine leukemic cells, which were either sensitive (L1210) or resistant (L1210/DDP) to cis-DDP. A tetrazolium dye (MTT) assay conducted 5 days after a 2-h exposure of cells to both drugs was utilized to determine the resistance factor (RF) of L1210/DDP cells as compared with the sensitive wild-type cells. Drug accumulation and efflux, together with the amount of platinum bound to DNA, were also investigated. The activity of DPR on sensitive cells was not significantly different from that of cis-DDP. Conversely, DPR was 4.3 times more effective than cis-DDP on resistant cells. A decreased drug accumulation is one of the mechanisms of resistance to cis-DDP of L1210/DDP cells. However, DPR accumulation was not significantly different in sensitive and resistant L1210 cells. Under culture conditions that yielded similar intracellular platinum concentrations, treatment with DPR produced significantly greater DNA platination than did treatment with cis-DDP in both cell lines. No difference in efflux was observed between L1210 and L1210/DDP cells exposed to either cis-DDP or DPR. Our results show that in parental cells, DPR is as potent as cis-DDP on a molar basis, and it is also minimally cross-resistant with cis-DDP in L1210/DDP cells. A direct implication of our results is that DPR could be useful in those human tumors showing a mechanism of resistance similar to that of L1210/DDP cells.","['Viale, M', 'Cafaggi, S', 'Parodi, B', 'Esposito, M']","['Viale M', 'Cafaggi S', 'Parodi B', 'Esposito M']","['Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Laboratorio Farmacologia Tossicologica, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (cisplatin-procaine complex)', '0468TBH014 (4-anisyltetrazolium blue)', '49DFR088MY (Platinum)', '4Z8Y51M438 (Procaine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism/*toxicity', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/chemistry/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Platinum/metabolism', 'Procaine/*analogs & derivatives/*chemistry/metabolism/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tetrazolium Salts/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800050249 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1995;35(5):371-6. doi: 10.1007/s002800050249.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Calyculin-A augmented the 1,25(OH)2D3-induced differentiation of the cells. Treatment of the cells with 1,25(OH)2D3 led to a decrease in PP1-like activity in the cytosol fraction, with a concomitant increase in the membrane and nuclear PP1-like activity, as determined when protein phosphatase activity was assayed using myosin light chain as substrate in the presence of 5 nM okadaic acid. Western blot analysis with antibodies specific for PP1 catalytic subunit isozymes (PP1 alpha, PP1 gamma, and PP1 delta) showed that all three PP1 isozymes were expressed but were differentially distributed in each cellular fraction. Subcellular redistribution of PP1-like activity during 1,25(OH)2D3-induced differentiation was mainly attributed to PP1 gamma and PP1 alpha proteins. In contrast, the localizations of PP1 delta and PP2A catalytic and regulatory subunits were not significantly affected by 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment. The gene expressions of PP1 alpha and PP1 gamma appeared to be constant during processes of monocytic differentiation. The correlation between phenotypic and functional changes of HL-60 cells on the one hand and subcellular redistribution of PP1-like activity on the other suggest that the translocations of PP1 alpha and PP1 gamma isozymes may contribute to the 1,25(OH)2D3-induced monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells.","['Omay, S B', 'Ogasawara, H', 'Toyoda, H', 'Nakai, K', 'Shima, H', 'Nagao, M', 'Mumby, M C', 'Shiku, H', 'Nishikawa, M']","['Omay SB', 'Ogasawara H', 'Toyoda H', 'Nakai K', 'Shima H', 'Nagao M', 'Mumby MC', 'Shiku H', 'Nishikawa M']","['2nd Department of Internal Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Marine Toxins)', '0 (Oxazoles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '7D07U14TK3 (calyculin A)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Marine Toxins', 'Monocytes/cytology/*drug effects/*enzymology', 'Oxazoles/pharmacology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1995/02/15 00:00,1995/02/15 00:01,['1995/02/15 00:00'],"['1995/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Feb 15;55(4):774-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At 37 degrees C, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), a serine protease inhibitor, was not cytotoxic at the concentration of 400 micrograms/ml for up to 6 h. When cells were exposed to PMSF (200-400 micrograms/ml) during heating at 43 degrees C, significant potentiation of hyperthermic cell killing was observed. Other protease inhibitors, such as chymostatin and diisopropylfluorophosphate (both are serine protease inhibitors); (2S,3S)-trans-epoxy-succinyl-L-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester (cysteine protease inhibitor) and pepstatin-A (aspartate protease inhibitor) showed similar effects. However, when cells were heated at 43 degrees C in the presence of cycloheximide (a protein synthesis inhibitor) together with PMSF, hyperthermic enhancement by PMSF decreased markedly. A decrease in potentiating the effect of PMSF was also noted with thermotolerant cells. These facts suggest that protease inhibitors may exert their hyperthermic cell killing by inhibiting proteases and ubiquitin, which are necessary to degrade denatured proteins induced by heat.","['Zhu, W G', 'Antoku, S', 'Kura, S', 'Aramaki, R', 'Nakamura, K', 'Sasaki, H']","['Zhu WG', 'Antoku S', 'Kura S', 'Aramaki R', 'Nakamura K', 'Sasaki H']","['Department of Experimental Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Serine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '57KD15003I (Phenylmethylsulfonyl Fluoride)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', '*Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Leukemia L5178/enzymology/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Phenylmethylsulfonyl Fluoride/pharmacology', 'Serine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology']",1995/02/15 00:00,1995/02/15 00:01,['1995/02/15 00:00'],"['1995/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Feb 15;55(4):739-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to understand the mechanism that induce such gene alterations in human leukemia cells, we studied the expression products of DHFR gene in trimetrexate (TMQ)- and/or methotrexate (MTX)-resistant sublines derived from a MOLT-3 human leukemia cell line. A 200-fold TMQ-resistant subline (MOLT-3/TMQ200) expressed the mutated DHFR mRNA, with a base change (T-->C) at the second position of codon 31, as well as the wild type gene. A MTX-resistant subline derived from MOLT-3/TMQ200 (MOLT-3/TMQ200-MTX500) showed a further increase in the expression of the mutated DHFR mRNA, compared to MOLT-3/TMQ200, with a marked decrease of expression of the wild type DHFR mRNA, which is confirmation of amplification of the mutated DHFR gene. By contrast, a 10,000-fold MTX-resistant subline (MOLT-3/MTX10,000) over-expressed the wild type DHFR mRNA, which is confirmation of amplification of the wild type gene. Increased levels of the DHFR enzyme in these sublines were proportional to expression levels of the DHFR mRNA. The DHFR enzyme expressed in MOLT-3/TMQ200-MTX500 cells showed a 40-fold increase in the Ki values for both MTX and TMQ, compared with values for the wild type DHFR expressed in both MOLT-3/MTX10,000 and its parent cell line. These findings suggest that the altered DHFR gene, which was introduced in MOLT-3 cells by exposure to TMQ, gave rise to a variant enzyme with reduced affinity to antifolates, and that complex DHFR alterations confer drug-resistant phenotypes in antifolate-resistance. Structural difference between the antifolates could be important in the introduction of the differential DHFR gene alterations in the antifolate resistance.","['Miyachi, H', 'Takemura, Y', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Ando, Y']","['Miyachi H', 'Takemura Y', 'Kobayashi H', 'Ando Y']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Drug Resistance', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*metabolism', 'Trimetrexate/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/06 00:00,1995/01/06 00:01,['1995/01/06 00:00'],"['1995/01/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/06 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['030438359403616Q [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(94)03616-q [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1995 Jan 6;88(1):93-9. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(94)03616-q.,,,,,,['DHFR'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of the metaphases were tetraploid, but there were also lymphoma cells observed with pseudodiploid chromosome constitutions. Cytogenetic analysis by G-banding revealed the existence of at least two cell populations. The karyotype of the minor pseudodiploid clone, which exhibited partial trisomy of 1q11qter and monosomy of 6p11pter as sole abnormalities, was 46,XY,der(6)t(1;6)(q11;p11).

The high proportion of tetraploid cells in the recurrent effusions was an indication that these cells were favorably selected in the environment of the somatic cavity. Our cytogenetic findings suggest that partial trisomy of 1q may be a crucial secondary chromosomal abnormality in highly malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Because L-asparaginase is a foreign protein, the potential exists for severe, dose-limiting hypersensitivity reactions. To reduce this toxicity, L-asparaginase has been linked with polyethylene glycol (PEG). METHODS: Patients with ALL in relapse were entered in a Phase II, open-label clinical trial (ASP-201A) to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of PEG-L-asparaginase. PEG-L-asparaginase has demonstrated potential low immunogenicity and a prolonged plasma half-life relative to native enzyme. PEG-L-asparaginase (2000 IU/m2 every 2 weeks) was used as single-agent induction therapy during an initial 14-day investigational window. Thereafter, the regimen consisted of PEG-L-asparaginase, vincristine, and prednisone. Patients also were allowed to receive doxorubicin and intrathecal chemotherapy beginning on day 14. All patients had been treated previously with one or more courses of native L-asparaginase; one of these patients was hypersensitive to L-asparaginase at enrollment. RESULTS: During the 14-day investigational window with PEG-L-asparaginase monotherapy, 22% of patients examined achieved a complete or partial remission. By completion of the 35-day induction period, 78% (or 14 of 18) of evaluated patients achieved complete or partial remission. Anaphylaxis did not occur during treatment. Mild urticaria and mild local allergic reactions occurred in five patients but did not cause discontinuation of treatment.

CONCLUSIONS: As administered in this study, PEG-L-asparaginase can be given safely with a spectrum of toxicity similar to that of native L-asparaginase.

The rationale for the use of topotecan in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is based on the finding that levels of Topo I are elevated in the lymphocytes of patients with this disease. METHODS: Twelve patients with CLL were treated with topotecan to assess its clinical efficacy; in addition, DNA-protein cross-linking was measured after exposure of the cells to topotecan, in an attempt to correlate potential anti-CLL effects with this parameter. The median age of the patients was 63 years; all had received prior therapy with fludarabine and four (33%) were resistant to fludarabine. Four patients (33%) had also received therapy with chlorambucil, and three of them were resistant to this agent. Seven patients (58%) were Rai stage I-II and five (42%) were Rai stage III-IV. Topotecan was given as a 30-minute infusion at a daily dose of 2 mg/m2 for 5 days, and courses were repeated monthly. Cells were obtained from the patients before treatment and exposed to 2 microM topotecan or control in vitro. In addition, cells were obtained from patients after they received the first dose of topotecan and protein-bound DNA was measured with the same technique. RESULTS: No patient responded to therapy with topotecan (95% confidence interval, 0-27%). Nonhematologic toxicity was mild and thrombocytopenia occurred in four of eight patients whose conditions could be evaluated. One patients died of myocardial infarction and another died of fungal pneumonia. DNA-protein cross-linking was detected in all nine patients whose cells were assessed in vitro, with levels of cleavable complex ranging from twofold to 7.5-fold that of the control cells. Only two of eight patients with evaluable conditions had increased cross-linking detectable in circulating cells after the first dose of topotecan, which was consistent with the drug's lack of effect in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Although exposure of cells from patients with CLL to topotecan in vitro at 2 microM resulted in detectable protein-DNA cross-linking, this effect was not seen in patients who received a bolus dose of 2 mg/m2, and no remissions were noted in 12 patients.","[""O'Brien, S"", 'Kantarjian, H', 'Ellis, A', 'Zwelling, L', 'Estey, E', 'Keating, M']","[""O'Brien S"", 'Kantarjian H', 'Ellis A', 'Zwelling L', 'Estey E', 'Keating M']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.

In the past six months, there has been a spate of five chickenpox infections in children with malignancy, all of whom were receiving chemotherapy at that time. METHODS: The cases of 17 children with malignancies, who suffered from varicella-zoster infection during a period of chemotherapy at Taichung Veterans General Hospital were reviewed. RESULTS: The diagnoses of their neoplasms were 12 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 2 lymphoma, 3 solid tumors. The mean age was 6.8 +/- 4.0 year-old (range 3 to 15 year-old). The average duration from chickenpox skin eruption to admission was 3.3 +/- 1.8 days. Four patients suffered from abdominal pain and three of them died soon; three of them suffered from back pain and one died later. Seven of these 11 patients had impaired liver function (GOT > 45 U/L), of whom 4 died later. There were seven patients with pneumonitis, of whom five died later. Among 12 patients with ALL, 3 had absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) < 500/mm3, but only 1 died later; 9 had ALC > 500/mm3, of whom 4 had pneumonitis, and all died later. Four patients developed disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and three of them died later. Seven patients were prescribed acyclovir within three days after first skin eruption, none of these died. Ten patients were prescribed acyclovir three days or more after first skin eruption and five of them died later. Five patients were prescribed intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) within three days after first skin eruption, and none of them died; of the seven patients prescribed IVIG three days or more after first skin eruption, three died later. CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal pain and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) were signs of visceral dissemination. Severe liver function impairment, pneumonitis and DIC were the principal causes of death. Early administration of acyclovir and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) can probably effectively prevent the dissemination of varicella-zoster virus (VZV). While varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) was unavailable, IVIG was still valuable in treating VZV infection.","['Chen, P Y', 'Chu, H Y', 'Shian, W J', 'Shu, S G', 'Chi, C S']","['Chen PY', 'Chu HY', 'Shian WJ', 'Shu SG', 'Chi CS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China (Republic : 1949- ),Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei),Zhonghua yi xue za zhi = Chinese medical journal; Free China ed,0005327,"['0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)', 'X4HES1O11F (Acyclovir)']",IM,"['Acyclovir/therapeutic use', 'Adolescent', 'Chickenpox/*complications/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei). 1994 Dec;54(6):417-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A disadvantage of the splenectomy is the high risk for an overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis (OPSI). Therefore, the partial splenectomy was introduced as an alternative to splenectomy in the staging of Hodgkin's diseases in children. METHODS: During the period 1982-1988, 12 children with Hodgkin's disease underwent a staging laparotomy with partial splenectomy. All patients were preoperatively vaccinated with Pneumococcus vaccine. The first three patients received 44 Gy locoregional radiotherapy, whereas nine patients received 25 Gy locoregional radiotherapy and two courses of MOPP/ABVD (mitoxin, oncovin [vincristine], procarbazine, prednisone/adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, decarbazine). RESULTS: The morbidity was negligible. The pathological stage changed in three patients (25%). During a median follow-up of 6 years (range 4-10), no OPSI was diagnosed. One patient developed a secondary leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Staging laparotomy for Hodgkin's disease is being performed with less frequency because the majority of patients are treated with chemotherapy and low-dose radiation therapy. After splenectomy and chemotherapy regimens with alkylating agents, there is an increased risk for secondary acute leukemia. With partial splenectomy an adequate staging of the disease can be achieved, allowing a more tailored therapy so that systemic chemotherapy will not be used as frequently, resulting in a lower treatment morbidity without decreasing survival.","['Hoekstra, H J', 'Tamminga, R Y', 'Timens, W']","['Hoekstra HJ', 'Tamminga RY', 'Timens W']","['Department of Surgical Oncology, University Hospital Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Surg Oncol,Annals of surgical oncology,9420840,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Postoperative Care', 'Preoperative Care', 'Reoperation', 'Splenectomy/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02303613 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Surg Oncol. 1994 Nov;1(6):480-6. doi: 10.1007/BF02303613.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obvious differences in a patient's ability to withstand cytotoxic therapy may account, in part, for these findings, but the biologic behaviour of the disease in the two age groups appears to be different; relapses are more frequent and cures less common in adults. In fact, age alone appears to be the most important prognostic factor in ALL. The demonstration of the efficacy of bone marrow transplantation in advanced disease as well as the marked improvements in supportive care and the development of effective high-dose cytotoxic preparative regimens, especially those which use total body irradiation, however, have paved the way for transplantation in first complete remission. Formerly, most adult ALL patients who underwent bone marrow transplant did so in relapse, or in second or subsequent remission. In most studies 40-50% of first remission adult patients attain long-term disease-free survival after allogeneic and autologous bone marrow transplant. Relapses are considerably higher in the autologous transplant group when compared to the allogeneic group, but the latter population may experience increased morbidity and mortality due to graft-versus-host disease and opportunistic infection. These differences may reflect the beneficial graft-versus-leukemia effect in the allograft as well as infusion of autologous leukemia cells in the autograft but neither transplant subtype appears superior. Compared to more conventional approaches, however, transplantation may offer improved disease-free survival, although patient selection appears to be significantly influence outcome. These many inherent biases must be noted when comparing markedly different approaches, e.g. transplant versus conventional therapy. The challenge of demonstrating which therapy is superior for adult ALL patients can only be addressed in a well-designed, prospective, randomized trial.","['Lazarus, H M', 'Rowe, J M']","['Lazarus HM', 'Rowe JM']","['Department of Medicine, Ireland Cancer Center, University Hospitals of Cleveland, Case Western Reserve University, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02988834 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 1994;11(2):75-88. doi: 10.1007/BF02988834.,104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

K562 human erythroleukemia cells were exposed to adriamycin or to adriamycin plus vitamin A. Presence of 2.5 to 15 microM all-trans retinol in the cell culture did not impair the cytotoxicity of adriamycin. Rather, an enhanced cell death was observed when cell colony was exposed to both compounds. Additional assays showed that all-trans retinol counteracted the lipoperoxide formation, assayed as malondialdehyde, induced in cell cultures by the redox cycling activity of adriamycin. These data strongly encourage a new therapeuthical approach with safe doses of vitamin A as an adjuvant in cancer chemotherapy.","['Ciaccio, M', 'Tesoriere, L', 'Pintaudi, A M', 'Re, R', 'Vallesi-Cardillo, S', 'Bongiorno, A', 'Livrea, M A']","['Ciaccio M', 'Tesoriere L', 'Pintaudi AM', 'Re R', 'Vallesi-Cardillo S', 'Bongiorno A', 'Livrea MA']","['Istituto di Chimica Biologica, University of Palermo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Biochem Mol Biol Int,Biochemistry and molecular biology international,9306673,"['0 (Lipid Peroxides)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*toxicity', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Lipid Peroxidation/*drug effects', 'Lipid Peroxides/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin A/*toxicity']",1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biochem Mol Biol Int. 1994 Sep;34(2):329-35.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During treatment with Hm, K562 cells constitutively expressed c-myb mRNA, and 50% of them began to synthesize hemoglobin (Hb). Expression of antisense myb RNA reduced the amount of c-myb mRNA, and the percentage of Hb-synthesizing cells was decreased to 20%. In the presence of Epo, c-myb mRNA declined and 20% of K562 cells synthesized Hb regardless of antisense myb RNA expression. It is suggested that constitutive expression of c-myb mRNA is necessary for Hm-induced differentiation, and that a decrease in the amount of c-myb mRNA induced by antisense myb RNA expression suppresses Hm-induced differentiation.

Some of the cell lines were resistant to ADR, MTX or their combinations. A similar pattern was found between the cytotoxicity and the suppression of ODC activity in these cell lines in terms of drug concentrations. In a cell line resistant to one drug, a relatively high concentration of that drug was required to inhibit ODC activity. This effect was independent of the sensitivity of the cells to the other drug. A similar correlation between arrest of growth and the inhibition in the induction of ODC was also observed in human epithelial carcinoma cells. In this case too, the growth of multidrug resistant cells was not affected by vinblastine, neither was the induction of ODC. On the other hand, both the growth and the induction of ODC were inhibited by vinblastine in drug-sensitive cells. These findings suggest that ODC measurements might be used for predicting the chemosensitivity of tumor cells.","['Bachrach, U', 'Shayovitz, A', 'Marom, Y', 'Ramu, A', 'Ramu, N']","['Bachrach U', 'Shayovitz A', 'Marom Y', 'Ramu A', 'Ramu N']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",9216789,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand). 1994 Nov;40(7):957-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, the goal of this research was to study the mechanism of phosphodiester oligonucleotide cellular uptake in Rauscher Red 5-1.5 erythroleukemia cells. An antisense c-myc oligodeoxynucleotide (21 bases) demonstrated biological activity in these cells using two types of proliferation assays and Northern blot analysis, and was internalized as visualized by confocal laser microscopy. Oligonucleotide uptake appeared to be a complex process consisting of surface binding and internalization. Cellular internalization accounted for up to 40% of total uptake and was partially dependent on both a trypsin-sensitive component and cellular energy. Uptake in these cells was nonspecific and did not appear to be due to receptor-mediated endocytosis. Therefore, because oligonucleotide cellular uptake in other cell types apparently involves an endocytic mechanism, the primary mechanism of oligonucleotide internalization may be cell line dependent.","['Wu-Pong, S', 'Weiss, T L', 'Hunt, C A']","['Wu-Pong S', 'Weiss TL', 'Hunt CA']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco 94143.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antisense Res Dev,Antisense research and development,9110698,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Genes, myc', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/ard.1994.4.155 [doi]'],ppublish,Antisense Res Dev. 1994 Fall;4(3):155-63. doi: 10.1089/ard.1994.4.155.,,,,,,['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The function of GMR in these nonhematopoietic cells is unknown. We studied the function of GMR in human melanoma cell lines. Six of seven cell lines tested (clones 1-5 and 3.44 of SK-MEL-131, SK-MEL-188, SK-MEL-23, SK-MEL-22, and SK-MEL-22A) expressed mRNA encoding the membrane-bound and soluble isoforms of the alpha subunit of the GMR. Melanoma cell lines in early stages of differentiation expressed the largest quantities of alpha-subunit mRNA. Although five of these lines expressed trace levels of mRNA encoding the beta subunit of the GMR, Scatchard analysis of equilibrium binding data derived from three of the cell lines showed that they expressed only low-affinity GMR. Clones 3.44 and 1-5 of SK-MEL-131, and SK-MEL-188 cells expressed receptors with a dissociation constant (kd) for GM-CSF in the following ranges: 0.7 to 0.8, 1.2 to 1.8, and 0.4 to 0.8 nmol/L, respectively. GM-CSF stimulated glucose uptake in four of the melanoma cell lines expressing the alpha subunit, presumably through facilitative glucose transporters, as uptake was blocked by cytochalasin B but not cytochalasin E. Stimulation of glucose uptake was transient, with maximum stimulation occurring at approximately 30 minutes in the presence of 1 nmol/L GM-CSF. GM-CSF stimulated glucose uptake 1.4- to 2.0-fold but did not stimulate cell proliferation. These results suggest a metabolic role for the low-affinity GMR in melanoma cell lines and indicate that the alpha subunit of the GMR can signal for increased glucose uptake in nonhematopoietic tumor cells.","['Spielholz, C', 'Heaney, M L', 'Morrison, M E', 'Houghton, A N', 'Vera, J C', 'Golde, D W']","['Spielholz C', 'Heaney ML', 'Morrison ME', 'Houghton AN', 'Vera JC', 'Golde DW']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cytochalasins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Monosaccharide Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '36011-19-5 (cytochalasin E)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Cell Line', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', 'Cytochalasins/pharmacology', 'DNA Primers', 'Deoxyglucose/metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Melanoma/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monosaccharide Transport Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/02/15 00:00,1995/02/15 00:01,['1995/02/15 00:00'],"['1995/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69738-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Feb 15;85(4):973-80.,,,,,"['P30-CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL42107/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA30388/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined 25 purified recombinant growth factors for their ability to initiate and support clonogenic growth of fibroblast colony-forming cells (CFU-F) from adult human bone marrow. Assays were performed using bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) enriched in CFU-F by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) using the monoclonal antibody (MoAb) STRO-1. A serum-deprived assay was developed to avoid components of fetal calf serum (FCS) that may mask or otherwise modify the response of CFU-F to exogenously added factors. L-ascorbate and the glucocorticoid dexamethasone were found to be essential for CFU-F colony development under serum-deprived conditions. Importantly, clonogenic growth of CFU-F in this culture system was absolutely dependent on an exogenous source of growth factor. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) demonstrated the greatest ability to support colony growth. Colony formation was dose-dependent, with half-maximal colony numbers at approximately 0.2 ng/mL for either factor and plateau numbers at concentrations in excess of 1.0 ng/mL. Simultaneous addition of PDGF and EGF had no effect on the number of colonies initiated but resulted in dose-dependent increases in mean colony diameter that were significant (P < or = .05) when compared with the effect of either factor alone or with the size of colonies elicited in control cultures by 20% FCS. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of BMMNC using MoAbs to the alpha chain of the PDGF receptor and to the EGF receptor in combination with the Moab STRO-1 demonstrated constitutive expression of both receptors by greater than 90% on CFU-F. Receptors for insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and nerve growth factor (NGF) were also detected on STRO-1+ CFU-F, but in vitro both IGF-1 and NGF did not support colony growth. This report demonstrates the development of a simple, reproducible, and stringent culture system for the growth and assay of stromal precursors under serum-deprived conditions and represents an important prerequisite for future studies of the role of growth factors in the regulation of stromal cell proliferation, differentiation, and development.","['Gronthos, S', 'Simmons, P J']","['Gronthos S', 'Simmons PJ']","['Matthew Roberts Laboratory, Leukaemia Research Unit, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Reference Values', 'Stromal Cells/*cytology/drug effects']",1995/02/15 00:00,1995/02/15 00:01,['1995/02/15 00:00'],"['1995/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69734-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Feb 15;85(4):929-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathologic consequences of these abnormalities remain unknown. The cyclin-dependent kinase 4 inhibitor (CDKN2) gene, which maps to 9p21, has been implicated by the finding of a high frequency of biallelic deletions in leukemic cell lines. We have determined the incidence of structural abnormalities affecting CDKN2 by DNA blot in a panel of 231 cases of leukemia and lymphoma and 66 cell lines derived from patients with lymphoid malignancies with defined cytogenetic abnormalities. Structural alterations of CDKN2 were seen in 20 (8.3%) of all fresh cases and 10 (15.1%) of all cell lines. Biallelic CDKN2 deletions were seen in 11 of 53 (21%) cases of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). There was no association with any particular cytogenetic abnormality. Biallelic deletions were also found in high-grade and transformed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of both B- and T-cell lineages. In two cases of transformed NHL, analysis of sequential samples showed loss of CDKN2 with transformation. Neither deletions nor rearrangements of the CDKN2 gene were seen in any of the 119 leukemias of mature B or T cells analyzed. Biallelic deletions of CDKN2 were observed in 6 of 13 NHL cell lines. Three of the 6 cases had undergone transformation from low- to high-grade disease: in 2 of these cases it was possible to show that the CDKN2 deletions were present in fresh material from the patient and were therefore not an artifact of in vitro culture. Rearrangements of CDKN2 were seen in 2 cases (4%) of BCP-ALL, in 1 case of B-NHL, and in 1 Burkitt's lymphoma cell line and suggest the presence of a ""hot spot"" for recombination in the vicinity of the CDKN2 gene. These data indicate that the loss of CDKN2 expression may be involved in the pathogenesis of a subset of BCP-ALL, some high-grade NHL, and in the transformation of NHL from low- to high-grade disease. CDKN2 deletions and rearrangements occurred in the absence of detectable cytogenetic changes of chromosome 9p in 25 of 30 (83%) cases. Finally, of 10 cases of BCP-ALL that produced overt, transplantable leukemia in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), seven showed biallelic CDKN2 deletions. In contrast, none of 11 cases that failed to engraft showed biallelic CDKN2 deletions. BCP-ALL cases that lack CDKN2 expression may have a particular propensity to grow in SCID mice.","['Stranks, G', 'Height, S E', 'Mitchell, P', 'Jadayel, D', 'Yuille, M A', 'De Lord, C', 'Clutterbuck, R D', 'Treleaven, J G', 'Powles, R L', 'Nacheva, E']","['Stranks G', 'Height SE', 'Mitchell P', 'Jadayel D', 'Yuille MA', 'De Lord C', 'Clutterbuck RD', 'Treleaven JG', 'Powles RL', 'Nacheva E', 'et al.']","['Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Institute of Cancer Research-Royal Marsden Hospital, Haddow Laboratories, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Exons', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/02/15 00:00,1995/02/15 00:01,['1995/02/15 00:00'],"['1995/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69729-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Feb 15;85(4):893-901.,,,,,,['CDKN2'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic cells from 42 children with newly diagnosed high-risk B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia were inoculated intravenously into CB.17 SCID mice. Mice were killed at 12 weeks or when they became moribund as a result of disseminated leukemia. All mice were necropsied and subjected to a series of laboratory studies to assess their burden of human leukemic cells. Twenty-three patients whose leukemic cells caused histopathologically detectable leukemia in SCID mice had a significantly higher relapse rate than the 19 patients whose leukemic cells did not (estimated 5-year event-free survival: 29.5% v 94.7%; 95% confidence intervals, 11.2% to 50.7% v 68.1% to 99.2%; P < .0001 by log-rank test).

Impaired in vitro T-cell functions have been documented in these patients, and these T-cell dysfunctions contribute to the prolonged immune deficiency after allo-BMT. In the present study, we examined the expression of CD26 as well as the reconstitution of CD26-mediated T-cell costimulation via the CD3 and CD2 pathways at various times in patients aged greater than 18 years after CD6-positive, T-cell depleted allo-BMT. We found that the percentage of CD26- and CD3-positive cells, as well as the levels of expression of both antigens, was lower than in normal controls during the first 4 months after CD6-depleted allo-BMT. Subsequently, the amount of lymphocytes expressing CD3 and CD26 and the quantitative surface expression of CD3 and CD26 were not significantly different in patients and normal controls. Functional studies showed that CD26-mediated T-cell proliferation via the CD3 pathway was considerably improved and almost reached normal levels by 1 year, whereas recovery of CD26-mediated T-cell proliferation via the CD2 pathway was delayed for at least 2 years after CD6-depleted allo-BMT. As CD26 involvement in the regulation of human thymocyte activation is restricted preferentially to the CD3 pathway--unlike its involvement with both CD3 and CD2 pathways of peripheral T cells--our results suggest that the different effects of CD26-mediated costimulation via the CD3 and CD2 pathways after CD6-depleted allo-BMT may be a reflection of peripheral T-cell immaturity in those individuals, similar to that seen in mature medullary thymocytes or cord T lymphocytes.","['Kameoka, J', 'Sato, T', 'Torimoto, Y', 'Sugita, K', 'Soiffer, R J', 'Schlossman, S F', 'Ritz, J', 'Morimoto, C']","['Kameoka J', 'Sato T', 'Torimoto Y', 'Sugita K', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Schlossman SF', 'Ritz J', 'Morimoto C']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'CD2 Antigens/*immunology', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology']",1995/02/15 00:00,1995/02/15 00:01,['1995/02/15 00:00'],"['1995/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69756-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Feb 15;85(4):1132-7.,,,,,"['AI29530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biodistribution studies were performed in 23 patients using 0.5 mg/kg trace 131I-labeled BC8 antibody. The BC8 antibody was cleared rapidly from plasma with an initial disappearance half-time of 1.5 +/- 0.2 hours, presumably reflecting rapid antigen-specific binding. The mean radiation absorbed doses (cGy/mCi131I administered) were as follows: marrow, 7.1 +/- 0.8; spleen, 10.8 +/- 1.4; liver, 2.7 +/- 0.2; lungs, 2.1 +/- 0.1; kidneys, 0.7 +/- 0.1; and total body, 0.4 +/- 0.03. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in relapse had a higher marrow dose (11.4 cGy/mCi) than those in remission (5.2 cGy/mCi; P = .001) because of higher uptake and longer retention of radionuclide in marrow. Twenty patients were treated with a dose of 131I estimated to deliver 3.5 Gy (level 1) to 7 Gy (level 3) to liver, with marrow doses of 4 to 30 Gy and spleen doses of 7 to 60 Gy, followed by 120 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (CY) and 12 Gy total body irradiation (TBI). Nine of 13 patients with AML or refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) and two of seven with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) are alive disease-free at 8 to 41 months (median, 17 months) after BMT. Toxicity has not been measurably greater than that of CY/TBI alone, and the maximum tolerated dose has not been reached. This study demonstrates that with the use of 131I-BC8 substantially greater doses of radiation can be delivered to hematopoietic tissues as compared with liver, lung, or kidney, which may improve the efficacy of marrow transplantation.","['Matthews, D C', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Eary, J F', 'Fisher, D R', 'Durack, L D', 'Bush, S A', 'Hui, T E', 'Martin, P J', 'Mitchell, D', 'Press, O W']","['Matthews DC', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Eary JF', 'Fisher DR', 'Durack LD', 'Bush SA', 'Hui TE', 'Martin PJ', 'Mitchell D', 'Press OW', 'et al.']","['Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle 98104.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacokinetics', 'Bone Marrow/diagnostic imaging', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*methods', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Kidney/diagnostic imaging', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*immunology', 'Liver/diagnostic imaging', 'Lung/diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Radioimmunotherapy/*methods', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Spleen/diagnostic imaging', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1995/02/15 00:00,1995/02/15 00:01,['1995/02/15 00:00'],"['1995/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)69755-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1995 Feb 15;85(4):1122-31.,,,,,"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To confirm that these are the only phagocyte-specific components necessary for oxidase activity in whole cells, the recombinant NADPH oxidase was reconstituted in a heterologous cell line. An undifferentiated multipotent leukemic cell line, K562, which expresses endogenous Rac and the small subunit of the flavocytochrome b558 (p22-phox), was cotransfected with episomal expression vectors containing cDNAs for the three other oxidase components. After 4 days of selection, the complete oxidase system was functionally reconstituted in transfected cells stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate or calcium ionophore. These easily transfected cells provide an ideal model system in which several oxidase components can be genetically manipulated and readily expressed. This system can be used to test the effects of mutations associated with any of the genes affected in chronic granulomatous disease and will facilitate studies on structure-function relationships within several oxidase components.

More recently, D-erythro-sphingosine has been shown to act as an early inducer of dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product (pRb) in the lymphoblastic leukemia cell line MOLT-4 [Chao, R., Khan, W., & Hannun, Y.A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem., 267, 23459-23462]. In the current study, the role of the natural D-erythro-sphingosine in regulation of cell growth and pRb dephosphorylation was evaluated using chemically synthesized pure isomers of sphingosine. Of the four possible stereoisomers of sphingosine, D-erythro-sphingosine was most active in inducing dephosphorylation of pRb protein with an EC50% of 0.6 microM whereas its enantiomer L-erythro-sphingosine was 8-fold less potent with an EC50% of 5 microM. The dose responses for inhibition of cell growth were nearly identical to the EC50% for pRb dephosphorylation with D-erythro-sphingosine causing 50% inhibition at 0.6 microM whereas L-erythro-sphingosine was 5-6-fold less potent. All of the stereoisomers were taken up by the cells, and the greater potency of D-erythro-sphingosine was not due to differences in cellular uptake. The metabolism of D-erythro-sphingosine was also studied to evaluate the possible role of sphingosine metabolites on regulation of retinoblastoma protein.

CD9 appears to play a role in platelet activation and to enhance sensitivity of cells to diphtheria toxin through its association with the diphtheria toxin receptor. Although several studies indicate that treatment of specific hematopoietic cells with the tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), induces CD9 expression, the mechanisms by which CD9 expression is regulated have not been elucidated. Here, we provide evidence that, in HL-60 cells, increases in the level of CD9 protein occur in parallel with TPA-induced differentiation. More than 80% of HL-60 cells exposed to 17 nM TPA become CD9 positive within 24 h. CD9 mRNA levels increase within 8-10 h after starting TPA treatment. Activation of CD9 transcription occurs during the same time period. Both transcriptional activation and accumulation of CD9 mRNA require protein synthesis. However, once CD9 mRNA has accumulated, inhibition of protein synthesis has no effect on its level or rate of turnover. These results suggest that CD9 expression in TPA-treated HL-60 cells is regulated at the transcriptional level and that activation of transcription occurs subsequent to the production of proteins induced as an immediate-early response to TPA. Since CD9 expression is not induced in HL-60TR cells, which respond to TPA but are resistant to its differentiating effects, the results also indicate that CD9 expression may serve as a marker for monocyte/macrophage differentiation of HL-60 cells.","['Xu, M', 'Chen, L', 'Christman, J K']","['Xu M', 'Chen L', 'Christman JK']","['Molecular Biology Program, Michigan Cancer Foundation, Detroit.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD9 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tetraspanin 29)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Methylation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tetraspanin 29', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transcriptional Activation/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1994 Nov;5(11):1225-34.,,,,,"['CA22453/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50909/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PKC-zeta cells expressed a more differentiated phenotype as assessed by changes in morphology, surface antigen expression, and lysosomal enzyme activities and were distinct from parental U937 cells stimulated to differentiate by exposure to phorbol esters. In contrast to parental U937 cells, PKC-zeta cells constitutively expressed mRNA transcripts for c-jun and a low mobility AP-1 binding activity. Thus, PKC-zeta overexpression stimulates a type of phenotypic differentiation that differs significantly from maturation occurring upon activation of other PKC subfamilies induced by phorbol ester treatment.

Association of axl expression with myelogenous leukemias and its expression in primitive hematopoietic cells suggests a role for axl in myeloid biology. To study the cellular function of axl, we constructed a chimeric receptor tyrosine kinase composed of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the EGF receptor and the cytoplasmic domain of axl; this chimera was named EAK for EGFR-Axl-Kinase. The EAK chimeric receptor was expressed in the mouse myeloid progenitor cell line 32D, which is dependent on interleukin 3 (IL-3) for proliferation and survival. Treatment of the 32D-EAK cells with EGF stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of the axl kinase domain and enabled proliferation through EGF rather than IL-3. Thus, axl can effectively couple with mitogenic signaling pathways intrinsic to 32D myeloid cells. Assay of proteins phosphorylated in response to different cytokine treatments showed that IL-3 and EGF exposure produced unique profiles in the 32D-EAK cells. Furthermore, Jak-2 is phosphorylated only in response to IL-3 treatment in these cells. This suggests that IL-3 receptor and axl transduce mitogenic signals through separate pathways. In addition, exposure of cells expressing the chimeric receptor to EGF for 19 days converted the cells to factor-independent growth, a phenomenon not seen with other receptor tyrosine kinases. Generation of this transformed phenotype is absolutely dependent on axl activation by foster ligand. The tyrosine phosphorylation level of the axl kinase domain in the factor-independent subclones is 40-fold greater than the factor-dependent cells. The association of a unique axl phosphorylation level with the factor-independent phenotype suggests that there is a threshold phosphorylation level of the axl kinase for transformation. The fact that activation of the axl receptor leads to transformation of 32D cells suggests that axl can play a role in leukemic conversion of myeloid cells, either through inappropriate expression or improper activation.","['McCloskey, P', 'Pierce, J', 'Koski, R A', 'Varnum, B', 'Liu, E T']","['McCloskey P', 'Pierce J', 'Koski RA', 'Varnum B', 'Liu ET']","['Department of Medicine, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 27599.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (axl receptor tyrosine kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cellular Senescence/physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mitogens/*biosynthesis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1994 Oct;5(10):1105-17.,,,,,['R0I-CA49240-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, neither the relation between the risk of second malignancies and type of adjuvant regimen utilized nor the interaction between chemotherapy and breast irradiation or age of the patients have been described in detail. METHODS: A total of 2,465 patients entered into prospective studies of CMF-based adjuvant chemotherapy carried out at the Milan Cancer Institute between June 1973 and July 1990 were evaluated. The median follow-up was 12.0 years and detailed information about therapy was available for all patients. RESULTS: At 15 years, the cumulative actuarial risk of second malignancies (excluding contralateral breast cancer and basal skin cancer) was 6.7% +/- 0.8% for the total series. The figures were 8.4% +/- 2.9% after local-regional treatment alone, 6.4% +/- 0.9% following CMF, and 5.1% +/- 1.0% following CMF plus Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Farmitalia-Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy). Compared to the general female population, the relative risk following CMF-based adjuvant chemotherapy was 1.29. Three patients, all of whom had received CMF-based chemotherapy, developed acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (cumulative risk 0.23% +/- 0.15%; relative risk 2.3). No differences were evident when breast irradiation was considered, but the cumulative risk of second tumors was slightly higher in women aged > or = 50 years at surgery (7.7% +/- 1.3%) than in younger patients (6.0% +/- 1.0%). CONCLUSIONS: At present, there is no evidence of a significantly increased risk of second malignancies following adjuvant CMF-based chemotherapy such as the one given in this case series. A low risk of acute leukemia was associated with the cumulative total dose of cyclophosphamide administered, and breast irradiation did not enhance this risk. IMPLICATIONS: Our findings suggest that there is no reason to omit alkylating agents from short-term effective adjuvant chemotherapy.","['Valagussa, P', 'Moliterni, A', 'Terenziani, M', 'Zambetti, M', 'Bonadonna, G']","['Valagussa P', 'Moliterni A', 'Terenziani M', 'Zambetti M', 'Bonadonna G']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'CMF protocol']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/adverse effects', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced/mortality/pathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Risk Factors']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a059008 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)63271-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1994 Nov;5(9):803-8. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a059008.,,,['Ann Oncol. 1994 Nov;5(9):785-7.

We show here that, in HL60 cells with Ca2+ stores that had been fully and irreversibly emptied using the endomembrane Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin, both nucleotides produced a biphasic effect on Ca2+ entry, first rapid inhibition and then delayed (about 15 s) activation. ATP was more effective at producing the initial inhibition of Ca2+ entry, whereas UTP was more effective at activating the delayed Ca2+ entry. Previous incubation with UTP desensitized the Ca2+ mobilization and the delayed activation of Ca2+ entry induced by ATP but not the inhibition of Ca2+ entry. The ATP analogue 2-methylthioATP (2-MeSATP) barely mobilized stored Ca2+ but inhibited Ca2+ entry. These results could be explained by the presence of two receptors: (i) a P2u receptor sensitive to ATP and UTP, responsible for activation of phospholipase C and Ca2+ mobilization, early inhibition of Ca2+ entry and delayed activation of Ca2+ entry and (ii) a P2y-like receptor sensitive to ATP and 2-MeSATP which produces only inhibition of Ca2+ entry. The inhibition of Ca2+ entry by nucleotides increased greatly during differentiation. Given that Ca2+ mobilization by nucleotides is not modified by differentiation, this suggests that a component of the mechanism of inhibition of Ca2+ entry is gradually expressed during differentiation of HL60 cells.","['Montero, M', 'Garcia-Sancho, J', 'Alvarez, J']","['Montero M', 'Garcia-Sancho J', 'Alvarez J']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular y Fisiologia, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Valladolid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Terpenes)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', ""35094-46-3 (adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate))"", '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'UT0S826Z60 (Uridine Triphosphate)', 'Y37441OBL1 (2-methylthio-ATP)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Manganese/metabolism', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uridine Triphosphate/*pharmacology']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3050879 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1995 Feb 1;305 ( Pt 3):879-87. doi: 10.1042/bj3050879.,,,,,,,PMC1136341,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of the PAF receptor is modulated by many agents, including those responsible for cell differentiation. We report here that differentiation of a human eosinophilic leukaemia cell line, EoL-1, by sodium n-butyrate is associated with induction of PAF receptor gene expression, as indicated by: PAF receptor mRNA accumulation; increases in the binding of [3H]WEB 2086, a PAF antagonist; analysis of cell-surface expression of PAF receptor protein using a monoclonal anti-(PAF receptor) antibody; and augmentation of PAF-induced increase in the intracellular concentration of calcium. Using cDNA cloning, the receptor expressed in EoL-1 cells was identified as 'Transcript 1', one of two transcripts which was previously reported from human genomic analysis (Mutoh, Bito, Minami, Nakamura, Honda, Izumi, Nakata, Kurachi, Terano and Shimizu (1993) FEBS Lett. 322, 129-134). The PAF-induced calcium response and phosphoinositide turnover were decreased by pertussis toxin (PTX) treatment, suggesting that these signals are coupled largely with PTX-sensitive G-protein(s) in EoL-1 cells. These systems may provide a useful experimental model with which to investigate the relationship between eosinophilic differentiation and PAF receptor induction, and the role of eosinophils in allergic responses.","['Izumi, T', 'Kishimoto, S', 'Takano, T', 'Nakamura, M', 'Miyabe, Y', 'Nakata, M', 'Sakanaka, C', 'Shimizu, T']","['Izumi T', 'Kishimoto S', 'Takano T', 'Nakamura M', 'Miyabe Y', 'Nakata M', 'Sakanaka C', 'Shimizu T']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Azepines)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '0 (platelet activating factor receptor)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '105219-56-5 (WEB 2086)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Azepines/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA, Complementary/chemistry/genetics', '*Gene Expression', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*metabolism/pathology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/biosynthesis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', '*Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Triazoles/metabolism', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3050829 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1995 Feb 1;305 ( Pt 3):829-35. doi: 10.1042/bj3050829.,,['GENBANK/D31736'],,,,,PMC1136334,,,,,,,,,,,

The Children's Cancer Group.,156-60,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of cranial irradiation on neuropsychological test performance evident 9 months after diagnosis. DESIGN: A companion study to a randomized clinical trial (CCG-105). SETTING: Institutions participating in Childrens Cancer Group cooperative treatment trials. PATIENTS: Seventy-four children aged 3.0 to 6.5 years with average-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Children with central nervous system leukemia at the time of diagnosis, preexisting mental retardation, or Down's syndrome or for whom English was not the primary language were not eligible for study. INTERVENTIONS: Children were randomized to receive treatment with one of four systemic chemotherapy regimens and either intrathecal methotrexate sodium during induction and consolidation plus 18 Gy of cranial irradiation or intrathecal methotrexate during induction, consolidation, and maintenance as central nervous system prophylaxis. MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS: The groups were comparable with regard to chronologic age, sex, and family socioeconomic status. Children who received cranial irradiation plus intrathecal methotrexate scored significantly lower on the McCarthy Motor Scale (P < .05) and the Token Test (P < .05) than children who received intrathecal methotrexate alone. The groups did not differ significantly on the McCarthy General Cognitive Index, Developmental Test of Visual Motor Integration, or Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that the combined effects of cranial irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate therapy on neuropsychological performance may be evident in young children as early as 9 months after diagnosis. Follow-up assessment of these children will reveal whether these effects remain constant, intensify, or resolve.","['MacLean, W E Jr', 'Noll, R B', 'Stehbens, J A', 'Kaleita, T A', 'Schwartz, E', 'Whitt, J K', 'Cantor, N L', 'Waskerwitz, M', 'Ruymann, F', 'Novak, L J']","['MacLean WE Jr', 'Noll RB', 'Stehbens JA', 'Kaleita TA', 'Schwartz E', 'Whitt JK', 'Cantor NL', 'Waskerwitz M', 'Ruymann F', 'Novak LJ', 'et al.']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Neurol,Archives of neurology,0372436,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain/*radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', '*Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*psychology/*radiotherapy', 'Psychomotor Performance']",1995/02/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1001/archneur.1995.00540260060017 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Neurol. 1995 Feb;52(2):156-60. doi: 10.1001/archneur.1995.00540260060017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon reaching terminal maturation these cells rapidly undergo apoptosis. Using three chemotherapeutic agents with known apoptosis inducing capability, the susceptibility of RA - and PMA - differentiated cultures was monitored by morphological means and flow cytometry. We observed that as cells with morphological characteristics of mature granulocytes/monocytes became more prominent in the populations, there was an increased resistance to apoptosis. The inhibition of the typical internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. However, activation of a CA+/Mg+ independent endonuclease in isolated nuclei was not affected. Flow immunocytometry revealed reduced levels of c-myc and bcl-2 oncoproteins in RA and PMA treated cells. These observations suggest that HL-60 derived granulocytes/monocytes become increasingly resistant to the induction of apoptosis and that this resistance is independent of c-myc and bcl-2 expression. Together these results demonstrate that the phenotypic changes associated with RA and PMA induced differentiation, inhibit a critical step in the progression of apoptosis.","['McCarthy, J V', 'Fernandes, R S', 'Gotter, T G']","['McCarthy JV', 'Fernandes RS', 'Gotter TG']","[""Department of Biology, St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, Co.

Resistance to drugs either belonging to the MDR type (Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Mitoxantrone) or to the non-MDR type (Methotrexate) was generated in vivo in order to mimic the clinical situation. All resistant sublines expressed the mdr1 gene and the p-glycoprotein determined on m-RNA level or immunohistochemically, while no expression was registered in the parent P388. The rhodamine 123 fluorescence as marker for the energy dependent drug efflux pump was decreased only in the MDR-sublines, while the parent P388 and the Methotrexate-resistant line retained 100% or 90% of the dye, respectively. This indicates that the rhodamine efflux is a more function-related marker for MDR than the mdr1 gene and the pgp. The in vivo characterization of the sublines as regards their sensitivity to cytostatics revealed a clear-cut cross-resistance to MDR drugs in the MDR-lines, while the Methotrexate resistant subline was only cross-resistant to Cytarabine. In each resistant subline collateral sensitivity to certain but different cytostatics was observed. Experiments to overcome resistance by concomitant treatment with the modulators Nifedipine, Verapamil, Cyclosporin A and Chloroquin led to only limited success. The sublines P388/Mitox, P388/Vinc and P388/MTX developed immunogenicity which was never registered in the original P388. Vaccination with lethally irradiated drug-resistant cells resulted in a substantial rejection of viable tumor cells of the same line. With the P388/Mitox and P388/Vinc also an over-cross immunization was possible. This generation of immunogenicity as a concomitant characteristic of resistance should be considered as therapeutic potential also in the treatment of clinical cancer.","['Fichtner, I', 'Stein, U', 'Hoffmann, J', 'Winterfeld, G', 'Pfeil, D', 'Hentschel, M']","['Fichtner I', 'Stein U', 'Hoffmann J', 'Winterfeld G', 'Pfeil D', 'Hentschel M']","['Max-Delbruck-Center of Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Expression', 'Immunocompetence', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Models, Biological', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1994 Sep-Oct;14(5A):1995-2003.,,,,,,['mdr1'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Examples of this include leukemia and duodenal atresia in trisomy 21. This paper presents a linkage analysis method for using trisomic individuals to map genes for such traits. It is based on a very general gene-specific dosage model that posits that the trait is caused by specific effects of different alleles at one or a few loci and that duplicate copies of ""susceptibility"" alleles inherited from the nondisjoining parent give increased likelihood of having the trait. Our mapping method is similar to identity-by-descent-based mapping methods using affected relative pairs and also to methods for mapping recessive traits using inbred individuals by looking for markers with greater than expected homozygosity by descent. In the trisomy case, one would take trisomic individuals and look for markers with greater than expected homozygosity in the chromosomes inherited from the nondisjoining parent. We present statistical methods for performing such a linkage analysis, including a test for linkage to a marker, a method for estimating the distance from the marker to the trait gene, a confidence interval for that distance, and methods for computing power and sample sizes. We also resolve some practical issues involved in implementing the methods, including how to use partially informative markers and how to test candidate genes.","['Feingold, E', 'Lamb, N E', 'Sherman, S L']","['Feingold E', 'Lamb NE', 'Sherman SL']","['Division of Biostatistics, Emory University School of Public Health, Atlanta, GA 30322.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hum Genet,American journal of human genetics,0370475,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Chromosome Mapping/*methods', 'Diploidy', 'Genetic Linkage/*genetics', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genotype', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Statistics as Topic/methods', 'Trisomy/*genetics']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Hum Genet. 1995 Feb;56(2):475-83.,,,,,"['N01-HD92907/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-HG 00470-01A1/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC1801125,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of FNABs of lymph nodes on 1,103 patients, performed over a 14-year period, from 1978 to 1992, are presented. The patients ranged in age from 1 to 90 years. Cervical nodes were the site sampled most frequently (47%). Of all the aspirates, 593 were diagnosed cytologically as malignant, 61 as suspicious for malignancy and 329 as benign. The material was classified as unsatisfactory in 120 cases. Aspirates from supraclavicular nodes were most likely to be malignant (85%), followed by those from deep nodes (67%). The most challenging lesions to assess using FNAB were lymphomas, accounting for 15 of the 23 false negatives. Most of these were related to difficulty in the interpretation of well-differentiated neoplasms in the early years of this study, prior to the use of immunocytochemistry. Sampling errors accounted for eight false-negative diagnoses; they included all the cases of metastatic carcinomas that had been missed. There were only three false-positive diagnoses; two of these involved the misinterpretation of lipid-rich lesions as metastatic clear cell carcinomas. The results of this study support the accuracy of FNAB and its value in investigating lymphadenopathies. FNAB of nodes provides a high level of diagnostic accuracy, as shown by the 3.4% false-negative and 0.9% false-positive rates. Lymphoid marker studies of cytologic material greatly enhance our ability to diagnose and properly classify lymphomas and reduce the false-negative rate.","['Steel, B L', 'Schwartz, M R', 'Ramzy, I']","['Steel BL', 'Schwartz MR', 'Ramzy I']","['Department of Pathology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy, Needle/*standards', 'Carcinoma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'False Negative Reactions', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/classification/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Sarcoma/diagnosis/pathology']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Cytol. 1995 Jan-Feb;39(1):76-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported that in comparison to normal cells, there is a substantial increase in frequency of intragenic deletions at an endogenous locus (HPRT) in FA lymphoblasts. Taken together with the increased chromosomal instability, these observations indicated that the wild-type FA gene(s) plays an important role in the maintenance of the genomic integrity. To obtain information on the mechanism(s) underlying the genomic rearrangements in FA, the breakpoint sites of deletions in 11 FA-derived HPRT- mutants were analyzed. The results indicate that a significant proportion of deletions involving a loss of a given exon are identical and that two deletions of different size have the same 3' breakpoint. Interestingly, it appears that in most of the mutants there is a common deletion signal sequence, which suggests that the mutations in the FA gene(s) may lead to an aberrant site-specific cleavage activity that might be responsible for the deletion proneness and the chromosomal instability characteristic of the FA pathology. From the similarity or even identity of the signal sequence at some of the breakpoints with the consensus heptamer which directs cleavage and joining in the assembly of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes, we speculate that steps in common with the V(D)J recombinational process may be illegitimately involved in FA cells.","['Laquerbe, A', 'Moustacchi, E', 'Fuscoe, J C', 'Papadopoulo, D']","['Laquerbe A', 'Moustacchi E', 'Fuscoe JC', 'Papadopoulo D']","['Unite Recherche Associee 1292 du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'Y6UY8OV51T (Trioxsalen)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Exons/genetics', 'Fanconi Anemia/enzymology/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Deletion/*genetics', 'Trioxsalen/pharmacology', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1995/01/31 00:00,1995/01/31 00:01,['1995/01/31 00:00'],"['1995/01/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/31 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/31 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.92.3.831 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Jan 31;92(3):831-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.3.831.,,,,,,,PMC42714,,,,,,,,,,,

In patients with -7/del(7q) (n = 6), leukemia was preceded by MDS in half of the cases, although they had diverse FAB subtypes. Thirty-seven patients had miscellaneous abnormalities. Despite a high CR rate, patients with t(8;21) had a very poor survival: only one child was event-free at 3 years from diagnosis. One third of patients with t(15;17) died during induction. Those eight who achieved CR fared well: only two relapsed, and six were event-free survivors. Patients with inv(16) had a high remission rate and a long survival: five children were in CR 20 to 136 months.

We showed that increased levels of TNF receptors (TNFR) induced by IFN-alpha treatment were associated with stimulation of high M(r) TNFR. Low M(r) TNFR were not detected on Eskol cells or hairy cells, either before or after IFN-alpha treatment. Furthermore, the expression of TNF mRNA increased in Eskol cells treated with IFN-alpha for 1-4 h as compared to control cells. In vivo experiments showed that IFN-alpha given to HCL patients induced both TNF mRNA expression in hairy cells and secretion of active TNF protein in patients' serum.

We investigated the expression of bFGF and FGF-receptors (FGF-Rs) in leukemic cell lines of various hematopoietic lineages. Three protein isoforms of bFGF of approximately 18, 22 and 24 kDa were detected in the myeloid cell line K562, but not in myelomonocytic or lymphoid (T or B) cell lines. In vitro-induced differentiation of K562 cells did not change the pattern of expression of the different bFGF isoforms. Accordingly, the mRNA of bFGF was found expressed in K562, but not in other leukemic lines tested, as assayed by reverse transcript amplification (RT-PCR). Using the same technique, we searched for the presence of high affinity FGF-Rs on these cells: in eight out of ten cell lines tested, mRNA for at least one FGF-R among FGF-R1, FGF-R3 or FGF-R4 was expressed, whereas FGF-R2 was never detected. We found that two cell lines were responsive to bFGF in different biological assays: (i) in K562 myeloid cells induced to differentiate by hemin, preincubation with bFGF and heparin increased cell viability and decreased hemin-induced DNA fragmentation, without affecting erythroid differentiation; and (ii) in U937 monocytic cells, the production of plasminogen activator was increased by bFGF or aFGF in combination with heparin. Binding experiments with 125I-bFGF (up to 200 pM) in the presence of heparin revealed high affinity receptors on the K562 and U937 cell lines (1177 +/- 440 and 392 +/- 184 sites/cell, Kd = 61.7 +/- 8.6 and 43.1 +/- 13.5 pM, respectively). Thus our results strongly suggest that cells of hematopoietic origin could express functional FGF-receptors.","['Allouche, M', 'Bayard, F', 'Clamens, S', 'Fillola, G', 'Sie, P', 'Amalric, F']","['Allouche M', 'Bayard F', 'Clamens S', 'Fillola G', 'Sie P', 'Amalric F']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire Eucaryote, CNRS, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*analysis/genetics/pharmacology', 'Heparin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/*analysis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/biosynthesis']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jan;9(1):77-86.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report transformation of the immortalized cell line FDC-P1 by overexpression of murine c-fms, the receptor for macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Three types of cell lines were obtained following expression of c-fms in FDC-P1 cells. The first type of cell line (FD-c-fms) was dependent on stimulation by M-CSF to induce cell proliferation and also underwent limited monocytic/macrophage differentiation in response to M-CSF. The second type of cell line (FD-c-fmsi) was able to proliferate in serum-containing cultures without stimulation by exogenous hemopoietic regulators. Stimulation of the FD-c-fmsi cell lines with M-CSF suppressed proliferation compared to cultures of unstimulated cells and induced monocytic/macrophage differentiation. The third type of cell line (FD-c-fms) was autonomous, failed to differentiate in response to M-CSF and secreted M-CSF into the culture medium, suggesting an autocrine mechanism of transformation. All three types of cell lines demonstrated varying degrees of suppression of cell proliferation when stimulated by the combination of M-CSF and GM-CSF.

We have recently demonstrated that the rate of cell division of BCP ALL cells increases when cultured in direct contact with BM stromal cells. In this study we describe a new method for examining the direct binding of BM stromal cells and BCP ALL cells at a cellular level. For this binding assay, BCP ALL cells from six patient samples were first stained with the lipophilic fluorescent probe PKH 26 GL and mixed with BM stromal cells in suspension. In all cases, aggregates between BCP ALL and BM stromal cells were identified by flow cytometry and isolated. Using this assay we have examined some of the mechanisms involved in this binding process. The pattern of aggregate formation at various leukemic/stromal cell ratios showed that the aggregate formation increased by increasing the number of either cell type and that the binding could not be saturated. This suggests that the interaction between these cells is an equilibrium reaction. Functional studies showed that the majority of BCP ALL-BM stromal cell binding is dependent on the presence of divalent cations and requires active cellular metabolism. Finally, by use of inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (moAbs) directed against cell adhesion molecules including anti-CD29, VCAM and CD18, we have demonstrated that the involvement of these molecules in the direct cellular interactions could be detected by this method. However, the maximum inhibition observed was 36% which suggests either that the avidity is low or that other adhesion molecules are involved. The data show that the use of flow cytometric analysis of aggregate formation (rather than cell binding to intact cell layers) allows the study of cell interactions at the individual cell level which can reveal additional cellular adhesion mechanisms.","['Ashley, D M', 'Bol, S J', 'Tucker, D P', 'Waugh, C M', 'Kannourakis, G']","['Ashley DM', 'Bol SJ', 'Tucker DP', 'Waugh CM', 'Kannourakis G']","[""L.A.R.C.H.

Further studies with ddA/CF revealed that cytotoxicity occurs only if ddA is supplied from the Calbiochem or Fluka companies. ddA supplied from other commercial sources (Pharmacia, Sigma) or the NCI Pharmaceutical Resources Branch is non-cytotoxic. To explore the basis for this difference, ddA from various sources was subjected to reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The Calbiochem and Fluka ddA had a unique HPLC peak, with a retention time of 12.8 min, representing a contaminant of less than 0.1% of the bulk material applied to the C-18 HPLC column. Study of all HPLC peaks resolved from the bulk material showed cytotoxic activity in only the 12.8 min peak. To identify the nature of the unknown compound, we compared HPLC characteristics of the synthetic intermediates and byproducts of ddA synthesis to the peak eluting at 12.8 min. Of these, only 3'-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin) had similar HPLC characteristics. In addition, in the co-presence of CF, cordycepin was specifically cytotoxic (IC50 < 0.5 microM) for all TdT-positive cell lines tested. Cytotoxicity was seen in TdT-negative cells only at concentrations 10-100-fold higher. We conclude that our previous report on ddA/CF as a TdT-specific cytotoxic combination was due to contamination of the ddA supplied by Calbiochem by cordycepin. ddA itself is non-cytotoxic for TdT-positive cells. Cordycepin in the co-presence of an ADA inhibitor may be effective in the treatment of TdT-positive hematological malignancies.","['Koc, Y', 'McCaffrey, R']","['Koc Y', 'McCaffrey R']","['Martin H.

This prompted us to investigate the tumor tissues from 17 patients with Leu4-negative peripheral T-cell lymphoma, including eight with nasal T-cell lymphoma (NTCL), for the expression of CD3 epsilon. The tissues were immunohistologically stained with rabbit anti-human CD3 epsilon antibody. The expression of CD3 epsilon was more frequent in the tissues of nasal lymphoma than in the non-nasal lymphoma tissues: specimens from six of eight of the NTCL patients expressed CD3 epsilon, while only one of nine of the non-NTCL patients did so. The NTCL patients presented clinically with lethal midline granuloma, had histologic findings of tumor necrosis and angioinvasion, and had a peculiar CD2+, Leu4-, CD3 epsilon+, CD5-, CD7+, CD45RO+, CD4-, CD8-, beta F1-, T-cell receptor (TRC) delta 1-, CD56+ phenotype. This peculiar phenotype seems to be closely associated with NTCL. No clonal rearrangement of the TCR genes was detected in three NTCL patients examined.

The phenotypic correspondence of our nasal tumors to adult activated NK cells supports this possibility, together with their lack of clonal rearrangement of the TCR genes.","['Ohno, T', 'Yamaguchi, M', 'Oka, K', 'Miwa, H', 'Kita, K', 'Shirakawa, S']","['Ohno T', 'Yamaguchi M', 'Oka K', 'Miwa H', 'Kita K', 'Shirakawa S']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (CD3 Complex)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CD3 Complex/*analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nose Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jan;9(1):44-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate this issue, we studied the in vitro response to IFN-alpha of a variant type of HCL, recently reported by us as the Japanese variant. Their clinical response to IFN-alpha (remission rate 35.7% in the multicenter study in Japan) was inferior to that of typical HCL (remission rate 80%; mean of previous reports). We found that both low molecular weight B-cell growth factor (L-BCGF) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) induced the proliferation of HC from patients with the Japanese variant, as well as those with typical HCL. While, in typical HCL, IFN-alpha strongly inhibited the in vitro proliferation of HC induced by L-BCGF and TNF-alpha, the inhibitory effect of IFN-alpha on L-BCGF and TNF-alpha-induced proliferation was low in most Japanese variant patients. These in vitro findings may be related to the extent of clinical efficacy of IFN-alpha in the Japanese variant, obtained in the multicenter study. Since the degree of inhibition was parallel in L-BCGF- and TNF-alpha-induced proliferation in three patients examined simultaneously, it appeared that the antiproliferative effect of IFN-alpha is not specific to individual growth factors.

Most previously described techniques are highly sensitive but also too laborious for application in a routine setting. Here we describe a technique based on the determination of IgH VHDJH and TCR V delta 2D delta 3 junctional regions by PCR/cycle sequencing analysis and hybridization of junctional region oligonucleotide probes in a standard liquid hybridization (LH) assay. We systematically analyzed the applicability of this simplified approach for the monitoring of MRD in a large patient group. IgH VHDJH and TCR V delta 2D delta 3 junctional regions were amplified from presentation bone marrow samples obtained from 53 childhood B-precursor ALL patients. The combined approach allowed the identification of at least one tumor marker for 49/53 (92.5%) of patients. A total of 75 oligonucleotide probes (54 DJH, 21 V delta 2D delta 3) was tested in the LH assay. Sensitivity range was 10(-2)-10(-5) and 10(-4)-10(-5) for DJH and V delta 2D delta 3 junctional region probes, respectively. A sensitivity of at least one malignant cell in 10(4) normal cells was obtained for 84.8% of evaluable patients, applying on average 1.1 IgH and 0.47 TCR delta probes per patient. Comparison to a method based on the use of initial PCR product as clone-specific probe showed that oligonucleotide LH was one log more sensitive in six of nine patients tested. The presented technique allows the monitoring of MRD with acceptable sensitivities in over 90% of childhood B-precursor ALL patients. Moreover, the technique is suitable for prospective patient studies in a routine setting as it is fast, reproducible and makes use of a standard hybridization protocol for different oligonucleotide probes.","['Steenbergen, E J', 'Verhagen, O J', 'van Leeuwen, E F', 'van den Berg, H', 'Behrendt, H', 'von dem Borne, A E', 'van der Schoot, C E']","['Steenbergen EJ', 'Verhagen OJ', 'van Leeuwen EF', 'van den Berg H', 'Behrendt H', 'von dem Borne AE', 'van der Schoot CE']","['Central Laboratory, The Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Child', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jan;9(1):216-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Except for the MLL primer all primers used during the second round of nested-PCR carried a characteristic fluorescence label at their 5'-end. Agarose gel analysis of the PCR products was sufficient to discriminate between the absence of any of the four MLL rearrangements and the presence of at least one of them. Discrimination of the four different MLL translocation partner genes was not possible by agarose gel analysis due to a molecular heterogeneity of the 11q23 breakpoints resulting in PCR products of variable size. For this reason, automatic fluorescence-based DNA-fragment analysis was used to exactly define the MLL translocation partner genes if a positive result had been obtained by agarose gel analysis. In patients with leukemia, this assay may enable a fast and highly sensitive detection of different 11q23 abnormalities, which usually correlate with poor clinical prognosis.","['Repp, R', 'Borkhardt, A', 'Haupt, E', 'Kreuder, J', 'Brettreich, S', 'Hammermann, J', 'Nishida, K', 'Harbott, J', 'Lampert, F']","['Repp R', 'Borkhardt A', 'Haupt E', 'Kreuder J', 'Brettreich S', 'Hammermann J', 'Nishida K', 'Harbott J', 'Lampert F']","[""Children's Hospital, University of Giessen, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jan;9(1):210-5.,,"['GENBANK/L04284', 'GENBANK/L04285', 'GENBANK/L13744', 'GENBANK/L13773', 'GENBANK/U02478']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-nine cases were analyzed for rearrangements of the immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes. All precursor B-cell ALLs (12 cases) contained rearranged Ig heavy-chain (JH) region which was biallelic in 92% of these tumors. In addition to JH rearrangements, TCR delta, beta and gamma rearrangements were observed in 80, 40 and 30% of these cases, respectively. TCR genes were invariably rearranged in T-cell ALLs (11 cases). A small fraction (2/11) of T-cell ALL showed concurrent IgJH rearrangement which was monoallelic. Simultaneous rearrangement of IgJH and TCR genes was also observed in both cases of biphenotypic ALL (coexpressing B and T markers). We observed marked heterogeneity in the pattern of rearrangement of antigen receptor genes in mixed-lineage leukemias (ALL coexpressing myeloid-associated markers), including the retention of germline configuration in two cases. Rearrangements of the ALL-1 gene were confined to the leukemias that demonstrated lineage infidelity. Mutations in p53 were infrequent and were present in only three of 47 ALL cases (6%) analyzed; two of these were mixed-lineage leukemias.

Stage distribution for Hodgkin's disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) showed a relatively high proportion of advanced stage disease. Histological analysis demonstrated a preponderance of lymphocyte predominance and mixed cellularity cases in Hodgkin's disease, and 2/3 of the NHL patients had small, non-cleaved cell lymphoma. Children fell into three main ethnic groups based on the origin/nationality of their parents: Group 1: UAE nationals and Omanis; Group 2: other Arabs; Group 3: Indian/Pakistani (subcontinental) origin. When compared for the relative proportion of leukaemia/lymphoma/other tumours, children of subcontinental origin had significantly more acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and less lymphoma than the other two ethnic groups.

The high-affinity receptors of this class are lacking intrinsic tyrosine kinase domains. The GM-CSF receptor consists of alpha and beta subunits. The beta subunit is shared with the receptors of IL-3 and IL-5. In addition to the membrane bound forms the receptors have been found to possess soluble isoforms. Since retroviral infection of the human GM-CSF dependent cell line, TF-1, leads to factor independent growth by increased expression of the GM-CSF receptor alpha chain in a subgroup of infected clones, we were interested in studying the role of this chain in human AML. Further considering that a point mutation in the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin receptor, also a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily, resulted in constitutive activation of a murine cell line, we investigated the possibility that a point mutation of the GM-CSF receptor was responsible for autonomous growth of AML cells. We sequenced a segment of the receptor coding for the extracellular domain of the alpha subunit. cDNA was prepared from peripheral blood or bone marrow cells from 24 patients with AML, from four patients with MDS and from three human myeloid cell lines. The region of interest was amplified with two rounds of PCR reactions with nested primers, covering five overlapping fragments, and directly sequenced using a non-radioactive technique.

We now report on the ability of the reconstituted extracellular matrix, Matrigel, to promote the formation of subcutaneous tumors in non-irradiated scid mice by a CD10- pre-B ALL cell line termed G2. Lymphatic tumors infiltrating the dermis were seen in all eight mice sacrificed 10-13 weeks after the co-injection of G2 cells and Matrigel but in only 2/8 mice injected with leukemic cells alone. Infiltration of bone marrow, spleen, thymus, lung and liver was observed earlier and was more extensive in the Matrigel-treated group. The tumor cells derived from Matrigel-treated mice could be passaged in vitro and their colony-forming ability was higher than that of the original G2 line. When re-injected intravenously into non-irradiated scid mice, the tumor cells invaded the thymus earlier than did the G2 cells. The expression of CD10/neutral endopeptidase was induced at high levels in all tumors, in Matrigel or non Matrigel-treated animals. This up-regulation was transient as the tumor variants grown in vitro or in vivo lost expression of CD10. However, 6-8 weeks later, induction of CD10 was observed on both tumor variants and parental G2 cells growing in the thymus and at a lower level on cells in bone marrow and spleen. Culturing G2 cells in vitro at high density or in the presence of documented growth-promoting cytokines such as IL-3, IL-6, IL-7, and GM-CSF did not stimulate the expression of CD10 mRNA.

In order to identify cellular changes that correlate with progression to full transformation in v-abl transformed lymphoblasts Abelson virus (A-MuLV)-infected murine bone marrow was plated over a pre-established stromal feeder layer. Shortly after A-MuLV infection, transformed lymphoblasts were poorly oncogenic, but over time, progressed in a stepwide manner to a more oncogenic state. The transformants first acquired the ability to grow efficiently in agar, but only over the feeder layer. They next progressed to efficient feeder-independent growth in liquid culture, and then to efficient feeder-independent growth in soft agar. Cell lines that reached the advanced stage of feeder-independent agar growth showed increased detection by antiphosphotyrosine Western blot of the GAP-associated p62 phosphoprotein as well as of a 55 kDa phosphoprotein while detection of the P160 v-abl phosphoprotein remained constant throughout all stages of progression. Although the identity of the p55 phosphoprotein and the mechanism by which detection of p55 and p62 phosphoproteins change on the Western blots during tumor progression are unknown, the data demonstrate that these changes strongly correlate with the stage of progression of v-abl-transformed cells and raise the possibility that these changes may play a role in tumor progression in this model.","['Clark, S S', 'Liang, Y']","['Clark SS', 'Liang Y']","['Department of Human Oncology, University of Wisconsin, School of Medicine, Madison.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Dok1 protein, mouse)', '0 (GAP-associated protein p62)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Culture Techniques', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*etiology/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/chemistry/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phosphoproteins/*analysis', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jan;9(1):165-74.,,,,,"['CA09471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA52142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether this effect is accompanied by changes in the expression of the protooncogenes c-myc and c-myb. Treatment of HL-60 cells with aclarubicin, 50 nM, caused a rapid decrease in c-myc and c-myb mRNA levels within 1 h and 2 h, respectively. In parallel, we demonstrated a strong induction of superoxide-anion production on day 8 of treatment. The kinetics of the effect of aclarubicin on c-myc and c-myb expression were comparable to those associated with the dimethylsulfoxide-induced granulocytic differentiation in this cell line, or to those observed following a chase with actinomycin D, 4 microM. Since aclarubicin partially inhibited total- and poly(A)(+)-RNA synthesis, this macromolecular synthesis inhibition may be causally related to the decrease in c-myc and c-myb mRNA levels. In contrast, the conventional anthracycline doxorubicin, which did not initiate differentiation, failed to affect c-myc or c-myb mRNA levels even in high cytotoxic concentrations, indicating that the suppression of c-myc and c-myb mRNA levels may be an early differentiation-related effect of aclarubicin. On the other hand, actinomycin D, 12.5 nM, and novobiocin, 300 microM, two other known inducers of granulocytic differentiation in HL-60 cells, did not induce an early decrease in c-myb or c-myc expression. Therefore, the immediate suppression of c-myc and c-myb mRNA levels, apparently, is not an obligatory step in chemically induced myeloid differentiation in HL-60 cells, but the common phenomenon in DMSO- and aclarubicin-induced differentiation.","['Stocker, U', 'Schaefer, A', 'Marquardt, H']","['Stocker U', 'Schaefer A', 'Marquardt H']","['Department of Toxicology, Hamburg University Medical School, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '17EC19951N (Novobiocin)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Genes, myc/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Novobiocin/pharmacology', 'Oncogenes/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis/biosynthesis', 'Superoxides/metabolism']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jan;9(1):146-54.,,,,,,"['c-myb', 'c-myc']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Complete remission is obtained by inducing granulocytic differentiation of the leukemic cells. To date, the exact mechanism through which ATRA exerts its differentiating effect is not known. The present investigation was initiated to characterize ATRA intracellular concentrations achieved in human myeloid leukemic cells in relation to their different sensitivity to ATRA differentiating effect. During the first 24 h of incubation, a significant decrease of ATRA in the culture medium and a marked increase in the intracellular concentrations were observed. Maximal uptake by the leukemic cells was reached within minutes, with levels between 20 and 260 pmol/10(6) cells (median = 100). Interestingly, a correlation between ATRA-induced differentiation and the intracellular ATRA concentration achieved was observed. In fact, patients with intracellular levels below 60 pmol/10(6) cells defined slow uptakers, never exceeded 40% differentiated cells at day 3. On the other hand, cells with 2-4-fold higher concentration (100-250 pmol/10(6) cells) achieved 100% differentiated cells at day 3.

The bcl-2 protein promotes cell survival by preventing the onset of apoptosis or programmed cell death following growth-factor deprivation. Bcl-2 has also been shown to be responsible for chemo-resistance in human leukaemic cell lines. Here we have investigated the role of bcl-2 expression in mediating resistance to apoptosis induced by cytosine arabinoside in vitro. The blasts from 17 AML patients exhibiting autonomous growth in a blast cell colony assay and expressing high levels of bcl-2 protein were studied. Incubation of the blasts with antisense oligonucleotides directed against bcl-2 mRNA resulted in a significant decrease in expression of the bcl-2 protein in seven of the 17 samples. In these seven cases the decreased expression of bcl-2 was accompanied by increased apoptosis and the susceptibility of the blasts to apoptosis induced by Ara-C was increased in the presence of bcl-2 antisense. As a high level of bcl-2 defines a group of AML patients who exhibit a poor response to chemotherapy, the demonstration that chemosensitivity of a significant proportion of these patients can be increased by bcl-2 antisense suggests this approach may have clinical potential.","['Keith, F J', 'Bradbury, D A', 'Zhu, Y M', 'Russell, N H']","['Keith FJ', 'Bradbury DA', 'Zhu YM', 'Russell NH']","['Department of Haematology, Nottingham City Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jan;9(1):131-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In each of the four cases neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils and monocytes may show trisomy 8 or 9, whereas lymphocytes resulted disomic. The comparison between leukocytes morphology and genotype suggests that the supernumerary chromosome does not influence cellular differentiation and maturation. We conclude that FISH analysis of PB leukocytes of patients with CMML is informative when studying the clonality of the disease. Chromosomal abnormalities seem to involve a hematopoietic cell committed to myeloid but not lymphoid differentiation. Trisomies 8 and 9 seem to confer some proliferative advantage without influencing the morphologic characteristics of leukocytes. Other causes will be investigated to explain dysmorphisms of neutrophils and monocytes typical of this disease.","['Fugazza, G', 'Bruzzone, R', 'Dejana, A M', 'Gobbi, M', 'Ghio, R', 'Patrone, F', 'Rattenni, S', 'Sessarego, M']","['Fugazza G', 'Bruzzone R', 'Dejana AM', 'Gobbi M', 'Ghio R', 'Patrone F', 'Rattenni S', 'Sessarego M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Aged', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Female', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Trisomy']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jan;9(1):109-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The St Jude Children's Research Hospital experience, 1962 through 1992.",633-7,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a racial difference in prognosis among childhood cancers. DESIGN: An overall (30-year) survival analysis by race was followed by separate studies for ""early"" and ""recent"" treatment eras, defined by time points at which significantly improved outcome was demonstrated for specific tumor types. Stratified analyses were performed to adjust for recognized prognostic features. SETTING: Pediatric oncology research and treatment center. PATIENTS: The study included 798 black and 4507 white children with newly diagnosed malignancies treated from January 1962 through June 1992. These patients were accepted for treatment regardless of their financial status and were enrolled on disease-specific protocols. RESULTS: Across the 30-year study period, black children had a significantly poorer rate of survival than white children (P < .001, log-rank test). In the early treatment era, a significant difference was seen for all forms of cancer combined (P < .001), with 10-year Kaplan-Meier estimates (+/- SE) of 37% +/- 3% for black children and 50% +/- 1% for white children. This difference largely reflected the poorer prognosis of black children with the most common childhood cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In the recent treatment era, there were no significant differences in treatment outcome by race for specific disease categories or for all forms of cancer combined. Ten-year survival rates were 67% +/- 6% for black children and 66% +/- 3% for white children, indicating a significantly greater improvement in the former group. CONCLUSION: With equal access to effective contemporary treatment, black children with cancer fare as well as white children when treated with protocol-based therapy at a pediatric oncology research center.","['Pui, C H', 'Boyett, J M', 'Hancock, M L', 'Pratt, C B', 'Meyer, W H', 'Crist, W M']","['Pui CH', 'Boyett JM', 'Hancock ML', 'Pratt CB', 'Meyer WH', 'Crist WM']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101-0318.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*African Americans/statistics & numerical data', 'Cancer Care Facilities', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Neoplasms/*ethnology/*mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Southeastern United States/epidemiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whites/statistics & numerical data']",1995/02/22 00:00,1995/02/22 00:01,['1995/02/22 00:00'],"['1995/02/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/22 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/22 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,JAMA. 1995 Feb 22;273(8):633-7.,,,['JAMA. 1995 Aug 2;274(5):379-80.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From October 1986 to March 1990, 302 assessable patients, 0.6 to 17.8 years of age, with newly diagnosed NHL were enrolled onto study ALL/NHL-BFM 86. Fifty percent of patients had Burkitt-type lymphomas, including B-ALL; 24% had lymphoblastic lymphoma; 18% had diffuse large-cell lymphoma; and 8% had an NHL not further classified. Therapy group B included Burkitt's-type lymphomas, B-ALL, and most large-cell lymphomas including Ki-1 anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. Patients with stage I and II disease resected received three, while all others received six, 5-day therapy courses (dexamethasone, methotrexate [MTX] 0.5 g/m2 [5 g/m2 for stage IV and B-ALL], and intrathecal [IT] therapy in each course, plus ifosfamide, cytarabine, and etoposide alternating with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin). Therapy for group non-B patients (lymphoblastic lymphoma and pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma [PTCL]) consisted of a Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocol, including cranial irradiation for advanced stage. Local therapy was restricted to patients with incomplete tumor regression. RESULTS: The probabilities of event-free survival (pEFS) at 7 years were 80% +/- 2% for the whole group, 81% +/- 3% for group B (n = 225), and 78% +/- 5% for group non-B (n = 77) with a follow-up duration of 3.6 to 7 years (median 5 years). Treatment results were comparable between NHL subtypes, except for PTCL, in which three of four patients suffered from relapse. Local disease manifestations were the most frequent site of failure. CONCLUSION: This therapy strategy provided patients of all NHL subtypes with an equally high chance to survive event-free, except patients with PTCL. With reduced systemic failure, local tumor control may become more important.","['Reiter, A', 'Schrappe, M', 'Parwaresch, R', 'Henze, G', 'Muller-Weihrich, S', 'Sauter, S', 'Sykora, K W', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Gadner, H', 'Riehm, H']","['Reiter A', 'Schrappe M', 'Parwaresch R', 'Henze G', 'Muller-Weihrich S', 'Sauter S', 'Sykora KW', 'Ludwig WD', 'Gadner H', 'Riehm H']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medizinische Hochschule, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.2.359 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Feb;13(2):359-72. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.2.359.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The experience of the Italian Bone Marrow Transplantation Group and the Italian Pediatric Hematology Oncology Association is summarized. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All children who had a relapse in the period 1980 to 1989 in 27 centers in Italy were eligible for the study. Of 287 eligible patients, 230 were treated with CHEMO, most of them (93%) according to a standard multiple-drug relapse protocol. The remaining 57 children underwent AlloBMT. Preparative regimens included total-body irradiation and chemotherapy (n = 51) or chemotherapy alone (n = 6). Statistical analysis was performed with a Cox regression model adjusting for waiting time to transplant and prognostic factors. RESULTS: In the whole series, minimum and median follow-up after second CR were 3 and 6.2 years, respectively; at 8 years from second CR, disease-free survival (DFS) was 20.0% (SE 2.5) and survival was 26.4% (SE 2.9). In the group of patients with an early first relapse, DFS was significantly longer after AlloBMT than after CHEMO (relative risk [RR] = 0.45, P = .002). No significant advantage of AlloBMT over CHEMO was found for patients with a late relapse (> 30 months since diagnosis). Duration of first CR significantly influenced prognosis in the CHEMO group (RR = 0.32, P = .0001 for patients with late first relapse versus patients with early first relapse). CONCLUSION: Results suggest an advantage in DFS of AlloBMT over CHEMO in ALL patients who experienced an early first medullary relapse.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty children received eight standard doses of intramuscular ASNase (10,000 IU/m2) every 3 days as part of induction therapy. In the postremission phase of therapy, the children were randomized to receive either 20 courses of high-dose intramuscular ASNase (25,000 IU/m2) weekly (n = 8) or four courses of standard-dose intramuscular ASNase (10,000 IU/m2) every 3 days (n = 12).

Thirteen patients remain in remission at 71+ to 126+ months (median, 104+), and 10 of 13 patients tested have normal IQ scores. Four patients have had a second relapse (one CNS and three non-CNS), and three have developed other malignancies. Prior cranial irradiation was associated with subsequent failure; only three of 10 patients who previously received radiotherapy, compared with all of the other 10 patients, remained in second remission. CONCLUSION: This intensive retrieval therapy is effective and well tolerated by children with an isolated CNS relapse of ALL, especially those who have not received prior cranial irradiation. Most patients have no significant neuropsychologic impairment.","['Ribeiro, R C', 'Rivera, G K', 'Hudson, M', 'Mulhern, R K', 'Hancock, M L', 'Kun, L', 'Mahmoud, H', 'Sandlund, J T', 'Crist, W M', 'Pui, C H']","['Ribeiro RC', 'Rivera GK', 'Hudson M', 'Mulhern RK', 'Hancock ML', 'Kun L', 'Mahmoud H', 'Sandlund JT', 'Crist WM', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101-0318.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System/radiation effects', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Critical Care', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.2.333 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Feb;13(2):333-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.2.333.,,,,,"['P01 CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred fifty-four patients with a variety of poor-prognosis malignancies received escalating doses of ifosfamide 6,000 to 24,000 mg/m2, carboplatin 1,200 to 2,100 mg/m2, and etoposide 1,800 to 3,000 mg/m2 divided over 6 days. Mesna was administered in a dose equal to ifosfamide. ASCR was performed 48 hours after the completion of ICE. The source of stem cells was bone marrow (BM) in patients without BM micrometastases and peripheral-blood stem cells (PBSC) in patients with BM micrometastases. Patients were evaluated for hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities, as well as response to therapy. RESULTS: The MTD of the ICE regimen is 20,100 mg/m2 of ifosfamide, 1,800 mg/m2 of carboplatin, and 3,000 mg/m2 of etoposide. The dose-limiting toxicities of ICE were CNS toxicity and acute renal failure. Additionally, reversible elevations of serum creatinine levels were noted in 29% of patients treated at the upper dose levels. Forty-six patients were treated at the MTD. Severe, reversible mucositis and enteritis were the major nonhematologic toxicities seen at the MTD (78% and 33%, respectively). The overall mortality rate was 8% for all dose levels (4% at the MTD). At the MTD, the median times to an absolute neutrophil count > or = 0.5 x 10(9)/L, to a platelet count > or = 20 x 10(9)/L, and to discharge were 18, 22, and 24 days, respectively. The overall response rate was 40% for 77 patients with assessable disease at the time of treatment. CONCLUSION: ICE is well tolerated, with acceptable hematopoietic side effects and predictable organ toxicity.","['Fields, K K', 'Elfenbein, G J', 'Lazarus, H M', 'Cooper, B W', 'Perkins, J B', 'Creger, R J', 'Ballester, O F', 'Hiemenz, J H', 'Janssen, W E', 'Zorsky, P E']","['Fields KK', 'Elfenbein GJ', 'Lazarus HM', 'Cooper BW', 'Perkins JB', 'Creger RJ', 'Ballester OF', 'Hiemenz JH', 'Janssen WE', 'Zorsky PE']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa 33612.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)', 'ICE protocol 1']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Female', 'Germinoma/drug therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Sarcoma/drug therapy', 'Testicular Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.2.323 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Feb;13(2):323-32. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.2.323.,,,['J Clin Oncol. 1995 Jul;13(7):1826-7.

The structure is stabilized by a hydrogen-bonding network. It was observed that although dpm alone is not able to alter the electrophoretic mobility of pUC8 DNA forms, the synthesized Pt-dpm compound substantially modifies the DNA conformation since it significantly alters the electrophoretic mobility of nicked and closed circular forms of pUC8 DNA. However, the alteration in mobility of pUC8 DNA induced by this compound upon binding is lower than that induced by cis-DDP. The analysis of the antiproliferative activity of the Pt-dpm salt against MDA-MB 468 (breast carcinoma) and HL-60 (leukemia) human cancer cells showed that this compound has ID50 values of 0.87 microM and 0.65 microM, respectively. Interestingly, it was found out that although the dpm molecule does not present any significant antiproliferative activity, the ID50 values of Pt-dpm are about 3-fold and 7-fold lower than those of cis-DDP and K2PtCl4, respectively. Altogether the biological data suggest that in Pt-dpm a synergic effect between cation and anion is produced.","['Lopez-Solera, I', 'Perez, J M', 'Monge, M A', 'Alvarez-Valdes, A', 'Masaguer, J R', 'Alonso, C', 'Navarro-Ranninger, C']","['Lopez-Solera I', 'Perez JM', 'Monge MA', 'Alvarez-Valdes A', 'Masaguer JR', 'Alonso C', 'Navarro-Ranninger C']","['Departmento de Quimica, Faculdad de Ciencias, Universidad Autonoma, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Inorg Biochem,Journal of inorganic biochemistry,7905788,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (bis(dipyridamole) tetrachloroplatinate(II)dipyridamole dihydrate)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA/chemistry/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Dipyridamole/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation/drug effects', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0162-0134(94)85103-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0162-0134(94)85103-4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Inorg Biochem. 1994 Dec;56(4):233-42. doi: 10.1016/0162-0134(94)85103-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When this virus is injected into neonatal NIH Swiss mice, pre-B and B-lymphoblastic lymphomas develop with a latency of 17 months. Van Lohuizen et al. (1989) described a line of transgenic mice that carry an activated pim-1 proto-oncogene transgene (E mu pim-1). They also reported that E mu pim-1 transgenic mice show greatly accelerated lymphoma development when infected with wild-type M-MuLV at birth. In these experiments, neonatal E mu pim-1 transgenic mice were infected intraperitoneally with delta Mo + SV M-MuLV. Marked acceleration of T-lymphoid leukaemia was seen. However, 10 of the 11 tumours analysed were found to be negative for the SV40 enhancers, but they still contained M-MuLV DNA as measured by Southern blot analysis. The LTRs on viruses cloned from two such tumours (as well as on virus recovered by infection onto NIH 3T3 cells) were characterized by PCR amplification, molecular cloning and sequence analysis. The LTR's from the two tumours were identical to each other and were distinct from both the delta Mo + SV M-MuLV and wild-type M-MuLV LTRs. However, they were identical to a rearranged solo M-MuLV LTR present in the E mu pim-1 transgene. These results indicate that the recombination in vivo between delta Mo + SV M-MuLV and the E mu pim-1 transgene yielded a replication-competent and pathogenic virus at high efficiency. This is the first report of in vivo recombination between an exogenous MuLV and a solo endogenous LTR.","['Suchman, E L', 'Pattengale, P K', 'Fan, H']","['Suchman EL', 'Pattengale PK', 'Fan H']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of California, Irvine 92717.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Pim1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*etiology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1', '*Recombination, Genetic', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae Infections/*etiology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*etiology']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-76-2-347 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1995 Feb;76 ( Pt 2):347-56. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-76-2-347.,,,,,"['CA32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07311/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['pim-1'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptotic cell death was assessed both by flow cytometry and agarose gel electrophoresis, and was correlated to the appearance of large (20 to > or = 580 kilobase pairs) DNA fragments, as assessed by field inversion gel electrophoresis. In all cases, the appearance of DNA fragments of 20-50 kilobase pairs accompanied the appearance of an apoptotic population and of internucleosomal cleavage. However, teniposide additionally induced a marked increase in fragmentation to > or = 580 kilobase pairs. The cotreatment of cells with zinc (1 mM) inhibited the formation of all large DNA fragments, internucleosomal cleavage and the appearance of an apoptotic population. We conclude that the generation of large DNA fragments is characteristic of apoptosis induced by various stimuli in U937, as has been found previously in rat thymocytes. However, unlike what occurs in rat thymocytes, zinc treatment does not dissociate the formation of large fragments from conventional markers of apoptosis.","['Bicknell, G R', 'Snowden, R T', 'Cohen, G M']","['Bicknell GR', 'Snowden RT', 'Cohen GM']","['MRC Toxicology Unit, Leicester University, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)', 'X8D5EPO80M (Emetine)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis/chemistry', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Emetine/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Teniposide/pharmacology', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Zinc/pharmacology']",1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1994 Sep;107 ( Pt 9):2483-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ascorbate also modulates cell growth and differentiation. Ascorbate can reduce or stimulate the growth of tumor cells, depending on the cell type. The inhibitory effect is not specific for the biological active isomer L-ascorbate, and isoascorbate and D-ascorbate are more effective in reducing cell growth than L-ascorbate. These results indicate that ascorbate has a cytotoxic effect by killing cells directly, rather a cytostatic one. However, only L-ascorbate is able to stimulate cell growth, but the mechanism of this stimulation is still unknown. L-Ascorbate stimulates the in vitro differentiation of several mesenchyme-derived cell types by altering the expression of multiple genes as the cell progresses through specific differentiation programs. Stimulation of collagen matrix at gene transcription, mRNA stabilization, hydroxylation, and secretion is a key role for L-ascorbate. L-Ascorbate also prevents cell transformation by stabilization of the differentiated state and cooperates with other agents to induce differentiation in a leukemia cell line.","['Alcain, F J', 'Buron, M I']","['Alcain FJ', 'Buron MI']","['Departamento de Biologia Celular, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Cordoba, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Bioenerg Biomembr,Journal of bioenergetics and biomembranes,7701859,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ascorbic Acid/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cartilage/cytology/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Mesoderm/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Nutritional Requirements', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Species Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00762780 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bioenerg Biomembr. 1994 Aug;26(4):393-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00762780.,78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood samples from 42 AML patients and 58 normal donors were analyzed by flow cytometry with the VCS. Normal and leukemic peripheral blood samples were tested to establish a correlation between VCS data and the reference manual method. We evaluated the sensitivity threshold of the VCS for blast cell detection in progressively diluted samples. We looked at a correlation between different scatterplots and flags and the FAB classification of acute myeloid leukemia in order to identify a characteristic VCS image for each subtype. Thirty-four bone marrow samples (18 normal donors and 16 leukemic patients) were analyzed by the VCS system to demonstrate a characteristic scattergram distribution. Further, we tried to compare scatterplots to the flags of leukemic bone marrow samples and, finally, we compared VCS scatterplots with aberrant antigen expression in AML cases. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Overall VCS specificity was 93.1% (54/58) in peripheral blood samples; sensitivity was 100% (42/42) and VCS efficiency was 96%. In AML the characteristic X6 flag was observed in 95.23% of the cases (40/42). In peripheral samples discrimination was made between AML M1 with agranular blasts > 50% of the non erythroid cells (NEC), M4, M5 on the one hand, and AML M1 with granular blasts > 50% of NEC, M2, M3 on the other: the X5 flag was often present in the second group because of the different localization of the cells (p = 0.001). In all normal bone marrow samples we observed granuloblasts in different maturation stages in the neutrophil region of the DF1 VCS scatterplot corresponding to the X5X6 flags or, rarely, to the X5X6X1, because of the presence of immature erythroid cells. This association X5X6 was never observed alone in patients affected by AML. In our study, it was difficult to identify peculiar scatterplots and alarms for each FAB class of AML. Nevertheless, we observed that in all M4 and M5 FAB cases the blastic cells both in the peripheral blood and in the bone marrow samples were located in the monocyte region, with the frequent presence of the X3 flag often associated with the X6 flag. Eight out of the 16 AML bone marrow samples (1 FAB M0, 1 M2, 1 M3, 2 M4, 3 M5) showed the X2 flag and partial localization of blasts in the lymphoid region. In all these cases the presence of some small blastic cells with agranular cytoplasm was confirmed by morphological observation and cytochemical stainings.","['Bruno, A', 'Del Poeta, G', 'Venditti, A', 'Stasi, R', 'Adorno, G', 'Aronica, G', 'Suppo, G', 'Di Rienzo, A M', 'Iazzoni, R', 'Tribalto, M']","['Bruno A', 'Del Poeta G', 'Venditti A', 'Stasi R', 'Adorno G', 'Aronica G', 'Suppo G', 'Di Rienzo AM', 'Iazzoni R', 'Tribalto M', 'et al.']","['Hematology Division, Tor Vergata University, S.

In this study we showed that HL-60 cells exposed to phorbol esters express osteopontin (OPN), a cell adhesion molecule linked with osteoclast function. Moreover, the timed expression of OPN, in phorbol ester treated cells, was linked to increased cell adhesion. Subsequent to the expression of OPN, an increase in mRNA levels for alpha v integrin subunit was observed. The alpha v beta 3 integrin, a cell surface receptor found in high concentrations in osteoclasts, is considered to be a receptor for OPN. Furthermore, during differentiation we detected an increase in two cell surface markers specific for osteoclasts, 75B and 121F.

The participation of inhibitory cells was addressed through adoptive transfer experiments utilizing young AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b congenic responder mice as the recipients of AKR.H-2b donor cells. The adoptive transfer of unfractionated viable splenocytes led to inhibition of virus-specific CTL responsiveness without affecting minor histocompatibility or allogeneic (H-2d)-specific CTL responses. Negative cell selection studies indicated that of the donor AKR.H-2b spleen cells that mediate specific inhibition, B lymphocytes, CD4-CD8+ and CD4+CD8- T lymphocytes, but not macrophages, even though they are viral antigen positive (as are B and T lymphocytes), were the cells responsible for the diminution of the generation of AKR/Gross virus-specific CTL by AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice. To evoke maximal inhibition, the adoptive transfer of AKR.H-2b cells had to be performed prior to in vivo priming with viral antigen. Anti-AKR/Gross MuLV nonresponsiveness of AKR.H-2b mice could not be overcome through utilization of exogenous IL-2 at either the priming or in vitro restimulation phases of CTL generation. These results illustrate the complex interaction between retroviruses and lymphocytes and are relevant to understanding how retrovirus-infected cells may not only escape immune surveillance themselves, but also may inhibit the cytolytic T cell response directed at other infected cells, such as tumor cells.","['Rich, R F', 'Green, W R']","['Rich RF', 'Green WR']","['Department of Microbiology, Dartmouth Medical School, West Lebanon, New Hampshire 03756, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,['0 (H-2 Antigens)'],IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'H-2 Antigens/immunology', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(95)80019-F [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(95)80019-f [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1995 Jan;160(1):139-51. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(95)80019-f.,,,,,"['CA-23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K04 CA-01112/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The human monocytic leukaemia cell line THP-1, when stimulated with phorbol ester, shares many properties with human monocyte-derived macrophages.

This work aims to present a case in whom hyponatremia was possibly due to an increased secretion of atrial natriuretic factor. CASE REPORT: --A 3 week-old baby was admitted because of malignant hemopathy. A diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia was rapidly made and the patient was firstly given alkaline diuresis, urate-oxidase and corticosteroids. Vincristine and daunorubicin were associated one week later. Insertion of a central intravenous line in the right subclavicular artery failed so that this catheter was finally inserted into the left jugular vein. Natremia was 126 mmol/l at that time and dramatically decreased within 24 hours to 109 mmol/l without net changes in water and electrolytic input. At that time, sodium urinary excretion was 6 mmol/kg/day (diuresis: 420 mlF/day). There was no hemodynamic changes, nor digestive or cardiac manifestations. Ultrasonography showed that the left superior cava vein drained into the right cardiac atrium. The catheter was withdrawn and the patient was given sodium supplementation permitting complete and definitive cure of hyponatremia within 2 days. CONCLUSIONS: --All usual causes of hyponatremia having been ruled out in this patient, we postulate that hyponatremia was due to direct stimulation of atrial natriuretic peptide through an increase in atrial pressure secondary to the catheter insertion near the cardiac atrium.","['Kebaili, K', 'Bertrand, Y', 'Foray, P', 'Taylor, P', 'Combet, S', 'Berthier, J C', 'Pangaud, N', 'Philippe, N']","['Kebaili K', 'Bertrand Y', 'Foray P', 'Taylor P', 'Combet S', 'Berthier JC', 'Pangaud N', 'Philippe N']","[""Service d'hemato-immunologie pediatrique et de transplantation de moelle osseuse, hopital Debrousse, Lyon, France.""]",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",France,Arch Pediatr,Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,9421356,['85637-73-6 (Atrial Natriuretic Factor)'],IM,"['Atrial Natriuretic Factor/*metabolism', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/adverse effects', 'Catheters, Indwelling/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Hyponatremia/*etiology', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Jugular Veins', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",1994/10/01 00:00,2000/05/05 09:00,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Pediatr. 1994 Oct;1(10):898-902.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Une cause rare d'hyponatremie lors du traitement d'induction d'une leucemie aigue lymphoblastique chez un nourrisson: la secretion inappropriee de facteur atrial natriuretique?,,,,

In this paper, the effects of the four plant polysaccharides on cell proliferation in mice sarcoma (ascitic type) S180 and human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells were studied with MTT chromometry. Tt was found That TF and lentinan had no effect on both cell line, but PPS and ASPS could obviously inhibit the proliferation of them, the IC50 of PPS was 1.5mg/ml in both cell line, that of ASPS was 0.38 mg/ml (S180 cells) and 0.28mg/ml (K562 cells) respectively. This result indicated that the PPS and ASPS were able to kill the tumor cell directly. To investigate the mechanism of antitumor action of PPS and ASPS, the sialic acid (SA), phospholipid (PI) and cholesterol (Ch) contents of S180 cell membrane were examined after the PPS or ASPS application for 24 hours. No significant changes were observed for the Ch and Ch/Pl ratio, the amount of SA increased and that of PI lowered respectively (P < 0.05).

This paper reports that monocyte differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D2 (vitamin D2) results in a marked increase in expression of u-PA and u-PA-R. This increase in u-PA expression is of greater magnitude than is observed after culture with interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), another potent inducer of monocytic differentiation. Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), an agent that induces granulocytic differentiation, also increased expression of u-PA. However, culture with the granulocyte-inducing all-trans retinoic acid (RA) did not induce an increase in surface expression of u-PA or u-PA-R. The vitamin D2-induced increase in cell-surface u-PA was not coincident with an increase in steady-state levels of u-PA mRNA, suggesting that intracellular stores of this protein, translational or post-translational mechanisms of regulation, or some other regulatory mechanism may be responsible for the increase in u-PA during differentiation. To ascertain an association between the increased expression of cell-surface u-PA and reduced proliferation that accompanies differentiation, the effect of u-PA on cellular proliferation of HL-60 cells was measured. Both pro-u-PA (whole molecule) and fragments of u-PA that retained receptor-binding capability caused a marked inhibition of HL-60 proliferation in the absence of vitamin D2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Howell, A L', 'Hunt, J A', 'James, T W', 'Mazar, A', 'Henkin, J', 'Zacharski, L R']","['Howell AL', 'Hunt JA', 'James TW', 'Mazar A', 'Henkin J', 'Zacharski LR']","['Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, White River Junction, VT 05009.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis,Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,9102551,"['0 (Autoreceptors)', '0 (Ergocalciferols)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)', 'U5NH2JV64T (saruplase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Autoreceptors/drug effects', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Ergocalciferols/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis. 1994 Aug;5(4):445-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combination treatments produced a longer survival time in mice bearing P388 solid lymphomas than either of the drugs alone. In the human metastatic melanoma HT-168 xenograft model the combined application of DBD and CDDP was also very effective, inducing a reduction in the number and volume of metastatic nodules. For V79 spheroids, DBD was mainly cytotoxic against the internal, quiescent cells, whereas cisplatin primarily killed cells in the proliferating, external regions of the spheroids. When combined, the drugs appeared to act synergistically throughout the spheroids. Studies on plasmid DNA showed that CDDP primarily generates cross-links, whereas single-strand breaks were dominant after DBD treatment. Upon using an assay for cleavage by restriction nuclease, antagonistic action of DBD and CDDP in combination may occur, nevertheless more strand breaks were always observed in these samples. These results suggest that the efficacy of combined DBD and CDDP is in part a result of 'spatial cooperation' by the drugs (i.e. affecting different cells) and in part the result of DNA damage produced by the combination treatments.","['Jeney, A', 'Kovalszky, I', 'Raso, E', 'Durand, R E', 'Furesz, J', 'Lapis, K']","['Jeney A', 'Kovalszky I', 'Raso E', 'Durand RE', 'Furesz J', 'Lapis K']","['Institute of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University of Medicine Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'LJ2P1SIK8Y (Mitolactol)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/toxicity', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mitolactol/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1995.63 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1995 Feb;71(2):317-21. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1995.63.,,,,,,,PMC2033585,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescence emission spectra were consistent with sensitiser localisation in hydrophobic regions of the P388 cell, and in more aqueous loci in P388/ADR. Subsequent irradiation resulted in photodamage to the P388 cells, resulting in loss of viability. In contrast, P388/ADR cells were unaffected except for an irreversible inhibition of P-glycoprotein, leading to enhanced accumulation of daunorubicin and rhodamine 123 and a corresponding increase in daunorubicin cytotoxicity. These results are consistent with the premise that substrates for P-glycoprotein are confined to membrane loci associated with the transporter, and indicate a very limited migration of cytotoxic photo-products in a cellular environment.","['Kessel, D', 'Woodburn, K']","['Kessel D', 'Woodburn K']","['Department of Pharmacology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '0TQU7668EI (Cycloleucine)', '17778-80-2 (Singlet Oxygen)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cycloleucine/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oxygen/metabolism', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines/metabolism', 'Singlet Oxygen', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/radiation effects']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1995.61 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1995 Feb;71(2):306-10. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1995.61.,,,,,"['CA 23378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 52997/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['mdr'],PMC2033570,,,,,,,,,,,

Dose-response characteristics of the inhibition were determined. Large doses (1 g/kg) of cyclopentenyl uracil were required, and the effect of a single dose fell rapidly over a 24-hr period. A sustained inhibition of uridine salvage of > 64-79% could be maintained by multiple doses of 1 g/kg given on an every 8-hr schedule. Mice given cyclopentenyl uracil (1 g/kg) every 8 hr for 5 days continued to gain weight and showed no signs of toxicity; however, the combination of cyclopentenyl uracil with a non-toxic dose of N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartic acid (PALA; 200 mg/kg daily for 5 days) was lethal to mice, indicating that circulating uridine modifies the toxicity of agents that act on enzymes of the de novo pyrimidine pathway. Although the duration of action and potency of cyclopentenyl uracil are not ideal, this is the first demonstration of an effective inhibition of uridine salvage in the intact mouse with a non-cytotoxic agent.

Cytidine, at concentrations of 1-25 microM, enabled cells to maintain normal logarithmic growth when added up to 12 hr after exposure to a 200 nM concentration of the oncolytic nucleoside, CPEC. The most abundant CPEC metabolite, CPEC-5'-triphosphate, is a potent [K1 approximately 6 microM] inhibitor of CTP synthetase (EC 6.3.4.2). Accumulation of this inhibitor resulted in a depletion of CTP levels to 17% of their original cellular concentration. Exogenous cytidine reversed CPEC-induced cellular cytotoxicity by suppressing the formation of CPEC-5'-triphosphate by 70%, and by partially replenishing intracellular CTP to at least 60-70% of its original concentration. In vivo, cytidine (500 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally 4 hr after each daily dose of CPEC (LD10-LD100) for 9 days reduced the toxicity and abolished the lethality of CPEC to non-tumored mice. Of greater practical importance is the finding that, under these experimental conditions, cytidine did not curtail the antineoplastic properties of CPEC in L1210 tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, the concentration range over which CPEC exhibited antineoplastic activity was extended with cytidine administration.","['Ford, H Jr', 'Driscoll, J S', 'Hao, Z', 'Dobyns, K A', 'Rommel, M E', 'Stowe, E', 'Anderson, J O', 'Plowman, J', 'Waud, W R', 'Johns, D G']","['Ford H Jr', 'Driscoll JS', 'Hao Z', 'Dobyns KA', 'Rommel ME', 'Stowe E', 'Anderson JO', 'Plowman J', 'Waud WR', 'Johns DG', 'et al.']","['Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '65-47-4 (Cytidine Triphosphate)', '69MO0NDN8K (cyclopentenyl cytosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cytidine/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/blood/*pharmacology/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Cytidine Triphosphate/analysis', 'Drug Interactions', 'Leukemia L1210/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/18 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/01/18 00:00'],"['1995/01/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/01/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295294004900 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(94)00490-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1995 Jan 18;49(2):173-80. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(94)00490-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This enzyme possesses a dimeric structure composed of two heavy-subunit/light-subunit protomers, with a heme-like prosthetic group covalently linked to each heavy subunit. Although MPO exhibits unusual spectral and enzymatic properties, the nature of the prosthetic group and its mode of linkage with the apoenzyme have not been determined. In an earlier report (K.L. Taylor, J. Pohl, and J.M. Kinkade, Jr. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 25282-25288), characterization of the autolytic cleavage of MPO led to the proposal that the prosthetic group was covalently linked to the apoenzyme via a methionyl sulfonium bond with Met409. In the present study, we have demonstrated that autolytic cleavage of MPO, followed by protease digestion under nonreducing conditions, effects the release of a macrocycle with visible and Raman spectral properties consistent with that of a protoheme IX derivative. Mass spectrometric analysis, in conjunction with metabolic labeling studies and recent X-ray crystallographic data, have led to the structural assignment of this macrocycle as 1,5-dihydroxymethyl-3,8-dimethyl-4-vinyl-2-(2'-methylthio) ethenylporphine-6,7-dipropionic acid-iron complex. Based on the mechanism of methionyl sulfonium bond cleavage, this structure is consistent with our earlier proposal that the MPO prosthetic group is covalently linked to the enzyme via a methionyl sulfonium bond and suggests that this linkage occurs through a peripheral vinyl substituent.","['Taylor, K L', 'Strobel, F', 'Yue, K T', 'Ram, P', 'Pohl, J', 'Woods, A S', 'Kinkade, J M Jr']","['Taylor KL', 'Strobel F', 'Yue KT', 'Ram P', 'Pohl J', 'Woods AS', 'Kinkade JM Jr']","['Department of Biochemistry, Winship Cancer Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0', ""(1,5-dihydroxymethyl-3,8-dimethyl-4-vinyl-2-(2'-methylthio)ethenylporphine-6,7-di"", 'proprionic acid-iron complex)', '0 (Ferric Compounds)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Autolysis', 'Ferric Compounds/*chemistry', 'Heme/*analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Neutrophils/enzymology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peroxidase/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Spectrum Analysis, Raman', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/10 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/01/10 00:00'],"['1995/01/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/01/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(85)71083-1 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1995.1083 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1995 Jan 10;316(1):635-42. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1995.1083.,,,,,"['R01 CA22294/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM33385/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR06276/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results suggest that hypericin might inhibited PKC-mediated processes of intact cells, including PMA-induced superoxide generation of neutrophils by some light-dependent mechanism, and that this mechanism might underlie its light-dependent inhibition of FLV infection.","['Utsumi, T', 'Okuma, M', 'Utsumi, T', 'Kanno, T', 'Yasuda, T', 'Kobuchi, H', 'Horton, A A', 'Utsumi, K']","['Utsumi T', 'Okuma M', 'Utsumi T', 'Kanno T', 'Yasuda T', 'Kobuchi H', 'Horton AA', 'Utsumi K']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '5QD5427UN7 (Perylene)', '7V2F1075HD (hypericin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthracenes', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Brain/enzymology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Light', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Perylene/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Respiratory Burst/radiation effects', 'Retroviridae Infections', 'Splenomegaly', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tumor Virus Infections']",1995/01/10 00:00,1995/01/10 00:01,['1995/01/10 00:00'],"['1995/01/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/10 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(85)71065-X [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1995.1065 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1995 Jan 10;316(1):493-7. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1995.1065.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At low cytosolic iron level, IRE-BP is activated and binds to stem-loop untranslated regions (IRE regions) of transferrin and ferritin mRNAs, activating and inhibiting their translations, respectively. This concerted mechanism permits a fine control of iron homeostasis in the cell. The activity of IRE-BP can be measured by its binding to IRE regions, using a protein band-shift electrophoretic assay. Damage to cells by oxidative stress is known to be mediated by iron. We observed that IRE-BP is rapidly activated by exposure of V79 Chinese hamster ovary cells to H2O2. However, if cell extracts are exposed to H2O2 IRE-BP activation is not observed. Therefore, the activation is not a direct consequence of the H2O2 attack to IRE-BP. The in vivo IRE-BP-activation by H2O2 is not prevented by hydroxyl radical scavengers or by the iron chelator 1,10-phenanthroline, indicating that Fenton reaction is not involved in the process. In fact, simultaneous exposure of cells to H2O2 and 1,10-phenanthroline produces an even stronger activation than exposure to H2O2 alone. The interpretation of the mechanism of IRE-BP activation by oxidative stress is hampered by the fact that the mechanism of IRE-BP modulation by cytosolic iron has not been established. It has been recently shown that the iron-sulfur cluster in IRE-BP must be completely disassembled in order for activation to occur and that this is triggered by low iron in the cell. It is likely that IRE-BP senses Fe(II) and that its oxidation to Fe(III) by H2O2 or chelation by 1,10-phenanthroline set up a program for increasing iron uptake. The physiological consequences of this activation still has to be assessed.","['Martins, E A', 'Robalinho, R L', 'Meneghini, R']","['Martins EA', 'Robalinho RL', 'Meneghini R']","['Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Chemistry, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Iron-Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Phenanthrolines)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'W4X6ZO7939 (1,10-phenanthroline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts', 'Free Radical Scavengers', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron Chelating Agents', 'Iron-Regulatory Proteins', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Oxidative Stress/*physiology', 'Phenanthrolines', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism']",1995/01/10 00:00,1995/01/10 00:01,['1995/01/10 00:00'],"['1995/01/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/10 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(85)71019-3 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1995.1019 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1995 Jan 10;316(1):128-34. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1995.1019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ninety patients relapsed, all within five years from diagnosis: 59 in bone-marrow (BM), 20 in CNS (no BM-involvement), nine in testes (all isolated), one in the eye, and one in a lymph node. The five-year event-free survival increased from 0.20 to 0.72 from the first to the last five-year period (p < 0.0001).

HTLV-I has previously been called Human T-cell leukaemia virus or Human T-cell lymphoma virus type I. HTLV-I infection is endemic in southwestern Japan, the Caribbean basin, and parts of South America and Africa. HTLV-I is aetiologically associated with adult T-cell leukaemia lymphoma and tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP), also known as HTLV-I-associated myelopathy. HTLV-II was isolated in 1982 and is endemic among some north American Indians. HTLV-II has not been clearly linked to any specific disease. Both viruses are found worldwide, particularly among intravenous drug users (IVDU), and have also been found in blood donors in USA and Europe. HTLV-I/II are transmitted by the same routes as HIV-1: blood-borne via blood transfusions and among IVDUs by sharing contaminated needles, and by mother-to-child transmission, primarily through breast feeding. HTLV-I/II infections are also sexually transmitted and can be transmitted in utero, though less efficiently than HIV-1. The diagnosis of HTLV-I/II infections is based on the detection of antibody to the virus. Due to the high degree of cross reactivity between HTLV-I and HTLV-II, it is difficult by serology to discriminate between the two viruses. Less than 5% of individuals infected with HTLV-I develop symptoms after a latent period, which can last from a few years to several decades.

Their age ranged from 1 to 16 years with a median of 7 years. Clinical staging was performed according to Murphy's system. There was one child in stage I (2%), 11 in stage II (21%), 14 stage III (26%) and 27 stage IV (51%). Patients in stage IV, 21 (78%) had initial bone marrow involvement, 4 (15%) central nervous system (CNS) infiltration and 2 (7%) simultaneous infiltration to the bone marrow and the CNS. The chemotherapy program consisted of induction, consolidation and maintenance with CNS prophylaxis. The whole program lasted 36 months. Out of 53 patients there were only 45 evaluable for treatment analysis response. A total of 14 (31%) are alive and in a continuous complete remission, with a median duration of remission of 66 months, 8 (18%) children abandoned treatment with a median duration of remission of 10 months. Twenty three patients (51%) are dead. The actuarial survival at 11 year is of 39% +/- 11% with a median remission rate for the whole group of 11.8 months. No patient in complete remission for more than 24 months has relapsed. We conclude that our chemotherapy program is more than adequate for early stages, but for advanced disease it has been a failure. There is a need to modify the chemotherapy program using a very similar protocol as the one used in high risk childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Rivera-Luna, R', 'Cardenas-Cardos, R', 'Martinez-Avalos, A', 'Leal-Leal, C', 'Ruano-Aguilar, J', 'Meza-Coria, C', 'Lanche-Guevara, T', 'de Leon-Bojorge, B']","['Rivera-Luna R', 'Cardenas-Cardos R', 'Martinez-Avalos A', 'Leal-Leal C', 'Ruano-Aguilar J', 'Meza-Coria C', 'Lanche-Guevara T', 'de Leon-Bojorge B']","['Departamento de Oncologia, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Mexico, D.F.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Mexico,Rev Invest Clin,Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,9421552,,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Invest Clin. 1994 Sep-Oct;46(5):369-75.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Linfoma linfoblastico en ninos.

To address the early consequences of HTLV-1 tax function, we have constructed fusion proteins containing tax sequence either aminoterminal (taxER) or carboxy-terminal (ERtax) of the hormone binding domain of the human estrogen receptor (ER). Addition of estrogen or the antagonist hydroxytamoxifen to Jurkat T-cells expressing these constructs led to the trans-activation or responsive promoters and upregulation of cell surface markers CD28, CD69 and CD5 but not CD25 (IL2R-alpha subunit) or B7 (ligand for CD28). Additional stimulation of the T-cell receptor CD3 complex, led to the upregulation of CD25. B7 was upregulated by concomittent activation of ERtax and CD3 or CD28 pathways. These events were in part reversible upon withdrawal of hormone and inactivation of ERtax. Severe inhibition of proliferation, and apoptosis was observed with cells which had been subjected to short term (3 days) activation of the tax fusion proteins and the CD3 complex. Induction of ERtax activity for longer than 3 days promoted cell death independently of CD3 stimulation. Co-stimulation through the CD28 cell surface molecule did not suppress induction of apoptosis.","['Chlichlia, K', 'Moldenhauer, G', 'Daniel, P T', 'Busslinger, M', 'Gazzolo, L', 'Schirrmacher, V', 'Khazaie, K']","['Chlichlia K', 'Moldenhauer G', 'Daniel PT', 'Busslinger M', 'Gazzolo L', 'Schirrmacher V', 'Khazaie K']","['Department of Tumor Immunology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'CD28 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'CD3 Complex/biosynthesis', 'Cell Division', 'Estrogens/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, Estrogen/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/19 00:00,1995/01/19 00:01,['1995/01/19 00:00'],"['1995/01/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/19 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/19 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1995 Jan 19;10(2):269-77.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although BFA promotes the formation of extensive tubular endosomal domains, our understanding of the effects of the antibiotic on vesicle traffic events associated with endocytosis is limited. Thus, alterations in the transferrin (Tf) receptor's endocytic/recycling pathway upon treatment of human erythroleukemia K562 cells with BFA were studied as a pharmacological response. Treatment of K562 cells with BFA caused a down-regulation in the number of cell surface Tf receptors. This effect is highly reminiscent of the well-known action of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on Tf receptor traffic in K562 cells. However, our results demonstrate that these two agents down-regulate the Tf receptor via different mechanisms. The effects of BFA and PMA were additive when K562 cells were incubated with both together. Using the In/Sur method, the endocytic rate constant for Tf internalization was determined and PMA was found to greatly enhance ke, from 0.28 min-1 to 0.43 min-1, while BFA had little effect (Ke = 0.20 min-1). In contrast, BFA-treatment alters the exocytic rate constant for return of internalized receptors to the cell surface, with the largest effect exerted on a 'slow-release', monensin-sensitive, compartment. The sum of the endocytic and exocytic kinetic data support a model in which BFA and PMA down-regulate the Tf receptor in K562 cells by mechanistically distinct actions, with BFA targeting exocytic monensin-sensitive intracellular compartments and PMA acting to exert a profound influence on elements of receptor internalization.","['Schonhorn, J E', 'Wessling-Resnick, M']","['Schonhorn JE', 'Wessling-Resnick M']","['Department of Nutrition, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Brefeldin A', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'Cyclopentanes/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Exocytosis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1994/06/29 00:00,1994/06/29 00:01,['1994/06/29 00:00'],"['1994/06/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/29 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00926519 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 1994 Jun 29;135(2):159-69. doi: 10.1007/BF00926519.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Non-inhibitory analogs of the inhibitor were ineffective. Assay of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity in permeable cells indicated that a transient activation of the enzyme occurred during the culture in serum-free medium (the maximum activation was observed at 8 h of the culture). The cells conditioned in serum-free medium for 24 h acquired significant resistancy to the inhibitor.

Exposure to VRP for 24 hr resulted in a decrease in mdr1 mRNA levels that was dose related at concentrations between 15 and 50 microM. The maximal decrease of mdr1 mRNA levels was found to be 6-fold in the K562/ADR cells and 3-fold in the CEM VLB100 cells. The effect of VRP on mdr1 mRNA levels was, however, biphasic. At 100 microM VRP, which strongly inhibited cell proliferation, a 2-fold increase of mdr1 mRNA levels was observed in the K562/ADR cells. To determine whether the decrease of mRNA levels resulted from post-transcriptional mechanisms, mRNA stability was studied after blocking of transcription with actinomycin D in VRP-treated cells and in control cells. This study revealed that mdr1 mRNA was stable in both cell lines and no increase in mdr1 mRNA degradation was observed in the 30 microM VRP-treated cells versus control cells (half-lives of 23 hr versus 14 hr for the K562/ADR cells and 15.5 hr versus 10.0 hr for the CEM VLB100 cells). The suggestion of a transcriptional mechanism was confirmed by nuclear run-on assays. A 4-fold decrease in the mdr1 gene transcription rate was observed in the 30 microM VRP-treated CEM VLB100 cells. The decreased transcription rate could be due to the decrease in mdr1 proximal promoter activity observed in CEM VLB100 cells transiently transfected with the mdr1 promoter fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Indeed, after exposure to 30 microM VRP, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was decreased by 2-fold. This study reports for the first time a down-regulation of mdr1 gene transcription by a pharmacological agent.

Serum levels of GM-CSF, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were also assessed. IL-1-beta, GM-CSF and TNF-alpha serum levels of the patients before and after BMT did not differ significantly from those obtained in 45 healthy controls. After marrow transplant, the engraftment of donor hematopoietic stem cell was associated with the disappearance of both pretransplant GM-CSF hypersensitivity and CFU-GM spontaneous growth. The inhibitory effect on the growth of normal hematopoietic progenitors also resolved. This confirms that the substitution of the pathological hematopoietic progenitors represents the basis for the curvative effect of allogeneic BMT in the treatment of JCML, abolishing both the excessive responsiveness of JCML progenitor cells even to very low concentrations of GM-CSF and the growth-inhibitory effect on normal hematopoiesis.","['Zecca, M', 'Rosti, V', 'Pinto, L', 'Comoli, P', 'Carra, A M', 'Prete, L', 'Bonetti, F', 'Pedrazzoli, P', 'Locatelli, F', 'Cazzola, M']","['Zecca M', 'Rosti V', 'Pinto L', 'Comoli P', 'Carra AM', 'Prete L', 'Bonetti F', 'Pedrazzoli P', 'Locatelli F', 'Cazzola M']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/pathology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/blood/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/blood', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*pathology/*therapy', 'Macrophages/*pathology', 'Male', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950240305 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1995 Mar;24(3):166-70. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950240305.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 122 children (seven infants aged 3 months-1 year, 26 children aged 1-3 years, 68 children aged 3-10 years and 21 adolescents aged 10-15 years) with normal liver and renal function, receiving consolidation therapy at the Pediatric Clinic of Monza between May 1988 and April 1992, were enrolled in this study. MTX was given as an intravenous infusion in 24 h and serum concentrations were measured up to at least 72 h after the start of infusion by an enzyme immunoassay (TDX Abbot, Dallas, TX) in order to modulate folinic acid rescue. Pharmacokinetic analysis of MTX levels according to a two-compartment open model indicated that, compared to all children up to 10 years old, in adolescents older than 10 years the drug reached higher concentrations in serum and was cleared at a lower rate. Steady-state levels and AUC were from 60% higher to more than double and the total clearance of the compound, expressed either per square meter surface area or per kg body weight, in each cycle was significantly lower in adolescents > 10 years of age, sometimes being only one-third of the clearance in infants (0.2 vs. 0.6 1/h/kg and 6.6 vs. 10.7 1/h/sq.m). The relationship between each age and systemic clearance was highly significant as measured by regression analysis. Methotrexate systemic clearance progressively decreased as a function of age. Subsequent treatments did not induce changes in MTX pharmacokinetics. These data suggest that the better tolerance of HD-MTX in children may have a pharmacokinetic basis. The faster elimination of MTX in infants, who usually show the worst prognosis, suggests that full doses could be safely used in order to maximize the antileukemic effect without a high risk of toxicity.","['Donelli, M G', 'Zucchetti, M', 'Robatto, A', 'Perlangeli, V', ""D'Incalci, M"", 'Masera, G', 'Rossi, M R']","['Donelli MG', 'Zucchetti M', 'Robatto A', 'Perlangeli V', ""D'Incalci M"", 'Masera G', 'Rossi MR']","['Istituto di Richerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Dipartimento di Biologia e Genetica per le Scienze Mediche, Universita degli Studi, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950240303 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1995 Mar;24(3):154-9. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950240303.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously demonstrated, using cytogenetic and molecular techniques, that the types of molecular lesions associated with tk-1 gene inactivation span a wide range similar to that seen in tumor cells at specific oncogene and tumor suppressor gene loci. We have identified, using polymerase chain reaction techniques, 21 microsatellite, or 'simple sequence repeat', polymorphisms between chromosomes 11a and 11b in 3.7.2C cells. These microsatellite polymorphisms span virtually the entire chromosome, from mapping positions of 3-78 centiMorgans (cM) from the centromere, thus providing landmarks to study loss of genetic material across the entire chromosome. Four of the microsatellite polymorphisms lie within 12 cM of tk-1, and provide a means of mapping loss of genetic material in the immediate vicinity of tk-1, a capability that we have not previously had in the mouse lymphoma assay. Loss of alleles (i.e. loss of heterozygosity) is an important feature of tumor development, having to do with tumor suppressor gene expression. Therefore, the ability to detect loss of heterozygosity in the mouse lymphoma assay will make the assay an extremely valuable tool in the detection of agents capable of inducing loss of heterozygosity.","['Liechty, M C', 'Hassanpour, Z', 'Hozier, J C', 'Clive, D']","['Liechty MC', 'Hassanpour Z', 'Hozier JC', 'Clive D']","['Applied Genetics Laboratories Inc., Melbourne, FL 32901.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,"['0 (DNA, Satellite)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA, Satellite/*genetics', 'Genetic Markers', 'Heterozygote', 'Leukemia L5178/enzymology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Minisatellite Repeats', 'Mutagenicity Tests/methods', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics']",1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/mutage/9.5.423 [doi]'],ppublish,Mutagenesis. 1994 Sep;9(5):423-7. doi: 10.1093/mutage/9.5.423.,,,,,,['tk-1'],,,,,,,,,,,,

More than 85% of the micronuclei induced by each compound stained positive for the presence of kinetochores implying that the micronuclei contained whole chromosomes. However, these same compounds were unable to induce TFT resistance under three different treatment regimes. We concluded that these compounds, under conditions where they induce primarily kinetochore positive micronuclei, were not able to induce mutations. Thus, the induction of micronuclei containing whole chromosomes harboring a selectable gene is not an early event leading to mutations in these cells.","['Stopper, H', 'Eckert, I', 'Schiffmann, D', 'Spencer, D L', 'Caspary, W J']","['Stopper H', 'Eckert I', 'Schiffmann D', 'Spencer DL', 'Caspary WJ']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,"['0 (Mutagens)', '32HRV3E3D5 (Griseofulvin)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '731DCA35BT (Diethylstilbestrol)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'RMW9V5RW38 (Trifluridine)', 'Z01IVE25KI (Demecolcine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Demecolcine/pharmacology', 'Diethylstilbestrol/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Griseofulvin/pharmacology', 'Kinetochores/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia L5178/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/*drug effects', 'Micronucleus Tests', '*Mutagenesis', 'Mutagens/*pharmacology', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Trifluridine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/mutage/9.5.411 [doi]'],ppublish,Mutagenesis. 1994 Sep;9(5):411-6. doi: 10.1093/mutage/9.5.411.,,,,,,['tk'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In vivo, the survival of mice challenged with syngeneic leukemic cells is enhanced by treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3. Patients treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 develop hypercalcemia at a serum level of 2 x 10(-10) mol/l which is a concentration too low to achieve an antileukemic effect in vitro. Several interesting vitamin D3 analogs have recently been developed. We initially examined the effect of 1,25(OH)2-16ene-23yne-19-nor-26,27-F6-D3 and 24a,26a,27a-tri-homo-22,24-diene-1-alpha,25-(OH)2-D3 on clonal growth and differentiation of HL-60 cells. Each of the analogs had comparable effects on clonal growth with 50% inhibition (ED50) at concentrations of 0.2-0.5 x 10(-9) M; 1,25(OH)2D3 was about 20- to 50-fold less active in inhibiting growth. Differentiation was determined by induction of superoxide production, as measured by nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction and by expression of a macrophage-specific enzyme (alpha napthyl acetate esterase (ANAE)). The 24a,26a,27a-tri-homo-22,24-diene-1-alpha,25-(OH)2-D3 and 1,25(OH)2-16ene-23yne-19-nor-26,27-F6-D3 were about 5- to 14-fold more potent than 1,25(OH)2D3. The hypercalcemia inducing side-effects of these analogs and three other previously identified, extremely potent vitamin D3 compounds, as well as 1,25(OH)2D3, were studied. The analogs were administered intraperitoneally every other day (qod) for 5 weeks; serum was collected weekly and Ca2+ measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The highest tolerated dose of each analog leaving all mice alive was for 1,25(OH)2D3: 0.25 micrograms; 1,25(OH)2-24a,26a,27a-tri-homo-22,24-diene-D3: 0.25 micrograms; and 1,25(OH)2-16ene-23yne-19-nor-26,27-F6-D3: 0.0625 micrograms.

The content of IL-1 beta in leukemic cells was measured by enzyme-amplified sensitivity immunoassay. We observed a significant proliferative response to exogenous IL-1 beta in leukemic cells from 27/66 patients with de novo AML, 1/29 patients with ALL, 2/3 patients with AUL, 8/12 patients with AML arising from MDS, 4/7 patients with myeloid crisis of CML, and 0/4 patients with lymphoid crisis of CML. Proliferation was marked in myeloid leukemic cells of a more premature stem cell origin. There were no significant differences in proliferative responses among the different FAB classes of de novo AML. The IL-1 beta content of leukemic cells was low in patients with lymphoid leukemia, but there was no significant difference among the various types of myeloid leukemia. There was no correlation between the proliferative response to exogenous IL-1 beta and the IL-1 beta content of leukemic cells. When we correlated the proliferative response to exogenous IL-1 beta with treatment outcome in patients with de novo AML, we found the rate of complete remission (CR) to be lower in those with a high proliferative response. We noted a longer duration of CR (p = 0.07) and of survival (p < 0.05) in patients with a low proliferative response. Thus, a high proliferative response to IL-1 beta in the cells of AML patients may indicate a poor prognosis.","['Ezaki, K', 'Tsuzuki, M', 'Katsuta, I', 'Maruyama, F', 'Kojima, H', 'Okamoto, M', 'Nomura, T', 'Wakita, M', 'Miyazaki, H', 'Sobue, R']","['Ezaki K', 'Tsuzuki M', 'Katsuta I', 'Maruyama F', 'Kojima H', 'Okamoto M', 'Nomura T', 'Wakita M', 'Miyazaki H', 'Sobue R', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tritium']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['014521269400064H [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(94)00064-h [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1995 Jan;19(1):35-41. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)00064-h.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we analyzed cytokine expression in bone marrow adherent layers derived from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). IL-6 messenger RNA (mRNA) was expressed in adherent layers established from four of nine MDS patients, and from 10 of 17 AML patients (including all four individuals in whom AML had evolved from an antecedent MDS state). Similarly, IL-1 beta mRNA was expressed in adherent layers derived from two of nine MDS patients and from three of 17 AML patients. Cultures from two of 10 AML patients who expressed IL-6 also expressed granulocyte (G) colony-stimulating factor (CSF) mRNA. In contrast, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and G-CSF mRNA were not discernible in adherent layers from any of 14 normal volunteers. Transforming growth factor-beta 1, macrophage (M) CSF, IL-7, and leukemia inhibitory factor mRNA as well as IL-6 protein were constitutively expressed in adherent layers derived from both MDS patients, AML patients, and normal bone marrows, whereas IL-1 alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and GM-CSF were not expressed in either the normal-, MDS- or AML-derived adherent layers. These results indicate that cultured stroma from a subset of MDS and AML patients produce IL-1 beta and/or IL-6. Although, exposure of adherent layers to exogenous IL-1 beta was able to induce IL-6 expression, in 9 of the 14 samples constitutively expressing cytokines, IL-6 transcript levels were elevated without a concomitant increase in IL-1 beta, suggesting that IL-6 transcription was independently dysregulated.","['Wetzler, M', 'Kurzrock, R', 'Estrov, Z', 'Estey, E', 'Talpaz, M']","['Wetzler M', 'Kurzrock R', 'Estrov Z', 'Estey E', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reference Values', 'Stromal Cells', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['014521269400059J [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(94)00059-j [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1995 Jan;19(1):23-34. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)00059-j.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HL60 cells are frequently used as an in vitro model for studying granulocytes during maturation. We have previously studied actin polymerization in response to fMLP in HL60 cells undergoing DMSO induced maturation, and reported that IL-8 causes actin polymerization in neutrophils in a manner similar to fMLP. We now compare chemotaxis and actin polymerization in response to IL-8 and fMLP, and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction in HL60 cells matured with ATRA and DMSO. Cells cultured for 4 days with ATRA and DMSO showed morphologic evidence of maturation. NBD-phallacidin staining and flow cytometry were used to measure changes in F-actin content in response to IL-8 and fMLP. Uninduced cells were not capable of actin polymerization or chemotaxis. Cells matured with ATRA exhibited a 2.6-fold increase in F-actin content in response to IL-8, but only a 1.2-fold increase in response to fMLP. Cells matured with DMSO responded to both IL-8 and fMLP in an equal manner with 1.6-fold increases in F-actin. The 2 h migration for ATRA induced cells was 124 microns in response to IL-8, 107 microns with fMLP, and 105 microns in buffer. DMSO induced cells migrated 89 microns in response to IL-8, 106 microns with fMLP, and 66 microns in buffer. With maturation, 65% of the ATRA induced cells reduced NBT compared with only 15% of the DMSO induced cells. In summary, HL60 cells cultured in ATRA develop greater functional maturity than those cultured in DMSO, and a greater responsiveness to IL-8 than fMLP, a finding distinct from previously reported work in neutrophils.","['Sham, R L', 'Phatak, P D', 'Belanger, K A', 'Packman, C H']","['Sham RL', 'Phatak PD', 'Belanger KA', 'Packman CH']","['Department of Medicine, Rochester General Hospital, NY 14621.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['014521269400063G [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(94)00063-g [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1995 Jan;19(1):1-6. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)00063-g.,,,,,['P01 HL18208-18/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these tissues, it has been suggested that the level of stathmin expression is important in development and cell proliferation. Furthermore, stathmin phosphorylation appears to be involved in the regulation of cell growth arrest, terminal differentiation, and hormone secretion. Elevated levels of expression of stathmin have been described in leukemia and lymphoma cells. The aim of this study was to characterize the distribution of cells that express the stathmin protein in a wide variety of normal human and rodent tissues. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: First, antisera against a synthetic stathmin peptide have been raised in rabbits and the specificity of these antisera confirmed by their reactivity with stathmin on 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional Western blots. Second, the most appropriate means of fixing tissues in order to stain stathmin has been investigated. Finally, using the optimized conditions of tissue fixation, the antisera have been used to immunostain sections taken from a wide variety of tissues. RESULTS: Immunopositivity was found in cells of all the lineages studied, with the stained cells present within the proliferating compartment of tissues. Conversely, most nonproliferating mature cells did not stain with the antisera to stathmin. The only nonproliferating cells that appeared to express stathmin were a subpopulation of glial cells, neurons, and anterior pituitary cells. CONCLUSIONS: It is proposed that stathmin is necessary for cell proliferation in most, or all, cell lineages and that its primary function relates to some aspect of cell division.","['Rowlands, D C', 'Williams, A', 'Jones, N A', 'Guest, S S', 'Reynolds, G M', 'Barber, P C', 'Brown, G']","['Rowlands DC', 'Williams A', 'Jones NA', 'Guest SS', 'Reynolds GM', 'Barber PC', 'Brown G']","['Department of Pathology, University of Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Microtubule Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (STMN1 protein, human)', '0 (Stathmin)', '0 (Stmn1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/immunology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Ki-67 Antigen', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Microtubule Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Organ Specificity', 'Phosphoproteins/*biosynthesis/immunology/*physiology', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Stathmin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1995 Jan;72(1):100-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is established that ANCA are specific for soluble enzymes of granules of polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes (PMN), such as myeloperoxidase (MPO) or protease 3 (PR3). The purpose of this study was to identify membrane proteins of PMNs, and/or glomerular cells, as additional autoantigenic ANCA targets. When membrane protein fractions were prepared from PMNs and isolated human glomeruli, and immunoblotted with ANCA sera of NCGN patients, two bands with apparent molecular masses of 170 and 80-110 kD (gp170/80-110) were labeled in PMNs, and a 130-kD glycoprotein (gp130) in glomeruli. Gp130 was purified, and monoclonal and rabbit antibodies (Abs) were produced which showed the same double specificity as the patient's ANCA. Using these probes, evidence was provided that gp170/80-110 is identical with human lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (h-lamp-2), because both proteins were immunologically cross-reactive and screening of a cDNA expression library from human promyelocytic leukemia cells with anti-gp130 Ab yielded a clone derived from h-lamp-2. Gp170/80-110 was localized primarily in granule membranes of resting PMNs, and was translocated to the cell surfaces by activation with FMLP. By contrast, gp130 was localized in the surface membranes of endothelial cells of human glomerular and renal interstitial capillaries, rather than in lysosomes, as found for h-lamp-2. Potential clinical relevance of autoantibodies to gp170/80-110 and gp130 was assessed in a preliminary trial, in which ANCA sera of patients (n = 16) with NCGN were probed with purified or recombinant antigens. Specific reactivity was detected in approximately 90% of cases with active phases of NCGN, and frequently also in combination with autoantibodies specific for PR3 or MPO. Collectively, these data provide evidence that h-lamp-2 in PMNs and a different, structurally related 130-kD membrane protein on the cell surface of renal microvascular endothelial cells are autoantigenic targets for ANCA in patients with active NCGN.","['Kain, R', 'Matsui, K', 'Exner, M', 'Binder, S', 'Schaffner, G', 'Sommer, E M', 'Kerjaschki, D']","['Kain R', 'Matsui K', 'Exner M', 'Binder S', 'Schaffner G', 'Sommer EM', 'Kerjaschki D']","['Division of Ultrastructural Pathology and Cell Biology, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 2)', '0 (Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antigens, CD', 'Autoantigens/*blood', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cytoplasm/immunology', 'Endothelium/immunology', 'Glomerulonephritis/blood/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kidney Glomerulus/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 2', 'Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Necrosis', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.181.2.585 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1995 Feb 1;181(2):585-97. doi: 10.1084/jem.181.2.585.,,"['GENBANK/L09709', 'GENBANK/L09710', 'GENBANK/L09711', 'GENBANK/L09712', 'GENBANK/L09713', 'GENBANK/L09714', 'GENBANK/L09715', 'GENBANK/L09716', 'GENBANK/L09717']",,,,,PMC2191894,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of studies indicate that female relatives of A-T patients suffer excess risk of breast cancer; based on an overview of all currently available data the estimated relative risk of breast cancer to A-T heterozygotes is 3.9-fold (95% CI 2.1-7.2). There is some suggestion that relative risk declines with age. In contrast, there is no consistent evidence of a risk from any other cancer; the estimated risk from all studies is 1.9 (95% CI 1.5-2.5) but some studies show a larger effect whilst others show no excess risk. On the basis of these results and the likely frequency of the A-T gene, A-T heterozygotes would account for between 1 and 13% of breast cancer cases, with 3.8% being the best estimate.

In this report we describe a bioassay for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin (LT) that is extremely rapid and specific and does not require sterile conditions. Using tritiated thymidine release, we could conveniently monitor degradation of DNA into small fragments following the incubation of human myelogenous leukemia ML-1a cells with TNF. The assay showed that TNF-dependent DNA fragmentation was potentiated by cycloheximide and occurred within 90 min. Treatment of cells to TNF lead to apoptosis as indicated by thymidine release, DNA laddering on agarose gels and morphological alterations. Under these conditions, plasma membrane were not damaged as indicated by lack of chromium release. This effect was linear with TNF concentration. This assay had high throughput, did not require sterile conditions, could be carried out in the absence of serum, and was sensitive only to TNF and LT and not to interferon (IFN)-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, transforming growth factor beta, interleukin-4, leukemia inhibitory factor and granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor; all cytokines known to inhibit different cell types.

Expression of this oncogene results in the factor-independent proliferation of myeloid, erythroid, megakaryocytic, and mast precursor cells, which retain the ability to differentiate. However, no lymphoid disease was ever reported. To determine whether MPLV could infect and transform very early B cells and their precursors (BCPs), lymphoid long-term bone marrow cultures were infected with a helper-free MPLV. Within 3 wk after infection, highly proliferating BCPs could be isolated. These cells were able to clone spontaneously in semi-solid cultures, grown in the absence of feeder cell layer or exogenous growth factor and rapidly produced tumors after s.c. injection into synegic irradiated mice. In addition, MPLV transformation of pre-B cells led to the induction of an autocrine activity. Immunophenotypic and molecular analysis indicated that MPLV transformed early pro-B, pro-B, and pre-B cells, according to the expression of HSA, CD43, B220, Thy1, s-IgM and BP1 Ags, and to the rearrangements of Ig genes. Interestingly, MPLV-transformed BCPs expressed Mac1 Ag without acquiring further characteristics of macrophagic differentiation. Although the v-mpl cytoplasmic domain is devoid of tyrosine kinase consensus sequence, MPLV-transformed pre-B cells contained a major approximately 105-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that was not detected in uninfected cells or in cells transformed by the Abelson viral oncogene (v-abl). These results demonstrate that, like v-abl, the truncated cytokine receptor v-mpl is able to transform BCPs in vitro and suggest that the oncogenic transformation of BCPs by either v-mpl or v-abl use different pathways.","['Fichelson, S', 'Vigon, I', 'Dusanter, I', 'Charon, M', 'Velu, T', 'Baillou, C', 'Gisselbrecht, S', 'Lemoine, F M']","['Fichelson S', 'Vigon I', 'Dusanter I', 'Charon M', 'Velu T', 'Baillou C', 'Gisselbrecht S', 'Lemoine FM']","['INSERM U363, ICGM, Rene Descartes University, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Transformed/transplantation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/physiology', '*Oncogenes', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/*physiology']",1995/02/15 00:00,1995/02/15 00:01,['1995/02/15 00:00'],"['1995/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1995 Feb 15;154(4):1577-86.,,,,,,"['v-abl', 'v-mpl', 'vav']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examine ceramide as a candidate intracellular mediator of serum factor dependence. In Molt-4 leukemia cells, serum withdrawal caused a significant arrest in cell cycle progression (80% of cells in G0/G1), accompanied by a modest apoptotic cell death (12%). Serum deprivation of these cells resulted in significant sphingomyelin hydrolysis (72%; corresponding to hydrolysis of 47 pmol/nmol phosphate), which was accompanied by a profound and progressive elevation (up to 10-15-fold) in endogenous levels of ceramide. Withdrawal of serum caused the activation of a distinct, particulate, and magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase. The addition of exogenous C6-ceramide induced a dramatic arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle comparable to the effects observed with serum withdrawal, albeit occurring much sooner. Unlike serum withdrawal, however, the addition of C6-ceramide resulted in more pronounced apoptosis. Because of the previously noted ability of exogenously added phorbol esters to inhibit ceramide-mediated apoptosis, we investigated the hypothesis that endogenous activation of the diacylglycerol/protein kinase C pathway may modulate the response to serum withdrawal. Indeed, serum withdrawal resulted in 3-4-fold elevation in endogenous diacylglycerol levels. The addition of exogenous diacylglycerols resulted in selective attenuation of ceramide's effects on apoptosis but not on cell cycle arrest. Thus, the combination of ceramide and diacylglycerol recapitulated the complex effects of serum withdrawal on cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These studies identify a novel role for ceramide in cell cycle regulation, and they may provide the first evidence for an intracellular signal transduction pathway in mammalian cells mediating cell cycle arrest. These studies also underscore the importance of lipid second messengers and the significance of the interplay between glycerolipid-derived and sphingolipid-derived lipid mediators.","['Jayadev, S', 'Liu, B', 'Bielawska, A E', 'Lee, J Y', 'Nazaire, F', 'Pushkareva MYu', 'Obeid, L M', 'Hannun, Y A']","['Jayadev S', 'Liu B', 'Bielawska AE', 'Lee JY', 'Nazaire F', 'Pushkareva MYu', 'Obeid LM', 'Hannun YA']","['Department of Cell Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Ceramides/*pharmacology', 'Culture Media', 'Diglycerides/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Sphingomyelins/metabolism']",1995/02/03 00:00,1995/02/03 00:01,['1995/02/03 00:00'],"['1995/02/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/03 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.5.2047 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)47957-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Feb 3;270(5):2047-52. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.5.2047.,,,,,['GM43825/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its actions on both central and peripheral targets are mediated by a G-protein-coupled receptor of known primary structure. To identify contact sites between the undecapeptide SP and its receptor, we prepared radiolabeled photoreactive analogs of SP (H-RPKPQQFFGLM-NH2) by replacing amino acids in the peptide with p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine (BPA). SP, BPA3-SP, and BPA8-SP bind with high affinity (Kd < 3 nM) to SP receptors on the murine cell line P388D1, triggering intracellular calcium responses. Both binding and calcium responses are blocked by the specific SP receptor antagonist CP-96345. On photolysis, radioiodinated BPA3-SP, and BPA8-SP covalently label a heterogeneously glycosylated protein of about 75 kDa; labeling is abolished by excess unlabeled SP or CP-96345.

BPA3-SP and BPA8-SP photo-incorporate into different regions of the murine SP receptor.

To date, signal transduction pathways involved in retinoid-induced differentiation remain poorly understood. Differentiation of HL-60 cells by all-trans-retinoic acid (tRA) is directly mediated by down-regulation of the serine protease myeloblastin (mbn). In this report, we investigate the possibility that the 28-kDa heat shock protein (hsp28), previously linked to differentiation of normal and neoplastic cells including HL-60, may be regulated by mbn. Using NB4 promyelocytic leukemic cells as a differentiative model, we show that tRA induces initial suppression and subsequent up-regulation of hsp28 protein, mirroring tRA-induced changes in mbn protein. The progressive reduction in hsp28 mRNA levels in response to tRA suggests that changes in hsp28 protein levels might be posttranscriptionally mediated, raising the possibility that hsp28 may be targeted by mbn. To address this, we developed an assay using purified mbn and recombinant hsp28 and now show that hsp28 is hydrolyzed by mbn but not its homologue, human neutrophil elastase. Moreover, mbn does not indiscriminately hydrolyze other proteins. Identifying hsp28 as a substrate of mbn strongly suggests that hsp28 may be a key component of the tRA signaling pathway involved in regulating cell differentiation.","['Spector, N L', 'Hardy, L', 'Ryan, C', 'Miller, W H Jr', 'Humes, J L', 'Nadler, L M', 'Luedke, E']","['Spector NL', 'Hardy L', 'Ryan C', 'Miller WH Jr', 'Humes JL', 'Nadler LM', 'Luedke E']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Miami School of Medicine, Florida 33136.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloblastin', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/20 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1995/01/20 00:00'],"['1995/01/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1995/01/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.270.3.1003 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)82956-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Jan 20;270(3):1003-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.3.1003.,,,,,"['CA-40216-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'IF32CA08954-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['rgp1'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Its product has not been characterized, but iron overload and its pathological consequences occur only in homozygotes for this putative gene. The genes encoding the putative human counterparts of the mouse thymus-leukaemia (TL) antigens map to the area where the HFE gene lies. Here, we postulate that a human TL gene may encode a protein acting as or interacting with the transferrin (Tf) receptor in the intestinal mucosa. This hypothesis is based on the following observations: (i) hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is due to excessive absorption of iron through the intestinal mucosa. HH has a strong association with HLA-A3, but HLA-A3 has no direct role in the pathogenesis and reflects linkage disequilibrium with a telomeric gene. (ii) An HLA-A3 homozygous genotype is associated with the highest relative risks for both early-onset leukaemia and HH. In analogy to the susceptibility locus in mice, this genotype may reflect a TL gene association in leukaemia and raise the possibility of a TL gene involvement in HH.

In the majority of individuals, PMN were more resistant to perforin than other peripheral blood cells including natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ lymphocytes. Among the lymphocytes, CD4+ cells were the most susceptible subset, followed by CD19+, CD8+ and CD56+ lymphocytes respectively. The human promyelocytic leukaemia cell line, HL-60, and the human histiocytic lymphoma cell line, U937, were readily killed by perforin. When HL-60 were differentiated to either macrophage- or neutrophil-like end cells, and U937 differentiated to macrophage-like end cells, there was no difference between differentiated and undifferentiated cells in their relative susceptibility to perforin. The relative resistance of PMN to perforin may be important in protecting them from damage in in vivo situations where both NK cells and neutrophils are localized in the same inflammatory areas.","['Jones, J', 'Morgan, B P']","['Jones J', 'Morgan BP']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/*drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Neutrophils/drug effects', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1994 Aug;82(4):555-60.,,,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,PMC1414909,,,,,,,,,,,

Ionizing radiation provokes the decomposition reaction of water, producing a variety of reactive oxygen species, including O2.-. The finding that cancer cells are generally low in SOD activity may offer a theoretical base for radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The purpose of this study was to examine the protective effect of intracellular SOD against cytotoxicity induced by O2.- or radiation and to investigate whether exogenous SOD can protect cells from O2.-(-) and radiation-induced cytotoxicity. For this purpose, xanthine (X) and xanthine oxidase (XOD) were employed as an O2.- (-)generating system, and a linear accelerator was used for ionizing radiation. Cytotoxicity against monolayer cancer cell lines and leukemic cell lines was estimated by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase from these cells. The results revealed that the resistibilites to X- and XOD-generated O2.- and radiation correlated with intracellular Cu. Zn-SOD levels and that exogenous SOD could only slightly reduce X- and XOD-induced cytotoxicity while having no influence on radiation-induced cytotoxicity. Thus, intracellular SOD may play a central role in protecting cancer cells against reactive oxygen species generated by anticancer drugs and radiation.","['Yamaguchi, S', 'Sakurada, S', 'Nagumo, M']","['Yamaguchi S', 'Sakurada S', 'Nagumo M']","['Second Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, School of Dentistry, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Xanthines)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '1AVZ07U9S7 (Xanthine)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.17.3.2 (Xanthine Oxidase)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase', 'Leukemia', 'Mouth Neoplasms', 'Superoxide Dismutase/*metabolism', 'Superoxides/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xanthine', 'Xanthine Oxidase/pharmacology', 'Xanthines/pharmacology']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0891-5849(94)90165-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0891-5849(94)90165-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 1994 Nov;17(5):389-95. doi: 10.1016/0891-5849(94)90165-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These primordial germ cell-derived embryonic germ cells (EG cells) can be induced to differentiate extensively in culture and also form teratocarcinomas when injected into nude mice. Additionally, they contribute to chimeras when injected into host blastocysts. We have derived multiple EG cell lines from 8.5 days post coitum (dpc) embryos of C57BL/6 inbred mice. Four independent EG cell lines with normal male karyotypes have formed chimeras (up to 70% coat colour chimerism) when injected into BALB/c host blastocysts. Chimeric mice from all four cell lines are fertile, but only those from one line have transmitted coat colour markers through the germline. Studies have also been carried out to determine whether gonadal primordial germ cells can give rise to pluripotent EG cells. Germ cells from gonads of 15.5 dpc C57BL/6 embryos and newborn mice failed to produce EG cell lines. EG cell lines capable of forming teratocarcinomas and coat colour chimeras have been established from primordial germ cells of 12.5 dpc genital ridges.

Paclitaxel concentrations in biological specimens can be measured using high performance liquid chromatography, or more recently by immunoassay. Pharmacokinetic studies in which adults have been administered pacliaxel intravenously over 1 to 96 hours have demonstrated the following pharmacokinetic characteristics: extensive tissue distribution; high plasma protein binding (approximately 90 to 95%); variable systemic clearance, with average clearances ranging from 87 to 503 ml/min/m2 (5.2 to 30.2 L/h/m2); and minimal renal excretion of parent drug (< 10%). In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that paclitaxel is extensively metabolised by the liver to 3 primary metabolites. Cytochrome P450 enzymes of the CYP3A and CYP2C subfamilies appear to be involved in hepatic metabolism of paclitaxel. Although early reports suggested that paclitaxel has first-order pharmacokinetics, some recent trials in children and adults suggest that its elimination is saturable. The clinical importance of saturable elimination would be greatest when large dosages are administered and/or the drug is infused over a shorter period of time. In these situations, achievable plasma concentrations are likely to exceed the affinity constant for elimination (Km). Thus, small changes in dosage or infusion duration may result in disproportionately large alterations in paclitaxel systemic exposure, potentially influencing patient response. A pharmacokinetic analysis of the combination of cisplatin and paclitaxel has demonstrated that paclitaxel clearance is apparently sequence dependent. Patients administered cisplatin prior to paclitaxel had lower clearances and greater clinical toxicity than patients receiving paclitaxel before cisplatin. Additional pharmacodynamic analyses have shown nonhaematological and haematological toxicity to correlate better with parameters of paclitaxel exposure (e.g. area under the plasma concentration-time curve, duration of plasma concentrations exceeding 0.1 mumol/L) than with the administered dosage.","['Sonnichsen, D S', 'Relling, M V']","['Sonnichsen DS', 'Relling MV']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Dosage Forms)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Absorption', 'Adult', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dosage Forms', 'Drug Administration Routes', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Tissue Distribution']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00003088-199427040-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 1994 Oct;27(4):256-69. doi: 10.2165/00003088-199427040-00002.,46,,,,"['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 31566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 6-h exposure of HL-60 cells to sphingosine or its methylated derivative, N,N-dimethylsphingosine, caused internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and stereotypical morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis (i.e., cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and the formation of apoptotic bodies), as well as that to pharmacological inhibitors of protein kinase C such as 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine and staurosporine. Apoptosis by sphingosine and N,N-dimethylsphingosine was measured using a flow cytometric method. The percentages of apoptotic cells in cultures treated with sphingosine (10 microM) and N,N-dimethylsphingosine (10 microM) for 6 h were 55.6 +/- 7.8% and 84.2 +/- 11.6%, respectively. HL-60 cells were induced to differentiate toward macrophages by treatment with 5 nM 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, which was a hallmark of apoptosis, was first detected after 10-h exposure to PMA and increased with longer treatment. Sphingosine concentrations in the cells increased concomitantly with the increasing proportion of apoptotic cells during cell differentiation. Sphingosine level in HL-60 cells differentiated by treatment with PMA for 48 h was about 3.3-fold greater than that in untreated cells. Differentiated HL-60 cells exhibited a markedly increased conversion of exogenously added [3H]ceramide to [3H]sphingosine, indicating elevation of ceramidase activity. Moreover, exposure to sphingosine resulted in down-regulation of c-myc mRNA. These observations suggest the possible role of sphingosine in induction of apoptotic DNA fragmentation during PMA-induced differentiation in myeloid leukemia cells. Sphingosine may function as an endogenous modulator mediating the apoptotic signal.","['Ohta, H', 'Sweeney, E A', 'Masamune, A', 'Yatomi, Y', 'Hakomori, S', 'Igarashi, Y']","['Ohta H', 'Sweeney EA', 'Masamune A', 'Yatomi Y', 'Hakomori S', 'Igarashi Y']","['Biomembrane Institute, Seattle, Washington 98119.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'L9QRA71834 (N,N-dimethylsphingosine)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Ceramides/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Phospholipids/analysis/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Feb 1;55(3):691-7.,,,,,['CA42505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to classical antifolates, which are dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors, DDATHF primarily inhibits GAR transformylase, the first folate-dependent enzyme along the pathway of de novo purine biosynthesis. The (6R) diastereomer of DDATHF (Lometrexol), currently undergoing clinical investigation, was used to develop CCRF-CEM human leukemia sublines resistant to increasing concentrations of the drug. Three cell lines were selected for ability to grow in medium containing 0.1 microM, 1.0 microM, and 10 microM of (6R)DDATHF, respectively. Impaired polyglutamylation was identified as a common mechanism of resistance in all three cell lines. A progressive decrease in the level of polyglutamylation was associated with diminished folylpolyglutamate synthetase activity and paralleled increasing levels of resistance to the drug. However, the expression of folylpolyglutamate synthetase RNA was not altered in the resistant cell lines compared to the parent cells. The most resistant cell subline also displayed an increased activity of gamma-glutamyl hydrolase. The sublines were scrutinized for other possible mechanisms of resistance. No alterations in drug transport or in purine economy were found. Modest increases were found in the activity of methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase but no alterations of other folate-dependent enzymes were observed. Increases in accumulation and conversion of folic acid to reduced forms, particularly 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, was also seen. The resistant cell lines were sensitive to dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors, methotrexate and trimetrexate, for a 72-h exposure period but showed cross-resistance to methotrexate for 4 and 24 h exposures. Cross-resistance was also shown toward other deazafolate analogues for both short- and long-term exposures.","['Pizzorno, G', 'Moroson, B A', 'Cashmore, A R', 'Russello, O', 'Mayer, J R', 'Galivan, J', 'Bunni, M A', 'Priest, D G', 'Beardsley, G P']","['Pizzorno G', 'Moroson BA', 'Cashmore AR', 'Russello O', 'Mayer JR', 'Galivan J', 'Bunni MA', 'Priest DG', 'Beardsley GP']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '6P3AVY8A7Q (lometrexol)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (FADH2))', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.5.1.5 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase (NADP))', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 2.1.2.- (Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases)', 'EC 2.1.2.1 (Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.2.2 (Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.2.3 (Phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide Formyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)', 'EC 3.4.19.9 (gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'EC 6.3.4.3 (Formate-Tetrahydrofolate Ligase)']",IM,"['5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (FADH2)', 'Acyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Clone Cells', '*Drug Resistance', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Formate-Tetrahydrofolate Ligase/metabolism', 'Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase (NADP)/metabolism', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)', 'Oxidoreductases/metabolism', 'Peptide Synthases/metabolism', 'Phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide Formyltransferase', 'Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase/metabolism']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Feb 1;55(3):566-73.,,,,,"['CA 25933/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57320/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was further determined by Northern blot analysis that this higher sensitivity of B-myb overexpressing clones was not due to a change in the expression of TGF-beta receptor type I or in the kinetics of the regulation of c-myc, c-myb, bcl-2, and/or bax.","['Bies, J', 'Wolff, L']","['Bies J', 'Wolff L']","['Laboratory of Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Mybl2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Northern', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Genes, myc', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Nucleosomes/drug effects', '*Oncogenes', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/biosynthesis', 'Retroviridae', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Feb 1;55(3):501-4.,,,,,,"['B-myb', 'c-myb', 'c-myc']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We find that, although cells expressing P210BCR-ABL by gene transfer are more resistant than their normal counterparts to apoptosis induced by chemotherapy or radiation, they are equally susceptible to apoptosis induced by alloreactive CTLs.

Normally, plasma arginine is excluded from the hepatocyte intracellular space by the low basal activity of its membrane transporter. We hypothesized that progressive malignant disease is associated with an increase in carrier-mediated arginine transport across the hepatocyte plasma membrane. METHODS: Twenty-four adult Fischer 344 rats were implanted subcutaneously with fibrosarcomas (TBR) and were studied when the tumors were small [10 +/- 1% of body weight (BW)], medium-sized (15 +/- 1% of BW), and large (25 +/- 1% of BW). Groups of control rats (n = 24) were pair-fed to match carcass weights of the three TBR groups. Livers were excised, and hepatocyte plasma membrane vesicles (HPMVs) were prepared by Percoll density gradient centrifugation. Arginine transport by HPMVs was assayed by a rapid mixing/filtration technique. Vesicle purity and functionality were assessed by membrane enzyme marker enrichments and transportability into an osmotically active space. RESULTS: Arginine uptake by HPMVs was mediated by both saturable carrier-mediated (System y+) and nonsaturable (diffusion) components. The time course of arginine uptake in HPMVs in the three groups showed similar equilibrium transport rates, indicating similar vesicle sizes. The presence of the growing tumor resulted in a 40-120% increase in System y(+)-mediated arginine transport in HPMVs. This response was dependent on tumor size and was due to a stimulation of carrier Vmax, suggesting an increase in the number of functional System y+ carriers in the hepatocyte plasma membrane. The Na(+)-dependent transport of the System A analog MeAIB was also increased, but only in rats with large tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor growth results in a progressive increase in hepatic arginine transport, a response mediated primarily by an increase in the activity of System y+. This accelerated transport may amplify the availability of arginine to support key arginine-dependent metabolic pathways in the hepatocyte.","['Espat, N J', 'Copeland, E M', 'Souba, W W']","['Espat NJ', 'Copeland EM', 'Souba WW']","['Department of Surgery, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Surg Oncol,Annals of surgical oncology,9420840,"['0 (Amino Acid Transport Systems)', '0 (Aminoisobutyric Acids)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)', '2566-34-9 (2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Transport Systems', 'Aminoisobutyric Acids/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Arginine/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Fibrosarcoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Male', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', '*Receptors, Virus']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02303559 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Surg Oncol. 1994 Mar;1(2):147-56. doi: 10.1007/BF02303559.,,,,,['CA 45327/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunophenotypically, CD19 and CD20 were positive for all cases of this series and CD5, CD21, CD22, CD23, CD25, CD38, Leu-8, KB-61, and bcl-2 protein were expressed in variable proportion from case to case. CD10, however, did not react. No alkaline phosphatase (ALP) positive cases were found. The phenotype of BCLL was similar to that of B cells of the mantle zone (MZ) of secondary follicle in the lymph node. It is therefore postulated that the neoplastic cells of BCLL in these cases might be derived from B cells of the MZ. Moreover, the cells possibly originated from the lymphocytes located in the inner layer of the MZ, since ALP+ B cells are usually observed in the outer layer of the MZ. The pseudofollicular (PF) pattern was observed in four biopsied lymph nodes among five cases tested, but no such a pattern in an aspiration clot of bone marrow. These four cases consisted of three cases with CLL and a case with CLL/PL. The immunohistochemical study showed that there were many proliferating cells showing Ki-67+ in the PF area of the lymph nodes. In these cases, leukemic cells might have developed from the PF area of the lymph node.","['Nakamura, N', 'Suzuki, S', 'Segami, H', 'Nozawa, Y', 'Tominaga, K', 'Wachi, E', 'Hojo, H', 'Abe, M', 'Sakuma, H', 'Wakasa, H']","['Nakamura N', 'Suzuki S', 'Segami H', 'Nozawa Y', 'Tominaga K', 'Wachi E', 'Hojo H', 'Abe M', 'Sakuma H', 'Wakasa H']","['Department of Pathology, Fukushima Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Division', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Ki-67 Antigen', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/immunology/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1827.1994.tb02926.x [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Int. 1994 Oct-Nov;44(10-11):779-84. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.1994.tb02926.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Second primary tumours occurring in such individuals might also be related to their genetic predisposition to cancer, as shown for hereditary retinoblastoma. We have found a mutation in the zinc finger region of the remaining WT1 allele in a case of acute myeloid leukaemia developing in a Wilms tumour survivor with the WAGR syndrome.

In the early 1970s, it was discovered that developing sympathetic neurons could switch from an adrenergic to cholinergic phenotype. The search for a diffusible factor responsible for this eventually led to the identification of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Cholinergic differentiation factor (CDF)/LIF has turned out to belong to the IL-6/class IB cytokine family. In this article we further speculate on a plausible molecular pathway for the IL6/class IB receptor family in the immune and nervous systems. We think that the evolution of the IL-6/class IB receptor family may have occurred in at least two major steps. Firstly, binding subunits of an IL-6 receptor and for a CDF/LIF receptor evolved and secondly, a third binding subunit of a CNTF receptor evolved. Our evolutional consideration predicts that the binding subunits generally determine the specificity of the receptors and it is possible that novel members of the cytokine family and their receptors exist in the nervous system.","['Yamamori, T', 'Sarai, A']","['Yamamori T', 'Sarai A']","['Frontier Research Program, Laboratory for Neural Networks, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",France,J Physiol Paris,"Journal of physiology, Paris",9309351,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Biological Evolution', 'Humans', 'Immune System/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nervous System/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0928-4257(94)90002-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0928-4257(94)90002-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Physiol Paris. 1994;88(3):165-71. doi: 10.1016/0928-4257(94)90002-7.,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
