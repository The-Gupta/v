BCR/ABL kinase displays transforming activity because of its constitutive kinase activity causing deregulated proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and adhesion. Moreover, BCR/ABL kinase is able to facilitate DNA repair, prolong activation of G2/M and S cell cycle checkpoints, and elevate expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-X(L), making malignant cells less responsive to antitumor treatment. BCR/ABL may also stimulate generation of reactive oxygen species and enhance spontaneous DNA damage in tumor cells. Unfortunately, BCR/ABL kinase compromises the fidelity of DNA repair mechanisms, thus contributing to the accumulation of additional genetic abnormalities that lead to resistance to inhibitors such as imatinib mesylate and to malignant progression of the disease.

Currently, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is thought to be the only curative therapeutic modality for this leukemia in adults, but the long-term survival rates are about 40% or less, far from satisfactory. Imatinib mesylate, a recently introduced specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL, in combination with chemotherapy, resulted in more than 90% hematologic CR in adult Ph-positive ALL, including molecular CR in more than 50% of patients. The higher CR rate and less frequent relapse gave more patients a chance to receive SCT. Patients who did not qualify for allo-SCT because of the lack of a suitable donor, advanced age, or underlying medical conditions apparently showed better survival than historical control patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Although longer follow-up is required to determine the effect on survival, imatinib in combination with chemotherapy clearly has a major potential to improve the treatment of Ph-positive ALL and may cure a substantial proportion of patients without SCT.","['Ohno, Ryuzo']",['Ohno R'],"['Aichi Cancer Center and Aichi Syukutoku University, Chikusaku, Nagoya, Japan. ohnoryu@aichi-cc.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'CVAD protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",37,2006/09/01 00:00,2010/08/07 06:00,['2010/04/29 06:00'],"['2010/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2006/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11899-996-0006-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2006 Sep;1(3):180-7. doi: 10.1007/s11899-996-0006-7.,['Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, investigators have proposed and tested numerous vaccine strategies able to elicit immune responses to tumor antigens. Furthermore, novel approaches to B-cell-targeted antibody therapies hold promise in advancing this line of treatment, and efficient gene transfer technologies have enabled investigators to manipulate immune effector cells to enhance antitumor activity.

Whether findings from these clinical trials, in combination with further preclinical studies, will ultimately translate into improved survival of patients with B-cell malignancies remains to be seen.","['Brentjens, Renier J']",['Brentjens RJ'],"['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. brentjer@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Vaccines, Synthetic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytokines/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/immunology', 'Immunotherapy/*methods/trends', 'Immunotherapy, Active', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Therapies, Investigational', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/metabolism/transplantation', 'Vaccines, Synthetic/therapeutic use']",42,2006/12/01 00:00,2010/07/29 06:00,['2010/04/29 06:00'],"['2010/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2006/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11899-006-0007-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2006 Dec;1(4):258-63. doi: 10.1007/s11899-006-0007-6.,,,"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95152/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequently, in Europe and the United States, high-dose methotrexate, high-dose cytarabine, etoposide, and ifosfamide were found to be active in children with recurrent disease and were incorporated into primary therapy for patients with high-risk disease. These third-generation protocols produce overall cure rates around 90%. Therapy regimens for adults with Burkitt lymphoma have been developed by modifying second-generation pediatric protocols, and few investigators have used the third-generation pediatric regimens that include higher doses of methotrexate and additional agents. The weight of evidence strongly suggests that high-dose therapy with stem cell rescue in first remission cannot substitute for intensive therapy from the outset. Tolerance of intensive regimens by the elderly is a legitimate concern, but it seems appropriate to modify therapy only when necessary in individual patients. The value of rituximab and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in patients undergoing intensive therapy (particularly the elderly) is worthy of further exploration. Because childhood diffuse large-B-cell leukemia (DLBCL) responds equally well to therapy for Burkitt lymphoma, more intensive therapy and intensive support might also give better results in at least a subset of adults with advanced DLBCL-perhaps defined on the basis of limited molecular profiling, which has provided new information about the categories of aggressive B-cell lymphomas.","['Magrath, Ian T']",['Magrath IT'],"['International Network for Cancer Treatment & Research, INCTR at Institut Pasteur, Rue England 642, B1180, Brussels, Belgium. imagrath@inctr.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology/genetics/pathology', 'Central Nervous System/pathology', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Drug Therapy/trends', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Rituximab', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Uganda/epidemiology']",78,2006/12/01 00:00,2010/07/29 06:00,['2010/04/29 06:00'],"['2010/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2006/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11899-006-0004-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2006 Dec;1(4):230-40. doi: 10.1007/s11899-006-0004-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, most of the current studies focused on the genome-wide screening of CNVs, and the functional impact of such regions needs to be extensively investigated in large amount of clinical samples. Thus, in our study, we collected 617 bone marrow samples from multi-types of hematological malignancies as well as healthy controls. We found significant association between the CNVs of BS69 and these hematological malignancies including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), multiple myeloma (MM), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We also examined the expression of BS69 mRNA in the samples with one or two copies of DNA, and observed a weak yet positive correlation between the relative expression level and gene dosage. In general, the CNVs of BS69 have the potential to serve as a diagnostic indicator, alone or in combination with other markers, for hematological malignancies.","['Yang, Hong', 'Zhang, Chao', 'Zhao, Xiaosu', 'Wu, Qi', 'Fu, Xinrong', 'Yu, Bo', 'Shao, Yong', 'Guan, Ming', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Wan, Jun', 'Huang, Xiaojun']","['Yang H', 'Zhang C', 'Zhao X', 'Wu Q', 'Fu X', 'Yu B', 'Shao Y', 'Guan M', 'Zhang W', 'Wan J', 'Huang X']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Guangdong, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (ZMYND11 protein, human)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/physiology', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', '*DNA Copy Number Variations', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism']",,2010/04/29 06:00,2010/09/21 06:00,['2010/04/29 06:00'],"['2010/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-010-0966-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2010 Oct;89(10):959-64. doi: 10.1007/s00277-010-0966-5.

It is a critical signaling molecule for tumor cell proliferation and survival. Data suggest that IGF-IR antibodies can effectively and specifically inhibit cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Blockage of IGF-IR expression could be a promising therapeutic approach for the management of cancer patients. AIM OF WORK: To characterize the expression pattern of IGF-IR gene in malignant lymphoblasts of children and adults suffering from ALL in relation to clinical features at diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression of IGF-IR was analyzed in 60 patients with ALL, 30 childhood ALL (16 newly diagnosed and 14 in complete remission) and 30 adulthood ALL (15 newly diagnosed and 15 in complete remission) together with 20 normal age and sex matched healthy controls using a Real-Time Quantitative Reverse- Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTQ-PCR) to assess the possible relation, association or correlation between IGF-IR expression and ALL clinical and laboratory features at diagnosis. RESULTS: IGF-IR was expressed in all 60 patients with ALL; the expression levels of IGF-IR were significantly higher in newly diagnosed patients than in patients in complete remission (CR) and controls (p < 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in the expression of IGF-IR between patients with different clinical and laboratory features. CONCLUSION: IGF-1R seems to play a crucial role in patients with ALL since it is expressed in all ALL cases (adulthood and childhood). Therefore, new therapeutic agents targeting IGF-1R may provide a better chance for those patients.

The concept that only a subpopulation of rare cancer stem cells (CSCs) is responsible for maintenance of the neoplasm emerged nearly 50 years ago: however, conclusive proof for the existence of a CSC was obtained only relatively recently. As definition, cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a sub-population of cancer cells (found within solid tumors or hematological malignancies) that possess characteristics normally associated with stem cells as high self-renewal potential. These cells are believed to be tumorigenic (tumor- forming) in contrast to the bulk of cancer cells, which are thought to be non-tumorigenic. The first conclusive evidence for CSCs was published in 1997 in Nature Medicine by Bonnet & Dick who isolated a subpopulation of leukemic cells in AML that express a specific surface marker CD34 but lacks the CD38 marker. The authors established that the CD34+/CD38- subpopulation is capable of initiating leukemia in NOD/SCID mice that is histologically similar to the donor [1]. This subpopulation of cells is termed SCID Leukemia-initiating cells (SLIC). A theory suggests that such cells act as a reservoir for disease recurrence, are the origin of metastasis and exert resistance towards classical antitumor regimens. This resistance was attributed to a combination of several factors [2], suggesting that conventional antitumor regimens are targeting the bulk of the tumor not the dormant stubborn CSCs. PURPOSE: Better understanding of the leukemogenic process and the biology of CSCS to define the most applicable procedures for their identification and isolation in order to design specific targeted therapies aiming at reducing disease burden to very low levels .. up to eradication of the tumor.","['Kassem, Neemat M']",['Kassem NM'],"['The Department of Clinical Oncology; Department of Clinical Pathology; Section of Immunology, Kasr ElAini Oncology Centre (NEMROCK), Cairo University School of Medicine, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst,Journal of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute,9424566,,,,,2008/09/01 00:00,2008/09/01 00:01,['2010/04/29 06:00'],"['2010/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst. 2008 Sep;20(3):209-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their broad spectrum of activities may probably be due to adjacent free hydroxyl groups. METHODS: Protein activation and expression were analysed by western blotting, deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate levels by HPLC, ribonucleotide reductase activity by (14)C-cytidine incorporation into nascent DNA and cell-cycle distribution by FACS. Apoptosis was measured by Hoechst 33258/propidium iodide double staining of nuclear chromatin and the formation of gaps into the lymphendothelial barrier in a three-dimensional co-culture model consisting of MCF-7 tumour cell spheroids and human lymphendothelial monolayers. RESULTS: In HL-60 leukaemia cells, di-GA activated caspase 3 and dose-dependently induced apoptosis. It further inhibited cell-cycle progression in the G1 phase by four different mechanisms: rapid downregulation of cyclin D1, induction of Chk2 with simultaneous downregulation of Cdc25A, induction of the Cdk-inhibitor p21(Cip/Waf) and inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity resulting in reduced dCTP and dTTP levels. Furthermore, di-GA inhibited the generation of lymphendothelial gaps by cancer cell spheroid-secreted lipoxygenase metabolites. Lymphendothelial gaps, adjacent to tumour bulks, can be considered as gates facilitating metastatic spread. CONCLUSION: These data show that di-GA exhibits three distinct anticancer activities: induction of apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest and disruption of cancer cell-induced lymphendothelial disintegration.","['Madlener, S', 'Saiko, P', 'Vonach, C', 'Viola, K', 'Huttary, N', 'Stark, N', 'Popescu, R', 'Gridling, M', 'Vo, N T-P', 'Herbacek, I', 'Davidovits, A', 'Giessrigl, B', 'Venkateswarlu, S', 'Geleff, S', 'Jager, W', 'Grusch, M', 'Kerjaschki, D', 'Mikulits, W', 'Golakoti, T', 'Fritzer-Szekeres, M', 'Szekeres, T', 'Krupitza, G']","['Madlener S', 'Saiko P', 'Vonach C', 'Viola K', 'Huttary N', 'Stark N', 'Popescu R', 'Gridling M', 'Vo NT', 'Herbacek I', 'Davidovits A', 'Giessrigl B', 'Venkateswarlu S', 'Geleff S', 'Jager W', 'Grusch M', 'Kerjaschki D', 'Mikulits W', 'Golakoti T', 'Fritzer-Szekeres M', 'Szekeres T', 'Krupitza G']","['Institute of Clinical Pathology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (digalloylresveratrol)', '632XD903SP (Gallic Acid)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coloring Agents', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gallic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Gap Junctions/drug effects/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lung/cytology/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology']",,2010/04/29 06:00,2010/05/29 06:00,['2010/04/29 06:00'],"['2010/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['6605656 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6605656 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2010 Apr 27;102(9):1361-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605656.,,,"['F 2801/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'F 2806/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'P 19598/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria']",,PMC2865764,['UKMS31287'],['NLM: UKMS31287'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imaging is the fastest growing expense for Medicare but has not been examined among beneficiaries with cancer. OBJECTIVE: To examine changes in the use of imaging and how those changes contribute to the overall cost of cancer care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Analysis of a nationally representative 5% sample of claims from the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services from 1999 through 2008. Patients were Medicare beneficiaries with incident breast cancer, colorectal cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or prostate cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Use and cost of imaging by modality, year, and cancer type. RESULTS: There were 100,954 incident cases of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and prostate cancer from 1999 through 2006. Significant mean annual increases in imaging use occurred among all cancer types for positron emission tomography (35.9%-53.6%), bone density studies (6.3%-20.0%), echocardiograms (5.0%-7.8%), magnetic resonance imaging (4.4%-11.5%), and ultrasound (0.7%-7.4%). Conventional radiograph rates decreased or stayed the same. As of 2006, beneficiaries with lung cancer and beneficiaries with lymphoma incurred the largest overall imaging costs, exceeding a mean of $3000 per beneficiary within 2 years of diagnosis. By 2005, one-third of beneficiaries with breast cancer underwent bone scans and half of beneficiaries with lung cancer or lymphoma underwent positron emission tomography scans. Mean 2-year imaging costs per beneficiary increased at a rate greater than the increase in mean total costs per beneficiary for all cancer types. CONCLUSION: Imaging costs among Medicare beneficiaries with cancer increased from 1999 through 2006, outpacing the rate of increase in total costs among Medicare beneficiaries with cancer.","['Dinan, Michaela A', 'Curtis, Lesley H', 'Hammill, Bradley G', 'Patz, Edward F Jr', 'Abernethy, Amy P', 'Shea, Alisa M', 'Schulman, Kevin A']","['Dinan MA', 'Curtis LH', 'Hammill BG', 'Patz EF Jr', 'Abernethy AP', 'Shea AM', 'Schulman KA']","['Center for Clinical and Genetic Economics, Duke Clinical Research Institute, PO Box 17969, Durham, NC 27715, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Diagnostic Imaging/*economics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Health Care Costs/*trends', 'Humans', 'Insurance, Health, Reimbursement/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Medicare/*statistics & numerical data', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis', 'United States']",,2010/04/29 06:00,2010/04/29 06:01,['2010/04/29 06:00'],"['2010/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/29 06:01 [medline]']","['303/16/1625 [pii]', '10.1001/jama.2010.460 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2010 Apr 28;303(16):1625-31. doi: 10.1001/jama.2010.460.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a nationwide study in Denmark to describe MCC incidence and mortality and the association between MCC and other cancers. METHODS: We used data from Danish national health and population registers on MCC diagnoses, deaths, and population counts during the study period (1978-2006) to calculate MCC incidence rates, cumulative risks of MCC at age 100 years, and MCC mortality rates by tumor stage. We used Poisson regression to estimate the excess mortality rate ratio attributable to MCC and examined associations between MCC and other cancers diagnosed before and after the MCC diagnosis using standardized incidence rate ratios (SIRs). All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Between January 1, 1978, and December 31, 2006, 185 persons were diagnosed with MCC in Denmark. MCC incidence between 1995 and 2006 was 2.2 cases per million person-years. In the first year after MCC diagnosis, 22% of persons with localized disease died compared with 54% of patients with nonlocalized disease; by 5 years after diagnosis, the proportions of MCC patients who had died increased to 55% and 84%, respectively. MCC incidence was statistically significantly increased more than 1 year after a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (SIR = 14.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 8.4 to 25.6), basal cell carcinoma (SIR = 4.3, 95% CI = 2.7 to 6.6), malignant melanoma (SIR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.1 to 10.3), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SIR = 12.0, 95% CI = 3.8 to 37.8), Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR = 17.6, 95% CI = 2.5 to 126), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR = 5.6, 95% CI = 1.4 to 22.4). Squamous cell carcinoma (SIR = 12.1, 95% CI = 5.1 to 29.1) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SIR = 14.7, 95% CI = 3.7 to 58.8) occurred in statistically significant excess more than 1 year after MCC diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the existence of shared risk factors for MCC and other cancers. Heightened awareness of the association between MCC and other cancers, particularly squamous cell carcinoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, may facilitate earlier clinical detection and treatment of MCC, thereby improving patient survival.","['Kaae, Jeanette', 'Hansen, Anne V', 'Biggar, Robert J', 'Boyd, Heather A', 'Moore, Patrick S', 'Wohlfahrt, Jan', 'Melbye, Mads']","['Kaae J', 'Hansen AV', 'Biggar RJ', 'Boyd HA', 'Moore PS', 'Wohlfahrt J', 'Melbye M']","['Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Artillerivej 5, 2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bias', 'Carcinoma, Merkel Cell/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality/pathology', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/complications', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/mortality/pathology']",,2010/04/29 06:00,2010/06/15 06:00,['2010/04/29 06:00'],"['2010/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['djq120 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djq120 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2010 Jun 2;102(11):793-801. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djq120.

Thus, their use in allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) provides a promising strategy to treat GVHD. However, 3 obstacles prevent their routine use in human clinical trials: (1) low circulating number of Tregs in peripheral blood, (2) loss of suppressor function after in vitro expansion, and (3) lack of Treg-specific surface markers necessary for efficient purification. FOXP3 is exclusively expressed in Tregs and forced expression in CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells can convert these non-Tregs into Tregs with functional suppressor function. Here, we show that the FDA-approved hypomethylating agents, decitabine (Dec) and azacitidine (AzaC), induce FOXP3 expression in CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells both in vitro and in vivo. Their suppressor function is dependent on direct contact, partially dependent on perforin 1 (Prf1), but independent of granzyme B (GzmB), and surprisingly, Foxp3. Independence of Foxp3 suggests that genes responsible for the suppressor function are also regulated by DNA methylation. We have identified 48 candidate genes for future studies. Finally, AzaC treatment of mice that received a transplant of major histocompatibility complex mismatched allogeneic bone marrow and T cells mitigates GVHD while preserving GVL by peripheral conversion of alloreactive effector T cells into FOXP3(+) Tregs and epigenetic modulation of genes downstream of Foxp3 required for the suppressor function of Tregs.","['Choi, Jaebok', 'Ritchey, Julie', 'Prior, Julie L', 'Holt, Matthew', 'Shannon, William D', 'Deych, Elena', 'Piwnica-Worms, David R', 'DiPersio, John F']","['Choi J', 'Ritchey J', 'Prior JL', 'Holt M', 'Shannon WD', 'Deych E', 'Piwnica-Worms DR', 'DiPersio JF']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/drug effects/metabolism/transplantation']",,2010/04/29 06:00,2010/08/25 06:00,['2010/04/29 06:00'],"['2010/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34769-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-12-257253 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jul 8;116(1):129-39. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-12-257253.

However, cancer cells might display telomere dysfunctions which in conjunction with defects in DNA repair and apoptosis, enables them to circumvent these pathways. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells exhibit telomere dysfunction, and a subset of these cells are resistant to DNA damage-induced apoptosis and display short telomeres. We show here that these cells exhibit significant resection of their protective telomeric 3' single-stranded overhangs and an increased number of telomere-induced foci containing gammaH2AX and 53BP1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated increased levels of telomeric Ku70 and phospho-S2056-DNA-PKcs, 2 essential components of the mammalian nonhomologous end-joining DNA repair system. Notably, these CLL cells display deletions of telomeric signals on one or 2 chromatids in parallel with 11q22 deletions, or with 13q14 deletions associated with another chromosomal aberration or with a complex karyotype.

Modest advances with therapeutic approaches that include oxaliplatin (L-OHP) have brought the median survival rate to 22 months, with drug resistance remaining a significant barrier. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is undergoing clinical evaluation. Although human colon carcinomas express TRAIL receptors, they can also demonstrate TRAIL resistance. Constitutive NF-kappaB activation has been implicated in resistance to TRAIL and to cytotoxic agents. We have demonstrated constitutive NF-kappaB activation in five of six human colon carcinoma cell lines; this activation is inhibited by quinacrine. Quinacrine induced apoptosis in colon carcinomas and potentiated the cytotoxic activity of TRAIL in RKO and HT29 cells and that of L-OHP in HT29 cells. Similarly, overexpression of IkappaBalpha mutant (IkappaBalphaM) or treatment with the IKK inhibitor, BMS-345541, also sensitized these cells to TRAIL and L-OHP. Importantly, 2 h of quinacrine pretreatment resulted in decreased expression of c-FLIP and Mcl-1, which were determined to be transcriptional targets of NF-kappaB. Extended exposure for 24 h to quinacrine did not further sensitize these cells to TRAIL- or L-OHP-induced cell death; however, exposure caused the down-regulation of additional NF-kappaB-dependent survival factors. Short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of c-FLIP or Mcl-1 significantly sensitized these cells to TRAIL and L-OHP. Taken together, data demonstrate that NF-kappaB is constitutively active in colon cancer cell lines and NF-kappaB, and its downstream targets may constitute an important target for the development of therapeutic approaches against this disease.","['Jani, Tanvi S', 'DeVecchio, Jennifer', 'Mazumdar, Tapati', 'Agyeman, Akwasi', 'Houghton, Janet A']","['Jani TS', 'DeVecchio J', 'Mazumdar T', 'Agyeman A', 'Houghton JA']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '04ZR38536J (Oxaliplatin)', 'H0C805XYDE (Quinacrine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/metabolism', 'Carcinoma/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Oxaliplatin', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Quinacrine/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",,2010/04/29 06:00,2010/07/22 06:00,['2010/04/29 06:00'],"['2010/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)58048-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.091645 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Jun 18;285(25):19162-72. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.091645.

Treatment of highly invasive human prostate cancer cells PC-3 and DU-145 with different doses of SKI-606 decreased Src activation, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion as determined by Matrigel Boyden chamber invasion assay. For in vivo studies, PC-3 cells were inoculated through s.c. or i.t. route into male BALB/c nu/nu or Fox Chase severe combined immunodeficient mice, respectively. Experimental animals treated with SKI-606 developed tumors of a significantly smaller volume and a significant decrease (50%) in experimental skeletal lesion area. A marked increase (32%) in bone volume to tumor volume ratio was also seen by micro-computed tomography analysis of tibias from control and experimental groups of animals.

Although kinase activity is directly responsible for the clinical phenotype, current diagnostic and prognostic methods focus on a genetic classification system in which molecularly distinct subcategories are used to predict patient responses to small-molecule inhibitors of the Bcr-Abl kinase. Point mutations in the kinase domain are a central factor regulating inhibitor resistance; however, compensatory signaling caused by the activation of unrelated kinases can influence inhibitor efficacy. Kinase activity profiling can be used as a complementary approach to genetic screening and allows direct screening of small-molecule inhibitors. We developed a quantitative assay to monitor tyrosine kinase activities and inhibitor sensitivities in a model of chronic myelogenous leukemia using peptide reporters covalently immobilized on Luminex beads. Kinase activity is quantified by nonlinear regression from well-specific internal standard curves. Using optimized synthetic substrates and peptides derived from native substrates as probes, we measured kinase inhibition in cell lysates by the signal transduction inhibitors imatinib and dasatinib. Taking advantage of a convenient 96-well plate format, this assay also allows a straightforward and quantitative analysis of the differential effects of ATP and inhibitors on kinase activity. This method for analyzing a focused signaling network benefits from rigorous statistical analysis and short processing times, thereby offering a powerful tool for drug discovery and clinical testing.","['Sylvester, Juliesta E', 'Kron, Stephen J']","['Sylvester JE', 'Kron SJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (PD 166326)', '0 (PD 173955)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/analysis/*isolation & purification/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Calibration', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods/standards', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', '*Microspheres', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/analysis/*isolation & purification/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyridines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyridones/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*analysis', 'Time Factors']",,2010/04/29 06:00,2010/08/21 06:00,['2010/04/29 06:00'],"['2010/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-10-0157 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0157 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2010 May;9(5):1469-81. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0157.

Among the postulated mechanisms of resistance is the overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2), which mediate reduced intracellular drug accumulation. We compared the interactions of the TKIs imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib with ABCB1 and ABCG2 in ex vivo and in vitro systems. The TKIs inhibited rhodamine 123 and Hoechst 33342 efflux mediated by endogenous expression of the transporters in murine and human hematopoietic stem cells with potency order nilotinib >> imatinib >> dasatinib. Studies with ABCB1-, ABCG2-, and ABCC1-transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells verified that nilotinib was the most potent inhibitor of ABCB1 and ABCG2. Cytotoxicity assays in stably transduced K562-ABCG2 and K562-ABCB1 cells confirmed that the TKIs were also substrates for the two transporters. Like imatinib, both nilotinib and dasatinib decreased ABCG2 surface expression in K562-ABCG2 cells. Finally, we found that all TKIs were able to compete labeling of ABCB1 and ABCG2 by the photo-cross-linkable prazosin analog [(125)I]iodoarylazidoprazosin, suggesting interaction at the prazosin-binding site of both proteins. Our experiments support the hypothesis that all three TKIs are substrates of ABC transporters and that, at higher concentrations, TKIs overcome transporter function. Taken together, the results suggest that therapeutic doses of imatinib and nilotinib may diminish the potential of ABCB1 and ABCG2 to limit oral absorption or confer resistance. Clinical data are required to definitively answer the latter question.","['Dohse, Marius', 'Scharenberg, Christian', 'Shukla, Suneet', 'Robey, Robert W', 'Volkmann, Thorsten', 'Deeken, John F', 'Brendel, Cornelia', 'Ambudkar, Suresh V', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Bates, Susan E']","['Dohse M', 'Scharenberg C', 'Shukla S', 'Robey RW', 'Volkmann T', 'Deeken JF', 'Brendel C', 'Ambudkar SV', 'Neubauer A', 'Bates SE']","['Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Dasatinib', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*metabolism', 'Thiazoles/*metabolism']",,2010/04/29 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/04/29 06:00'],"['2010/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['dmd.109.031302 [pii]', '10.1124/dmd.109.031302 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2010 Aug;38(8):1371-80. doi: 10.1124/dmd.109.031302.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In part 1 of the trial, 16 patients received SGN-30 with GVD to assess the safety of the combination. In part 2, patients were randomly allocated to SGN-30 (n = 7) or placebo (n = 7) with GVD to determine overall response rate (ORR). RESULTS: ORR in all 30 patients was 63% (65% with SGN-30 plus GVD, n = 23, and 57% with placebo plus GVD, n = 7). Median event-free survival was 9.0 months, with no difference between the two arms. Grades 3-5 pneumonitis occurred in five patients receiving SGN-30 and GVD, leading to premature closure of the trial. All five patients with pulmonary toxicity had a V/F polymorphism in the FcgammaRIIIa gene (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Together with historical data demonstrating a 2% incidence of pulmonary events with GVD, these results indicate that SGN-30 cannot safely be administered concurrently. The risk of pneumonitis with SGN-30 and GVD is greatest in patients with an FcgammaRIIIa V/F polymorphism.","['Blum, K A', 'Jung, S-H', 'Johnson, J L', 'Lin, T S', 'Hsi, E D', 'Lucas, D M', 'Byrd, J C', 'Cheson, B D', 'Bartlett, N L']","['Blum KA', 'Jung SH', 'Johnson JL', 'Lin TS', 'Hsi ED', 'Lucas DM', 'Byrd JC', 'Cheson BD', 'Bartlett NL']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH.

IL-2 and TNF-alpha levels were also detected in the donors during mobilization to analyze the relationship between the cytokines and aGVHD. RESULTS: Five recipients showed no aGVHD, 10 developed grade I aGVHD, and 7 developed grade II-IV aGVHD. The serum levels of IL-2 and TNF-alpha after conditioning and post-transplantation were significantly higher in the recipients with grade II-IV aGVHD than in those with grade 0-I aGVHD, but no difference was found before the pre-conditioning. The serum IL-2 levels in the mobilized donors for the recipients with grade II-IV aGVHD were significantly higher than that in donors for recipients with grade 0-I aGVHD, whereas the levels of TNF-alpha showed no such a difference.

In this study, the expression levels of WT1 and MDR1 mRNA in 57 adult ALL patients were simultaneously detected using multiplex fluorescence real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expression levels of WT1 and MDR1 in bone marrow samples of adult ALL patients were significantly higher than those in the normal samples (P<0.001), and in addition, the expression levels of WT1 and MDR1 mRNA were highly correlated (r(s)=0.404, P=0.002). According to the expression levels of these two genes, the patients in this study were subdivided into the following three groups: low-WT1/low-MDR1 (n=16), high-WT1 or high-MDR1 (n=24), high-WT1/high-MDR1 (n=17). There was no significant difference in response to induction therapy among these three cohorts (P=0.217). The overall first year relapse rate was 53.2% (25 out of 47 ALL patients). High-WT1/high-MDR1 mRNA expression was strongly associated with BCR-ABL expression and a higher tendency to be T-cell ALL type. In addition, high-WT1/high-MDR1 have a significantly higher relapse rate (P=0.048) and shorter disease free survival (P=0.016). Our data suggests that high-WT1/high-MDR1 levels of mRNA expression may be associated with relatively poorer outcomes in patients with ALL.

RESULTS: The present study disclosed extremely high VL with highly dense smears with or without oligoclonal bands in SBH. A high VL of 10% or more was observed in 16 (43.2%) of a total of 33 samples (one of 13 asymptomatic carriers, 8 of 12 symptomatic carriers, and 7 of 8 patients with lymphoma-type ATL without circulating ATL cells). In particular, an extremely high VL of 50% or more was limited to symptomatic carriers whose band findings always contained at least dense smears derived from polyclonally expanded cells infected with HTLV-1. Sequential samples revealed that the VL value was synchronized with the presence or absence of dense smears, and declined at the same time as disappearing dense smears. Dense smears transiently emerged at the active stage of the underlying disease. After disappearance of the smears, several clonal bands became visible and were persistently retained, explaining the process by which the clonality of HTLV-1-infected cells is established. The cases with only oligoclonal bands tended to maintain a stable VL of around 20% for a long time. Two of such cases developed ATL 4 and 3.5 years later, suggesting that a high VL with oligoclonal bands may be a predisposing risk to ATL. CONCLUSION: The main contributor to extremely high VL seems to be transient emergence of dense smears detected by the sensitivity level of SBH, corresponding to polyclonal expansion of HTLV-1-infected cells including abundant small clones. Major clones retained after disappearance of dense smears stably persist and acquire various malignant characteristics step by step.","['Sasaki, Daisuke', 'Doi, Yuko', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Yanagihara, Katsunori', 'Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Iwanaga, Masako', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Watanabe, Toshiki', 'Kamihira, Shimeru']","['Sasaki D', 'Doi Y', 'Hasegawa H', 'Yanagihara K', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Iwanaga M', 'Yamada Y', 'Watanabe T', 'Kamihira S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood/virology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Carrier State/*virology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/*isolation & purification', '*Viral Load']",,2010/04/29 06:00,2010/06/23 06:00,['2010/04/29 06:00'],"['2009/12/25 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1743-422X-7-81 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-7-81 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2010 Apr 28;7:81. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-7-81.,,,,20100428,PMC2876101,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study aims to investigate whether PSP pre-treatment can increase the response of the human leukemia HL-60 cells to apoptosis induction by Camptothecin (CPT). METHODS: We used bivariate bromodeoxyuridine/propidium iodide (BrdUrd/PI) flow cytometry analysis to measure the relative movement (RM) of the BrdUrd positively labeled cells and DNA synthesis time (Ts) on the HL-60 cell line. We used annexin V/PI flow cytometry analysis to quantify the viable, necrotic and apoptotic cells. The expression of cyclin E and cyclin B1 was determined with annexin V/PI flow cytometry and western blotting. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used to test the cytotoxicity of PSP and CPT. RESULTS: PSP reduced cellular proliferation; inhibited cells progression through both S and G2 phase, reduced 3H-thymidine uptake and prolonged DNA synthesis time (Ts) in HL-60 cells. PSP-pretreated cells enhanced the cytotoxicity of CPT. The sensitivity of cells to the cytotoxic effects of CPT was seen to be the highest in the S-phase and to a small extent of the G2 phase of the cell cycle. On the other hand, no cell death (measured by annexin V/PI) was evident with the normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with treatment of either PSP or CPT. CONCLUSION: The present study shows that PSP increases the sensitization of the HL-60 cells to undergo effective apoptotic cell death induced by CPT. The pattern of sensitivity of cancer cells is similar to that of HL-60 cells. PSP rapidly arrests and/or kills cells in S-phase and did not interfere with the anticancer action of CPT. PSP is a potential adjuvant to treat human leukemia as rapidly proliferating tumors is characterized by a high proportion of S-phase cells.","['Wan, Jennifer Man-Fan', 'Sit, Wai-Hung', 'Yang, Xiaotong', 'Jiang, Pingping', 'Wong, Leo Lap-Yan']","['Wan JM', 'Sit WH', 'Yang X', 'Jiang P', 'Wong LL']","['Agricultural, Food and Nutritional Sciences Division, School of Biological Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong SAR, China. jmfwan@hkusua.hku.hk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Chin Med,Chinese medicine,101265109,,,,,2010/04/29 06:00,2010/04/29 06:01,['2010/04/29 06:00'],"['2009/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/29 06:01 [medline]']","['1749-8546-5-16 [pii]', '10.1186/1749-8546-5-16 [doi]']",epublish,Chin Med. 2010 Apr 27;5:16. doi: 10.1186/1749-8546-5-16.,,,,20100427,PMC2874562,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapeutic forms of L-ASNase come from different biological sources (primarily E. coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi). It is well established that the various preparations have different biochemical pharmacology properties, and different tendency to induce side-effects. This is due to different structural, physicochemical and kinetic properties of L-ASNases from the various biological sources. Understanding these properties of various L-ASNases would allow a better decipherment of their catalytic and therapeutic features, thus enabling more accurate predictions of the behaviour of these enzymes under a variety of therapeutic conditions. In addition, detailed understanding of the catalytic mechanism of L-ASNases might permit the design of new forms of L-ASNases with optimal biochemical properties for clinical applications.

MI-63 induced G1 phase arrest and increased p21 expression. MI-63 induced pronounced apoptosis in all primary AML samples tested, and most important, was effective in inducing cell death of leukemia 'stem' cells.

Mutations in one or both alleles of CEBPA are observed in about 10% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Moreover, other genetic events associated with AML have been identified to deregulate C/EBPalpha expression and function at various levels. Recently developed mouse models that accurately mimic the genetic C/EBPalpha alterations in human AML demonstrate C/EBPalpha's gatekeeper function in the control of self-renewal and lineage commitment of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Moreover, these studies indicate that CEBPA mutations affect HSCs in early leukemia development by inducing proliferation and limiting their lineage potential. However, the exact relationship between 'pre-leukemic' HCSs and those cells that finally initiate leukemia (leukemia-initiating cells) with disturbed differentiation and aberrant proliferation remains elusive. More research is needed to identify and characterize these functionally distinct populations and the exact role of the different genetic alterations in the process of leukemia initiation and maintenance.","['Reckzeh, Kristian', 'Cammenga, Jorg']","['Reckzeh K', 'Cammenga J']","['Department of Molecular Medicine and Gene Therapy, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)'],IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice']",89,2010/04/28 06:00,2010/08/14 06:00,['2010/04/28 06:00'],"['2010/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-010-0573-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2010 May;91(4):557-68. doi: 10.1007/s12185-010-0573-1.

Capillary electrophoresis coupled with laser-induced fluorescence (CE-LIF) detection is used to separate and detect CNTP in multidrug-resistant cells (K562A) and the parent cells (K562S). CE-LIF and flow cytometry investigation reveal that the CNTP can traverse the membranes in both cell lines without being pumped out by P-glycoprotein. The CE-LIF method is also useful for quantitative analysis of CNT in single cells, enabling drug delivery and multidrug resistance (MDR) studies. Moreover, toward quantifying the intracellular uptake of oxidized (o)-SWNTs with anchored Rhodamine123 (Rho123), fluorescence-quenching of Rho123 is measured by micellar electrokinetic chromatography coupled with LIF detection. Enhanced uptake of Rho123 in multidrug-resistant leukemia cells can be achieved with the aid of the o-SWNTs carriers. Besides being able to overcome MDR, o-SWNTs are shown to be excellent intracellular carriers possessing large adsorption capacity and prolonged release ability. Finally, it is demonstrated that o-SWNTs are safe for biological applications at concentrations of up to 40 microg/mL.","['Li, Ruibin', 'Zou, Hanfa', 'Xiao, Hua', 'Wu, Renan']","['Li R', 'Zou H', 'Xiao H', 'Wu R']","['National Chromatographic R & A Center, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, P.R., China. snowmaplecher@126.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Nanotubes, Carbon)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)']",IM,"['Adsorption', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Carriers/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Dyes/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Lasers', 'Nanotubes, Carbon/*chemistry', 'Rhodamine 123/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Surface Properties', 'Tissue Distribution']",,2010/04/28 06:00,2010/09/03 06:00,['2010/04/28 06:00'],"['2010/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-60761-579-8_13 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2010;625:153-68. doi: 10.1007/978-1-60761-579-8_13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This is a retrospective descriptive study of patients of retinoblastoma registered at our cancer center from June 2003-February 2007 to study compliance. RESULTS: Sociodemographic data of 177 patients revealed rural:urban ratio of 2:1, median age 36 months (unilateral disease) and 24 months (bilateral disease); median symptom duration 7.2 months. Overall, 84/141 evalued cases took adequate therapy; follow-up could be achieved in 67/141 (47.5%) cases in comparison to 92.4% in Hodgkin's lymphoma (p=0.001), 62.8% in acute myeloid leukemia (p=0.036) and 72.7% in non Hodgkin's lymphoma (p=0.001). There was no significant impact of any sociodemographic factors on compliance. Amongst those offered enucleation upfront for intraocular disease, it was accepted in 86/93 (92.5%) eyes. CONCLUSION: This is one of the largest studies in relation to sociodemographic factors and clinical spectrum, and the only study from Asia evaluating compliance with recommended therapy in retinoblastoma.

In this study, we assessed expressions of HSP90 and VEGF in bone marrow samples of patients with ALL and effect of these expression quantities on the mean overall survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using immunohistochemical methods, we assessed expression of HSP90 and VEGF in 22 cases of ALL. RESULTS: Expression of HSP90 was detected in 19/22 (86.4%) and 3/22 (13.6%) of patients with ALL, for strongly positive and moderate-weakly positive, respectively. Negative HSP90 expression was not detected in patients with ALL. Expression of HSP90 in patients with ALL and in control group were statistically significant (P<0.001), however, did not reflect the mean overall survival (P=0.910). Mean OS was evaluated 992+/-181 and 724.8+/-88.2 days for moderate-weak and high HSP90 expression, respectively. VEGF expressions were not significantly different between ALL and control groups (P<0.087). We did not find any relationship between HSP90 and VEGF expressions in bone marrow specimens of patients with ALL. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that HSP90 expression grades in patients with ALL were significantly higher than that in controls and presence of strong HSP90 expression was associated with worse overall survival. VEGF expression in patients with ALL was not different from that in control samples. Determination HSP90 with immunohistochemical method in bone marrow can provide information about prognosis.","['Hacihanefioglu, Abdullah', 'Gonullu, Emel', 'Mehtap, Ozgur', 'Keski, Hakan', 'Yavuz, Melike', 'Ercin, Cengiz']","['Hacihanefioglu A', 'Gonullu E', 'Mehtap O', 'Keski H', 'Yavuz M', 'Ercin C']","['Department of Hematology, University of Kocaeli, Medical Faculty, Kocaeli, Turkey. bsukriye@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Female', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/*mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*biosynthesis', 'Young Adult']",,2010/04/28 06:00,2012/01/19 06:00,['2010/04/28 06:00'],"['2010/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-010-9533-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2011 Sep;28(3):846-51. doi: 10.1007/s12032-010-9533-0.

Our previous study showed that liquid crystal-related compounds (LCRCs), which are precursors of the liquid crystal, enhanced hematopoietic differentiation at a relatively low concentration (Biol Pharm Bull, 32, 2009). However, biological potentials of LCRCs on tumor cells are unclear. In this study, the biological activity of 16 LCRCs to a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, K562, was evaluated. As a result, two compounds, 2-(4-butoxyphenyl)-5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pyrimidine (compound 7) and 2-{4-(4-hexyloxyphenyl)phenyl}-5-hydroxypyrimidine (compound 9) showed marked growth suppression of K562 cells at muM range. These compounds are similar in structure with a core of three aromatic rings including a pyrimidine ring and residues of one alkyl chain and one hydroxide on either side. In addition, only compound 7 induced the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and apoptosis of K562 cells. The contrasting results between compounds 7 and 9 indicate different mechanisms to suppress the cell proliferation between the two compounds.

The causal relationship of XMRV infection to human disease and the mechanism of pathogenicity have not been established. During retrovirus replication, integration of the cDNA copy of the viral RNA genome into the host cell chromosome is an essential step and involves coordinated joining of the two ends of the linear viral DNA into staggered sites on target DNA. Correct integration produces proviruses that are flanked by a short direct repeat, which varies from 4 to 6 bp among the retroviruses but is invariant for each particular retrovirus. Uncoordinated joining of the two viral DNA ends into target DNA can cause insertions, deletions, or other genomic alterations at the integration site. To determine the fidelity of XMRV integration, cells infected with XMRV were clonally expanded and DNA sequences at the viral-host DNA junctions were determined and analyzed. We found that a majority of the provirus ends were correctly processed and flanked by a 4-bp direct repeat of host DNA. A weak consensus sequence was also detected at the XMRV integration sites. We conclude that integration of XMRV DNA involves a coordinated joining of two viral DNA ends that are spaced 4 bp apart on the target DNA and proceeds with high fidelity.","['Kim, Sanggu', 'Rusmevichientong, Alice', 'Dong, Beihua', 'Remenyi, Roland', 'Silverman, Robert H', 'Chow, Samson A']","['Kim S', 'Rusmevichientong A', 'Dong B', 'Remenyi R', 'Silverman RH', 'Chow SA']","['Biomedical Engineering Interdepartmental Program, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Retroviridae Infections/virology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tumor Virus Infections/virology', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",,2010/04/28 06:00,2011/06/17 06:00,['2010/04/28 06:00'],"['2010/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0010255 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Apr 20;5(4):e10255. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0010255.,,,"['R01 CA068859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA103943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA103943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",20100420,PMC2857682,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this report is to assess the long-term outcome of children with 'low-risk' relapsed ALL treated according to a prospective purified auto-transplantation protocol. From January 1997 to March 2004, at a single pediatric Center, 30 ALL consecutive children, lacking an HLA-identical sibling, were treated according to the autologous purified peripheral blood stem cell protocol after isolated-extramedullary (7) or late medullary (24) relapse. After the 'DIAVE' mobilizing regimen a median of 11.6 x 10(6)CD34+/Kg (range 3.9-27.4) were collected. Leukaphereses were depleted by 99% of CD19+cells (range 98-100) by means of a double step immunological purification. The conditioning regimen included TBI. No early severe complications nor transplant-related deaths occurred; late effects, as expected, mostly consisted in endocrinological issues and were assessed at a median follow-up of 8.5 years. Five-year-EFS and survival were 68.5% (s.e. 7.9) and 85.7% (s.e. 5.9), respectively, for the 35 eligible patients and 70.0% (s.e. 8.4) and 86.7% (s.e. 6.2) for the 30 patients actually transplanted as per protocol.

METHODS: Retrospective review of 2003 Medicare Standard Analytic Files utilizing International Classification of Diseases for Oncology ninth edition CM code 238.7 to identify new MDS patients, with 3-year follow-up. RESULTS: Among 1,394,343 individuals in Medicare Standard Analytic Files age > or = 65 years, 162 per 100,000 were coded as newly diagnosed MDS during 2003 yielding a calculated 45,000 new cases in the United States Medicare > or = 65 years population. Patients with MDS were older (median age, 77 years), and over-represented by males. Among patients with MDS diagnosed during first quarter of 2003, 73.2% suffered cardiac-related events during 3-year follow-up, which exceeded the Medicare population (54.5%; P < .01) even when age adjusted (odds ratio, 2.10; P < .01). Significant increases in prevalence of diabetes (40.0% v 33.1%), dyspnea (49.4% v 28.5%), hepatic diseases (0.8% v 0.2%), and infections (sepsis: 22.5% v 6.1%) were noted in MDS (all P < .01) compared with the Medicare population. Patients with MDS requiring RBC transfusions had greater prevalence of these comorbidities. Acute myeloid leukemia developed within 3 years in 9.6%, with increased transformation among transfused (24.6%; P < .001). The 3-year Kaplan-Meier age-adjusted survival for MDS was 60.0%, which was significantly lower than the Medicare population (84.7%; hazard ratio, 3.08; P < .001), and mortality was further increased among transfused MDS (P < .01). In 2003, median payment for MDS was $16,181, compared to $1,575 for the Medicare population (P < .001). CONCLUSION: MDS is a common hematologic malignancy of the elderly, which places patients at risk for comorbid conditions. Transfusion dependency identifies patients with MDS at additional increased risk of organ impairment and shortened survival.","['Goldberg, Stuart L', 'Chen, Er', 'Corral, Mitra', 'Guo, Amy', 'Mody-Patel, Nikita', 'Pecora, Andrew L', 'Laouri, Marianne']","['Goldberg SL', 'Chen E', 'Corral M', 'Guo A', 'Mody-Patel N', 'Pecora AL', 'Laouri M']","['John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, 20 Prospect Ave, Ste 400, Hackensack, NJ 07601, USA. sgoldberg@humed.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Medicare/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/economics/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States/epidemiology']",22,2010/04/28 06:00,2010/09/09 06:00,['2010/04/28 06:00'],"['2010/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.25.2395 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.25.2395 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Jun 10;28(17):2847-52. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.25.2395.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients were treated, of whom 22 had intermediate-2 or high-risk disease (International Prognostic Scoring System). Median age was 70 years (range, 53 to 86), nine patients had secondary MDS, and 20 patients experienced prior therapy failure with hypomethylating agents. Three doses of clofarabine were evaluated: 40 mg/m(2), 30 mg/m(2), and 20 mg/m(2) daily for 5 days. Courses were repeated every 4 to 8 weeks. RESULTS: Eight patients (25%) achieved complete remission (CR), three had (9%) hematologic improvement (HI), and three had (9%) clinical benefit (CB; overall response rate, 43%). Responses in patients who experience treatment failure with hypomethylating agents included CR in two (10%), HI in two (10%), and CB in two patients (10%). No patients died within 6 weeks of induction. Renal failure occurred in four patients in the context of myelosuppression-associated infectious complications. Common adverse events were gastrointestinal and hepatic. Myelosuppression was common, but prolonged myelosuppression (> 42 days) was rare. The toxicity profile was better with lower doses of clofarabine, whereas response rates did not differ significantly. CONCLUSION: Oral clofarabine has achieved a response rate of 43% in patients with higher-risk MDS. The optimal dose and schedule and the appropriate patient population for such therapy remain to be further defined.","['Faderl, Stefan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Cortes, Jorge E', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Gandhi, Varsha', 'Plunkett, William', 'Byrd, Anna', 'Kwari, Monica', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Faderl S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Estrov Z', 'Ravandi F', 'Borthakur G', 'Cortes JE', ""O'Brien S"", 'Gandhi V', 'Plunkett W', 'Byrd A', 'Kwari M', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

We now report the impact of OA on loss of response, disease transformation, and survival after 5 years of imatinib. PATIENTS AND METHODS: OA is defined as the difference in intracellular concentration of carbon-14-imatinib with and without OCT-1 inhibition. OA was measured in blood from 56 patients with untreated chronic-phase CML. RESULTS: More patients who had high OA (ie, > median OA value) achieved MMR by 60 months compared with patients who had low OA (89% v 55%; P = .007). A low OA was associated with a significantly lower overall survival (87% v 96%; P = .028) and event-free survival (EFS; 48% v 74%; P = .03) as well as a higher kinase domain mutation rate (21% v 4%; P = .047). These differences were highly significant in patients who averaged less than 600 mg/d of imatinib in the first 12 months but were not significant in patients averaging >/= 600 mg/d. Patients with very low OA (ie, quartile 1) were the only group who developed leukemic transformation (21% in quartile 1 v 0% in all other quartiles; P = .002). CONCLUSION: Measurement of OA pretherapy is a predictor for the long-term risk of resistance and transformation in patients with imatinib-treated CML. Early dose-intensity may reduce the negative prognostic impact of low OA. We propose that OA could be used to individualize dosage strategies for patients with CML to maximize molecular response and optimize long-term outcome.","['White, Deborah L', 'Dang, Phuong', 'Engler, Jane', 'Frede, Amity', 'Zrim, Stephanie', 'Osborn, Michael', 'Saunders, Verity A', 'Manley, Paul W', 'Hughes, Timothy P']","['White DL', 'Dang P', 'Engler J', 'Frede A', 'Zrim S', 'Osborn M', 'Saunders VA', 'Manley PW', 'Hughes TP']","['Haematology Department, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology (IMVS Campus), University of Adelaide, Frome Road, Adelaide, Australia. deb.white@imvs.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Organic Cation Transporter 1)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Benzamides', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Organic Cation Transporter 1/*genetics', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Probability', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2010/04/28 06:00,2010/07/22 06:00,['2010/04/28 06:00'],"['2010/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.26.5819 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.26.5819 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Jun 1;28(16):2761-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.26.5819.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively quantified VLA-4 expression in 216 patients enrolled onto COG-AAML03P1 by flow cytometry and correlated expression levels with disease characteristics and clinical outcome. RESULTS: VLA-4 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) varied 35-fold (range, 30 to 1,110; median, 219.5). High VLA-4 expression (> median MFI), compared with low expression, was associated with younger age (7.1 v 12.1 years, respectively; P < .001), lower FLT3 internal tandem duplication prevalence (4% v 21%, respectively; P < .001), and higher likelihood of extramedullary disease (16% v 5%, respectively; P = .013). In low- and high-expression groups, rates of remission (89% v 80%, respectively; P = .137) and minimal residual disease (29% v 25%, respectively; P = .700) were similar. Patients with low VLA-4 expression, compared with high expression, had a higher relapse rate (RR; 44% +/- 10% v 24% +/- 9%, respectively; P = .011) and lower disease-free survival (DFS; 48% +/- 11% v 67% +/- 10%, respectively; P = .023) after 3 years. Multivariate analyses showed that low VLA-4 expression was an independent adverse prognostic factor for DFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.98; P = .038) and RR (HR = 2.77; P = .009). Subgroup analyses indicated that the prognostic role of VLA-4 expression was most prominent in patients with standard-risk AML, in whom low VLA-4 expression was associated with inferior DFS (34% +/- 16% v 69% +/- 14% for high expression; P = .011) and higher RR (61% +/- 16% v 26% +/- 14% for high expression; P = .009). A similar trend was seen in low-risk but not high-risk patients. CONCLUSION: High VLA-4 expression is associated with better clinical outcome in pediatric AML and is an independent predictor of relapse that may refine our abilities to stratify patients without identifiable cytogenetic or molecular risk factors.","['Walter, Roland B', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Ho, Phoenix A', 'Smith, Franklin O', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Hirsch, Betsy A', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Franklin, Janet L', 'Hurwitz, Craig A', 'Loken, Michael R', 'Meshinchi, Soheil']","['Walter RB', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gerbing RB', 'Ho PA', 'Smith FO', 'Raimondi SC', 'Hirsch BA', 'Gamis AS', 'Franklin JL', 'Hurwitz CA', 'Loken MR', 'Meshinchi S']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N, D2-190, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA. rwalter@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2010/04/28 06:00,2010/09/09 06:00,['2010/04/28 06:00'],"['2010/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.27.5693 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.27.5693 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Jun 10;28(17):2831-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.27.5693.

We analyzed 272 adult patients with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) for the presence of IDH2 mutations in codons R140 and R172. IDH2 mutations of amino acid 140 or 172 could be identified in 12.1% of CN-AML patients, with the majority of mutations (90%) occurring at position R140. The incidence of IDH2 mutations in AML patients with aberrant karyotypes (n = 130) was significantly lower (3.8%, P = .006). IDH2 mutations were mutually exclusive with mutations in IDH1. IDH2 mutation status alone or in combination with IDH1 mutations had no impact on response to therapy, overall survival, and relapse-free survival in patients with CN-AML.

However, our knowledge both of the upstream pathways controlling mTOR activity and of the downstream events mediating these effects is still seriously incomplete. We report a previously unsuspected role for the nonprotein-coding RNA GAS5 in the inhibition of T-cell proliferation produced by mTOR antagonists such as rapamycin. GAS5 transcripts are up-regulated during growth arrest and after rapamycin treatment, and GAS5 has recently been shown to be necessary and sufficient for normal T-cell growth arrest. Down-regulation of GAS5 using RNA interference protects both leukemic and primary human T cells from the inhibition of proliferation produced by mTOR antagonists. The GAS5 transcript is a member of the 5' terminal oligopyrimidine class of RNAs, which is specifically controlled at the level of translation by the mTOR pathway, and the effects of GAS5 on the cell cycle provide a novel and important link to the control of proliferation. These observations point to a significant advance in our understanding of the mechanism of action of mTOR inhibitors, which is likely to lead to improvements in immunosuppressive and cancer therapy.","['Mourtada-Maarabouni, Mirna', 'Hasan, Anwar M', 'Farzaneh, Farzin', 'Williams, Gwyn T']","['Mourtada-Maarabouni M', 'Hasan AM', 'Farzaneh F', 'Williams GT']","['Institute for Science and Technology in Medicine and School of Life Sciences, Huxley Building, Keele University, Keele, ST5 5BG, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Nucleolar)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)', '0 (growth arrest specific transcript 5)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Small Nucleolar/*physiology', 'RNA, Untranslated/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",,2010/04/28 06:00,2010/07/31 06:00,['2010/04/28 06:00'],"['2010/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.110.064055 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.110.064055 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2010 Jul;78(1):19-28. doi: 10.1124/mol.110.064055.

Clinical examples of hematopoietic lineage plasticity are rare. Here we report on a patient who presented with an acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia and developed a Langerhans' cell sarcoma 9 years later. We provide evidence that the second neoplasm is the result of transdifferentiation. DESIGN AND METHODS: B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was diagnosed in an 11-year old boy in 1996. Treatment according to the ALL-BFM-1995 protocol resulted in a complete remission. Nine years later, in 2005, Langerhans' cell sarcoma was diagnosed in a supraclavicular lymph node. Despite treatment with different chemotherapy protocols the patient had progressive disease. Finally, he received an allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant and achieved a continuous remission. Molecular studies of IGH- and TCRG-gene rearrangements were performed with DNA from the Langerhans' cell sarcoma and the cryopreserved cells from the acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The expression of PAX5 and ID2 was analyzed with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Identical IGH-rearrangements were demonstrated in the acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia and the Langerhans' cell sarcoma. The key factors required for B-cell and dendritic cell development, PAX5 and ID2, were differentially expressed, with a strong PAX5 signal in the acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia and only a weak expression in the Langerhans' cell sarcoma, whereas ID2 showed an opposite pattern. CONCLUSIONS: The identical IGH-rearrangement in both neoplasms indicates transdifferentiation of the acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia into a Langerhans' cell sarcoma. Loss of PAX5 and the acquisition of ID2 suggest that these key factors are involved in the transdifferentiation from a B-cell phenotype into a Langerhans'/dendritic cell phenotype.

However, neither histological criteria to define this form of chronic lymphocytic leukemia nor its clinical correlates and prognostic impact have been formally defined in large series of patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: Tissue biopsies from 100 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were analyzed for the size of proliferation centers and their proliferation rate as assessed by mitosis count and Ki-67 immunostaining. Histological patterns were correlated with main clinico-biological features and outcome. RESULTS: A suspicion of disease transformation was the main reason for carrying out tissue biopsy, which was performed at a median time of 14 months (range, 0 to 204 months) after the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The biopsy showed histological transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in 22 cases. In the remaining 78 patients, the presence of expanded proliferation centers (broader than a 20x field) and high proliferation rate (either >2.4 mitoses/proliferation center or Ki-67 >40%/proliferation center) predicted a poor outcome and were selected to define a highly proliferative group. Thus, 23 patients with either expanded proliferation centers or high proliferation rate were considered as having ""accelerated"" chronic lymphocytic leukemia. These patients displayed particular features, including higher serum lactate dehydrogenase levels and more frequently elevated ZAP-70 than ""non-accelerated"" cases. The median survival from biopsy of patients with ""non-accelerated"" chronic lymphocytic leukemia, ""accelerated"" chronic lymphocytic leukemia and transformation to diffuse large B-cell leukemia was 76, 34, and 4.3 months, respectively (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of expanded and/or highly active proliferation centers identifies a group of patients with ""accelerated"" chronic lymphocytic leukemia characterized by an aggressive clinical behavior.","['Gine, Eva', 'Martinez, Antoni', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Lopez-Guillermo, Armando', 'Camos, Mireia', 'Martinez, Daniel', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Calvo, Xavier', 'Muntanola, Ana', 'Abrisqueta, Pau', 'Rozman, Maria', 'Rozman, Ciril', 'Bosch, Francesc', 'Campo, Elias', 'Montserrat, Emili']","['Gine E', 'Martinez A', 'Villamor N', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Camos M', 'Martinez D', 'Esteve J', 'Calvo X', 'Muntanola A', 'Abrisqueta P', 'Rozman M', 'Rozman C', 'Bosch F', 'Campo E', 'Montserrat E']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic Villarroel n masculine 170, 08036-Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/analysis']",,2010/04/28 06:00,2012/11/09 06:00,['2010/04/28 06:00'],"['2010/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.022277 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.022277 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Sep;95(9):1526-33. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.022277.

Studies also indicate that 'stereotypy' may influence the clinical course of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, for example, in subsets with stereotyped IGHV3-21 and IGHV4-34 B-cell receptors; however, little is known regarding the genomic profile of patients in these subsets. DESIGN AND METHODS: We applied 250K single nucleotide polymorphism-arrays to study copy-number aberrations and copy-number neutral loss-of-heterozygosity in patients with stereotyped IGHV3-21 (subset #2, n=29), stereotyped IGHV4-34 (subset #4, n=17; subset #16, n=8) and non-subset #2 IGHV3-21 (n=13) and non-subset #4/16 IGHV4-34 (n=34) patients. RESULTS: Over 90% of patients in subset #2 and non-subset #2 carried copy-number aberrations, whereas 75-76% of patients in subset #4 and subset #16 showed copy-number aberrations. Subset #2 and non-subset #2 patients also displayed a higher average number of aberrations compared to patients in subset #4. Deletion of 13q was the only known recurrent aberration detected in subset #4 (35%); this aberration was even more frequent in subset #2 (79%). del(11q) was more frequent in subset #2 and non-subset #2 (31% and 23%) patients than in subset #4 and non-subset #4/16 patients. Recurrent copy-number neutral loss-of-heterozygosity was mainly detected on chromosome 13q, independently of B-cell receptor stereotypy. CONCLUSIONS: Genomic aberrations were more common in subset #2 and non-subset #2 than in subset #4. The particularly high frequency of del(11q) in subset #2 may be linked to the adverse outcome reported for patients in this subset. Conversely, the lower prevalence of copy-number aberrations and the absence of poor-prognostic aberrations in subset #4 may reflect an inherently low-proliferative disease, which would prevent accumulation of genomic alterations.","['Marincevic, Millaray', 'Cahill, Nicola', 'Gunnarsson, Rebeqa', 'Isaksson, Anders', 'Mansouri, Mahmoud', 'Goransson, Hanna', 'Rasmussen, Markus', 'Jansson, Mattias', 'Ryan, Fergus', 'Karlsson, Karin', 'Adami, Hans-Olov', 'Davi, Fred', 'Jurlander, Jesper', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Marincevic M', 'Cahill N', 'Gunnarsson R', 'Isaksson A', 'Mansouri M', 'Goransson H', 'Rasmussen M', 'Jansson M', 'Ryan F', 'Karlsson K', 'Adami HO', 'Davi F', 'Jurlander J', 'Juliusson G', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Rosenquist R']","['Department of Genetics and Pathology, Rudbeck Laboratory, Uppsala University, SE-751-85 Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', '*Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell']",,2010/04/28 06:00,2012/11/09 06:00,['2010/04/28 06:00'],"['2010/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.021014 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.021014 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Sep;95(9):1519-25. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.021014.

We hypothesized that hitherto unrecognized, cytogenetically cryptic tyrosine kinase fusions may be common in non-classical or atypical myeloproliferative neoplasms and related myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms. DESIGN AND METHODS: To detect genomic copy number changes associated with such fusions, we performed a systematic search in 68 patients using custom designed, targeted, high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization. Arrays contained 44,000 oligonucleotide probes that targeted 500 genes including all 90 tyrosine kinases plus downstream tyrosine kinase signaling components, other translocation targets, transcription factors, and other factors known to be important for myelopoiesis. RESULTS: No abnormalities involving tyrosine kinases were detected; however, nine cytogenetically cryptic copy number imbalances were detected in seven patients, including hemizygous deletions of RUNX1 or CEBPA in two cases with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia. Mutation analysis of the remaining alleles revealed non-mutated RUNX1 and a frameshift insertion within CEBPA. A further mutation screen of 187 patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms identified RUNX1 mutations in 27 (14%) and CEBPA mutations in seven (4%) patients. Analysis of other transcription factors known to be frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia revealed NPM1 mutations in six (3%) and WT1 mutations in two (1%) patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms. Univariate analysis indicated that patients with mutations had a shorter overall survival (28 versus 44 months, P=0.019) compared with patients without mutations, with the prognosis for cases with CEBPA, NPM1 or WT1 mutations being particularly poor. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that mutations of transcription and other nuclear factors are frequent in myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms and are generally mutually exclusive. CEBPA, NPM1 or WT1 mutations may be associated with a poor prognosis, an observation that will need to be confirmed by detailed prospective studies.","['Ernst, Thomas', 'Chase, Andrew', 'Zoi, Katerina', 'Waghorn, Katherine', 'Hidalgo-Curtis, Claire', 'Score, Joannah', 'Jones, Amy', 'Grand, Francis', 'Reiter, Andreas', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Cross, Nicholas C P']","['Ernst T', 'Chase A', 'Zoi K', 'Waghorn K', 'Hidalgo-Curtis C', 'Score J', 'Jones A', 'Grand F', 'Reiter A', 'Hochhaus A', 'Cross NC']","['Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury District Hospital, Salisbury SP2 8BJ, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Myelopoiesis/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics']",,2010/04/28 06:00,2012/11/09 06:00,['2010/04/28 06:00'],"['2010/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.021808 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.021808 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Sep;95(9):1473-80. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.021808.

AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study was undertaken to investigate if total flavonoids from Lysimachia clethroides Duby (ZE4) possesses anti-cancer effects through apoptotic pathways in human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: K562 cells were treated with different concentrations of ZE4 at different time intervals. Cell viability was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry, Hoechst 33258 staining and COMET assay. Western blot analysis was used to detect Bcl-2, Trail and DR5 expressions. RESULTS: 15 flavonoids were isolated and identified from ZE4. ZE4 could inhibit the growth of K562 cells significantly by induction of apoptosis.

Dendritic cells provide a critical checkpoint for immunity by their capacity to both induce and suppress immunity. Although evident that cigarette smoke, the primary cause of COPD, significantly influences dendritic cell functions, little is known about the roles of dendritic cells in the pathogenesis of COPD. METHODS: The extent of dendritic cell infiltration in COPD tissue specimens was determined using immunohistochemical localization of CD83+ cells (marker of matured myeloid dendritic cells), and CD1a+ cells (Langerhans cells). The extent of tissue infiltration with Langerhans cells was also determined by the relative expression of the CD207 gene in COPD versus control tissues. To determine mechanisms by which dendritic cells accumulate in COPD, complimentary studies were conducted using monocyte-derived human dendritic cells exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE), and dendritic cells extracted from mice chronically exposed to cigarette smoke. RESULTS: In human COPD lung tissue, we detected a significant increase in the total number of CD83+ cells, and significantly higher amounts of CD207 mRNA when compared with control tissue. Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells exposed to CSE (0.1-2%) exhibited enhanced survival in vitro when compared with control dendritic cells. Murine dendritic cells extracted from mice exposed to cigarette smoke for 4 weeks, also demonstrated enhanced survival compared to dendritic cells extracted from control mice. Acute exposure of human dendritic cells to CSE induced the cellular pro-survival proteins heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and B cell lymphoma leukemia-x(L) (Bcl-xL), predominantly through oxidative stress. Although activated human dendritic cells conditioned with CSE expressed diminished migratory CCR7 expression, their migration towards the CCR7 ligand CCL21 was not impaired. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that COPD is associated with increased numbers of cells bearing markers associated with Langerhans cells and mature dendritic cells, and that cigarette smoke promotes survival signals and augments survival of dendritic cells. Although CSE suppressed dendritic cell CCR7 expression, migration towards a CCR7 ligand was not diminished, suggesting that reduced CCR7-dependent migration is unlikely to be an important mechanism for dendritic cell retention in the lungs of smokers with COPD.","['Vassallo, Robert', 'Walters, Paula R', 'Lamont, Jeffrey', 'Kottom, Theodore J', 'Yi, Eunhee S', 'Limper, Andrew H']","['Vassallo R', 'Walters PR', 'Lamont J', 'Kottom TJ', 'Yi ES', 'Limper AH']","['The Thoracic Diseases Research Unit, Division of Pulmonary Critical Care, Department of Internal Medicine, the Clinical Immunology and Immunotherapeutics Program, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, Minnesota, 55905, USA. vassallo.robert@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Respir Res,Respiratory research,101090633,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD1)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (CCR7 protein, human)', '0 (CD1a antigen)', '0 (CD207 protein, human)', '0 (CD83 antigen)', '0 (Chemokine CCL21)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Mannose-Binding Lectins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nicotinic Agonists)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)', '0 (Smoke)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '6M3C89ZY6R (Nicotine)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (HMOX1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/genetics', 'Antigens, CD1/analysis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL21/metabolism', 'Chemotaxis', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/*immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Langerhans Cells/immunology', 'Lectins, C-Type/genetics', 'Lung/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mannose-Binding Lectins/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Nicotine/pharmacology', 'Nicotinic Agonists/pharmacology', 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/genetics/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, CCR7/metabolism', 'Smoke/adverse effects', 'Smoking/*adverse effects/genetics/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",,2010/04/28 06:00,2010/07/09 06:00,['2010/04/28 06:00'],"['2009/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1465-9921-11-45 [pii]', '10.1186/1465-9921-11-45 [doi]']",epublish,Respir Res. 2010 Apr 26;11:45. doi: 10.1186/1465-9921-11-45.,,,"['1UL1 RR024150/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'HL96829Z-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'NHLBI NOI HR46161-05/HR/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",20100426,PMC2867978,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various sources of stem cells like bone marrow, peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood are used for the transplantation. Among these umbilical cord blood is currently preferred due to the primitiveness of the derived stem cells and minimal possibilities of graft versus host disease or development of graft induced tumors. One of the problems for these sources is the procurement of sufficient number of donor stem cells. Inadequate number of cells may lead to delayed recovery and decrease survivability of the patient. Thus to overcome the limitation of stem cell number, development of an ex-vivo expansion technology is critically important. The recent emerging technology using nanofiber in combination with growth factors has made a significant improvement to the field of regenerative medicine and a couple of patents have been filed.

Selective inhibitors may provide a new therapy for the treatment of tumors with Aurora kinase amplification. Herein we describe our lead optimization efforts within a 7-azaindole-based series culminating in the identification of GSK1070916 (17k). Key to the advancement of the series was the introduction of a 2-aryl group containing a basic amine onto the azaindole leading to significantly improved cellular activity. Compound 17k is a potent and selective ATP-competitive inhibitor of Aurora B and C with K(i)* values of 0.38 +/- 0.29 and 1.5 +/- 0.4 nM, respectively, and is >250-fold selective over Aurora A. Biochemical characterization revealed that compound 17k has an extremely slow dissociation half-life from Aurora B (>480 min), distinguishing it from clinical compounds 1 and 2. In vitro treatment of A549 human lung cancer cells with compound 17k results in a potent antiproliferative effect (EC(50) = 7 nM). Intraperitoneal administration of 17k in mice bearing human tumor xenografts leads to inhibition of histone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 in human colon cancer (Colo205) and tumor regression in human leukemia (HL-60).

Drug susceptibility testing showed that it was resistant to fluconazole, flucytosine, and itraconazole, suggesting that it is a species that has a strong tendency to become resistant.

Primary diagnoses were hematologic diseases in 87.5% of subjects. The most common hematologic diseases included acute myelogenous leukemia in 50% of the subjects, followed by malignant lymphoma in 12.5% of the subjects. The mean administration period was 14.2 +/- 12.9 days, and the mean cumulative dose was 1,786 +/- 2,181 mg.

Adverse events occurred in 9 cases to a slight degree, in 7 cases to a moderate degree, and in no case to a severe degree. Hypokalemia and hypercreatininemia were seen in 7 cases (21.9%) and 4 cases (12.5%), respectively, but these adverse reactions were so mild that the treatment did not need to be discontinued. Any adverse reactions for which treatment administration was discontinued were confirmed to have disappeared at the end of the study. These results support the efficacy and safety of L-AMB in accordance with previous foreign reports. It was noteworthy that early use of L-AMB prior to established diagnosis sometimes better therapeutic outcomes. It was also suggested that L-AMB could be safely administered while controlling electrolyte balance, such as serum potassium concentration, with sufficient fluid replacement, including physiological saline infusion. There are limitations in the use of the conventional form of amphotericin B because of its renal toxicity and other reasons. However, L-AMB had fewer side effects, so the agent was considered useful for the treatment of hematologic disease patients who either had mycosis or carried a risk for fungal infection.","['Iyama, Satoshi', 'Murase, Kazuyuki', 'Sato, Tsutomu', 'Kikuchi, Shohei', 'Sato, Yasushi', 'Kobune, Masayoshi', 'Takimoto, Risyu', 'Kato, Junji']","['Iyama S', 'Murase K', 'Sato T', 'Kikuchi S', 'Sato Y', 'Kobune M', 'Takimoto R', 'Kato J']","['Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,Kansenshogaku zasshi.

Most effects of GC are mediated by glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Multiple promoters have been found in GR gene, which results in different exons 1 s. In human leukemia cell lines, GC response is thought to be related with promoter usage and auto-upregulation of GR. In this study, we investigated whether GR could be auto-induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and whether an inability to upregulate the GR is related with GC resistance in idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS). METHODS: Reverse transcription-PCR was applied to measure the mRNA expression of GR transcripts (GR exons 1A, 1B, 1C, and GR), and real-time PCR was used to confirm these results. GR protein expression was analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: Following GC treatment, both GR exon 1A and GR in PBMCs were increased in vitro, while GR exons 1B and 1C showed no significant changes. In patients with INS, the glucocorticoid-sensitive group expressed more GR exon 1A and less GR exon 1C than the glucocorticoid-resistant group, but the total GR showed no significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: GR is auto-induced in PBMCs in vitro and GR promoter 1A is involved in this mechanism; however the auto-upregulation of GR is not related with glucocorticoid response in patients with INS.","['Chen, Peisong', 'Jiang, Tang', 'Ouyang, Juan', 'Cui, Yingpeng']","['Chen P', 'Jiang T', 'Ouyang J', 'Cui Y']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, 58 Zhongshan Road II, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Int Urol Nephrol,International urology and nephrology,0262521,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blotting, Western', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nephrosis, Lipoid/blood/drug therapy/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spectrophotometry', '*Up-Regulation']",,2010/04/27 06:00,2011/07/27 06:00,['2010/04/27 06:00'],"['2009/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11255-010-9741-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Urol Nephrol. 2011 Mar;43(1):167-74. doi: 10.1007/s11255-010-9741-8.

However, these drugs are limited by common tumor resistance mechanisms and side-effect profiles. Novel topoisomerase II-targeting agents may benefit patients who prove resistant to currently available topoisomerase II-targeting drugs or encounter unacceptable toxicities. Voreloxin is an anticancer quinolone derivative, a chemical scaffold not used previously for cancer treatment. Voreloxin is completing Phase 2 clinical trials in acute myeloid leukemia and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. This study defined voreloxin's anticancer mechanism of action as a critical component of rational clinical development informed by translational research. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Biochemical and cell-based studies established that voreloxin intercalates DNA and poisons topoisomerase II, causing DNA double-strand breaks, G2 arrest, and apoptosis. Voreloxin is differentiated both structurally and mechanistically from other topoisomerase II poisons currently in use as chemotherapeutics. In cell-based studies, voreloxin poisoned topoisomerase II and caused dose-dependent, site-selective DNA fragmentation analogous to that of quinolone antibacterials in prokaryotes; in contrast etoposide, the nonintercalating epipodophyllotoxin topoisomerase II poison, caused extensive DNA fragmentation. Etoposide's activity was highly dependent on topoisomerase II while voreloxin and the intercalating anthracycline topoisomerase II poison, doxorubicin, had comparable dependence on this enzyme for inducing G2 arrest. Mechanistic interrogation with voreloxin analogs revealed that intercalation is required for voreloxin's activity; a nonintercalating analog did not inhibit proliferation or induce G2 arrest, while an analog with enhanced intercalation was 9.5-fold more potent. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: As a first-in-class anticancer quinolone derivative, voreloxin is a toposiomerase II-targeting agent with a unique mechanistic signature. A detailed understanding of voreloxin's molecular mechanism, in combination with its evolving clinical profile, may advance our understanding of structure-activity relationships to develop safer and more effective topoisomerase II-targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer.","['Hawtin, Rachael E', 'Stockett, David E', 'Byl, Jo Ann W', 'McDowell, Robert S', 'Nguyen, Tan', 'Arkin, Michelle R', 'Conroy, Andrew', 'Yang, Wenjin', 'Osheroff, Neil', 'Fox, Judith A']","['Hawtin RE', 'Stockett DE', 'Byl JA', 'McDowell RS', 'Nguyen T', 'Arkin MR', 'Conroy A', 'Yang W', 'Osheroff N', 'Fox JA']","['Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., South San Francisco, California, United States of America. rhawtin@sunesis.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Naphthyridines)', '0 (Quinolones)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'K6A90IIZ19 (vosaroxin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*drug effects', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'G2 Phase', 'Humans', 'Intercalating Agents', 'Naphthyridines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Quinolones/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,2010/04/27 06:00,2011/06/17 06:00,['2010/04/27 06:00'],"['2009/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0010186 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Apr 15;5(4):e10186. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0010186.,,,"['R01 GM033944/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM33944/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",20100415,PMC2855444,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer stem cell eradication is thought to be crucial for successful anticancer therapy. Using an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model induced by the leukemia-associated monocytic leukemia zinc finger (MOZ)-TIF2 fusion protein, we show here that AML can be cured by the ablation of leukemia stem cells. The MOZ fusion proteins MOZ-TIF2 and MOZ-CBP interacted with the transcription factor PU.1 to stimulate the expression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (CSF1R, also known as M-CSFR, c-FMS or CD115). Studies using PU.1-deficient mice showed that PU.1 is essential for the ability of MOZ-TIF2 to establish and maintain AML stem cells. Cells expressing high amounts of CSF1R (CSF1R(high) cells), but not those expressing low amounts of CSF1R (CSF1R(low) cells), showed potent leukemia-initiating activity. Using transgenic mice expressing a drug-inducible suicide gene controlled by the CSF1R promoter, we cured AML by ablation of CSF1R(high) cells. Moreover, induction of AML was suppressed in CSF1R-deficient mice and CSF1R inhibitors slowed the progression of MOZ-TIF2-induced leukemia. Thus, in this subtype of AML, leukemia stem cells are contained within the CSF1R(high) cell population, and we suggest that targeting of PU.1-mediated upregulation of CSF1R expression might be a useful therapeutic approach.","['Aikawa, Yukiko', 'Katsumoto, Takuo', 'Zhang, Pu', 'Shima, Haruko', 'Shino, Mika', 'Terui, Kiminori', 'Ito, Etsuro', 'Ohno, Hiroaki', 'Stanley, E Richard', 'Singh, Harinder', 'Tenen, Daniel G', 'Kitabayashi, Issay']","['Aikawa Y', 'Katsumoto T', 'Zhang P', 'Shima H', 'Shino M', 'Terui K', 'Ito E', 'Ohno H', 'Stanley ER', 'Singh H', 'Tenen DG', 'Kitabayashi I']","['Molecular Oncology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tsukiji, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (NCOA2 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/genetics', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', '*Up-Regulation', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",,2010/04/27 06:00,2010/07/03 06:00,['2010/04/27 06:00'],"['2010/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['nm.2122 [pii]', '10.1038/nm.2122 [doi]']",ppublish,"Nat Med. 2010 May;16(5):580-5, 1p following 585. doi: 10.1038/nm.2122.

By indirect standardization, the expected cases (based on incidence rate in the Province) were compared with observed cases in the close-by municipality of Ispra, in municipalities within a 5 km radius of the JRC (5kmArea) and in the area covered by the District of Sesto Calende (DistrictArea). RESULTS: in the period 1982-1998, mean populations were 4,687 (Ispra), 32,120 (5kmArea) and 43,707 (DistrictArea); the population of the Province was 793,752.

While Tal-1 is essential for both hematopoietic and vascular development, the role of Lyl1 appears to be distinct as deficient mice are viable and display modest hematopoietic defects. Here, we reveal a role for Lyl1 as a major regulator of adult neovascularization. Tumors implanted into Lyl1-deficient mice showed higher proliferation and angiogenesis, as evidenced by enlarged lumens, reduced pericyte coverage and increased permeability, compared with wild type littermates. Of note, Lyl1-deficient tumor vessels exhibited an up-regulation of Tal-1, the VE-Cadherin target gene, as well as Angiopoietin-2, 3 major actors in angiogenesis. Hematopoietic reconstitution experiments demonstrated that this sustained tumor angiogenesis was of endothelial origin. Moreover, the angiogenic phenotype observed in the absence of Lyl1 function was not tumor-restricted as microvessels forming in Matrigel or originating from aortic explants were also more numerous and larger than their wild-type counterparts. Finally, LYL1 depletion in human endothelial cells revealed that LYL1 controls the expression of molecules involved in the stabilization of vascular structures. Together, our data show a role for LYL1 in the postnatal maturation of newly formed blood vessels.","['Pirot, Nelly', 'Deleuze, Virginie', 'El-Hajj, Rawan', 'Dohet, Christiane', 'Sablitzky, Fred', 'Couttet, Philippe', 'Mathieu, Daniele', 'Pinet, Valerie']","['Pirot N', 'Deleuze V', 'El-Hajj R', 'Dohet C', 'Sablitzky F', 'Couttet P', 'Mathieu D', 'Pinet V']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier, Unite Mixte de Recherche 5535, Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Angiopoietin-2)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (LYL1 protein, human)', '0 (Lyl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (cadherin 5)']",IM,"['Angiopoietin-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cadherins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*blood supply/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",,2010/04/27 06:00,2010/07/10 06:00,['2010/04/27 06:00'],"['2010/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34846-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-03-275651 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jun 24;115(25):5270-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-03-275651.

To identify novel T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia entities, gene expression profiling was performed and clinico-biological features were studied. DESIGN AND METHODS: Sixty-nine untreated adults with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia were evaluated by oligonucleotide arrays: unsupervised and supervised analyses were performed. The up-regulation of myeloid genes and miR-223 expression were validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. RESULTS: Using unsupervised clustering, we identified five subgroups. Of these, one branch included seven patients whose gene expression profile resembled that of acute myeloid leukemia. These cases were characterized by over-expression of a large set of myeloid-related genes for surface antigens, transcription factors and granule proteins. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed over-expression of MPO, CEBPA, CEBPB, GRN and IL8. We, therefore, evaluated the expression levels of miR-223, involved in myeloid differentiation: these cases had significantly higher levels of miR-223 than had the other cases of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with values comparable to those observed in acute myeloid leukemia. Finally, these patients appear to have an unfavorable clinical course. CONCLUSIONS: Using gene profiling we identified a subset of adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, accounting for 10% of the cases analyzed, which displays myeloid features. These cases were not recognized by standard approaches, underlining the importance of gene profiling in identifying novel acute leukemia subsets. The recognition of this subgroup may have clinical, prognostic and therapeutic implications.","['Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Messina, Monica', 'Tavolaro, Simona', 'Zardo, Giuseppe', 'Elia, Loredana', 'Vitale, Antonella', 'Fatica, Alessandro', 'Gorello, Paolo', 'Piciocchi, Alfonso', 'Scappucci, Gina', 'Bozzoni, Irene', 'Fozza, Claudio', 'Candoni, Anna', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Foa, Robin']","['Chiaretti S', 'Messina M', 'Tavolaro S', 'Zardo G', 'Elia L', 'Vitale A', 'Fatica A', 'Gorello P', 'Piciocchi A', 'Scappucci G', 'Bozzoni I', 'Fozza C', 'Candoni A', 'Guarini A', 'Foa R']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Via Benevento 6, 00161 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (MIRN223 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics']",,2010/04/27 06:00,2010/09/30 06:00,['2010/04/27 06:00'],"['2010/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.015099 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.015099 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Jul;95(7):1114-21. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.015099.

This latter problem is assumed to be caused by a higher cellular sensitivity of tissues in children with Down syndrome. However, whether differences in pharmacokinetics play a role is unknown. DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared methotrexate-induced toxicity and pharmacokinetics in a retrospective case-control study between patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who did or did not have Down syndrome. Population pharmacokinetic models were fitted to data from all individuals simultaneously, using non-linear mixed effect modeling. RESULTS: Overall, 468 courses of methotrexate (1-5 g/m(2)) were given to 44 acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with Down syndrome and to 87 acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients without Down syndrome. Grade 3-4 gastrointestinal toxicity was significantly more frequent in the children with Down syndrome than in those without (25.5% versus 3.9%; P=0.001). The occurrence of grade 3-4 gastrointestinal toxicity was not related to plasma methotrexate area under the curve. Methotrexate clearance was 5% lower in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with Down syndrome (P=0.001); however, this small difference is probably clinically not relevant, because no significant differences in methotrexate plasma levels were detected at 24 and 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find evidence of differences in the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate between patients with and without Down syndrome which could explain the higher frequency of gastrointestinal toxicity and the greater need for methotrexate dose reductions in patients with Down syndrome. Hence, these problems are most likely explained by differential pharmaco-dynamic effects in the tissues between children with and without Down syndrome. Although the number of patients was limited to draw conclusions, we feel that it may be safe in children with Down syndrome to start with intermediate dosages of methotrexate (1-3 g/m(2)) and monitor the patients carefully.","['Buitenkamp, Trudy D', 'Mathot, Ron A A', 'de Haas, Valerie', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Zwaan, C Michel']","['Buitenkamp TD', 'Mathot RA', 'de Haas V', 'Pieters R', 'Zwaan CM']","[""Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down Syndrome/complications/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2010/04/27 06:00,2010/09/30 06:00,['2010/04/27 06:00'],"['2010/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.019778 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.019778 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Jul;95(7):1106-13. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.019778.

Recent reports have identified health effects at exposure levels < 1 ppm, the permissible exposure limit (PEL; 8 hr) set by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether occupational exposures to benzene near 1 ppm induce aneuploidy in sperm. METHODS: We used multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization to measure the incidence of sperm with numerical abnormalities of chromosomes X, Y, and 21 among 33 benzene-exposed men and 33 unexposed men from Chinese factories. Individual exposures were assessed using personal air monitoring and urinary concentrations of benzene and trans,trans-muconic acid (E,E-MA). Air benzene concentrations were not detectable in unexposed men; in exposed men, concentrations ranged from below the detection limit to 24 ppm (median, 2.9 ppm), with 27% of exposed men (n = 9) having concentrations of <or= 1 ppm. Exposed men were categorized into low and high groups based on urinary E,E-MA (median concentrations of 1.9 and 14.4 mg/L, respectively; median air benzene of 1 and 7.7 ppm, respectively), and aneuploidy frequencies were compared with those of unexposed men. RESULTS: Sperm aneuploidy increased across low- and high-exposed groups for disomy X [incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-3.4; and IRR = 2.8; 95% CI, 1.5-4.9, respectively], and for overall hyperhaploidy for the three chromosomes investigated (IRR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0-2.4; and IRR = 2.3; 95% CI, 1.5-3.6, respectively). We also found elevated disomy X and hyperhaploidy in the nine men exposed to <or= 1 ppm benzene compared with unexposed men (IRR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.0; and IRR = 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.9, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Benzene appeared to increase the frequencies of aneuploid sperm for chromosomes associated with chromosomal abnormality syndromes in human offspring, even in men whose air benzene exposure was at or below the U.S. permissible exposure limit.","['Xing, Caihong', 'Marchetti, Francesco', 'Li, Guilan', 'Weldon, Rosana H', 'Kurtovich, Elaine', 'Young, Suzanne', 'Schmid, Thomas E', 'Zhang, Luoping', 'Rappaport, Stephen', 'Waidyanatha, Suramya', 'Wyrobek, Andrew J', 'Eskenazi, Brenda']","['Xing C', 'Marchetti F', 'Li G', 'Weldon RH', 'Kurtovich E', 'Young S', 'Schmid TE', 'Zhang L', 'Rappaport S', 'Waidyanatha S', 'Wyrobek AJ', 'Eskenazi B']","['Life Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '3KD92ZL2KH (muconic acid)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'X045WJ989B (Sorbic Acid)']",IM,"['*Aneuploidy', 'Benzene/analysis/*toxicity', 'China', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*chemically induced', 'Environmental Pollutants/standards/*toxicity/urine', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Occupational Exposure/*analysis', 'Sorbic Acid/analogs & derivatives/analysis', 'Spermatozoa/*drug effects']",,2010/04/27 06:00,2010/10/20 06:00,['2010/04/27 06:00'],"['2009/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.0901531 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2010 Jun;118(6):833-9. doi: 10.1289/ehp.0901531.

We report here a case of CML with e19a2 who did not show additional chromosomal abnormalities at diagnosis, but progressed to the fatal advanced stage in approximately 2 years. The patient was initially treated with imatinib, which, however, could be administered only intermittently at reduced doses because of recurrent thrombocytopenia and fluid retention. Nine months after starting imatinib, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with the BCR/ABL-ES fusion probe revealed 96% and 3% of bone marrow cells with one and two BCR/ABL1 fusion signals, respectively. Two years after starting therapy, leukocytosis recurred and the bone marrow contained 8.2% large and bizarre myeloblasts. Cytogenetic analysis revealed double Ph clones as well as tetraploid cells with four to five Ph chromosomes. FISH analysis confirmed the presence of cells with two to five BCR/ABL1 fusion signals. The patient died of disease progression in 2 months. No point mutation was detected in the region coding for the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase domain by sequence analysis. It is speculated that the amplification of the BCR/ABL1 fusion gene by duplication of Ph and tetraploidy led to the progression of CML with the e19a2 transcript.","['Oshikawa, Gaku', 'Kurosu, Tetsuya', 'Arai, Ayako', 'Murakami, Naomi', 'Miura, Osamu']","['Oshikawa G', 'Kurosu T', 'Arai A', 'Murakami N', 'Miura O']","['Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Bunkyoku, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', '*Polyploidy', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis/*genetics', 'Time Factors']",,2010/04/27 06:00,2010/05/05 06:00,['2010/04/27 06:00'],"['2009/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2010/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-4608(10)00045-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2010.01.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2010 May;199(1):56-61. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2010.01.018.,,,,,,,,,,['2010 Elsevier Inc.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay confirmed the presence of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 gene (previously AML1-ETO) rearrangements. Among these cases, three-way breakpoints 18p11.3 and 2q11.2 have not been previously reported. The present report deals with the results of hematologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and molecular analyses of these variants. The possible role of the genes in this region in leukemogenesis, response to treatment, and clinical implications are discussed.","['Bae, Sook Young', 'Kim, Jang Su', 'Ryeu, Bung Jun', 'Lee, Kap No', 'Lee, Chang Kyu', 'Kim, Young Kee', 'Lim, Chae Seung', 'Cho, Yunjung', 'Choi, Chul Won', 'Ryu, Sook-Won', 'Yoon, Soo-Young']","['Bae SY', 'Kim JS', 'Ryeu BJ', 'Lee KN', 'Lee CK', 'Kim YK', 'Lim CS', 'Cho Y', 'Choi CW', 'Ryu SW', 'Yoon SY']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seongbuk-Gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Painting', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",,2010/04/27 06:00,2010/05/05 06:00,['2010/04/27 06:00'],"['2009/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/23 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-4608(09)00591-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2009.10.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2010 May;199(1):31-7. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2009.10.002.,,,,,,,,,,['2010 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we describe a novel reciprocal t(5;11)(q31;p15) involving NUP98, as revealed by conventional karyotypic analysis using R-banding technique and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a BAC RP11-120E20 probe and whole chromosome paint probes for chromosomes 5 and 11 in a 77-year-old woman who was diagnosed as having de novo acute myeloid leukemia. The patient received two courses of intensive combined chemotherapy but did not reach complete remission. She eventually died from the progressive disease, surviving for only 1 month after diagnosis. FISH analysis using WCP5 together with BAC RP11-878F9 or RP11-155N22 demonstrated that the breakpoint of chromosome 5 is located on 5q31. In addition, the EGR1 gene was unexpectedly found to be lost in the FISH study using EGR1 (red)/D5S23, D5S721 (green) dual-color probe. We supposed that the fusion gene created by t(5;11)(q31;p15) consisting of the NUP98 and its partner gene, as well as the loss of the EGR1 gene, may play a cooperative role in leukemogenesis. The partner gene of NUP98 in t(5;11)(q31;p15) is unclear at this time.

Consequently, imatinib is used as front-line therapy for this disease. A major concern in imatinib treatment is the emergence of resistance to the drug. Here we used the imatinib-resistant KCL22R and imatinib-sensitive KCL22S cells in which none of the known resistance mechanisms has been detected and hence novel Bcr-Abl activity-independent mechanisms could be envisaged. We characterized proteins that were differentially expressed between the KCL22R and KCL22S cells. Using two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis we identified 51 differentially expressed proteins: 27 were over-expressed and 24 were under-expressed in KCL22R versus KCL22S cells. Several of these proteins are likely to be involved in such survival mechanisms as modulation of redox balance and activation of anti-apoptotic pathways mediated by NF-kappaB and Ras-MAPK signaling. The data reported may be useful for further studies on mechanisms of imatinib resistance and for the screening of biomarkers to develop new combinatorial therapeutic approaches.","['Colavita, Irene', 'Esposito, Nicola', 'Martinelli, Rosanna', 'Catanzano, Francesca', 'Melo, Junia V', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Ruoppolo, Margherita', 'Salvatore, Francesco']","['Colavita I', 'Esposito N', 'Martinelli R', 'Catanzano F', 'Melo JV', 'Pane F', 'Ruoppolo M', 'Salvatore F']","['CEINGE Biotecnologie Avanzate Scarl, Napoli, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'NADP/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2010/04/27 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/04/27 06:00'],"['2009/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S1570-9639(10)00107-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.04.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2010 Oct;1804(10):1974-87. doi: 10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.04.009.

Nanoparticle loading was performed in water/ethanol mixtures in the presence of dissolved HSA acting as solubilizer for photosensitizers. The HSA concentration was optimized to exclude precipitation in the nanoparticle suspension and to increase binding to nanoparticles. Additionally, the influence of pH and incubation time on drug adsorption was investigated. A freeze drying method was established for mTHPC loaded nanoparticles and the storage stability of the freeze dried formulation was tested. PDT related photophysical parameters of drug loaded HSA nanoparticles, especially singlet oxygen generation, are presented. Both preparations were able to generate singlet oxygen with low quantum yield. In contrast, efficient singlet oxygen generation was obtained when Jurkat cells were incubated with mTHPP and mTHPC loaded HSA nanoparticles. This indicates that the photosensitizer molecules were successfully released from the nanoparticles that were taken up by the cells. Therefore, the efficiency of HSA nanoparticles as drug carriers for photosensitizers was proven under in vitro conditions.","['Wacker, Matthias', 'Chen, Kuan', 'Preuss, Annegret', 'Possemeyer, Karin', 'Roeder, Beate', 'Langer, Klaus']","['Wacker M', 'Chen K', 'Preuss A', 'Possemeyer K', 'Roeder B', 'Langer K']","['Institute of Pharmaceutical Technology, Biocenter of Goethe-University, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int J Pharm,International journal of pharmaceutics,7804127,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Mesoporphyrins)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (Solvents)', '0 (tetra(3-hydroxyphenyl)porphine)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '17778-80-2 (Singlet Oxygen)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', 'FU21S769PF (temoporfin)']",IM,"['Adsorption', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', '*Drug Carriers', 'Drug Compounding', 'Drug Stability', 'Drug Storage', 'Ethanol/chemistry', 'Freeze Drying', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Mesoporphyrins/*chemistry', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', '*Nanoparticles', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*chemistry', 'Porphyrins/*chemistry', 'Serum Albumin/*chemistry', 'Singlet Oxygen/metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Solvents/chemistry', 'Surface Properties', 'Technology, Pharmaceutical/methods', 'Time Factors', 'Water/chemistry']",,2010/04/27 06:00,2010/09/04 06:00,['2010/04/27 06:00'],"['2010/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-5173(10)00294-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijpharm.2010.04.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Pharm. 2010 Jun 30;393(1-2):253-62. doi: 10.1016/j.ijpharm.2010.04.022.

Selenocysteine incorporation occurs during translation of selenoprotein messages by redefinition of UGA codons, which normally specify termination of translation. Studies of the eukaryotic selenocysteine incorporation mechanism suggest that selenocysteine insertion is inefficient compared with termination. Nevertheless, selenoprotein P and several other selenoproteins are known to contain multiple selenocysteines. The production of full-length (FL) protein from these messages would seem to demand highly efficient selenocysteine incorporation due to the compounding effect of termination at each UGA codon. We present data demonstrating that efficient incorporation of multiple selenocysteines can be reconstituted in rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation reactions. Selenocysteine incorporation at the first UGA codon is inefficient but increases by approximately 10-fold at subsequent downstream UGA codons. We found that ribosomes in the ""processive"" phase of selenocysteine incorporation (i.e., after decoding the first UGA codon as selenocysteine) are fully competent to terminate translation at UAG and UAA codons, that ribosomes become less efficient at selenocysteine incorporation as the distance between UGA codons is increased, and that efficient selenocysteine incorporation is not dependent on cis-acting elements unique to selenoprotein P. Furthermore, we found that the percentage of ribosomes decoding a UGA codon as selenocysteine rather than termination can be increased by 3- to 5-fold by placing the murine leukemia virus UAG read-through element upstream of the first UGA codon or by providing a competing messenger RNA in trans. The mechanisms of selenocysteine incorporation and selenoprotein synthesis are discussed in light of these results.","['Fixsen, S M', 'Howard, Michael T']","['Fixsen SM', 'Howard MT']","['Department of Human Genetics, University of Utah, Room 2100, 15 North 2030 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Codon, Terminator)', '0 (Selenoprotein P)', '0 (Selenoproteins)', '0CH9049VIS (Selenocysteine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Codon', 'Codon, Terminator', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Rabbits', 'Reticulocytes/metabolism', 'Selenocysteine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Selenoprotein P/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Selenoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics']",,2010/04/27 06:00,2010/09/04 06:00,['2010/04/27 06:00'],"['2010/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2836(10)00407-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2010.04.033 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2010 Jun 11;399(3):385-96. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2010.04.033.

Here we demonstrated the antitumor potential of SR141716 in leukemia-derived cell lines and its low toxicity in normal cells (PBMC). SR141716 (1-20microM range of doses) reduced Jurkat and U937 cell number by activating death signals as well as affecting cell cycle progression. The most prominent response in U937 to SR141716 was a G(0)/G(1) block, while in Jurkat cells there was activation of cell death processes. SR141716-treated cells exhibited the morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis and to some extent necrosis. Apoptotic mode of cell death was confirmed in both cell lines by analysis of cell morphology, phosphatidylserine exposure and DNA fragmentation. Moreover, the drug was found to induce an early and robust mitochondrial membrane depolarization. In Jurkat cells the apoptotic process was typically caspase-dependent, while in U937 caspase-independent pathways were also activated. The contribution of PARP activation to SR141716-induced apoptosis in U937 was suggested by protein PARylation, AIF release and apoptosis reversal by PARP inhibitors. Moreover, SR141716 negatively modulated, especially in U937, the PI3K/AKT pathways.

Since iPS cells are generated from somatic cells, they provide an invaluable source of pluripotent stem cells for cell transplantation therapy that does not present ethical problems. However, the reprogramming efficiency is extremely low, and optimal culture conditions for iPS cell derivation have not been clearly defined. METHODS: To generate iPS cells efficiently, we tested 10 different culture conditions: DMEM supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), Knockout DMEM with 15% FBS from Invitrogen, Equitech, or HyClone, DMEM with 15% Knockout Serum Replacement (KSR), and Knockout DMEM with 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, or 35% KSR. These media all contain 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 muM nonessential amino acids, 100 muM beta-mercaptoethanol, 1000 units ml(-)(1) leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), 50 units ml(-)(1) penicillin, and 50 mug ml(-)(1) streptomycin. RESULTS: Medium containing Knockout DMEM with 20% KSR permits efficient induction of iPS cells from both mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and adult tail tip fibroblasts (TTFs). Mouse iPS cells generated in the condition express ES cell marker genes such as Oct4, Sox2, Rex1, and Nanog at levels comparable to those of ES cells. Furthermore, iPS cells derived form MEFs and adult TTFs can contribute to adult chimeras. CONCLUSION: Our iPS cell induction efficiency is greater than that described in other reports. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: These findings provide an important catalyst for examining different culture environments for the generation of iPS cells.","['Okada, Minoru', 'Oka, Masahiro', 'Yoneda, Yoshihiro']","['Okada M', 'Oka M', 'Yoneda Y']","['Biomolecular Networks Laboratories, Department of Frontier Biosciences, Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Mice', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",,2010/04/27 06:00,2010/11/04 06:00,['2010/04/27 06:00'],"['2009/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-4165(10)00111-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbagen.2010.04.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2010 Sep;1800(9):956-63. doi: 10.1016/j.bbagen.2010.04.004.

Plantaricin A (PlnA) is a peptide pheromone with membrane permeabilizing strain-specific antibacterial activity, produced by Lactobacillus plantarum C11. Recently, we have reported that PlnA also permeabilizes cancerous rat pituitary cells (GH(4) cells), whereas normal rat anterior pituitary cells are resistant. To investigate if preferential effect on cancerous cells is a general feature of PlnA, we have studied effects of the peptide on normal and cancerous lymphocytes and neuronal cells. Normal human B and T cells, Reh cells (from human B cell leukemia), and Jurkat cells (from human T cell leukemia) were studied by flow cytometry to detect morphological changes (scatter) and viability (propidium iodide uptake), and by patch clamp recordings to monitor membrane conductance. Ca(2+) imaging based on a combination of fluo-4 and fura-red was used to monitor PlnA-induced membrane permeabilization in normal rat cortical neurons and glial cells, PC12 cells (from a rat adrenal chromaffin tumor), and murine N2A cells (from a spinal cord tumor). All the tested cell types were affected by 10-100 microM PlnA, whereas concentrations below 10 microM had no significant effect. We conclude that normal and cancerous lymphocytes and neuronal cells show similar sensitivity to PlnA.","['Sand, Sverre L', 'Oppegard, Camilla', 'Ohara, Shinya', 'Iijima, Toshio', 'Naderi, Soheil', 'Blomhoff, Heidi K', 'Nissen-Meyer, Jon', 'Sand, Olav']","['Sand SL', 'Oppegard C', 'Ohara S', 'Iijima T', 'Naderi S', 'Blomhoff HK', 'Nissen-Meyer J', 'Sand O']","['Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Oslo, Blindernveien 31, NO-0316 Oslo, Norway. olav.sand@imbv.uio.no']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Peptides,Peptides,8008690,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bacteriocins)', '0 (Pheromones)', '131463-18-8 (plantaricin A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Bacteriocins/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lactobacillus plantarum/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neurons/drug effects/metabolism', 'Pheromones/biosynthesis', 'Rats']",,2010/04/27 06:00,2010/09/15 06:00,['2010/04/27 06:00'],"['2010/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0196-9781(10)00164-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.peptides.2010.04.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Peptides. 2010 Jul;31(7):1237-44. doi: 10.1016/j.peptides.2010.04.010.

The normal donor marrow specimens were used as the reference. The ratio of cmtm5 copy number to abl (Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog) gene copy number was used for indicating the expression level. The results showed that the expression level of cmtm5 gene was significantly down-regulated in bone marrow cells of 51 untreated or relapsed/refractory MM patient as compared to those of normal donor marrow cells (0.047+/-0.062 for the untreated or relapsed/refractory MM patients versus 0.255+/-0.333 for the normal, p<0.01).

The potential of these screens to identify genes causally involved in tumorigenesis is not only limited to the murine host, but many of these genes have also been proven to be involved in the oncogenic process in man. RESULTS: Through an insertional mutagenesis screen applying murine leukemia viruses in mouse, we found that Cd74 was targeted by proviral insertion in tumors of B-cell origin. This locus encodes a protein playing crucial roles in antigen presentation and B-cell homeostasis, and its deregulation is often associated with cancer in man. The distribution of insertions within the Cd74 locus prompted the identification of an alternative transcript initiated in intron 1 of Cd74 encoding an N-terminally truncated Cd74 isoform in tissues from un-infected mice, and transcriptional activation assays revealed a positive effect on the novel intronic promoter by a formerly described intronic enhancer in the Cd74 locus. Furthermore, we show that the new Cd74 isoform is IFNgamma inducible and that its expression is differentially regulated from the canonical Cd74 isoform at the transcriptional level. CONCLUSIONS: We here identify Cd74 as a common insertion site in murine B-lymphomas and describe a novel IFNgamma-inducible murine Cd74 isoform differentially regulated from the canonical isoform and expressed under the control of an intronic promoter. The distribution and orientation of proviral insertion sites within the Cd74 locus underscores the causal involvement of the isoforms in the murine B-lymphomagenic process.","['Pyrz, Magdalena', 'Wang, Bruce', 'Wabl, Matthias', 'Pedersen, Finn Skou']","['Pyrz M', 'Wang B', 'Wabl M', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Aarhus University, Aarhus, DK-8000, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (invariant chain)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*genetics/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2010/04/27 06:00,2010/07/31 06:00,['2010/04/27 06:00'],"['2010/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-9-86 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-9-86 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2010 Apr 23;9:86. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-9-86.,,,['R01 AI041570/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],20100423,PMC2883540,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Details of 2959 primary malignant cases (1659 males, 1300 females), diagnosed during the period 1968-2005, were extracted from a specialist registry (the Northern Region Young Persons' Malignant Disease Registry). Seasonal variation was analysed with respect to month of birth and diagnosis. The chi-squared heterogeneity test was used to test for non-uniform variation. Poisson regression analysis was used to fit sinusoidal (harmonic) models to the data, using month of birth and month of diagnosis, respectively, as covariates in separate models. There was significant sinusoidal variation based on month of birth for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) aged 1-6 years (P = 0.04; peak in March). For 0- to 14-year-old boys, there was statistically significant sinusoidal variation in month of birth for acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia (P = 0.04; peak in September) and astrocytoma (P = 0.03; peak in October). Based on month of diagnosis, there was statistically significant sinusoidal variation in girls for all lymphomas (P = 0.048; peak in March) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) (P = 0.005; peak in January), and in boys for osteosarcoma (P = 0.049; peak in October). This study confirms previous findings of seasonal variation around the month of birth for childhood ALL (at the peak ages) and provides further evidence of seasonal variation around month of birth for astrocytoma and around month of diagnosis for HL. The results are consistent with a role for environmental factors in the aetiology of these diagnostic groups. Further studies are needed to examine putative candidate agents.","['Basta, Nermine O', 'James, Peter W', 'Craft, Alan W', 'McNally, Richard J Q']","['Basta NO', 'James PW', 'Craft AW', 'McNally RJ']","['Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol,Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,8709766,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Astrocytoma/*epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', '*Seasons']",,2010/04/27 06:00,2010/08/05 06:00,['2010/04/27 06:00'],"['2010/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['PPE1112 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-3016.2010.01112.x [doi]']",ppublish,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol. 2010 May;24(3):309-18. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3016.2010.01112.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper examines the performance of random digit dialling (RDD) in obtaining a control sample, and the sample's representativeness of the population with respect to socio-economic status. The study subjects were recruited from 2003 to 2006 for a national, population-based case-control study investigating causes of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in children <15 years of age in Australia. Control families' addresses were linked to Australian Bureau of Statistics Census 2006 Collection Districts and thus to Socio-Economic Indexes for Area scores, which are area-based measures of socio-economic status. These scores were compared with those of all collection districts where families lived. We estimate that 55% of eligible families in the RDD sample agreed to participate in the study. Participation was directly related to socio-economic status with those of highest economic status most likely to participate. Completeness of participation in the components of data collection was similarly related to socio-economic status. This evidence of selection according to socio-economic status indicates that there may also be selection with respect to other factors potentially important in the aetiology of ALL.","['Bailey, Helen D', 'Milne, Elizabeth', 'de Klerk, Nicholas', 'Fritschi, Lin', 'Bower, Carol', 'Attia, John', 'Armstrong, Bruce K']","['Bailey HD', 'Milne E', 'de Klerk N', 'Fritschi L', 'Bower C', 'Attia J', 'Armstrong BK']","['Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Centre for Child Health Research, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, USA. helenb@ichr.uwa.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol,Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,8709766,,IM,"['*Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Data Collection', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Selection Bias', 'Socioeconomic Factors', '*Telephone']",,2010/04/27 06:00,2010/08/05 06:00,['2010/04/27 06:00'],"['2010/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['PPE1099 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-3016.2010.01099.x [doi]']",ppublish,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol. 2010 May;24(3):293-302. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3016.2010.01099.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we analyzed cell surface and relative gene expression of HSP70 in cell lines established from patients with different acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subtypes, together with the expression of natural killer (NK) cell activation/inhibitory ligands. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six AML cell lines were included in this study. The relative gene expression of HSP70 was analyzed using the real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Surface expression of HSP70 and NK cell ligands was analyzed using flow cytometry. RESULTS: All cell lines overexpressed HSP70; however, its mRNA levels were not elevated. The expression of NKG2D activation ligands was heterogeneous. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to describe long-term stationary cell surface expression of HSP70 in different subtypes of AML.

A comprehensive structural, biochemical, and cellular study is presented here to probe the potential of these enzymes for epigenetic therapies. This approach employs tranylcypromine as a chemical scaffold for the design of novel demethylase inhibitors. This drug is a clinically validated antidepressant known to target monoamine oxidases A and B. These two flavoenzymes are structurally related to LSD1 and LSD2. Mechanistic and crystallographic studies of tranylcypromine inhibition reveal a lack of selectivity and differing covalent modifications of the FAD cofactor depending on the enantiomeric form. These findings are pharmacologically relevant, since tranylcypromine is currently administered as a racemic mixture. A large set of tranylcypromine analogues were synthesized and screened for inhibitory activities. We found that the common evolutionary origin of LSD and MAO enzymes, despite their unrelated functions and substrate specificities, is reflected in related ligand-binding properties. A few compounds with partial enzyme selectivity were identified. The biological activity of one of these new inhibitors was evaluated with a cellular model of acute promyelocytic leukemia chosen since its pathogenesis includes aberrant activities of several chromatin modifiers. Marked effects on cell differentiation and an unprecedented synergistic activity with antileukemia drugs were observed. These data demonstrate that these LSD1/2 inhibitors are of potential relevance for the treatment of promyelocytic leukemia and, more generally, as tools to alter chromatin state with promise of a block of tumor progression.","['Binda, Claudia', 'Valente, Sergio', 'Romanenghi, Mauro', 'Pilotto, Simona', 'Cirilli, Roberto', 'Karytinos, Aristotele', 'Ciossani, Giuseppe', 'Botrugno, Oronza A', 'Forneris, Federico', 'Tardugno, Maria', 'Edmondson, Dale E', 'Minucci, Saverio', 'Mattevi, Andrea', 'Mai, Antonello']","['Binda C', 'Valente S', 'Romanenghi M', 'Pilotto S', 'Cirilli R', 'Karytinos A', 'Ciossani G', 'Botrugno OA', 'Forneris F', 'Tardugno M', 'Edmondson DE', 'Minucci S', 'Mattevi A', 'Mai A']","['Department of Genetics and Microbiology, University of Pavia, Via Ferrata 1, 27100 Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Am Chem Soc,Journal of the American Chemical Society,7503056,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '3E3V44J4Z9 (Tranylcypromine)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Histone Demethylases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tranylcypromine/*chemistry/*pharmacology']",,2010/04/27 06:00,2010/07/31 06:00,['2010/04/27 06:00'],"['2010/04/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ja101557k [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Chem Soc. 2010 May 19;132(19):6827-33. doi: 10.1021/ja101557k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After achieving hematological remission, he received tandem high-dose melphalan supported by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Five months after his second transplant, he complained of lumbago and bilateral leg pain. M-protein and Bence-Jones protein were not detected in serum or urine. An axial magnetic resonance imaging study revealed enlargement of the cauda equina nerve roots on T-1 weighted image. A sagittal T-1 weighted gadolinium-enhanced imaging study showed hyperintensities along the cauda equina. Leptomeningeal enhancement was also seen below the level of Th6. A cytological examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with May-Giemsa stain showed atypical plasma cells. Immunoelectrophoresis of the CSF revealed monoclonal IgA-k type protein. A diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS)relapse was made. The patient died of pneumonia two months after relapse.

The economic crisis among cancer patients is a consequence of structural problems with many anticancer drugs and cancer treatment.

METHODS: Decision tree models based on the results of two registration trials and subsequent Markov models over patient lifetimes were developed for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with neutropenia and for hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). RESULTS: By reducing IFIs in AML/MDS patients with posaconazole prophylaxis, the contained IFI-related treatment costs more than compensated for the incremental cost of posaconazole, resulting in savings of CHF 1,118 per patient. Lifetime posaconazole prophylaxis resulted in a benefit of 0.16 life years saved per patient compared with fluconazole/itraconazole. In patients with GVHD, posaconazole prophylaxis prevented 0.04 IFIs, resulting in incremental costs of CHF 7,040 per patient. Lifetime posaconazole prophylaxis resulted in a benefit of 0.15 life years saved per patient, with an incremental cost-effectiveness rate of CHF 48,324 per life year saved. CONCLUSIONS: Given the conditions of the Swiss setting, posaconazole can be considered a cost-effective early treatment strategy that increases survival in patients at risk for IFI and may have a substantial benefit for the economic burden of IFI.","['Greiner, Roger-Axel', 'Meier, Yvonne', 'Papadopoulos, George', ""O'Sullivan, Amy K"", 'Imhof, Alexander']","['Greiner RA', 'Meier Y', 'Papadopoulos G', ""O'Sullivan AK"", 'Imhof A']","['Consultant Health Economics, Lorrach, Germany.

Surprisingly, at CML diagnosis, 15 of 18 patients (83%) had a sizeable clonal, BCR-ABL1 negative lymphocyte population, which was uncommon in healthy persons (1 of 12; 8%). The same clone persisted at low levels in most imatinib-treated patients. In contrast, in a distinct population of dasatinib-treated patients, the diagnostic phase clone markedly expanded, resulting in absolute lymphocytosis in blood. Most patients with LGL expansions (90%) had TCR delta rearrangements, which were uncommon in patients without an LGL expansion (10%). The TCR delta clones were confined to gammadelta(+) T- or natural killer-cell compartments and the TCR gamma clones to CD4(+)/CD8(+) alphabeta(+) fractions.

We screened 842 patients treated on 3 consecutive pediatric AML trials for WT1 zinc-finger mutations. Eighty-five mutations were detected in 70 of 842 patients (8.3%). Mutations occurred predominantly in exon 7 (n = 74) but were also found in exons 8 (n = 5) and 9 (n = 6). Normal karyotype was observed in 35.3% of WT1(mut) patients, whereas 27.5% WT1(mut) patients harbored favorable risk cytogenetics. Patients with or without mutations had similar rates of complete remission after one course of induction chemotherapy. Overall survival (OS) for patients with WT1 mutations was 41% versus 54% for those without mutations (P = .016). Corresponding event-free survival (EFS) was also significantly worse for those with WT1 mutations (28% vs 42%; P = .01). However, FLT3/ITD was present in 36% of the WT1(mut) cohort; WT1(mut) patients without FLT3/ITD had similar OS (56% vs 56%, respectively; P = .8) and EFS (35% and 44%, respectively; P = .34) to patients who were wild type for both mutations. In current risk stratification schemes incorporating cytogenetics and FLT3/ITD status, the presence of WT1 mutations has no independent prognostic significance in predicting outcome in pediatric AML.

Besides the previously demonstrated role of histone deacetylation in the epigenetic repression of BLV expression, we showed here that BLV promoter activity was induced by several DNA methylation inhibitors (such as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) and that overexpressed DNMT1 and DNMT3A, but not DNMT3B, down-regulated BLV promoter activity. Importantly, cytosine hypermethylation in the 5'-long terminal repeat (LTR) U3 and R regions was associated with true latency in the lymphoma-derived B-cell line L267 but not with defective latency in YR2 cells. Moreover, the virus-encoded transactivator Tax(BLV) decreased DNA methyltransferase expression levels, which could explain the lower level of cytosine methylation observed in the L267(LTaxSN) 5'-LTR compared with the L267 5'-LTR. Interestingly, DNA methylation inhibitors and Tax(BLV) synergistically activated BLV promoter transcriptional activity in a cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-dependent manner. Mechanistically, methylation at the -154 or -129 CpG position (relative to the transcription start site) impaired in vitro binding of CRE-binding protein (CREB) transcription factors to their respective CRE sites. Methylation at -129 CpG alone was sufficient to decrease BLV promoter-driven reporter gene expression by 2-fold. We demonstrated in vivo the recruitment of CREB/CRE modulator (CREM) and to a lesser extent activating transcription factor-1 (ATF-1) to the hypomethylated CRE region of the YR2 5'-LTR, whereas we detected no CREB/CREM/ATF recruitment to the hypermethylated corresponding region in the L267 cells. Altogether, these findings suggest that site-specific DNA methylation of the BLV promoter represses viral transcription by directly inhibiting transcription factor binding, thereby contributing to true proviral latency.","['Pierard, Valerie', 'Guiguen, Allan', 'Colin, Laurence', 'Wijmeersch, Gaelle', 'Vanhulle, Caroline', 'Van Driessche, Benoit', 'Dekoninck, Ann', 'Blazkova, Jana', 'Cardona, Christelle', 'Merimi, Makram', 'Vierendeel, Valerie', 'Calomme, Claire', 'Nguyen, Thi Lien-Anh', 'Nuttinck, Michele', 'Twizere, Jean-Claude', 'Kettmann, Richard', 'Portetelle, Daniel', 'Burny, Arsene', 'Hirsch, Ivan', 'Rohr, Olivier', 'Van Lint, Carine']","['Pierard V', 'Guiguen A', 'Colin L', 'Wijmeersch G', 'Vanhulle C', 'Van Driessche B', 'Dekoninck A', 'Blazkova J', 'Cardona C', 'Merimi M', 'Vierendeel V', 'Calomme C', 'Nguyen TL', 'Nuttinck M', 'Twizere JC', 'Kettmann R', 'Portetelle D', 'Burny A', 'Hirsch I', 'Rohr O', 'Van Lint C']","['Laboratoire de Virologie Moleculaire, Institut de Biologie et de Medecine Moleculaires, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Rue des Profs Jeener et Brachet 12, 6041 Gosselies, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ATF1 protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Sulfites)', '135844-64-3 (Cyclic AMP Response Element Modulator)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'OJ9787WBLU (hydrogen sulfite)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 1/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/*virology', 'Chromatin/chemistry', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element Modulator/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'Cytosine/chemistry/*metabolism', 'DNA/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Plasmids/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sulfites/chemistry']",,2010/04/24 06:00,2010/07/22 06:00,['2010/04/24 06:00'],"['2010/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)58076-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.107607 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Jun 18;285(25):19434-49. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.107607.

Radiation and chemotherapy can cause mutations and cytogenetic abnormalities and induce genomic instability. Host immunity and appropriate DNA damage responses are critical inhibitors of carcinogenesis. Therefore, we sought to determine the long-term effects of ALL treatment on immune function and response to DNA damage. METHODS: Comparative studies on 14 survivors in first complete remission and 16 siblings were conducted. RESULTS: In comparison to siblings on the cells that were involved in adaptive immunity, the patients had either higher numbers (CD19+ B cells and CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells) or similar numbers (alphabetaT cells and CD45RO+/RA- memory T cells) in the blood. In contrast, patients had lower numbers of all lymphocyte subsets involved in innate immunity (gammadeltaT cells and all NK subsets, including KIR2DL1+ cells, KIR2DL2/L3+ cells, and CD16+ cells), and lower natural cytotoxicity against K562 leukemia cells. Thymopoiesis was lower in patients, as demonstrated by less CD45RO-/RA+ naive T cell and less SjTREC levels in the blood, whereas the Vbeta spectratype complexity score was similar. Array of gene expression response to low-dose radiation showed that about 70% of the probesets had a reduced response in patients. One of these genes, SCHIP-1, was also among the top-ranked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) during the whole-genome scanning by SNP microarray analysis.

In human medicine, FC (in addition to cytology) is reported to increase the accuracy of diagnosis of most lymphoma sub-types. In dogs, FC can add a number of useful diagnostic features to the morphological evaluation of lymphoma including the evaluation of B or T cell lineage, antigen quantification and evaluation of aberrant patterns, the assessment of clonality, staging and the evaluation of minimal residual disease. In comparison to other immunophenotyping techniques, FC is rapid and easy to perform and 'gating' techniques can resolve mixed cell populations although the use of fresh samples is required and the appropriate equipment and its maintenance are quite expensive. The use of FC to refine cytological diagnosis could be further enhanced by the use of a multi-parametric approach and by the development of a wider panel of standardised canine-specific antibodies.","['Comazzi, S', 'Gelain, M E']","['Comazzi S', 'Gelain ME']","['Department of Veterinary Pathology, University of Milan, Via Celoria 10, Milan, Italy. stefano.comazzi@unimi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Vet J,"Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)",9706281,,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Dog Diseases/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Dogs', 'Flow Cytometry/methods/*veterinary', 'Immunophenotyping/methods/veterinary', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/immunology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/immunology/pathology/*veterinary', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology']",,2010/04/24 06:00,2011/06/16 06:00,['2010/04/24 06:00'],"['2009/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1090-0233(10)00094-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tvjl.2010.03.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet J. 2011 May;188(2):149-55. doi: 10.1016/j.tvjl.2010.03.011.

Consistent with the notion of concordance of arterial and HSC programs, we show that Tel1/ETV6 is also required for the specification of the DA as an artery. We further show that Tel1/ETV6 acts by regulating the transcription of VegfA in both the lateral plate mesoderm and also in the somites. Exogenous VEGFA rescues Tel1/ETV6 morphants, and depletion of VEGFA or its receptor, Flk1, largely phenocopies Tel1/ETV6 depletion.

Although the viral Tax protein is involved in the proliferation of infected cells during the preleukemic stages, Tax expression is not systematically detected in primary leukemic cells. In 2002, we described the characterization of a novel viral protein that we have termed HBZ for HTLV-1 bZIP factor. This viral factor is encoded on the antisense strand of HTLV-1 proviral DNA, demonstrating the existence of antisense transcription from a promoter located in the 3' LTR. HBZ can negatively control the expression of the other viral proteins by blocking the interaction between Tax and ATF/CREB factors and the recruitment of CBP/p300 by Tax on the promoter. Moreover, recent studies found that the viral HBZ gene was always expressed in leukemic cells, suggesting its involvement in the progression of the infected cells towards malignancy.","['Duc Dodon, Madeleine', 'Mesnard, Jean-Michel', 'Barbeau, Benoit']","['Duc Dodon M', 'Mesnard JM', 'Barbeau B']","['virologie humaine, Inserm U758, 69364, Lyon Cedex 07, France.']",['fre'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Med Sci (Paris),Medecine sciences : M/S,8710980,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factors)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (CREB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*genetics', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leucine Zippers/genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/immunology/*virology', 'Models, Genetic', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Rabbits', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/metabolism']",31,2010/04/24 06:00,2010/06/25 06:00,['2010/04/24 06:00'],"['2010/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [medline]']","['00/00/0F/3F/ [pii]', '10.1051/medsci/2010264391 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Sci (Paris). 2010 Apr;26(4):391-6. doi: 10.1051/medsci/2010264391.,,,,,,,,,,,Leucemies T induites par HTLV-1 : y a-t-il un avant et un apres HBZ ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The network approach was used to evaluate and compare individual biomarkers and quantitatively link the biomarkers along the exposure-disease continuum. The network was used to perform the biomarker-based dose-response analysis, and various other approaches to the dose-response analysis were conducted for comparison. The network-derived benchmark concentration was approximately an order of magnitude lower than that from the usual exposure concentration versus response approach, which suggests that the presence of more information in the low-dose region (where changes in biomarkers are detectable but effects on AML mortality are not) helps inform the description of the AML response at lower exposures. This work provides a quantitative approach for linking changes in biomarkers of effect both to exposure information and to changes in disease response. Such linkage can provide a scientifically valid point of departure that incorporates precursor dose-response information without being dependent on the difficult issue of a definition of adversity for precursors.","['Hack, C Eric', 'Haber, Lynne T', 'Maier, Andrew', 'Shulte, Paul', 'Fowler, Bruce', 'Lotz, W Gregory', 'Savage, Russell E Jr']","['Hack CE', 'Haber LT', 'Maier A', 'Shulte P', 'Fowler B', 'Lotz WG', 'Savage RE Jr']","['Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment (TERA), Cincinnati, OH, USA. charles.hack@wpafb.af.mil']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Risk Anal,Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,8109978,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Biomarkers)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants/toxicity', '*Bayes Theorem', 'Benzene/*administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Biomarkers/*analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Risk Assessment/*statistics & numerical data']",,2010/04/24 06:00,2010/11/06 06:00,['2010/04/24 06:00'],"['2010/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['RISK1413 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1539-6924.2010.01413.x [doi]']",ppublish,Risk Anal. 2010 Jul;30(7):1037-51. doi: 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2010.01413.x.

Quantification of WT gene expression in bone marrow (BM) samples may be useful as a marker of minimal residual disease (MRD) during and after treatment for early prediction of relapse. We evaluated the validity of this AML-MRD marker after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). The quantitative assessment of WT1 expression by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) was measured in 25 patients (pts) with AML at diagnosis, at the time of RIC-SCT and after transplant at precise time points. All pts showed high WT1 levels at diagnosis with a mean of 4895 (SD 4462) and a median of 3679 (range 454-16,853) copies WT1/10(4) ABL. At transplant, 18/25 pts (72%) were in complete cytologic remission (CcR) and 7/25 (28%) had refractory AML. At the pre-SCT evaluation, BM samples from pts transplanted in CcR showed significantly lower WT1 expression levels compared to the samples from pts with refractory AML (p = 0.002). Median follow-up after RIC-SCT was 18 months (range 2-54). On 18 pts transplanted in CcR, those (17/18) who maintained CcR after RIC-SCT displayed a WT1 copy number persistently low during all the follow-up period. In patients who received RIC-SCT with active disease obtaining a sustained CcR after transplant (3/25), WT1 levels decreased to normal range in the first two months after RIC-SCT and remained low through the entire study period. All pts who relapsed after RIC-SCT (4/25) had a high WT1 copy number before the cytologic relapse. In 50% of these cases, an increase in WT1 expression was documented before molecular chimerism decreasing. With this experience, taking into account the limited number of pts, we confirmed a concordance between WT1 expression levels (measured by RQ-PCR at precise and sequential time points) and status of AML before and after RIC-SCT and we found a concordance between WT1 expression levels and hematopoietic chimerism status. Our data suggest that, in the RIC-SCT setting, the sequential and quantitative analysis of WT1 may be useful as a leukemia marker for monitoring MRD and as a predictor of overt AML cytologic relapse.","['Candoni, Anna', 'Toffoletti, Eleonora', 'Gallina, Roberto', 'Simeone, Erica', 'Chiozzotto, Marianna', 'Volpetti, Stefano', 'Fanin, Renato']","['Candoni A', 'Toffoletti E', 'Gallina R', 'Simeone E', 'Chiozzotto M', 'Volpetti S', 'Fanin R']","['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medical and Morphologic Research, University of Udine, Udine, Italy. candoni.anna@aoud.sanita.fvg.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Clin Transplant,Clinical transplantation,8710240,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/surgery', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/*genetics/surgery', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,2010/04/24 06:00,2011/08/17 06:00,['2010/04/24 06:00'],"['2010/04/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['CTR1251 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1399-0012.2010.01251.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Transplant. 2011 Mar-Apr;25(2):308-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0012.2010.01251.x.,,,,,,,,,,['(c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we reported that human Lf induces apoptosis via a c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK)-associated Bcl-2 pathway that stimulates programmed cell death. In order to gain insight into the mechanism underlying Lf-triggered apoptotic features, we attempted to determine the mechanisms whereby the Lf-induced Bcl-2 family proteins exert their pro- or anti-apoptotic effects in Jurkat leukemia T lymphocytes. Treatment of the cells with high concentrations of Lf resulted in a significant reduction in in vitro growth and cell viability. As the levels of Lf increased, greater quantities of CDK6 and hyper-phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein were produced, resulting in the induction of E2F1-dependent apoptosis. Simultaneously, PARP and caspases were efficiently cleaved during Lf-induced apoptosis. The E2F1-induced apoptotic process occurred preferentially in p53-deficient Jurkat leukemia cells. Therefore, we attempted to determine whether E2F1-regulated Bcl-2 family proteins involved in the apoptotic process were relevant to Lf-induced apoptosis. We found that Lf increased the interaction of Bcl-2 with the pro-apoptotic protein Bad, whereas the total protein levels did not change significantly. Our results, collectively, suggest that Lf exploits the control mechanism of E2F1-regulated target genes or Bcl-2 family gene networks involved in the apoptotic process in Jurkat human leukemia T lymphocytes.","['Lee, Shin-Hee', 'Hwang, Hye-Min', 'Pyo, Chul-Woong', 'Hahm, Dae Hyun', 'Choi, Sang-Yun']","['Lee SH', 'Hwang HM', 'Pyo CW', 'Hahm DH', 'Choi SY']","['School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, 5 Anam-dong, Sungbuk-gu, Seoul 136-701, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biometals,"Biometals : an international journal on the role of metal ions in biology, biochemistry, and medicine",9208478,"['0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lactoferrin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2010/04/23 06:00,2010/10/22 06:00,['2010/04/23 06:00'],"['2010/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10534-010-9341-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Biometals. 2010 Jun;23(3):507-14. doi: 10.1007/s10534-010-9341-1.

This review summarizes the research on exercise interventions in adult and pediatric hematological cancer survivors. We searched MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane and PEDro through September 2009 for exercise intervention studies in children and adults with any type of hematological cancer. In the 24 adult intervention studies reviewed, we found strong evidence (that is, > or =3 high-quality studies and > or =75% reporting a significant benefit) for a benefit on body composition. Weak, but promising, evidence (> or =3 high-quality studies, but <75% reporting a significant benefit) was found for cardiorespiratory fitness, fatigue, muscle strength, physical functioning and quality of life. In pediatric interventions (13 studies), we found strong evidence for a benefit on muscle strength and cardiorespiratory fitness, particularly, if training was conducted in the hospital setting. Evidence is weak for ankle dorsiflexion, physical functioning and body composition. No exercise-related risks were identified in adults or children studies. Though more randomized controlled trials are needed, a growing body of literature supports the notion that regular physical activity is safe and has potential benefits for both adult and pediatric hematological cancer survivors.","['Wolin, K Y', 'Ruiz, J R', 'Tuchman, H', 'Lucia, A']","['Wolin KY', 'Ruiz JR', 'Tuchman H', 'Lucia A']","['Department of Surgery, Washington University in School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63130, USA. wolink@wustl.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', '*Exercise', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*rehabilitation', 'Humans', 'Quality of Life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survivors']",76,2010/04/23 06:00,2010/07/07 06:00,['2010/04/23 06:00'],"['2010/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201054 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.54 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Jun;24(6):1113-20. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.54.

Low-risk MGUS is characterized by having an M protein <15 g/l, IgG type and a normal free light chain (FLC) ratio. Patients should be followed with serum protein electrophoresis at six months and, if stable, can be followed every 2-3 years or when symptoms suggestive of a plasma cell malignancy arise.

The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was significantly increased by albanol A treatment. Furthermore, albanol A induced caspase-2 activation. These results suggested that albanol A induces apoptotic cell death in HL60 via both the cell death receptor pathway by stimulation of death receptor, and the mitochondrial pathway by Topo II inhibition through caspase-2 activation.

SUMMARY: Bendamustine is an alkylating agent that has a unique, multifaceted mechanism of action. Compared with other alkylators, bendamustine produces more-extensive and long-lasting DNA damage. Bendamustine also inhibits cell-cycle checkpoints, leading to mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis. Bendamustine is approved for the treatment of CLL and for indolent B-cell NHL that has progressed during or within 6 months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-based regimen. In Phase II and III trials in patients with indolent NHL and CLL, bendamustine has demonstrated response rates of 67-84% as a single agent and median durations of response of 7-21 months. Additional clinical trials are examining bendamustine as a single agent and in combination therapy for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Adverse events associated with bendamustine are typically mild to moderate and can usually be managed with supportive care. Myelosuppression is the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse event. Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported to occur in some patients, and preventive measures should be taken in at-risk patients. The dosage and administration differ for the treatment of NHL and CLL. CONCLUSION: Bendamustine is a well- tolerated and effective chemotherapeutic agent indicated for the treatment of rituximab-refractory, indolent NHL and CLL. It has demonstrated efficacy in patients whose disease is refractory to other therapies, including other alkylating agents.","['Elefante, Anjana', 'Czuczman, Myron S']","['Elefante A', 'Czuczman MS']","['Department of Pharmacy, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. angie.elefante@roswellpark.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",45,2010/04/23 06:00,2010/07/30 06:00,['2010/04/23 06:00'],"['2010/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['67/9/713 [pii]', '10.2146/ajhp090328 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2010 May 1;67(9):713-23. doi: 10.2146/ajhp090328.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retinoic acid (RA) has been linked to stem cell self-renewal in adults and also participates in yolk sac blood island formation. Here, we demonstrate that RA decreases gata1 expression and blocks primitive hematopoiesis in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos, while increasing expression of the vascular marker, fli1. Treatment with an inhibitor of RA biosynthesis or a retinoic acid receptor antagonist increases gata1(+) erythroid progenitors in the posterior mesoderm of wild-type embryos and anemic cdx4(-/-) mutants, indicating a link between the cdx-hox signaling pathway and RA. Overexpression of scl, a DNA binding protein necessary for hematopoietic development, rescues the block of hematopoiesis induced by RA. We show that these effects of RA and RA pathway inhibitors are conserved during primitive hematopoiesis in murine yolk sac explant cultures and embryonic stem cell assays. Taken together, these data indicate that RA inhibits the commitment of mesodermal cells to hematopoietic fates, functioning downstream of cdx4 and upstream of scl. Our studies establish a new connection between RA and scl during development that may participate in stem cell self-renewal and hematopoietic differentiation.","['de Jong, Jill L O', 'Davidson, Alan J', 'Wang, Yuan', 'Palis, James', 'Opara, Praise', 'Pugach, Emily', 'Daley, George Q', 'Zon, Leonard I']","['de Jong JL', 'Davidson AJ', 'Wang Y', 'Palis J', 'Opara P', 'Pugach E', 'Daley GQ', 'Zon LI']","[""Stem Cell Program and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (gata1a protein, zebrafish)', '0 (tal1 protein, zebrafish)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism', 'Zebrafish/embryology/*physiology', 'Zebrafish Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",,2010/04/23 06:00,2010/08/13 06:00,['2010/04/23 06:00'],"['2010/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)30082-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-10-249557 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jul 15;116(2):201-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-10-249557.

Tribbles proteins function as adapters to recruit E3 ubiquitin ligases and enhance ubiquitylation of the target protein to promote its degradation. Increased Trib1 and Trib2 mRNA expression occurs in human myeloid leukemia and induces acute myeloid leukemia in mice, whereas Trib3 has not been associated with leukemia. Given the high degree of structural conservation among Tribbles family members, we directly compared the 3 mammalian Tribbles in hematopoietic cells by reconstituting mice with hematopoietic stem cells retrovirally expressing these proteins. All mice receiving Trib1 or Trib2 transduced hematopoietic stem cells developed acute myeloid leukemia, whereas Trib3 mice did not. Our previous data indicated that Trib2-mediated degradation of the transcription factor, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBPalpha), is important for leukemogenesis. Similar to Trib2, Trib1 induced C/EBPalpha degradation and inhibited its function. In contrast, Trib3 failed to inactivate or promote efficient degradation of C/EBPalpha. These data reveal that the 3 Tribbles homologs differ in their ability to promote degradation of C/EBPalpha, which account for their differential ability to induce leukemia.","['Dedhia, Priya H', 'Keeshan, Karen', 'Uljon, Sacha', 'Xu, Lanwei', 'Vega, Maria E', 'Shestova, Olga', 'Zaks-Zilberman, Meirav', 'Romany, Candice', 'Blacklow, Stephen C', 'Pear, Warren S']","['Dedhia PH', 'Keeshan K', 'Uljon S', 'Xu L', 'Vega ME', 'Shestova O', 'Zaks-Zilberman M', 'Romany C', 'Blacklow SC', 'Pear WS']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Institute for Medicine & Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trib1 protein, mouse)', '0 (tribbles 2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2010/04/23 06:00,2010/10/01 06:00,['2010/04/23 06:00'],"['2010/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34587-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-07-229450 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Aug 26;116(8):1321-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-07-229450.

To decipher transcriptional networks in T-cell development and differentiation we developed a browsable expression atlas and applied a novel quantitative method to define gene sets most specific to each of the represented cell subsets and tissues. Using this system, body atlas size datasets can be used to examine gene enrichment profiles from a cell/tissue perspective rather than gene perspective, thereby identifying highly enriched genes within a cell type, which are often key to cellular differentiation and function. A systems analysis of transcriptional regulators within T cells during different phases of development and differentiation resulted in the identification of known key regulators and uncharacterized coexpressed regulators. ZBTB25, a BTB-POZ family transcription factor, was identified as a highly T cell-enriched transcription factor. We provide evidence that ZBTB25 functions as a negative regulator of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) activation, such that RNA interference mediated knockdown resulted in enhanced activation of target genes. Together, these findings suggest a novel mechanism for NF-AT mediated gene expression and the compendium of expression data provides a quantitative platform to drive exploration of gene expression across a wide range of cell/tissue types.","['Benita, Yair', 'Cao, Zhifang', 'Giallourakis, Cosmas', 'Li, Chun', 'Gardet, Agnes', 'Xavier, Ramnik J']","['Benita Y', 'Cao Z', 'Giallourakis C', 'Li C', 'Gardet A', 'Xavier RJ']","['Center for Computational and Integrative Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, 185 Cambridge St., Boston, MA 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '137951-89-4 (ZBTB25 protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism']",,2010/04/23 06:00,2010/08/03 06:00,['2010/04/23 06:00'],"['2010/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58386-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-01-263855 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jul 1;115(26):5376-84. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-01-263855.

However, this application is limited in mouse models by the low efficiency of lentiviral vectors. To facilitate the rapid production of high-titre helper-free retroviral vectors for enhanced gene delivery, multiple modifications to a prototype moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-derived vector system were made including adaptation of the vector system to simian virus 40 ori/T antigen-mediated episomal replication in packaging cells, replacement of the MoMLV 5' U3 promoter with a series of stronger composite promoters and addition of an extra polyadenylation signal downstream of the 3' long terminal repeat. These modifications enhanced vector production by 2-3 logs. High-titre vector stocks were tested for their ability to infect a variety of cells derived from humans and mice, including primary monocyte-derived macrophage cultures. Whilst the lentiviral vector was significantly restricted at the integration level, the MoMLV-based vector showed effective gene transduction of mouse cells. This high-titre retroviral vector system represents a useful tool for efficient gene delivery into human and mouse haematopoietic and lymphocytic cells, with particular application in mice as a small animal model for novel gene therapy tests.","['Wu, Chengxiang', 'Lu, Yuanan']","['Wu C', 'Lu Y']","['Departments of Public Health Sciences and Microbiology, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822, USA.', 'Departments of Public Health Sciences and Microbiology, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Macrophages/*virology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Replication Origin', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Virus Assembly', 'Virus Replication']",,2010/04/23 06:00,2010/08/07 06:00,['2010/04/23 06:00'],"['2010/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1099/vir.0.020255-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2010 Aug;91(Pt 8):1909-1918. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.020255-0.

Urisman et al., PLoS Pathog. 2:e25, 2006). While that study showed evidence of XMRV infection exclusively in the prostatic stromal fibroblasts, a recent study found XMRV protein antigens mainly in malignant prostate epithelial cells (R. Schlaberg et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 106:16351-16356, 2009). To help elucidate the mechanisms behind XMRV infection, we show that prostatic fibroblast cells express Xpr1, a known receptor of XMRV, but its expression is absent in other cell lines of the prostate (i.e., epithelial and stromal smooth muscle cells). We also show that certain amino acid residues located within the predicted extracellular loop (ECL3 and ECL4) sequences of Xpr1 are required for efficient XMRV entry. Although we found strong evidence to support XMRV infection of prostatic fibroblast cell lines via Xpr1, we learned that XMRV was indeed capable of infecting cells that did not necessarily express Xpr1, such as those of the prostatic epithelial and smooth muscle origins. Further studies suggest that the expression of Xpr1 and certain genotypes of the RNASEL gene, which could restrict XMRV infection, may play important roles in defining XMRV tropisms in certain cell types. Collectively, our data reveal important cellular determinants required for XMRV entry into different human prostate cells in vitro, which may provide important insights into the possible role of XMRV as an etiologic agent in human prostate cancer.","['Bhosle, Sushma', 'Suppiah, Suganthi', 'Molinaro, Ross', 'Liang, Yuying', 'Arnold, Rebecca', 'Diehl, William', 'Makarova, Natalia', 'Blackwell, Jerry', 'Petros, John', 'Liotta, Dennis', 'Hunter, Eric', 'Ly, Hinh']","['Bhosle S', 'Suppiah S', 'Molinaro R', 'Liang Y', 'Arnold R', 'Diehl W', 'Makarova N', 'Blackwell J', 'Petros J', 'Liotta D', 'Hunter E', 'Ly H']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (XPR1 protein, human)', '0 (Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.26.- (2-5A-dependent ribonuclease)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endoribonucleases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/virology', 'Fibroblasts/virology', 'Gammaretrovirus/*physiology', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Male', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/virology', 'Prostate/*virology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*virology', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Tropism', '*Virus Internalization', 'Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor']",,2010/04/23 06:00,2010/06/30 06:00,['2010/04/23 06:00'],"['2010/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00274-10 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00274-10 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Jul;84(13):6288-96. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00274-10.

DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the mRNA levels of the KIR3DL1 inhibitory and the related KIR3DS1 activating receptors in 15 patients with natural killer cell-type lymphoproliferative disease of granular lymphocytes and in ten controls. These genes are usually expressed when present in the genome of the Caucasian population. RESULTS: We demonstrated the complete lack of KIR3DL1 expression in most of the patients analyzed, with the receptor being expressed in 13% of patients compared to in 90% of controls (P<0.01). Interestingly, studies of the methylation patterns of KIR3DL1 promoter showed a significantly higher methylation status (0.76 +/- 0.12 SD) in patients than in healthy subjects (0.49+/-0.10 SD, P<0.01). The levels of expression of DNA methyl transferases, which are the enzymes responsible for DNA methylation, did not differ between patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we showed, for the first time, a consistent down-regulation of the inhibitory KIR3DL1 signal due to marked methylation of its promoter, thus suggesting that together with the increased expression of activating receptors, the lack of the inhibitory signal could also play a role in the pathogenesis of natural killer cell-type lymphoproliferative disease of granular lymphocytes.","['Gattazzo, Cristina', 'Teramo, Antonella', 'Miorin, Marta', 'Scquizzato, Elisa', 'Cabrelle, Anna', 'Balsamo, Mirna', 'Agostini, Carlo', 'Vendrame, Elena', 'Facco, Monica', 'Albergoni, Maria Paola', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Vitale, Massimo', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Zambello, Renato']","['Gattazzo C', 'Teramo A', 'Miorin M', 'Scquizzato E', 'Cabrelle A', 'Balsamo M', 'Agostini C', 'Vendrame E', 'Facco M', 'Albergoni MP', 'Trentin L', 'Vitale M', 'Semenzato G', 'Zambello R']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Padova, via Giustiniani 2, Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, KIR3DL1)', '0 (Receptors, KIR3DS1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Methylation', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, KIR3DL1/*deficiency/genetics', 'Receptors, KIR3DS1/genetics']",,2010/04/23 06:00,2011/02/24 06:00,['2010/04/23 06:00'],"['2010/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.023358 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.023358 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Oct;95(10):1722-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.023358.

Comparisons of these rates with those from the developing countries are rare, but important in evaluating international cancer care discrepancies. This study aimed to provide up-to-date estimates of cancer survival in a Philippine urban population, and to compare these with those observed in the European countries. METHODS: Using the results from the EUROCARE-4 study, the survival estimates of the European patients who were diagnosed in 1995-99 and followed till December 2003 were abstracted. From randomly selected samples drawn from the Manila and Rizal Cancer Registries, 5-year survival was estimated for nine common cancers. Age-adjusted survival estimates were then compared between the Philippine population and Europeans. RESULTS: In comparison to the European mean, survival estimates for the Philippine residents were lower for most cancers, with differences ranging from 2 to 40% units. Differences with European country-specific estimates were large for cancers of the breast and cervix, where early detection is possible, and for leukaemia, where treatment regimens are costly, highlighting the importance of health care. Smaller discrepancies were observed for stomach, liver and lung cancers, with the 5-year relative survival being similar to the Philippines and to many European countries. A survival advantage was seen though for the Philippine residents for ovarian cancer. CONCLUSION: Apart from efforts to prevent cancers, improvements in cancer control and making early diagnosis and treatment more accessible remain major challenges, both in the Philippines and in the European nations.","['Redaniel, Maria Theresa', 'Laudico, Adriano', 'Mirasol-Lumague, Maria Rica', 'Gondos, Adam', 'Brenner, Hermann']","['Redaniel MT', 'Laudico A', 'Mirasol-Lumague MR', 'Gondos A', 'Brenner H']","['Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Aging Research, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Public Health,European journal of public health,9204966,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cross-Cultural Comparison', 'Developed Countries/statistics & numerical data', 'Developing Countries/statistics & numerical data', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Philippines/epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Survival Rate', 'Urban Population/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",,2010/04/23 06:00,2011/07/22 06:00,['2010/04/23 06:00'],"['2010/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['ckq031 [pii]', '10.1093/eurpub/ckq031 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Public Health. 2011 Apr;21(2):221-8. doi: 10.1093/eurpub/ckq031.

However, the value of prophylaxis has been questioned in centres with a low incidence of invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) and pre-emptive treatment strategies. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the epidemiology of IFDs in acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) patients undergoing first remission-induction chemotherapy before and after posaconazole prophylaxis had been introduced as a standard of care. Patients admitted from January 2003 to December 2005 received topical polyenes as antifungal prophylaxis (first group), while those admitted between January 2006 and December 2008 received 200 mg of oral posaconazole three times daily (second group). Other diagnostic and therapeutic standard operating procedures remained unchanged. RESULTS: A total of 82 patients in the polyene prophylaxis group and 77 in the posaconazole prophylaxis group were included in the final analysis. Baseline characteristics were well matched between groups. Patients receiving topical polyene prophylaxis were more likely to experience breakthrough IFDs (19.5% and 3.9%; P = 0.003) or breakthrough aspergillosis (13.4% and 2.6%; P = 0.018) than patients receiving systemic posaconazole prophylaxis. They also had more febrile days (mean 10.7 +/- 9.66 and 7.3 +/- 5.73; P = 0.007), longer need for inpatient treatment (mean 53.0 +/- 24.16 and 46.0 +/- 14.39; P = 0.026) and a shorter fungal-free survival (78.7 and 90.4 days; P = 0.024). No significant differences were observed for persistent fever, pneumonia, lung infiltrates indicative of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, or attributable and overall mortality. CONCLUSIONS: After introduction of posaconazole prophylaxis for patients with AML, the number of febrile days, the incidence rate of IFDs and aspergillosis and the duration of hospitalization decreased significantly.","['Vehreschild, J J', 'Ruping, M J G T', 'Wisplinghoff, H', 'Farowski, F', 'Steinbach, A', 'Sims, R', 'Stollorz, A', 'Kreuzer, K-A', 'Hallek, M', 'Bangard, C', 'Cornely, O A']","['Vehreschild JJ', 'Ruping MJ', 'Wisplinghoff H', 'Farowski F', 'Steinbach A', 'Sims R', 'Stollorz A', 'Kreuzer KA', 'Hallek M', 'Bangard C', 'Cornely OA']","['Klinik I fur Innere Medizin, Klinikum der Universitat zu Koln, Koln, Germany. janne.vehreschild@ctuc.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Antimicrob Chemother,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,7513617,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Polyenes)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Chemoprevention/*methods', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Polyenes/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",,2010/04/23 06:00,2010/09/18 06:00,['2010/04/23 06:00'],"['2010/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['dkq121 [pii]', '10.1093/jac/dkq121 [doi]']",ppublish,J Antimicrob Chemother. 2010 Jul;65(7):1466-71. doi: 10.1093/jac/dkq121.

We report here a patient first diagnosed with Fanconi anemia at age 10. Bone marrow transplantation was performed at age 23 and repeated after an episode of rejection at age 25. Hematologic findings returned to normal, but chronic graft-versus-host disease persisted. Esophageal cancer developed at age 35. Invasion of the bronchus and aorta by the tumor was suspected on computed tomography. Chemoradiotherapy was administered to down-stage the tumor, using low-dose cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. After two courses of chemotherapy with cisplatin (total dose, 100 mg) and 5-fluorouracil (5000 mg) plus radiotherapy (30 Gy), Grade 3 diarrhea and bone marrow suppression developed, and treatment was discontinued. After resolution of toxicity, a good response to the neoadjuvant therapy was seen on computed tomography scan, and a subtotal esophagectomy was performed which demonstrated a complete response in the resected specimen. However, tongue cancer developed at age 40 years, and hemiglossectomy was performed. Patients with Fanconi anemia have a high risk of developing esophageal cancer while they are still young. Reduced doses of alkylating agents and radiotherapy are used in patients with Fanconi anemia. However, the optimal dosage of chemoradiotherapy and the treatment strategy for esophageal cancer in patients with Fanconi anemia remain unclear, and outcomes are generally extremely poor. In this patient, esophageal cancer associated with Fanconi anemia responded well to multidisciplinary therapy.","['Hosoya, Yoshinori', 'Lefor, Alan', 'Hirashima, Yuki', 'Nokubi, Mitsuhiro', 'Yamaguti, Takehiko', 'Jinbu, Yoshinori', 'Muroi, Kazuo', 'Nakazawa, Masanori', 'Yasuda, Yoshikazu']","['Hosoya Y', 'Lefor A', 'Hirashima Y', 'Nokubi M', 'Yamaguti T', 'Jinbu Y', 'Muroi K', 'Nakazawa M', 'Yasuda Y']","['Department of Surgery, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Shimotsuke, Tochigi 329-0498, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,"['Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/diagnosis/etiology/pathology/*therapy', 'Child', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/diagnosis/etiology/pathology/*therapy', 'Esophagectomy', 'Fanconi Anemia/*complications/therapy', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Tongue Neoplasms/pathology/secondary']",,2010/04/23 06:00,2010/08/19 06:00,['2010/04/23 06:00'],"['2010/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['hyq049 [pii]', '10.1093/jjco/hyq049 [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 2010 Aug;40(8):805-10. doi: 10.1093/jjco/hyq049.

However, the long-term prognosis and independent prognostic effect of some abnormalities has been questioned. Also, little is known about the association between cytogenetics and the characteristics of relapse (eg, time and site of relapse) that are known to predict outcome after relapse. METHODS: We analysed cytogenetic data from 1725 children with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who were included in the UK Medical Research Council ALL97/99 study and followed up for a median time of 8.2 years. Univariate and multivariate analysis were done to examine risk of relapse, event-free survival, and overall survival associated with 21 chromosomal abnormalities and three cytogenetic risk groups constructed from these data. FINDINGS: Two chromosomal abnormalities were associated with a significantly better outcome (ETV6-RUNX1, hazard ratio [HR] 0.51, 95% CI 0.38-0.70 and high hyperdiploidy, 0.60, 0.47-0.78), whereas five abnormalities were associated with an increased risk of relapse (intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 [iAMP21], 6.04, 3.90-9.35; t(9;22), 3.55, 2.21-5.72; MLL translocations, 2.98, 1.71-5.20; abnormal 17p, 2.09, 1.30-3.37; and loss of 13q, 1.87, 1.09-3.20). Multivariate analysis incorporating age, white-cell count, and treatment parameters showed that six cytogenetic abnormalities (ETV6-RUNX1, high hyperdiploidy, iAMP21, t(9;22), loss of 13q, and abnormal 17p) retained their significance for effect on relapse risk. Based on these data, patients were classified into good, intermediate, and poor cytogenetic risk groups. Slow early treatment response correlated with cytogenetic risk group: 34 of 460 (7%) in the good-risk group, 22 of 211 (10%) in the intermediate-risk group, and 27 of 95 (28%) in the poor-risk group had a slow response (p<0.0001). Additionally, the proportion of patients with a very early (<18 months) relapse varied by cytogenetic risk group: eight of 129 (6%) patients in the good-risk group had a very early relapse, compared with 24 of 98 (24%) in the intermediate-risk group, and 37 of 82 (45%) in the poor-risk group (p<0.0001). However, there was no difference in the site of relapse by cytogenetic risk group. INTERPRETATION: Individual chromosomal abnormalities are strong independent indicators of outcome, especially risk of relapse. Diagnostic cytogenetics identifies patients with a higher rate of relapse and those who are likely to have a high-risk relapse.

Heterogeneity (I(2)=65%, P<0.0001) for C677T among the studies was extreme.

Although MTHFR C677T was associated with increased risks of colorectal cancer, leukemia, and gastric cancer, our pooled data suggest no evidence for a major role of MTHFR C677T in the carcinogenesis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Wang, Jing', 'Zhan, Ping', 'Chen, Bing', 'Zhou, Rongfu', 'Yang, Yonggong', 'Ouyang, Jian']","['Wang J', 'Zhan P', 'Chen B', 'Zhou R', 'Yang Y', 'Ouyang J']","['Department of Hematology, the Affiliated DrumTower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,['EC 1.5.1.5 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase (NADP))'],IM,"['Adolescent', '*Alleles', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics', 'Female', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase (NADP)/*genetics', '*Models, Biological', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Risk Factors', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics']",,2010/04/23 06:00,2010/12/22 06:00,['2010/04/23 06:00'],"['2010/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(10)00175-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2010.03.034 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Dec;34(12):1596-600. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2010.03.034.

However, a broad picture of the expression of CT antigens and associated humoral immune responses in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is still missing. METHODS: We screened CML cell lines and bone marrow (BM) samples from healthy donors by RT-PCR for the expression of 31 CT antigens before and after treatment with epigenetic agents. Expression of tumor-restricted antigens was further examined in 60 CML patients and humoral immune responses against 15 CT antigens were screened by ELISA. RESULTS: In untreated cell lines we detected the expression of 17 CT antigens that were absent from normal BM. Expression of most antigens increased following demethylating treatment with 5'-Aza-2'-Deoxycytidine. In these samples, only PRAME was repeatedly detected and expression correlated with several clinicopathological parameters and decreased overall survival. We further show that a lower frequency of PRAME-positive samples during imatinib treatment was not caused by gene-specific downregulation. Analyzing the patients' antibody responses we found that the vast majority of patients lacked spontaneous immunity against CT antigens including PRAME. CONCLUSIONS: CT antigen expression can be increased by the application of epigenetic agents and the expression of PRAME correlates with clinicopathological parameters and overall survival in patients with CML, but does not lead to humoral immune responses. PRAME-specific immunotherapy might represent a promising approach for the eradication of residual therapy-resistant leukemic cells due to its frequent expression and stability under imatinib treatment.","['Luetkens, Tim', 'Schafhausen, Phillipe', 'Uhlich, Frederike', 'Stasche, Tim', 'Akbulak, Ruken', 'Bartels, Britta M', 'Hildebrandt, York', 'Gontarewicz, Arthur', 'Kobold, Sebastian', 'Meyer, Sabrina', 'Gordic, Maja', 'Bartels, Katrin', 'Lajmi, Nesrine', 'Cao, Yanran', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Atanackovic, Djordje']","['Luetkens T', 'Schafhausen P', 'Uhlich F', 'Stasche T', 'Akbulak R', 'Bartels BM', 'Hildebrandt Y', 'Gontarewicz A', 'Kobold S', 'Meyer S', 'Gordic M', 'Bartels K', 'Lajmi N', 'Cao Y', 'Kroger N', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Atanackovic D']","['Department of Oncology and Hematology, Center of Oncology, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Decitabine', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/immunology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects/*immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunity, Humoral/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*immunology/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/immunology/metabolism', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use']",,2010/04/23 06:00,2010/12/22 06:00,['2010/04/23 06:00'],"['2010/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(10)00180-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2010.03.039 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Dec;34(12):1647-55. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2010.03.039.

Acetylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac) is generally associated with transcription initiation and unfolded chromatin, thereby positively influencing gene expression. Deep sequencing of the 5' ends of gene transcripts using DeepCAGE delivers detailed information about the architecture and expression level of gene promoters. The combination of H3K9ac ChIP-chip and DeepCAGE in a myeloid leukemia cell line (THP-1) allowed us to study the spatial distribution of H3K9ac around promoters using a novel clustering approach. The promoter classes were analyzed for association with relevant genomic sequence features. RESULTS: We performed a clustering of 4,481 promoters according to their surrounding H3K9ac signal and analyzed the clustered promoters for association with different sequence features. The clustering revealed three groups with major H3K9ac signal upstream, centered and downstream of the promoter. Narrow single peak promoters tend to have a concentrated activity of H3K9ac in the upstream region, while broad promoters tend to have a concentrated activity of H3K9ac and RNA polymerase II binding in the centered and downstream regions. A subset of promoters with high gene expression level, compared to subsets with low and medium gene expression, shows dramatic increase in H3K9ac activity in the upstream cluster only; this may indicate that promoters in the centered and downstream clusters are predominantly regulated at post-initiation steps. Furthermore, the upstream cluster is depleted in CpG islands and more likely to regulate un-annotated genes. CONCLUSIONS: Clustering core promoters according to their surrounding acetylation signal is a promising approach for the study of histone modifications. When examining promoters clustered into groups according to their surrounding H3K9 acetylation signal, we find that the relative localization and intensity of H3K9ac is very specific depending on characteristic sequence features of the promoter. Experimental data from DeepCAGE and ChIP-chip experiments using undifferentiated (monocyte) and differentiated (macrophage) THP-1 cells leads us to the same conclusions.","['Kratz, Anton', 'Arner, Erik', 'Saito, Rintaro', 'Kubosaki, Atsutaka', 'Kawai, Jun', 'Suzuki, Harukazu', 'Carninci, Piero', 'Arakawa, Takahiro', 'Tomita, Masaru', 'Hayashizaki, Yoshihide', 'Daub, Carsten O']","['Kratz A', 'Arner E', 'Saito R', 'Kubosaki A', 'Kawai J', 'Suzuki H', 'Carninci P', 'Arakawa T', 'Tomita M', 'Hayashizaki Y', 'Daub CO']","['Keiko University, Graduate School of Media and Governance, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Histones)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genome, Human', '*Histone Code', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysine/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism']",,2010/04/23 06:00,2010/07/02 06:00,['2010/04/23 06:00'],"['2009/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-11-257 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-11-257 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2010 Apr 21;11:257. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-11-257.,,,,20100421,PMC2867832,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have shown that a high percentage of healthy blood donors harbour Chlamydia DNA and antigens. The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of this microorganism among blood donors. Blood samples were collected between November 2004 and March 2005 from 196 healthy blood donors. Ten millilitre of blood was collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA) tube. Reverse transcription of RNA was performed with Moloney murine leukaemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase and random primers hexamer. Polymerase chain reaction products were evaluated by electrophoresis. Data were analysed using the chi(2) test and t-test. Of the 196 healthy blood donors, 7.1% were C. pneumoniae DNA positive (CI 95 % = 3.51- 10.69), which is slightly higher in female (8.5%) than male (6.5%) donors; this difference was not found to be significant (P = 0.4). The average age of study groups was 40.84 (SD +/- 10.80) years; significant association was not found between age groups and the presence of C. pneumoniae DNA. There was no significant differences between positive rate and first-time [37 (19.3%)] and repeat [155 (80.7%)] donors. C. pneumoniae DNA seems to be frequent in apparently healthy blood donors; therefore, it can be a threat for blood safety. But further studies are needed to evaluate the survival of C. pneumoniae in blood bank conditions and in blood recipients to define the clinical importance of such findings. Elimination of intracellular bacteria by filtration is an effective strategy for risk reduction.","['Karimi, Gh', 'Samiei, Sh', 'Hatami, H', 'Gharehbaghian, A', 'Vafaiyan, V', 'Namini, M Tabrizi']","['Karimi G', 'Samiei Sh', 'Hatami H', 'Gharehbaghian A', 'Vafaiyan V', 'Namini MT']","['Research Centre of Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Transfus Med,"Transfusion medicine (Oxford, England)",9301182,"['0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, Bacterial/blood', 'Blood Banks/*statistics & numerical data', '*Blood Donors', 'Carrier State/*blood/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Chlamydophila Infections/*blood/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Chlamydophila pneumoniae/genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'DNA, Bacterial/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Young Adult']",,2010/04/23 06:00,2010/10/23 06:00,['2010/04/23 06:00'],"['2010/04/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['TME1003 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-3148.2010.01003.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfus Med. 2010 Aug 1;20(4):237-43. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3148.2010.01003.x.

We examined cells of the oral mucosa (OM) and fibroblasts of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treated with dasatinib and bosutinib. Results were compared with data from patients with CML treated with imatinib or nilotinib and with data from patients suffering from renal and hepatocellular carcinomas (RCC/HCC) treated with sorafenib or sunitinib. Cells of healthy donors served as controls. RESULTS: OM cells (n = 12) and fibroblasts (n = 7) of patients with CML treated with dasatinib and OM cells of three patients with CML treated with bosutinib showed centrosomal alterations (mean, 14%) compared with 16 (10 OM and 6 fibroblasts) controls (mean, 3%). OM cells of five patients with CML and one patient with systemic mastocytosis treated with imatinib or nilotinib and of eight patients with RCC or HCC treated with sorafenib or sunitinib showed centrosome defects in a mean of 15%.

BALB/c mice were injected with 2E8 hybridoma cells to obtain 2E8 monoclonal antibody (mAb). NCTD-liposomes were prepared by using film dispersion method. 2E8 mAbs were linked to NCTD-liposomes using post-incorporation technology. Flow cytometry showed that the targeting efficiency of purified 2E8 mAbs on CD19(+) Nalm-6 cells was 99.93%. The purified 2E8 mAbs were conjugated with NCTD-liposomes to prepare 2E8-NCTD-liposomes whose targeting efficiency on CD19(+) Nalm-6 was also 95.82%. The average size of 2E8-NCTD-liposomes was 118.32 nm in diameter. HPLC showed that the encapsulation efficiency of NCTD was 46.51%. When the molar ratio of 2E8/Mal-PEG(2000)-DSPE reached 1:50, we obtained the liposomes with 9 2E8 molecules per liposome. The targeting efficiency of 2E8-NCTD-liposomes on CD19(+) leukemia cells was significantly higher than that on CD19-leukemia cells. Similarly, the targeting efficiency of the immunoliposomes was also higher than that of the NCTD-liposomes on CD19(+) leukemia cells. Those results were consistent with those observed by laser scanning confocal microscopy. 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay demonstrated that 2E8-NCTD-liposomes specifically killed Nalm-6 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The viability of Nalm-6 cells treated by 2E8-NCTD-liposomes was significantly lower than that of Molt-3 cells and it was also significantly lower than that of Nalm-6 cells treated with the same concentration of NCTD-liposomes or free NCTD. We are led to concluded that 2E8 antigen can serve as a specific targeting molecule of B lineage hematopoietic malignancies for liposome targeting, and 2E8-NCTD-liposomes can be used as a new and effective means for the treatment of B lineage hematopoietic malignancies.","['Zhang, Jingying', 'Tang, Yongmin', 'Qian, Baiqin', 'Sheng, Hongqiang']","['Zhang J', 'Tang Y', 'Qian B', 'Sheng H']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China. zhangjy423@gmail.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Eradicating the leukemia stem cells holds the promise of CML treatment. In this study, we found that the CD34+ subpopulation in the CML cell line K562 had a higher expression of SOD1 than that in the CD34 negative cells. Knockdown of SOD1 in CD34+ cells had no significant effects on cell survival and growth, while it sensitized the CD34+ cells to imatinib therapy. N-acetyl-L cysteine (NAC) blocked the pro-apoptotic effects of SOD1 knockdown, suggesting the antioxidant effects of SOD1 was essential for the resistance of CD34+ cells to imatinib therapy.

Previous measurements revealed that MF in apartments located above internal transformer stations (ITSs) are higher than in other apartments in the same building. An international epidemiologic study of childhood leukemia, TransExpo, was designed to take advantage of this scenario. This article presents the results of an exposure assessment study performed in apartment buildings with ITS in Israel. Measurements were performed in 41 apartments within 10 buildings. Average MF at the height of 0.5 m was 0.40 muT in apartments above the ITS and 0.06-0.12 muT in all other apartments. These results confirm that classification of MF exposure based on apartment location is feasible with remarkable specificity (0.98 and 0.96 for cutoff points of 0.2 and 0.4 muT, respectively) and sensitivity (1.00 for both cutoff points).

As such, imatinib has become the front-line treatment for CML patients. However, the recent emergence of imatinib resistance, commonly associated with point mutations within the kinase domain, has led to the search for alternative drug treatments and combination therapies for CML. METHODS: In this report, we analyse the effects of representative members of the novel pro-apoptotic microtubule depolymerising pyrrolo-1,5-benzoxazepines or PBOX compounds on chemotherapy-refractory CML cells using a series of Bcr-Abl mutant cell lines, clinical ex vivo patient samples and an in vivo mouse model. RESULTS: The PBOX compounds potently reduce cell viability in cells expressing the E225K and H396P mutants as well as the highly resistant T315I mutant. The PBOX compounds also induce apoptosis in primary CML samples including those resistant to imatinib. We also show for the first time, the in vivo efficacy of the pro-apoptotic PBOX compound, PBOX-6, in a CML mouse model of the T315I Bcr-Abl mutant. CONCLUSION: Results from this study highlight the potential of these novel series of PBOX compounds as an effective therapy against CML.","['Bright, S A', 'McElligott, A M', ""O'Connell, J W"", ""O'Connor, L"", 'Carroll, P', 'Campiani, G', 'Deininger, M W', 'Conneally, E', 'Lawler, M', 'Williams, D C', 'Zisterer, D M']","['Bright SA', 'McElligott AM', ""O'Connell JW"", ""O'Connor L"", 'Carroll P', 'Campiani G', 'Deininger MW', 'Conneally E', 'Lawler M', 'Williams DC', 'Zisterer DM']","['School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland. brights@tcd.ie']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oxazepines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', 'IN93MQ497D (PBOX-6)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Oxazepines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology']",,2010/04/22 06:00,2010/06/10 06:00,['2010/04/22 06:00'],"['2010/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/10 06:00 [medline]']","['6605670 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6605670 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2010 May 11;102(10):1474-82. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605670.

The objective was to identify novel markers of disease and to unravel the pathogenesis of AIP. METHODS: To explore key targets of the inflammatory process, we analyzed the expression of proteins at the RNA and protein level using genomics and proteomics, immunohistochemistry, western blot, and immunoassay. An animal model of AIP with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus-infected mice was studied in parallel. RNA microarrays of pancreatic tissue from 12 patients with AIP were compared with those of 8 patients with non-AIP chronic pancreatitis. RESULTS: Expression profiling showed 272 upregulated genes, including those encoding for immunoglobulins, chemokines and their receptors, and 86 downregulated genes, including those for pancreatic proteases such as three trypsinogen isoforms. Protein profiling showed that the expression of trypsinogens and other pancreatic enzymes was greatly reduced. Immunohistochemistry showed a near-loss of trypsin-positive acinar cells, which was also confirmed by western blotting. The serum of AIP patients contained high titers of autoantibodies against the trypsinogens PRSS1 and PRSS2 but not against PRSS3. In addition, there were autoantibodies against the trypsin inhibitor PSTI (the product of the SPINK1 gene). In the pancreas of AIP animals, we found similar protein patterns and a reduction in trypsinogen. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the immune-mediated process characterizing AIP involves pancreatic acinar cells and their secretory enzymes such as trypsin isoforms. Demonstration of trypsinogen autoantibodies may be helpful for the diagnosis of AIP.","['Lohr, J-Matthias', 'Faissner, Ralf', 'Koczan, Dirk', 'Bewerunge, Peter', 'Bassi, Claudio', 'Brors, Benedikt', 'Eils, Roland', 'Frulloni, Luca', 'Funk, Anette', 'Halangk, Walter', 'Jesenofsky, Ralf', 'Kaderali, Lars', 'Kleeff, Jorg', 'Kruger, Burkhard', 'Lerch, Markus M', 'Losel, Ralf', 'Magnani, Mauro', 'Neumaier, Michael', 'Nittka, Stephanie', 'Sahin-Toth, Miklos', 'Sanger, Julian', 'Serafini, Sonja', 'Schnolzer, Martina', 'Thierse, Hermann-Josef', 'Wandschneider, Silke', 'Zamboni, Giuseppe', 'Kloppel, Gunter']","['Lohr JM', 'Faissner R', 'Koczan D', 'Bewerunge P', 'Bassi C', 'Brors B', 'Eils R', 'Frulloni L', 'Funk A', 'Halangk W', 'Jesenofsky R', 'Kaderali L', 'Kleeff J', 'Kruger B', 'Lerch MM', 'Losel R', 'Magnani M', 'Neumaier M', 'Nittka S', 'Sahin-Toth M', 'Sanger J', 'Serafini S', 'Schnolzer M', 'Thierse HJ', 'Wandschneider S', 'Zamboni G', 'Kloppel G']","['Molecular Gastroenterology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany. matthias.lohr@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Gastroenterol,The American journal of gastroenterology,0421030,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Proteome)', '9002-08-8 (Trypsinogen)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Autoantibodies/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Autoimmune Diseases/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inflammation/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pancreas, Exocrine/*immunology/metabolism', 'Pancreatitis/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Proteome', 'Trypsinogen/blood']",,2010/04/22 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2010/04/22 06:00'],"['2010/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['ajg2010141 [pii]', '10.1038/ajg.2010.141 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Gastroenterol. 2010 Sep;105(9):2060-71. doi: 10.1038/ajg.2010.141.

The corticosteroid used in the pulses was that assigned at induction. Overall, 411 patients were randomly assigned: 202 initially randomly assigned to PRED (60 mg/m(2)/d), 201 to DEX (6 mg/m(2)/d), and 8 nonrandomly assigned to PRED.

Therefore, novel therapies that increase the efficacy of the treatments and that prolong T-ALL patient survival are needed. Malignant T cells require high concentrations of nutrients to sustain their increased rate of proliferation. In this study, we determined whether L-Arginine depletion by the pegylated form of the L-Arginine-metabolizing enzyme arginase I (peg-Arg I) impairs the proliferation of malignant T cells. Our results show that peg-Arg I depleted L-Arginine levels in vitro and in vivo. In addition, treatment of malignant T-cell lines with peg-Arg I significantly impaired their proliferation, which correlated with a decreased progression into the cell cycle, followed by the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, peg-Arg I impaired the expression of cyclin D3, a fundamental protein in T-ALL proliferation, through a global arrest in protein synthesis. Injection of peg-Arg I plus chemotherapy agent Cytarabine prolonged survival in mice bearing T-ALL tumors. This antitumoral effect correlated with an inhibition of T-ALL proliferation in vivo, a decreased expression of cyclin D3, and T-ALL apoptosis. The results suggest the potential benefit of L-Arginine depletion by peg-Arg I in the treatment of T-cell malignancies.","['Hernandez, Claudia P', 'Morrow, Kevin', 'Lopez-Barcons, Lluis A', 'Zabaleta, Jovanny', 'Sierra, Rosa', 'Velasco, Cruz', 'Cole, John', 'Rodriguez, Paulo C']","['Hernandez CP', 'Morrow K', 'Lopez-Barcons LA', 'Zabaleta J', 'Sierra R', 'Velasco C', 'Cole J', 'Rodriguez PC']","['Tumor Immunology Program, Stanley S.

Inhibition of the ABL kinase alone is not sufficient to eradicate leukemic stem cells (LSCs). We have previously shown that the deficiency of Rac2 GTPase signaling, but not Rac1, in p210-BCR-ABL-transduced hematopoietic cells prolonged survival of mice with MPD. Here we demonstrate that absence of Rac2 GTPase prolongs survival of HSC-initiated, inducible Scl/p210-BCR-ABL (Scl/p210) binary transgenic mice, it induces apoptosis, and, unlike in normal HSC and progenitor (HSC/P), impairs LSC and progenitor (LSC/P) proliferation in vivo. As a result, Rac2 deficiency causes functional exhaustion of the LSC pool in vivo. This defect is not due to impaired interaction with the hematopoietic microenvironment as reflected by its unaltered adhesion, migration, and homing to recipient organs. In summary, Rac2 deficiency exhausts the LSC pool in vivo through impairment of oncogene-induced proliferation and survival signals.","['Sengupta, Amitava', 'Arnett, Jorden', 'Dunn, Susan', 'Williams, David A', 'Cancelas, Jose A']","['Sengupta A', 'Arnett J', 'Dunn S', 'Williams DA', 'Cancelas JA']","[""Stem Cell Biology Program, Division of Experimental Hematology & Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, OH;""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (rac2 GTP-binding protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins/*deficiency/genetics']",,2010/04/22 06:00,2010/08/25 06:00,['2010/04/22 06:00'],"['2010/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34763-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-10-247437 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jul 8;116(1):81-4. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-10-247437.

Here, we identify microRNAs that are differentially expressed in LSC-enriched cell fractions (c-kit(+)) in a mouse model of MLL leukemia. Members of the miR-17 family were notably more abundant in LSCs compared with their normal counterpart granulocyte-macrophage progenitors and myeloblast precursors. Expression of miR-17 family microRNAs was substantially reduced concomitant with leukemia cell differentiation and loss of self-renewal, whereas forced expression of a polycistron construct encoding miR-17-19b miRNAs significantly shortened the latency for MLL leukemia development. Leukemias expressing increased levels of the miR-17-19b construct displayed a higher frequency of LSCs, more stringent block of differentiation, and enhanced proliferation associated with reduced expression of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor previously implicated as a direct target of miR-17 microRNAs. Knockdown of p21 in MLL-transformed cells phenocopied the overexpression of the miR-17 polycistron, including a significant decrease in leukemia latency, validating p21 as a biologically relevant and direct in vivo target of the miR-17 polycistron in MLL leukemia. Expression of c-myc, a crucial upstream regulator of the miR-17 polycistron, correlated with miR-17-92 levels, enhanced self-renewal, and LSC potential. Thus, microRNAs quantitatively regulate LSC self-renewal in MLL-associated leukemia in part by modulating the expression of p21, a known regulator of normal stem cell function.","['Wong, Piu', 'Iwasaki, Masayuki', 'Somervaille, Tim C P', 'Ficara, Francesca', 'Carico, Christine', 'Arnold, Christopher', 'Chen, Chang-Zheng', 'Cleary, Michael L']","['Wong P', 'Iwasaki M', 'Somervaille TC', 'Ficara F', 'Carico C', 'Arnold C', 'Chen CZ', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology and Microbiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305-5324, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn17 microRNA, mouse)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genes', 'Genes, myc', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2010/04/22 06:00,2010/05/28 06:00,['2010/04/22 06:00'],"['2010/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-3268 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-3268 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 May 1;70(9):3833-42. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-3268.

Mutations of p53 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are rare but resistance to chemotherapy has been reported because of the deregulation of the p53 signaling and differentiation pathways. It is known that the interaction of the vitamin D metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D) with its functional vitamin D receptor leads to differentiation, G(1) arrest, and increased cell survival in p53-null AML cells. However, there are no reports on the effect of 1,25D in leukemia cells expressing wild-type p53. Here, we examine vitamin D signaling in AML cells MOLM-13 and OCI-AML3 expressing wild-type p53 in the presence and absence of the MDM2 antagonist nutlin-3. We find that 1,25D alone induces monocytic differentiation in these cell lines similar to that seen in p53-null AML cells, suggesting that the presence of wild-type p53 is compatible with activation of vitamin D signaling. Combination of nutlin-3a with 1,25D accelerated programmed cell death, likely because of enhanced nutlin-induced upregulation of the proapoptotic PIG-6 protein and downregulation of antiapoptotic BCL-2, MDMX, human kinase suppressor of Ras 2, and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2.","['Thompson, Thelma', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Studzinski, George P', 'Vassilev, Lyubomir T']","['Thompson T', 'Andreeff M', 'Studzinski GP', 'Vassilev LT']","['Discovery Oncology, Roche Research Center, Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., Nutley, New Jersey, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcitriol/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', '*Genes, p53', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/physiology', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2010/04/22 06:00,2010/08/21 06:00,['2010/04/22 06:00'],"['2010/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-09-1036 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-1036 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2010 May;9(5):1158-68. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-1036.

There are data to support the use of HDAC inhibitors in association with other cancer therapies. To propose a rational combination therapy, it is necessary to depict the molecular basis behind the cytotoxic effect of MGCD0103. In this study, we found that MGCD0103 was substantially more toxic in neoplastic B cells relative to normal cells, and we described the death pathways activated by MGCD0103 in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells from 32 patients. MGCD0103 decreased the expression of Mcl-1 and induced translocation of Bax to the mitochondria, mitochondrial depolarization, and release of cytochrome c in the cytosol. Caspase processing in the presence of the caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh and time course experiments showed that caspase-9 was the apical caspase. Thus, MGCD0103 induced the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in CLL cells. Moreover, MGCD0103 treatment resulted in the activation of a caspase cascade downstream of caspase-9, caspase-dependent amplification of mitochondrial depolarization, activation of calpain, and Bax cleavage. We propose a model whereby the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis triggered by MGCD0103 in CLL is associated with a mitochondrial death amplification loop.","['El-Khoury, Victoria', 'Moussay, Etienne', 'Janji, Bassam', 'Palissot, Valerie', 'Aouali, Nassera', 'Brons, Nicolaas H C', 'Van Moer, Kris', 'Pierson, Sandrine', 'Van Dyck, Eric', 'Berchem, Guy']","['El-Khoury V', 'Moussay E', 'Janji B', 'Palissot V', 'Aouali N', 'Brons NH', 'Van Moer K', 'Pierson S', 'Van Dyck E', 'Berchem G']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hemato-Oncology, Public Research Center for Health (CRP-Sante), Luxembourg, Luxembourg. victoria.elkhoury@crp-sante.lu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'A6GWB8T96J (mocetinostat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2010/04/22 06:00,2010/08/21 06:00,['2010/04/22 06:00'],"['2010/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-09-1000 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-1000 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2010 May;9(5):1349-60. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-1000.

METHODS: The investigation was performed in 11 laboratories across three continents and included 3,334 patients. An exploratory retrospective stage I study was designed for biomarker discovery and generated whole-genome expression profiles from 2,143 patients with leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes. The gene expression profiling-based diagnostic accuracy was further validated in a prospective second study stage of an independent cohort of 1,191 patients. RESULTS: On the basis of 2,096 samples, the stage I study achieved 92.2% classification accuracy for all 18 distinct classes investigated (median specificity of 99.7%). In a second cohort of 1,152 prospectively collected patients, a classification scheme reached 95.6% median sensitivity and 99.8% median specificity for 14 standard subtypes of acute leukemia (eight acute lymphoblastic leukemia and six acute myeloid leukemia classes, n = 693). In 29 (57%) of 51 discrepant cases, the microarray results had outperformed routine diagnostic methods. CONCLUSION: Gene expression profiling is a robust technology for the diagnosis of hematologic malignancies with high accuracy. It may complement current diagnostic algorithms and could offer a reliable platform for patients who lack access to today's state-of-the-art diagnostic work-up. Our comprehensive gene expression data set will be submitted to the public domain to foster research focusing on the molecular understanding of leukemias.","['Haferlach, Torsten', 'Kohlmann, Alexander', 'Wieczorek, Lothar', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Kronnie, Geertruy Te', 'Bene, Marie-Christine', 'De Vos, John', 'Hernandez, Jesus M', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Mills, Ken I', 'Gilkes, Amanda', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Shurtleff, Sheila A', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Yeoh, Allen E', 'Papenhausen, Peter R', 'Liu, Wei-Min', 'Williams, P Mickey', 'Foa, Robin']","['Haferlach T', 'Kohlmann A', 'Wieczorek L', 'Basso G', 'Kronnie GT', 'Bene MC', 'De Vos J', 'Hernandez JM', 'Hofmann WK', 'Mills KI', 'Gilkes A', 'Chiaretti S', 'Shurtleff SA', 'Kipps TJ', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Yeoh AE', 'Papenhausen PR', 'Liu WM', 'Williams PM', 'Foa R']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany. torsten.haferlach@mll-online.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*classification/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods']",,2010/04/22 06:00,2010/09/09 06:00,['2010/04/22 06:00'],"['2010/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.23.4732 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.23.4732 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 May 20;28(15):2529-37. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.23.4732.

However, a trend toward an increased incidence of relapses in the standard-risk (SR) group after G-CSF treatment was observed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 154 SR patients in the AML-BFM 98 cohort, 50 patients were tested for G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) RNA isoform I and IV expression, G-CSFR cell surface expression, and acquired mutations in the G-CSFR gene. RESULTS: In patients randomly assigned to receive G-CSF after induction, 16 patients overexpressing the G-CSFR isoform IV showed an increased 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (50% +/- 13%) compared with 14 patients with low-level isoform IV expression (14% +/- 10%; log-rank P = .04). The level of G-CSFR isoform IV had no significant effect in patients not receiving G-CSF (P = .19). Multivariate analyses of the G-CSF-treated subgroup, including the parameters G-CSFR isoform IV overexpression, sex, and favorable cytogenetics as covariables, revealed the prognostic relevance of G-CSFR isoform IV overexpression for 5-year event-free survival (P = .031) and the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (P = .049).

Some scientific questions of this nature can only be addressed, or may best be addressed, through the conduct of a clinical trial in which research biopsies are obtained from all participants. However, trial designs with mandatory research biopsies have raised ethical concerns related to the risk of harm to participants, the adequacy of voluntary informed consent, and the potential for misunderstanding among research participants when access to an experimental intervention is linked to the requirement to undergo a research biopsy. In consideration of the ethical and scientific issues at stake in this debate, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B Ethics Committee proposes guidelines for clinical trials involving mandatory research biopsies. Any cancer clinical trial that requires research biopsies of participants must be well designed to address the scientific question, obtain the biopsy in a way that minimizes risk, and ensure that research participants are fully informed of the risks, rationale, and requirements of the study, as well as of treatment alternatives. Further guidelines and discussions of this issue are specified in this position paper.

Specifically, aberrant nuclear localization of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase, is a poor prognostic indicator in several epithelial carcinomas. It is now appreciated that in addition to signaling from the plasma membrane, EGFR also trafficks to the nucleus, and can directly bind the promoter regions of genes encoding cyclin D1 (CCND1) and B-Myb (MYBL2). We have previously established that loss of MUC1 in an EGFR-dependent transgenic mouse model of breast cancer correlates with the loss of cyclin D1 expression. Here, we provide evidence for a novel regulatory function of MUC1 in the trafficking and nuclear activity of EGFR. We found that MUC1 and EGFR interact in the nucleus of breast cancer cells, which promotes the accumulation of chromatin-bound EGFR. Additionally, the presence of MUC1 results in significant colocalization of EGFR and phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, indicating that MUC1 influences the association of EGFR with transcriptionally active promoter regions. Importantly, we found that the loss of MUC1 expression resulted in a decrease in the interaction between EGFR and the CCND1 promoter, which translated to a significant decrease in cyclin D1 protein expression. This data offers insights into a novel regulatory mechanism of EGFR nuclear function and could have important implications for evaluating nuclear localization in cancer.","['Bitler, Benjamin G', 'Goverdhan, Aarthi', 'Schroeder, Joyce A']","['Bitler BG', 'Goverdhan A', 'Schroeder JA']","['Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MYBL2 protein, human)', '0 (Mucin-1)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Carcinoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cyclin D1/genetics/metabolism', 'ErbB Receptors/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mucin-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism']",,2010/04/22 06:00,2010/10/01 06:00,['2010/04/22 06:00'],"['2010/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['jcs.062661 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.062661 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2010 May 15;123(Pt 10):1716-23. doi: 10.1242/jcs.062661.

Peripheral blood basophils, recognized as major effector cells in allergic inflammation that play a role in both innate and adaptive immunity, are activated by IL-33 through ST2L. However, studies are challenging due to the paucity of this cell population, representing less than 1% of peripheral blood leukocytes. We identified a basophil-like chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, KU812, that constitutively expresses ST2L and demonstrates functional responses to IL-33 stimulation. IL-33 induced production of multiple inflammatory mediators in KU812 cells that were blocked by anti-ST2L and anti-IL-33 antibodies. The interaction of IL-33 and ST2L activated NF-kappaB, JNK, and p38 MAPK, but not ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Studies using pharmacological inhibitors to IKK-2 and MAP kinases revealed that one of the functional responses, IL-33-induced IL-13 production, was regulated through NF-kappaB, but not JNK or p38 MAPK signaling. The requirement of NF-kappaB was confirmed by IKK-2 knockdown using shRNA. KU812 represents the first human cell line-based in vitro model of the IL-33/ST2L axis and provides a valuable tool to aid in understanding the mechanism and significance of IL-33 and ST2L interaction and function.","['Tare, Nadine', 'Li, Hongli', 'Morschauser, Andrew', 'Cote-Sierra, Javier', 'Ju, Grace', 'Renzetti, Louis', 'Lin, Tai-An']","['Tare N', 'Li H', 'Morschauser A', 'Cote-Sierra J', 'Ju G', 'Renzetti L', 'Lin TA']","['Pharma Research and Early Development, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley, NJ 07110-1199, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Biomarkers, Pharmacological)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IL1RL1 protein, human)', '0 (IL33 protein, human)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-1 Receptor-Like 1 Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-33)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Pharmacological/analysis/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokines/metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Like 1 Protein', 'Interleukin-33', 'Interleukins/metabolism/*pharmacology/*physiology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/physiology', '*Models, Theoretical', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology']",,2010/04/22 06:00,2010/09/09 06:00,['2010/04/22 06:00'],"['2010/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/01 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(10)00162-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.04.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2010 Sep 10;316(15):2527-37. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.04.007.

For haematological malignancies, the non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mouse is one of the most successful models to study paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). However, for this model to be effective for studying engraftment and therapy responses at the whole genome level, careful molecular characterisation is essential. RESULTS: Here, we sought to validate species-specific gene expression profiling in the high engraftment continuous ALL NOD/SCID xenograft. Using the human Affymetrix whole transcript platform we analysed transcriptional profiles from engrafted tissues without prior cell separation of mouse cells and found it to return highly reproducible profiles in xenografts from individual mice. The model was further tested with experimental mixtures of human and mouse cells, demonstrating that the presence of mouse cells does not significantly skew expression profiles when xenografts contain 90% or more human cells. In addition, we present a novel in silico and experimental masking approach to identify probes and transcript clusters susceptible to cross-species hybridisation. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate species-specific transcriptional profiles can be obtained from xenografts when high levels of engraftment are achieved or with the application of transcript cluster masks. Importantly, this masking approach can be applied and adapted to other xenograft models where human tissue infiltration is lower. This model provides a powerful platform for identifying genes and pathways associated with ALL disease progression and response to therapy in vivo.","['Samuels, Amy L', 'Peeva, Violet K', 'Papa, Rachael A', 'Firth, Marin J', 'Francis, Richard W', 'Beesley, Alex H', 'Lock, Richard B', 'Kees, Ursula R']","['Samuels AL', 'Peeva VK', 'Papa RA', 'Firth MJ', 'Francis RW', 'Beesley AH', 'Lock RB', 'Kees UR']","[""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Perth, Western Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', '*Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Species Specificity', 'Spleen/metabolism']",,2010/04/22 06:00,2010/07/02 06:00,['2010/04/22 06:00'],"['2009/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-11-256 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-11-256 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2010 Apr 21;11:256. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-11-256.,,,,20100421,PMC2876122,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Steroids may contribute to ALL-associated thrombosis. We explored the hemostatic effects of methylprednisolone monotherapy (MpMT) (32 mg/m2/day IV x 3 days) in children with newly diagnosed ALL. METHODS: Children (>1 to < or = 18 years of age) enrolled on DFCI ALL05-01 protocol (n = 30; mean age 6.3 years), without prior steroid therapy, were eligible for study. Overnight fasting pre- and post-MpMT samples were analyzed for coagulation factors [FVIII:C, von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag) and fibrinogen] and parameters of thrombin generation [prothrombin fragments 1.2 (F1.2), thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), and D-dimer]. RESULTS: At diagnosis F1.2 (1.5 nmol/L), TAT (10.9 microg/L), and D-dimers (2,766 ng/ml) levels were increased indicating endogenous thrombin activation. Patients with peripheral blasts (n = 17) had higher levels of vWF:Ag (1.89 vs. 1.14 P = 0.001), TAT (15.39 vs. 5.02 P = 0.038), and D-dimer (3,640 vs. 1,623 P = 0.019) compared to those without peripheral blasts. Following MpMT the blast count decreased significantly from 24% to 3.5% (P < 0.001) with reduction in level of vWF:Ag (1.5, P < 0.01), TAT (8.9, P = 0.42), and D-dimer (P = 0.018) despite 30% increase in FVIII:C levels (P = 0.005). However, patients without peripheral blasts had no significant change in vWF:Ag levels (1.14 vs. 1.25; P = 0.142) and had an increase in thrombin generation parameters. CONCLUSIONS: We postulate that peripheral blasts through endothelial activation stimulate vWF:Ag production/secretion causing coagulation activation. Methylprednisolone therapy reduces the blast count and indirectly suppresses the coagulation activation. Future studies are required to confirm these findings.","['Athale, Uma', 'Moghrabi, Albert', 'Nayiager, Trishana', 'Delva, Yves-Line', 'Thabane, Lehana', 'Chan, Anthony K C']","['Athale U', 'Moghrabi A', 'Nayiager T', 'Delva YL', 'Thabane L', 'Chan AK']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. athaleu@mcmaster.ca']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Thrombin/*drug effects', 'Thrombosis/chemically induced', 'von Willebrand Factor/*drug effects']",,2010/04/21 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/04/21 06:00'],"['2010/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22466 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Jul 1;54(7):963-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22466.,,,['CA 068484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,"['Copyright 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective was to examine whether changing trends in cigarette smoking prevalence nationally and within selected states parallel similar trends in mortality from leukemia. Trends in national smoking rates were correlated with trends in leukemia mortality rates obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results registry, respectively. State-specific correlations were assessed from 1984 to 2004 using smoking prevalence data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and leukemia mortality data from National Vital Statistics System. Correlations were computed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Leukemia mortality decreased overall in the United States in parallel with decreased smoking. Analyzed on a state-specific basis, leukemia mortality decreased in states where smoking rates declined markedly but remained unchanged where smoking prevalences were relatively stable. The findings suggest that declining rates of leukemia mortality are associated with changing patterns of smoking behavior.","['Varadarajan, Ramya', 'Cummings, Michael K', 'Hyland, Andrew J', 'Wang, Eunice S', 'Wetzler, Meir']","['Varadarajan R', 'Cummings MK', 'Hyland AJ', 'Wang ES', 'Wetzler M']","['Leukemia Section, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Registries', 'Smoking/adverse effects/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Smoking Cessation']",,2010/04/21 06:00,2010/08/17 06:00,['2010/04/21 06:00'],"['2009/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-010-0957-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2010 Sep;89(9):873-6. doi: 10.1007/s00277-010-0957-6.

Peripheral blood smears revealed a population of large granular lymphocytes. Large granular lymphocytosis (LGL) was first noted between 1 and 8 months after initiation of dasatinib, and it has persisted up to 33 months from the onset of LGL in one patient. Peak numbers of large granular lymphocytes ranged from 2,915 to 17,425/microl. The occurrence of LGL might interfere with achieving molecular response (MR, real-time quantification of major BCR-ABL1 mRNA less than 50 copies/microg RNA) in our small cohort; 8 (89%) of 9 patients with LGL attained MR, while only 6 (55%) of 11 patients without LGL eventually achieved MR. With respect to the relationship between LGL and pleural effusion (PE), 3 (27%) of 11 patients without LGL developed PE, while 5 (56%) of 9 patients with LGL developed PE. Moreover, the mean peak number of LGL was 9,215/microl, which was much higher than the mean peak number (4,635/microl) of LGL in patients without PE.

Optimal extraction conditions were determined as 60 kHz frequency at 60 degrees C for 30 min with 120 W intensity, which resulted in 19.3% of extraction yields and 19.1% of cytotoxicity on normal human cells. Yields from conventional water and ethanol extraction were 15.8% at 100 degrees C and 8.3% at 80 degrees C, respectively. It was found that the extracts obtained by ultrasonic extraction process selectively inhibited the digestive-related cancer cell lines, such as human stomach cancer cells, having 89% of the highest inhibition ratio and 4.5 of the highest selectivity. In adding 0.5 mg/mL of the extract, human promyelocytic leukemia cells' cell differentiation was increased 1.72 times over that of the control. Expression level of B cell lymphoma-2 from Hep3B cell was also effectively suppressed by the extract obtained at 60 kHz and 60 degrees C, leading to the inhibition of the early step of carcinogenesis. This work suggests that anticancer activity of the extracts is due to water-soluble polysaccharides rather than proteins and is further supported by the result that the ultrasonification extraction process can efficiently extract relatively intact polysaccharides rather than digesting the proteins in S. maxima by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight and high performance size exclusion chromatography chromatogram analyses. Therefore, ultrasonic extraction increases both extraction yield and the biological activity of S. maxima extracts, which might be useful as an alternative natural anticancer agent in the medical and food industries.","['Oh, Sung-Ho', 'Ahn, Juhee', 'Kang, Do-Hyung', 'Lee, Hyeon-Yong']","['Oh SH', 'Ahn J', 'Kang DH', 'Lee HY']","['College of Bioscience and Biotechnology Division of Biomaterials Engineering, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, 200-701, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mar Biotechnol (NY),"Marine biotechnology (New York, N.Y.)",100892712,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Biological Products/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxins/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Ethanol/chemistry', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*High-Energy Shock Waves', 'Humans', 'Spirulina/*chemistry', 'Temperature']",,2010/04/21 06:00,2011/07/08 06:00,['2010/04/21 06:00'],"['2009/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10126-010-9282-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Mar Biotechnol (NY). 2011 Apr;13(2):205-14. doi: 10.1007/s10126-010-9282-2.

Since many patients are diagnosed in the earliest stages, the course of the disease may be indolent and asymptomatic, requiring no therapy. For those who are diagnosed in advanced stages or whose disease becomes symptomatic, treatment is indicated. Advances in identifying prognostic factors, such as cytogenetics, IgHV mutational status, CD38, TP53, and ZAP-70, are helping physicians better predict who is more likely to have progressive disease and thus needs more frequent monitoring. Some of these prognostic factors are also helping to guide therapy choices as they can predict response to treatment and/or duration of response. Recent advances in treatment options have moved beyond traditional management with alkylating agents and purine analogs into regimens combining these two chemotherapy classes with monoclonal antibodies targeting CD20. Chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) has become the most effective therapy option to date for CLL. Compared with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, FCR has shown higher complete response rates and longer progression-free survival. Bendamustine, a unique alkylating agent with purine analog properties, has recently been approved by the FDA for treatment of CLL and provides a new alternative to existing therapies. Initial trials combining bendamustine with rituximab are showing promise for both untreated and relapsed/refractory disease. Other agents recently approved and/or being tested, such as ofatumumab, flavopiridol, and lenalidomide, are demonstrating activity in the relapsed setting.","['Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier', 'McQuary, Amy']","['Pinilla-Ibarz J', 'McQuary A']","['Malignant Hematology Division, H.

Most acute myeloid leukemia (AML) protocols use anthracyclines. Dexrazoxane has cardioprotective activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate cardioprotection of dexrazoxane in a prospective study. Fifty pediatric AML patients were treated with a Medical Research Council AML 10 modified protocol with dexrazoxane previous to any anthracycline dose. Cardiac function was evaluated at diagnosis, before every cycle, and every 6 months after the end of chemotherapy. Accumulative doses of anthracycline reached 424 mg/m (150 to 850 mg/m). Forty-eight patients (96%) received a dose higher than 300 mg/m. Twenty-eight percent had a grade of cardiotoxicity (24% grade 1 and 4% grade 2). Non 3 or 4 grade cardiotoxicity was seen. Cumulated anthracycline doses did not correlated with cardiotoxicity (P=0.815). The event-free survival was 53%, 15.7% died of disease, and 11.8% died free of leukemia. There is still not an agreement for the optimal method to reduce cardiotoxicity in children receiving anthracyclines. In our study, we could conclude that the use of dexrazoxane was effective cardioprotectant to allow a high-dose of anthracycline therapy. A randomized study is necessary to consolidate this asseveration.","['Sanchez-Medina, Jeronimo', 'Gonzalez-Ramella, Oscar', 'Gallegos-Castorena, Sergio']","['Sanchez-Medina J', 'Gonzalez-Ramella O', 'Gallegos-Castorena S']","['Department of Ambulatory Pediatrics, Hospital Infantil De Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico, DF, Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Cardiovascular Agents)', '5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/*adverse effects', 'Cardiovascular Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart Diseases/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Razoxane/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2010/04/21 06:00,2010/05/28 06:00,['2010/04/21 06:00'],"['2010/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181d321b3 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2010 May;32(4):294-7. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181d321b3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently described that Plk1 is overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemia, and that its inhibition selectively reduces the proliferation of leukemic cells. Here, we report that Plk1 inhibition or depletion using pharmacological and siRNA approaches decreased the phosphorylation of two mTOR substrates in AML cells. In HCT116 cells, inducible expression of a constitutively active form of Plk1 leads to activation of mTOR, as shown by increased phosphorylation of its 4E-BP1 and RPS6 down-stream targets. In addition, cells overexpressing the active form of Plk1 were characterized by abnormal growth that could be reversed by rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of the TORC1 complex. Altogether these data suggest the existence of a molecular and functional link between the Plk1 mitotic kinase and the mTOR pathway. Given the different established functions of Plk1 and mTOR during the cell cycle, we will discuss the possible meaning of this functional relationship.","['Renner, Annelies G', 'Creancier, Laurent', 'Dos Santos, Cedric', 'Fialin, Camille', 'Recher, Christian', 'Bailly, Christian', 'Kruczynski, Anna', 'Payrastre, Bernard', 'Manenti, Stephane']","['Renner AG', 'Creancier L', 'Dos Santos C', 'Fialin C', 'Recher C', 'Bailly C', 'Kruczynski A', 'Payrastre B', 'Manenti S']","['INSERM, U563-IFR30, Centre de Physiopathologie Toulouse-Purpan, Departement Oncogenese et Signalisation dans les cellules hematopoietiques CHU Purpan, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (EIF4EBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (polo-like kinase 1)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'G1 Phase', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",,2010/04/21 06:00,2010/09/04 06:00,['2010/04/21 06:00'],"['2010/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['11295 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.9.9.11295 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2010 May;9(9):1690-6. doi: 10.4161/cc.9.9.11295.

However, none of these mechanisms involves Bim functioning downstream of p53 mitochondrial translocation. Utilizing a p53 nuclear localization signal mutant, whose nuclear import is completely abrogated, we demonstrate that its apoptotic activity at the outer mitochondrial membrane, which involves conformational changes in Bax and Bak, is mediated by Bim. We further demonstrate an inverse correlation between the binding levels of p53 and Bim to Mcl-1. Thus, enhanced binding of p53 to Mcl-1 involves the disruption of existing complexes between Mcl-1 and Bim. We propose that mitochondrial p53 functions as a Bim derepressor by releasing Bim from sequestrating complexes with Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL, and allowing its engagement in Bak/Bax activation.","['Han, Jie', 'Goldstein, Leslie A', 'Hou, Wen', 'Gastman, Brian R', 'Rabinowich, Hannah']","['Han J', 'Goldstein LA', 'Hou W', 'Gastman BR', 'Rabinowich H']","['Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nuclear Localization Signals/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",,2010/04/21 06:00,2010/08/07 06:00,['2010/04/21 06:00'],"['2010/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)60282-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.081042 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Jul 16;285(29):22473-83. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.081042.

To determine whether IAP is also repressed in pluripotent stem cells by DNA methylation, we examined IAP expression in demethylated mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and epiblast-derived stem cells. Surprisingly, in demethylated ESC cultures carrying mutations of DNA methyltransferase I (Dnmt1), no IAP transcripts and proteins are detectable in undifferentiated Oct4(+) ESCs. In contrast, approximately 3.6% of IAP-positive cells are detected in Oct4(-) Dnmt1(-/-) cells, suggesting that the previously observed increase in IAP transcripts in the population of Dnmt1(-/-) ESCs could be accounted for by this subset of Oct4(-) Dnmt1(-/-) ESCs undergoing spontaneous differentiation. Consistent with this possibility, a dramatic increase of IAP mRNA (>100-fold) and protein expression was observed in Dnmt1(-/-) ESC cultures upon induction of differentiation through the withdrawal of leukemia-inhibitory factor for 6 or more days. Interestingly, both mRNAs and proteins of IAP can be readily detected in demethylated Oct4(+) epiblast-derived stem cells as well as differentiated mouse embryo fibroblasts, neurons, and glia upon conditional Dnmt1 gene deletion. These data suggest that mESCs are a unique stem cell type possessing a DNA methylation-independent IAP repression mechanism. This methylation-independent mechanism does not involve Dicer-mediated action of microRNAs or RNA interference because IAP expression remains repressed in Dnmt1(-/-); Dicer(-/-) double mutant ESCs. We suggest that mESCs possess a unique DNA methylation-independent mechanism to silence retrotransposons to safeguard genome stability while undergoing rapid cell proliferation for self-renewal.","['Hutnick, Leah K', 'Huang, Xinhua', 'Loo, Tao-Chuan', 'Ma, Zhicheng', 'Fan, Guoping']","['Hutnick LK', 'Huang X', 'Loo TC', 'Ma Z', 'Fan G']","['Department of Human Genetics, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Dmap1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Retroelements)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (Dnmt1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Brain/physiology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases', '*DNA Methylation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/physiology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neuroblastoma/genetics/physiopathology', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/deficiency/genetics', 'Retroelements/*physiology']",,2010/04/21 06:00,2010/08/11 06:00,['2010/04/21 06:00'],"['2010/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)57394-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.125674 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Jul 2;285(27):21082-91. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.125674.

METHODS: Incidence and survival data for childhood cancers came from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 9 (SEER 9) registries, and mortality data were based on deaths in the United States that were reported by states to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by underlying cause. RESULTS: Childhood cancer incidence rates increased significantly from 1975 through 2006, with increasing rates for acute lymphoblastic leukemia being most notable. Childhood cancer mortality rates declined by more than 50% between 1975 and 2006. For leukemias and lymphomas, significantly decreasing mortality rates were observed throughout the 32-year period, though the rate of decline slowed somewhat after 1998. For remaining childhood cancers, significantly decreasing mortality rates were observed from 1975 to 1996, with stable rates from 1996 through 2006. Increased survival rates were observed for all categories of childhood cancers studied, with the extent and temporal pace of the increases varying by diagnosis. CONCLUSION: When 1975 age-specific death rates for children are used as a baseline, approximately 38,000 childhood malignant cancer deaths were averted in the United States from 1975 through 2006 as a result of more effective treatments identified and applied during this period. Continued success in reducing childhood cancer mortality will require new treatment paradigms building on an increased understanding of the molecular processes that promote growth and survival of specific childhood cancers.","['Smith, Malcolm A', 'Seibel, Nita L', 'Altekruse, Sean F', 'Ries, Lynn A G', 'Melbert, Danielle L', ""O'Leary, Maura"", 'Smith, Franklin O', 'Reaman, Gregory H']","['Smith MA', 'Seibel NL', 'Altekruse SF', 'Ries LA', 'Melbert DL', ""O'Leary M"", 'Smith FO', 'Reaman GH']","['Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.

RIC conditioning included busulfan 9 mg/kg or less (27), melphalan 150 mg/m(2) or less (23), low-dose total body irradiation (TBI; 36), and others (7). The RIC group was older (median 45 vs 28 years, P < .001) and more received peripheral blood grafts (73% vs 43%, P < .001) but had similar other prognostic factors. The RIC versus full-intensity conditioning groups had slightly, but not significantly, less acute grade II-IV graft-versus-host disease (39% vs 46%) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (34% vs 42%), yet similar transplantation-related mortality. RIC led to slightly more relapse (35% vs 26%, P = .08) yet similar age-adjusted survival (38% vs 43%, P = .39). Multivariate analysis showed that conditioning intensity did not affect transplantation-related mortality (P = .92) or relapse risk (P = .14). Multivariate analysis demonstrated significantly improved overall survival with: Karnofsky performance status more than 80, first complete remission, lower white blood count, well-matched unrelated or sibling donors, transplantation since 2001, age younger than 30 years, and conditioning with TBI, but no independent impact of conditioning intensity.

Given that the fraction of AML with mutated p53 is small ( approximately 10%), it appears rational to study MDM2 inhibitors as therapy for AML. Here, we report results of a detailed characterization of sensitivity and resistance to treatment ex vivo with the MDM2 inhibitor MI219 in AML blasts from 109 patients. In line with previous observations, all AML cases with mutated p53 were resistant to MI219. Importantly, approximately 30% of AML cases with unmutated p53 also demonstrated primary resistance to MI219. Analysis of potential mechanisms associated with MI219 resistance in AML blasts with wild-type p53 uncovered distinct molecular defects, including low or absent p53 protein induction after MDM2 inhibitor treatment or external irradiation. Furthermore, a separate subset of resistant blasts displayed robust p53 protein induction after MI219 treatment, indicative of defective p53 protein function or defects in the apoptotic p53 network. Finally, analysis of very sensitive AML cases uncovered a strong and significant association with mutated Flt3 status (Flt3-ITD), which for the first time identified a clinically high-risk group of AML that may particularly benefit from MDM2 inhibitor treatment.","['Long, Jianting', 'Parkin, Brian', 'Ouillette, Peter', 'Bixby, Dale', 'Shedden, Kerby', 'Erba, Harry', 'Wang, Shaomeng', 'Malek, Sami N']","['Long J', 'Parkin B', 'Ouillette P', 'Bixby D', 'Shedden K', 'Erba H', 'Wang S', 'Malek SN']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Michigan, 1500 E Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0936, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (MDM4 protein, human)', '0 (MI-63 compound)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spiro Compounds/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism']",,2010/04/21 06:00,2010/08/25 06:00,['2010/04/21 06:00'],"['2010/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34762-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-01-261628 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jul 8;116(1):71-80. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-01-261628.

Consequently, it has been suggested that increasing one's dietary intake of flavanols may be of benefit. Complicating this idea, there are reports that high intakes of certain flavonoids during pregnancy are associated with an increased risk for acute infant leukemia due to a poison effect of select polyphenolic compounds on DNA topoisomerase (topo) II activity that promotes aberrant chromosomal translocations. In the current study, we characterized the effects of select flavanols (epicatechin and catechin monomers), and select flavanol dimers and longer oligomers, on topo II activity, and on cellular toxicity in vitro. In contrast to the chemotherapeutic drug etoposide (VP16) and the flavonol quercetin, which strongly inhibited topo II activity and increased the formation of cleavage complexes demonstrating a poison effect, the flavanols epicatechin and catechin had little effect on topo II enzyme activity. Accordingly, several fold greater concentrations of the flavanols were required to achieve cellular toxicity similar to that of quercetin and VP16 in cultures of myeloid and lymphoid cells. Low cellular toxicity and limited topo II inhibition were also observed with a procyanidin-rich cocoa extract. Of all the flavanols tested, the dimers (B2, B5 and a mix of both) exerted the greatest inhibition of topo II and inhibited cellular proliferation rates at concentrations similar to quercetin. However, in contrast to quercetin, the dimers did not function as topo II poisons. Collectively, our in vitro data show that cocoa-derived flavanols have limited effects on topo II activity and cellular proliferation in cancer cell lines. We predict that these compounds are likely to have limited leukemogenic potential at physiological concentrations.","['Lanoue, Louise', 'Green, Kerri K', 'Kwik-Uribe, Catherine', 'Keen, Carl L']","['Lanoue L', 'Green KK', 'Kwik-Uribe C', 'Keen CL']","['Department of Nutrition, University of California, Davis, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616, USA. llanoue@ucdavis.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),"Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)",100973463,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)']",IM,"['Cacao/chemistry/toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Diet/*adverse effects', 'Dimerization', 'Etoposide/toxicity', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/isolation & purification/*toxicity', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/enzymology/etiology', 'Quercetin/toxicity', 'Risk Factors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",,2010/04/21 06:00,2010/05/05 06:00,['2010/04/21 06:00'],"['2010/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['235/1/77 [pii]', '10.1258/ebm.2009.009184 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2010 Jan;235(1):77-89. doi: 10.1258/ebm.2009.009184.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most research has focused on single-sample CNA discovery, the so-called segmentation problem. The availability of high-density, large sample-size SNP array datasets makes the identification of recurrent copy number changes in cancer, an important issue that can be addressed using the cross-sample information. RESULTS: We present a novel approach for finding regions of recurrent copy number aberrations, called CNAnova, from Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array data. The method derives its statistical properties from a control dataset composed of normal samples and, in contrast to previous methods, does not require segmentation and permutation steps. For rigorous testing of the algorithm and comparison to existing methods, we developed a simulation scheme that uses the noise distribution present in Affymetrix arrays. Application of the method to 128 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia samples shows that CNAnova achieves lower error rate than a popular alternative approach. We also describe an extension of the CNAnova framework to identify recurrent CNA regions with intra-tumour heterogeneity, present in either primary or relapsed samples from the same patients.

Although it is investigated that the therapeutic action of As(4)S(4) is closely associated with its induced cells apoptosis, the definitive systematic molecular mechanism of action of As(4)S(4) in APL therapy is still remained unknown. In this study, a serial of assays in vitro about the cytotoxicity of As(4)S(4) and cellular apoptotic evidences were done, then a proteomic investigation with the high-resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis system and mass spectrometry were performed to obtain for the first time systematic identification and characterization of the global proteome of apoptosis induced by As(4)S(4) in retinoic acid (RA)-resistant cells. Among them, expressional and functional regulations of target proteins SET, RPP2 and PHB might be the potential novel effective therapeutic strategies for RA-resistant APL. This study will not only facilitate to understand the signal transduction of apoptosis of RA-resistant APL cells induced by As(4)S(4) as a whole, but also is important to screen for drug targets as a new therapeutic strategy for hematopoietic malignant tumors.","['Qi, Jun', 'He, Pengcheng', 'Chen, Wei', 'Wang, Hongli', 'Wang, Xinyang', 'Zhang, Mei']","['Qi J', 'He P', 'Chen W', 'Wang H', 'Wang X', 'Zhang M']","[""Department of Hematology, the First Clinical Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, No. 1 Jiankang Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (PHB protein, human)', '0 (Prohibitins)', '0 (Sulfides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZIK02R2PSD (tetraarsenic tetrasulfide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prohibitins', 'Proteomics/methods', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfides/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,2010/04/21 06:00,2010/11/04 06:00,['2010/04/21 06:00'],"['2009/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(10)00179-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2010.03.038 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Nov;34(11):1506-16. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2010.03.038.

The main challenge remains the ineffective RNAi delivery inside the cells. Non-viral gene delivery vectors have low immunogenicity compared to viral vectors, but are constrained by their reduced transfection efficiency. Silencing of the bcr-abl gene expression by RNAi confers therapeutic potential in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), but is limited by the cytotoxicity of the existing delivery methods. Here, we present evidence that the fusion between the cell penetrating peptide (CPP) HIV-Tat (49-57) and the membrane lytic peptide (LK15), Tat-LK15, mediates high transfection efficiency in delivering short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting the BCR-ABL oncoprotein in K562 CML cells. Our results show that shRNA complexes induce a more stable gene silencing of bcr-abl when compared to silencing mediated by siRNA complexes. In addition, silencing of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein by both shRNA and siRNA delivered by Tat-LK15 is more efficient and longer lasting than that achieved using Lipofectamine and more importantly without considerable cytotoxicity. In these terms Tat-LK15 can be an alternative to DNA/siRNA delivery in difficult-to-transfect leukemic cells.","['Arthanari, Yamini', 'Pluen, Alain', 'Rajendran, Ramkumar', 'Aojula, Harmesh', 'Demonacos, Constantinos']","['Arthanari Y', 'Pluen A', 'Rajendran R', 'Aojula H', 'Demonacos C']","['School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Stopford building, University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, M13 9PT, England, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (tat peptide (47-57), Human immunodeficiency virus 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/therapy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*administration & dosage/genetics', 'tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/*chemistry']",,2010/04/21 06:00,2010/10/19 06:00,['2010/04/21 06:00'],"['2009/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0168-3659(10)00268-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jconrel.2010.04.011 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2010 Aug 3;145(3):272-80. doi: 10.1016/j.jconrel.2010.04.011.

METHODS: The expression of STAT1, p-STAT1 and RIG-G in IFN-alpha-treated NB4 cells was detected by Western blot. The roles of STAT1, STAT2 and IRF-9 in IFN-alpha-induced RIG-G expression were analyzed in STAT1-null U3A cells by cell transfection, reporter gene assay, co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitaion. RESULTS: In U3A cells, only when STAT2 and IRF-9 were co-transfected, the luciferase activities of RIG-G promoter-containing reporter gene could be highly increased about 8-fold compared with that in the control group. Moreover, in the absence of IFN-alpha, similar effects were observed in either IRF-9 co-transfected with wild type or mutant form of STAT2, whereas IFN-alpha could increase the transactivation activity of wild type STAT2 and IRF-9 by 6-fold compared with that without IFN-alpha, but had no effect on mutant STAT2. In addition, STAT2 could interact with IRF-9 and bind to the RIG-G promoter. CONCLUSION: STAT2 may interact with IRF-9 in a STAT1-independent manner. The complex STAT2/IRF-9 is the key factor mediating the expression of RIG-G gene regulated by IFN-alpha. This is a novel signal transduction cascade for IFN which is different from the classical JAK-STAT pathway.","['Lou, Ye-jiang', 'Pan, Xiao-rong', 'Jia, Pei-min', 'Li, Dong', 'Zhang, Zhang-lin', 'Xu, Gui-ping', 'Tong, Jian-hua']","['Lou YJ', 'Pan XR', 'Jia PM', 'Li D', 'Zhang ZL', 'Xu GP', 'Tong JH']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,"['0 (IFIT3 protein, human)', '0 (IRF9 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3, gamma Subunit)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fibrosarcoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3, gamma Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmids', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT2 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection']",,2010/04/21 06:00,2011/04/26 06:00,['2010/04/21 06:00'],"['2010/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/26 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2010 Feb;32(2):88-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experimental data suggest that arsenic trioxide also can have a potential use as chemotherapeutic agent for other malignancies. The precise mechanisms of action of arsenic trioxide have though not been elucidated. As the role of Bcl-2 in arsenic trioxide-mediated cell apoptosis and conformation change of Bcl-2 in response to arsenic trioxide treatment has not been studied. The aim of the present study was to determine whether conformation change of Bcl-2 is involved in the action of arsenic trioxide. METHODS: Human gastric cancer SGC7901 cells were exposed to different concentrations of arsenic trioxide. Proliferation was measured by using the Kit-8 cell counting assay. Analysis of nuclear morphology was observed by DAPI staining. The apoptosis rates of cells treated with arsenic trioxide were analyzed by flow cytometry using Annexin V-FITC staining. The conformation change of Bcl-2 and Bax activation were detected by immunostaining and Western blot analysis. Total expression of Bcl-2 and Bax were examined by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Arsenic trioxide inhibited the growth of human gastric cancer SGC7901 cells and induced apoptosis. There were two Bcl-2 phenotypes coexisting in SGC7901 cells and the Bcl-2 cytoprotective phenotype could change into a cytodestructive phenotype following conformational change of Bcl-2, triggered by arsenic trioxide exposure. Bax activation might also be involved in arsenic trioxide-induced Bcl-2 conformational change. Arsenic trioxide did not change levels of total Bcl-2 expression, but up-regulated total Bax expression for the treatment time ranging from 3 to 24 hours. CONCLUSION: Arsenic trioxide induces apoptosis through induction of Bcl-2 conformational change, Bax activation and up-regulation of total Bax expression rather than affecting total Bcl-2 expression in human gastric cancer SGC7901 cells. The conformational change of Bcl-2 may be a novel described mechanism of arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis in cancer cells.","['Zheng, Yihu', 'Zhou, Mengtao', 'Ye, Aifang', 'Li, Qiu', 'Bai, Yongheng', 'Zhang, Qiyu']","['Zheng Y', 'Zhou M', 'Ye A', 'Li Q', 'Bai Y', 'Zhang Q']","['Department of Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College, Wenzhou 325000, China. zhengyihu@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,World J Surg Oncol,World journal of surgical oncology,101170544,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Stomach Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",,2010/04/21 06:00,2010/08/06 06:00,['2010/04/21 06:00'],"['2009/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1477-7819-8-31 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-7819-8-31 [doi]']",epublish,World J Surg Oncol. 2010 Apr 20;8:31. doi: 10.1186/1477-7819-8-31.,,,,20100420,PMC2873337,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disruption of JAK3 function results in quantitative and qualitative deficiencies in both B- and T-cell compartments of the immune system of JAK3 deficient mice and development of severe combined immunodeficiency in humans with the JAK3 genetic aberration. JAK3 plays a specific role in immune function and lymphoid development and it only resides in the hematopoietic system, thus the rationale for selective targeting. Inhibitors of JAK3 have shown utility in many different autoimmune disorders, including allograft rejection during transplantation, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and allergic and asthmatic diseases. These inhibitors are making their way into clinical trials with profound effects, thus, validating the target and strategy. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: A review that covers around 90 patents and patent applications made in the last 10 years in the area involving JAK3 inhibitors is provided. Specifically, what this content will provide is the genus, highlighted compounds of particular interest, filing organization and some biological measure of these compounds as inhibitors of this protein kinase or none if it is not provided. Some information from original research articles appearing in peer reviewed literature is provided, but this article is not a review of the literature. Furthermore, an overview of the current clinical status and future outcomes of this field is provided as summary. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: A strong understanding for the current state of the art in patents dealing with inhibitors of JAK3 including genus and species designations, potential commercial interest of this target in the pharmaceutical community, depth of coverage by numbers of examples and selected proof of action against the target. Also, a brief understanding of the biology and pharmacology involved in the processes involving the research, discovery, characterization and clinical status of JAK3 inhibitors. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: This review is intended for medicinal chemists and patent agents who want to get a quick understanding of the state of the art in the field of JAK3 inhibitors.

PML/RARalpha inhibits differentiation of myeloid precursor cells at stem cell level. Resveratrol is a phytoalexin that exerts cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. Ceramides have crucial roles in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, drug resistance, and apoptosis. In this study, we examined the possible cytotoxic effects of resveratrol on acute myeloid leukemia cells and determined the roles of ceramide-metabolizing genes in resveratrol-induced apoptosis, in addition to investigating the possibility of increasing the sensitivity of HL60 cells to resveratrol by manipulating sphingolipids. METHODS: Cytotoxic effects of resveratrol, C8:ceramide, PDMP, and SK-1 inhibitor were determined by XTT cell proliferation assay. Changes in caspase-3 enzyme activity and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were measured using caspase-3 colorimetric assay and JC-1 MMP detection kit. Expression levels of ceramide-metabolizing genes were examined by RT-PCR. RESULTS: The results revealed that manipulations of ceramide metabolism toward generation or accumulation of apoptotic ceramides increased apoptotic effects of resveratrol in HL60 cells, synergistically. More importantly, gene expression analyses revealed that resveratrol-induced apoptosis via increasing expression levels of ceramide-generating genes and decreasing expression levels of antiapoptotic sphingosine kinase-1 and glucosylceramide synthase genes. CONCLUSION: These results showed for the first time that increasing intracellular levels of ceramides by biochemical approaches has also increased sensitivity of HL60 cells to resveratrol. We also showed that resveratrol induces apoptosis through manipulating ceramide-metabolizing genes that resulted in the accumulation of ceramides in HL60 cells.","['Cakir, Zeynep', 'Saydam, Guray', 'Sahin, Fahri', 'Baran, Yusuf']","['Cakir Z', 'Saydam G', 'Sahin F', 'Baran Y']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science, Izmir Institute of Technology, Gulbahce Campus, 35430 Urla, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Amino Alcohols)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Morpholines)', ""0 (N-methyl-5-(4'-pentylphenyl)-2-aminopent-4-ene-1,3-diol)"", '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Sphingolipids)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '73257-80-4 (RV 538)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Amino Alcohols/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Ceramides/pharmacology', 'Colorimetry', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Resveratrol', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sphingolipids/*metabolism', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",,2010/04/20 06:00,2011/04/28 06:00,['2010/04/20 06:00'],"['2010/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-010-0884-x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2011 Feb;137(2):279-86. doi: 10.1007/s00432-010-0884-x.

Recently, a new hypothesis was proposed for the pathogenesis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The so-called 'adrenal hypothesis' emphasized the role of endogenous cortisol in the etiology of B-cell precursor ALL. The incidence peak of ALL in children between 3 to 5 years of age has been well documented and is consistent with this view. The adrenal hypothesis proposes that the risk of childhood B-cell precursor ALL is reduced when early childhood infections induce qualitative and quantitative changes in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. It suggests that the increased plasma cortisol levels would be sufficient to eliminate all clonal leukemic cells originating during fetal life. Because Brazil is a continental and tropical country, the exposure to infections is diversified with endemic viral and regionally non-viral infections, with some characteristics that support the recent adrenal hypothesis. Here we discuss this new hypothesis in terms of data from epidemiological studies and the possible implications of the diversity of infections occurring in Brazilian children.","['Azevedo-Silva, F', 'Camargo, B de', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, M S']","['Azevedo-Silva F', 'Camargo Bd', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS']","['Centro de Pesquisa, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,['WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Communicable Diseases/*complications/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/*blood', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*immunology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology/immunology', 'Risk Factors']",,2010/04/20 06:00,2010/12/17 06:00,['2010/04/20 06:00'],"['2009/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0100-879X2010000300001 [pii]', '10.1590/s0100-879x2010007500011 [doi]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2010 Mar;43(3):226-9. doi: 10.1590/s0100-879x2010007500011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subjects were drawn from patients transplanted between 1991 and 1999 facilitated by the National Marrow Donor Program. Patients who received high-dose Cy/TBI regimens were slightly younger, more likely to receive a mismatched transplant and to have intermediate or advanced disease compared with patients in the BuCy or standard-dose TBI group. Neutrophil recovery was significantly higher in the standard-dose CY/TBI group compared with the high-dose Cy/TBI or BuCy group. Patients who received the high-dose Cy/TBI regimen had an increased risk of developing grades III-IV aGVHD when compared with the control group who received BuCy (P = 0.011).

Hybridization of genomic DNA from CD34-positive blasts of acute myeloid leukemia (n=19) or myeloproliferative disorder (n=1) with the arrays identified 9148 nonsynonymous nucleotide changes. Subsequent analysis showed that most of these changes were also present in the genomic DNA of the paired controls, with 11 somatic changes identified only in the leukemic blasts. One of these latter changes results in a Met-to-Ile substitution at amino-acid position 511 of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3), and the JAK3(M511I) protein exhibited transforming potential both in vitro and in vivo. Further screening for JAK3 mutations showed novel and known transforming changes in a total of 9 out of 286 cases of leukemia. Our experiments also showed a somatic change responsible for an Arg-to-His substitution at amino-acid position 882 of DNA methyltransferase 3A, which resulted in a loss of DNA methylation activity of >50%.

The importance of EphA2-EFNA4 interactions at the endothelium-lymphocyte interface during TEM could rely on their attractive/repulsive properties.

Immune responses were evaluated by delayed-type hypersensitivity, CD4+ T-cell proliferation, CD3+ T-cell interferon-gamma release, and WT1 peptide tetramer staining. Of the 9 evaluable patients, 7 completed 6 vaccinations and WT1-specific T-cell responses were noted in 7 of 8 patients. Three patients who were HLA-A0201-positive showed significant increase in interferon-gamma-secreting cells and frequency of WT1 tetramer-positive CD8+ T cells. Three patients developed a delayed hypersensitivity reaction after vaccination. Definite related toxicities were minimal. With a mean follow-up of 30 plus or minus 8 months after diagnosis, median disease-free survival has not been reached.

Herein we explored three mechanisms (pharmacokinetics, serum albumin and pharmacogenetics) through which dexamethasone may cause debilitating fatigue and disrupted sleep. METHODS: We enrolled 100 patients on a 10-d study: 5-d of no dexamethasone (OFF DEX) followed by 5-d of dexamethasone (ON DEX) during continuation chemotherapy. Sleep variables were collected with continuous actigraphy on days 1 through 5, both OFF DEX and ON DEX. On days 2 and 5 of each 5-d period, parents and patients 7 years of age and older completed a sleep diary and Fatigue Scale questionnaire. Blood was collected at 0 (pre-dexamethasone), 1, 2, 4 and 8 h after the first oral dexamethasone dose for pharmacokinetic analysis. Serum albumin concentration was retrospectively analysed in stored samples. Patient DNA was genotyped for 99 polymorphic loci in candidate genes associated with glucocorticoid metabolism. RESULTS: Dexamethasone clearance was significantly greater in younger patients than in older ones and in lower risk patients. In multiple regression models, risk group was significantly related to pharmacokinetic parameters. We found that polymorphisms in three genes (AHSG, IL6, POLDIP3) were significantly associated with sleep measures but not with fatigue. CONCLUSION: Risk group had the most significant relationship with disrupted sleep in patients while on dexamethasone. Serum albumin levels had neither a direct relationship with sleep or fatigue variables nor an indirect relationship through systemic exposure to dexamethasone. We identified candidate genes that may help explain the adverse events of disrupted sleep in paediatric patients receiving dexamethasone.","['Vallance, Kelly', 'Liu, Wei', 'Mandrell, Belinda N', 'Panetta, John C', 'Gattuso, Jami S', 'Hockenberry, Marilyn', 'Zupanec, Sue', 'Yang, Lei', 'Yang, Jie', 'Hinds, Pamela S']","['Vallance K', 'Liu W', 'Mandrell BN', 'Panetta JC', 'Gattuso JS', 'Hockenberry M', 'Zupanec S', 'Yang L', 'Yang J', 'Hinds PS']","[""Department of Hematology, Cook Children's Medical Center, Fort Worth, TX, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Fatigue/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Serum Albumin/metabolism', 'Sleep Wake Disorders/*chemically induced/genetics']",,2010/04/20 06:00,2010/10/14 06:00,['2010/04/20 06:00'],"['2009/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(10)00257-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2010.03.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2010 Jul;46(10):1848-55. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2010.03.026.

The tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 has emerged as a major regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and cytokine receptor signaling. In the last decade, germline mutations in the human PTPN11 gene, encoding Shp2, were linked to Noonan (NS) and LEOPARD syndromes, two multisymptomatic developmental disorders that are characterized by short stature, craniofacial defects, cardiac defects, and mental retardation. Somatic Shp2 mutations are also associated with several types of human malignancies, such as the most common juvenile leukemia, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Whereas NS and JMML are caused by gain-of-function (GOF) mutations of Shp2, loss-of-function (LOF) mutations are thought to be associated with LEOPARD syndrome. Animal models that carry conditional LOF and GOF mutations have allowed a better understanding of the mechanism of Shp2 function in disease, and shed light on the role of Shp2 in signaling pathways that control decisive events during embryonic development or during cellular transformation/tumorigenesis.","['Grossmann, Katja S', 'Rosario, Marta', 'Birchmeier, Carmen', 'Birchmeier, Walter']","['Grossmann KS', 'Rosario M', 'Birchmeier C', 'Birchmeier W']","['Department of Cancer Research, Max-Delbrueck-Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Adv Cancer Res,Advances in cancer research,0370416,"['EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Morphogenesis/*physiology', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction']",191,2010/04/20 06:00,2010/07/09 06:00,['2010/04/20 06:00'],"['2010/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0065-230X(10)06002-1 [pii]', '10.1016/S0065-230X(10)06002-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Cancer Res. 2010;106:53-89. doi: 10.1016/S0065-230X(10)06002-1.,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

A signaling cascade of events activated by stimulation with antigens contributes to the regulation of mast cell degranulation. While various anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic drugs have been developed that inhibit degranulation of mast cells, the inhibitory mechanism has been poorly understood. Licochalcone A (Lico A) is a retrochalcone isolated from the root of Xinjiang liquorice and has been reported to exhibit various biological activities such as anti-inflammatory activity. We examined the effects of Lico A and related chalcones on degranulation in a rat basophilic leukemia cell line, RBL-2H3. Whereas Lico A and licochalcone C (Lico C) exhibited inhibitory activity with cytotoxicity, licochalcone D (Lico D) significantly inhibited the degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells with low cytotoxicity. Moreover, Lico D significantly inhibited the Ca2+ influx and phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) and MEK. These results suggest that Lico D inhibits mast cell degranulation via the inhibition of both extracellular Ca2+ influx and activation of the MEK-ERK pathway.","['Tanifuji, Shota', 'Aizu-Yokota, Eriko', 'Funakoshi-Tago, Megumi', 'Sonoda, Yoshiko', 'Inoue, Hideo', 'Kasahara, Tadashi']","['Tanifuji S', 'Aizu-Yokota E', 'Funakoshi-Tago M', 'Sonoda Y', 'Inoue H', 'Kasahara T']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Keio University, 1-5-30 Shibakoen, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105-8512, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Chalcones)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'JTV5467968 (licochalcone A)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Basophils/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chalcones/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cytoprotection', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Glycyrrhiza/immunology', 'Intracellular Space/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Roots', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",,2010/04/20 06:00,2011/04/20 06:00,['2010/04/20 06:00'],"['2009/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S1567-5769(10)00121-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.intimp.2010.04.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2010 Jul;10(7):769-76. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2010.04.007.

However, dysregulated PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling has been documented in a wide range of neoplasias, including malignant hematological disorders. It is now emerging that this signaling network plays a key role during normal hematopoiesis, a tightly regulated process resulting in the formation of all blood lineages. Blood cell development encompasses a complex series of events which are mainly regulated by actions of cytokines, a family of extracellular ligands which stimulate many biological responses in a wide array of cell types. Hematopoiesis is strictly dependent on the correct function of the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM), as BMM cells secrete most of the cytokines. Several of these cytokines activate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling network and regulate proliferation, survival, and differentiation events during hematopoiesis. Here, we review the evidence that links the signals emanating from the PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade with the functions of hematopoietic stem cells and the process of myelopoiesis, including lineage commitment. We then highlight the emerging role played by aberrant PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling during leukemogenesis.","['Martelli, Alberto M', 'Evangelisti, Camilla', 'Chiarini, Francesca', 'Grimaldi, Cecilia', 'Cappellini, Alessandra', 'Ognibene, Andrea', 'McCubrey, James A']","['Martelli AM', 'Evangelisti C', 'Chiarini F', 'Grimaldi C', 'Cappellini A', 'Ognibene A', 'McCubrey JA']","['Department of Human Anatomy, University of Bologna, via Irnerio 48, 40126 Bologna, Italy. alberto.martelli@unibo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Mammals/genetics/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Myelopoiesis/*genetics/physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",0,2010/04/20 06:00,2010/10/28 06:00,['2010/04/20 06:00'],"['2010/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0167-4889(10)00111-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2010.04.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2010 Sep;1803(9):991-1002. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2010.04.005.

Human tumors frequently overexpress Op18 and a tumor-associated Q18-->E mutation has been identified that confers hyperactivity, destabilizes spindle microtubules, and causes mitotic aberrancies, polyploidization, and chromosome loss in K562 leukemia cells. Here we determined whether wild-type and mutant Op18 have the potential to cause chromosomal instability by some means other than interference with spindle assembly, and thereby bypassing the spindle assembly checkpoint. Our approach was based on Op18 derivatives with distinct temporal order of activity during mitosis, conferred either by differential phosphorylation inactivation or by anaphase-specific degradation through fusion with the destruction box of cyclin B1. We present evidence that excessive Op18 activity generates chromosomal instability through interference occurring subsequent to the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, which reduces the fidelity of chromosome segregation to spindle poles during anaphase. Similar to uncorrected merotelic attachment, this mechanism evades detection by the spindle assembly checkpoint and thus provides an additional route to chromosomal instability.","['Holmfeldt, Per', 'Sellin, Mikael E', 'Gullberg, Martin']","['Holmfeldt P', 'Sellin ME', 'Gullberg M']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,['0 (Stathmin)'],IM,"['Anaphase', 'Chromosomal Instability/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Metaphase', 'Spindle Apparatus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Stathmin/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', '*Up-Regulation']",,2010/04/20 06:00,2010/06/23 06:00,['2010/04/20 06:00'],"['2010/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(10)00163-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.04.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2010 Jul 15;316(12):2017-26. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.04.008.

Short-term administration of bosutinib causes regression of K562 and KU812 CML tumour xenografts. BaF3 murine myeloid cells expressing wild-type Bcr-Abl are sensitive to bosutinib treatment, as are BaF3 cells expressing many imatinib-resistant forms of Bcr-Abl.

To determine mitotic cell age in hematopoietic cells of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, we assessed differential CSX methylation patterns in these diseases vs age-adjusted healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed bisulfite pyrosequencing to analyze CSX methylation in CD34(+) and bone marrow (BM) cells from 53 MDS, 62 AML, 77 ALL patients, and 37 controls. RESULTS: Analysis of MDS CD34(+) and BM cells revealed significantly increasing methylation of CSX in controls < MDS low-risk < MDS high-risk < AML. Furthermore, increased differences of CSX methylation between the CD34(+) vs the unselected BM compartment were detected in matched MDS low-risk but not high-risk and AML samples. ALL samples displayed highly elevated CSX methylation levels as compared to controls.

Annexin A1 (ANXA1/lipocortin-1/lipomodulin), a GC-inducible molecule, was regarded as a vital anti-inflammatory mediator of GC. Thioredoxin binding protein-2 (TBP-2/VDUP1/TXNIP), a regulator of redox reactions, cell growth and lipid metabolism, was also reportedly induced by GC. HTLV-I infected T cells undergo the transition from the IL-2 dependent to IL-2 independent growth during the long-term culture in vitro. We found that these T cells responded to GC with growth arrest and apoptosis in the IL-2 dependent growth stage, whereas they failed to respond to GC after their growth had shifted into the IL-2 independent stage. Here we employed these T cell lines and studied the roles of ANXA1 and TBP-2 in mediating GC-induced apoptosis. In GC-sensitive T cells, ANXA1 expression was negligible and unaffected by GC treatment, whereas TBP-2 was expressed and induced by GC treatment. In GC-resistant T cells, however, ANXA1 was highly expressed regardless of GC treatment and promoted cellular proliferation. In contrast, TBP-2 expression was lost and could not mediate the GC-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, these results suggest that TBP-2, but not ANXA1, is directly involved in the switching of GC sensitivity and GC resistance in HTLV-I infected T cell lines, whereas ANXA1 may be a biomarker indicative of the advanced stage of the transformation.","['Chen, Zhe', 'Yoshihara, Eiji', 'Son, Aoi', 'Matsuo, Yoshiyuki', 'Masutani, Hiroshi', 'Sugie, Katsuji', 'Maeda, Michiyuki', 'Yodoi, Junji']","['Chen Z', 'Yoshihara E', 'Son A', 'Matsuo Y', 'Masutani H', 'Sugie K', 'Maeda M', 'Yodoi J']","['Laboratory of Infection and Prevention, Department of Biological Responses, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (Annexin A1)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (TXNIP protein, human)']",IM,"['Annexin A1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glucocorticoids/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/physiology/*virology']",,2010/04/20 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/04/20 06:00'],"['2010/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-2478(10)00120-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.imlet.2010.04.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 2010 Jun 15;131(1):11-8. doi: 10.1016/j.imlet.2010.04.003.

Recently, celastrol is identified both as a novel inhibitor of HSP90 and as a potential anti-tumor agent. However, this agent's effects on the cell cycle are rarely investigated. In this study, we observed the effects of celastrol on the human monocytic leukemia cell line U937 cell cycle. RESULTS: Celastrol affected the proliferation of U937 in a dose-dependent way, arresting the cell cycle at G0/G1 with 400 nM doses and triggering cell death with doses above 1000 nM. Cell cycle arrest was accompanied by inhibition of HSP90 ATPase activity and elevation in HSP70 levels (a biochemical hallmark of HSP90 inhibition), a reduction in Cyclin D1, Cdk4 and Cdk6 levels, and a disruption of the HSP90/Cdc37/Cdk4 complex. The observed effects of celastrol on the U937 cell cycle were thiol-related, firstly because the effects could be countered by pre-loading thiol-containing agents and secondly because celastrol and thiol-containing agents could react with each other to form new compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Our results disclose a novel action of celastrol-- causing cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase based upon thiol-related HSP90 inhibition.

While the initial focus has been on investigating each data set separately, there is an increasing interest in studying the correlation structure between two or more data sets. Multivariate methods based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) have been proposed for integrating paired genetic data sets. The high dimensionality of microarray data imposes computational difficulties, which have been addressed for instance by studying the covariance structure of the data, or by reducing the number of variables prior to applying the CCA. In this work, we propose a new method for analyzing high-dimensional paired genetic data sets, which mainly emphasizes the correlation structure and still permits efficient application to very large data sets. The method is implemented by translating a regularized CCA to its dual form, where the computational complexity depends mainly on the number of samples instead of the number of variables. The optimal regularization parameters are chosen by cross-validation. We apply the regularized dual CCA, as well as a classical CCA preceded by a dimension-reducing Principal Components Analysis (PCA), to a paired data set of gene expression changes and copy number alterations in leukemia. RESULTS: Using the correlation-maximizing methods, regularized dual CCA and PCA+CCA, we show that without pre-selection of known disease-relevant genes, and without using information about clinical class membership, an exploratory analysis singles out two patient groups, corresponding to well-known leukemia subtypes. Furthermore, the variables showing the highest relevance to the extracted features agree with previous biological knowledge concerning copy number alterations and gene expression changes in these subtypes. Finally, the correlation-maximizing methods are shown to yield results which are more biologically interpretable than those resulting from a covariance-maximizing method, and provide different insight compared to when each variable set is studied separately using PCA. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that regularized dual CCA as well as PCA+CCA are useful methods for exploratory analysis of paired genetic data sets, and can be efficiently implemented also when the number of variables is very large.","['Soneson, Charlotte', 'Lilljebjorn, Henrik', 'Fioretos, Thoas', 'Fontes, Magnus']","['Soneson C', 'Lilljebjorn H', 'Fioretos T', 'Fontes M']","['Centre for Mathematical Sciences, Lund University, Box 118, SE-221 00 Lund, Sweden. lottas@maths.lth.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Databases, Genetic', '*Gene Dosage', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/genetics', 'Principal Component Analysis']",,2010/04/20 06:00,2010/06/10 06:00,['2010/04/20 06:00'],"['2009/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-11-191 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-11-191 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2010 Apr 15;11:191. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-11-191.,,,,20100415,PMC2873536,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They have caused a major impact on the survival of cancer patients in many areas of clinical oncology and hematology. Indeed, in some hematologic malignancies, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, biologicals and antibodies specifically designed to target tumour-specific proteins have revolutionized treatment standards. In solid tumours, new drugs targeting EGF- or VEGF- receptors are now approved and are entering clinical practise for treatment of colon, lung, kidney and other cancers, either alone or in combination with conventional treatment approaches. Recent data have now shown that molecular targeted therapy might display efficacy in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as well. The evaluated biologicals are generally well tolerated from HNSCC patients, who usually have the burden of multiple co-morbidities that interfere with conventional systemic treatment options. Therefore, molecular targeted therapies offer new treatment options even for heavily pretreated and seriously ill patients usually unable to tolerate chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The two most promising and advanced strategies are the blockage of growth-factor based cellular signalling and interference with angiogenesis-related pathways. But inhibitors of alternative targets, such as Scr and proteasomes, have already been evaluated in early clinical trials with HNSCC patients.","['Goerner, Martin', 'Seiwert, Tanguy Y', 'Sudhoff, Holger']","['Goerner M', 'Seiwert TY', 'Sudhoff H']","['Community Hospital Bielefeld, Department of Hematology, Oncology and Palliative Care, Teutoburger Str, 60, 33604 Bielefeld, Germany. martin.goerner@klinikumbielefeld.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Head Neck Oncol,Head & neck oncology,101479704,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",IM,"['ErbB Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",,2010/04/20 06:00,2010/04/20 06:01,['2010/04/20 06:00'],"['2010/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/20 06:01 [medline]']","['1758-3284-2-8 [pii]', '10.1186/1758-3284-2-8 [doi]']",epublish,Head Neck Oncol. 2010 Apr 14;2:8. doi: 10.1186/1758-3284-2-8.,,,,20100414,PMC2868849,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20100630'],,,,,,,,,,,

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an inverse correlation exists between expression of wild-type CEBPA and CD7. Aim of this study was to find out whether C/EBPalpha is a negative regulator of CD7 and which other regulatory mechanisms might be involved. RESULTS: As already described for primary AML cells, the majority of AML cell lines tested were either C/EBPalpha+/CD7- or C/EBPalpha-/CD7+. However, the existence of isolated CD7+ cell lines expressing wild-type C/EBPalpha challenges the notion that C/EBPalpha acts as a unique repressor of CD7. Furthermore, ectopic expression of CEBPA did not reduce CD7 in CD7+ cells and knock-down of C/EBPalpha failed to induce CD7 in CD7- cells. In contrast, the DNA demethylating agent Aza-2'deoxycytidine triggered CD7 expression in CD7- AML and in T-cell lines suggesting epigenetic regulation of CD7. Bisulfite sequencing data confirmed that CpGs in the CD7 exon1 region are methylated in CD7- cell lines, and unmethylated in CD7+ cell lines. CONCLUSION: We confirmed an inverse correlation between the expression of wild-type CEBPA and of CD7 in AML cells. Our results contradict the hypothesis that C/EBPalpha acts as repressor for CD7, and instead show that epigenetic mechanisms are responsible for CD7 regulation, in AML cells as well as in T-cells, the typical CD7 expressing cell type.","['Rohrs, Sonja', 'Scherr, Michaela', 'Romani, Julia', 'Zaborski, Margarete', 'Drexler, Hans G', 'Quentmeier, Hilmar']","['Rohrs S', 'Scherr M', 'Romani J', 'Zaborski M', 'Drexler HG', 'Quentmeier H']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD7/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2010/04/20 06:00,2010/08/11 06:00,['2010/04/20 06:00'],"['2010/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-3-15 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-3-15 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2010 Apr 14;3:15. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-3-15.,,,,20100414,PMC2873354,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reported herein is a case of disseminated S. prolificans infection in a patient undergoing anti-neoplastic chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. Antemortem blood culture yielded S. prolificans, which was confirmed on conventional morphological examination and polymerase chain reaction-based DNA sequencing targeting internally transcribed spacer regions. Histopathology of autopsy specimens indicated fungal infection in the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract, with the development of hemorrhagic and ischemic necrosis. The infecting fungus had developing septate hyphae and was identified as belonging to the genus Scedosporium, on in situ hybridization of tissue. The combination of haphazardly branching hyphae and lemon-shaped conidia appeared to be the most useful distinguishing features to allow differentiation of this fungus from other filamentous fungi in tissue. Three other unique histopathological characteristics of the fungus were noted: (i) parallel hyphae bridged at right angles to produce letter-H patterns; (ii) intravascular conidiation; and (iii) purple conidia in tissue, though these are usually described as brown in most text books. Precise histopathology, in addition to other techniques such as in situ hybridization, can aid in the identification of etiological fungi.","['Kimura, Masatomo', 'Maenishi, Osamu', 'Ito, Hiroyuki', 'Ohkusu, Kiyofumi']","['Kimura M', 'Maenishi O', 'Ito H', 'Ohkusu K']","['Department of Pathology, Kinki University School of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama, Osaka, Japan. kimura-m@med.kindai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/drug therapy', 'Mycetoma/complications/*pathology', '*Scedosporium']",,2010/04/20 06:00,2010/07/14 06:00,['2010/04/20 06:00'],"['2010/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['PIN2491 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1440-1827.2009.02491.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pathol Int. 2010 Feb;60(2):131-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.2009.02491.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper focuses on depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and posttraumatic growth (PTG) among Japanese CCSs and their SIBs. METHODS: Adolescent and young adult CCSs (n=185), in remission for more than 1 year, their SIBs (n=72), and general controls (CONTs) (n=1,000) completed anonymous self-report questionnaires for depression, anxiety, PTSS, and PTG. The physicians in charge also completed an anonymous disease/treatment data sheet. RESULTS: CCSs were approximately 8 years old at diagnosis and approximately 23 years old at the time of the survey. Their diagnoses included leukemia (57%), lymphoma (12%), and solid tumors (30%). Thirty-eight percent underwent surgery and 25% received stem cell transplantation. No significant differences were found between CCSs and CONTs in terms of depression and anxiety. CCSs had significantly more PTSS and had remarkably greater PTG compared to CONTs. Although no significant differences were found between SIBs and CONTs regarding depression, anxiety, or PTSS, female SIBs exhibited greater PTG compared to female CONTs. CONCLUSION: To empower CCSs, they should be evaluated periodically regarding PTSS and PTG and should be provided appropriate care and feedback. The fact that the mental health status of young adult SIBs was similar to CONTs at 15 years after their siblings' diagnoses may help reassure parents who worry about mental health among the siblings of an affected child during and after his/her treatment.","['Kamibeppu, Kiyoko', 'Sato, Iori', 'Honda, Misato', 'Ozono, Shuichi', 'Sakamoto, Naoko', 'Iwai, Tsuyako', 'Okamura, Jun', 'Asami, Keiko', 'Maeda, Naoko', 'Inada, Hiroko', 'Kakee, Naoko', 'Horibe, Keizo', 'Ishida, Yasushi']","['Kamibeppu K', 'Sato I', 'Honda M', 'Ozono S', 'Sakamoto N', 'Iwai T', 'Okamura J', 'Asami K', 'Maeda N', 'Inada H', 'Kakee N', 'Horibe K', 'Ishida Y']","['Department of Family Nursing, Graduate School of Medicine, the University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-0033, Japan. kkamibeppu-tky@umin.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Anxiety/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child Development/*physiology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Depression/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/psychology/*rehabilitation', 'Personality Inventory', 'Siblings/*psychology', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/physiopathology/psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",,2010/04/17 06:00,2011/02/25 06:00,['2010/04/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11764-010-0124-z [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2010 Dec;4(4):303-12. doi: 10.1007/s11764-010-0124-z.

The anti-JL1 immunonanoplexes were able to deliver siRNA specifically to leukemic cells (CEM and Jurkat), but not to control cancer cells (H9).

All haematological malignancies (HMs) registered between 1993 and 2002 in children below 15 years of age were included in the study. Pathological and haematological diagnoses were reviewed, recoded according to International Classification of Diseases for Oncology-3 and reclassified on the basis of ICCC-3. Sex and age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated, using the world population as standard. Five hundred and seventy-one HMs were registered in the Girona, Valencia and Zaragoza Cancer Registries during the study period. According to ICCC-3, precursor cell leukaemias were the most frequent HMs in children and constituted 60% of all HMs (an age-adjusted incidence rate of 42.7 per million children-years). The second most frequent childhood HM was Hodgkin lymphoma (11.2% of all HMs), yielding an age-adjusted standardized incidence rate of 6.3 per million children-years. With regard to myeloid lineage, acute myeloid leukaemias were the most frequent with a rate of 7.9 per million children-years. The standardized incidence rates for lymphoid leukaemia (1.19) and Burkitt lymphoma (3.94) were statistically higher than the rates observed in Europe. Compared with European data, Spain has a high incidence of lymphoid leukaemias and lymphomas. In particular, a high incidence of Burkitt lymphoma was observed. The causes of this geographical variation are still unknown.","['Marcos-Gragera, Rafael', 'Cervantes-Amat, Marta', 'Vicente, Maria Luisa', 'de Sanjose, Silvia', 'Guallar, Elena', 'Godoy, Catalina', 'Calvo, Carlota', 'Giraldo, Pilar', 'Sant, Milena', 'Peris-Bonet, Rafael', 'Carmen Martos, Maria']","['Marcos-Gragera R', 'Cervantes-Amat M', 'Vicente ML', 'de Sanjose S', 'Guallar E', 'Godoy C', 'Calvo C', 'Giraldo P', 'Sant M', 'Peris-Bonet R', 'Carmen Martos M']","['Department of Health, University of Girona, Girona Cancer Registry-Catalan Cancer Plan, Girona, Italy. rmarcos@ico.scs.es']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Cancer Prev,European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP),9300837,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/epidemiology', '*Population Surveillance', 'Registries', 'Spain/epidemiology']",,2010/04/17 06:00,2011/02/17 06:00,['2010/04/17 06:00'],"['2010/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CEJ.0b013e328339e2f3 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Prev. 2010 Jul;19(4):247-55. doi: 10.1097/CEJ.0b013e328339e2f3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Bone mineral density (BMD) was evaluated at lumbar spine (LS), total hip and femoral neck in 89 patients (44 men) more than 5 years after remission of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The patients had received chemotherapy (group I; n = 41), chemotherapy and cranial irradiation (group II; n = 32), or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with total body irradiation (TBI) (group III; n = 16). All patients had received methylprednisolone and 47 additional dexamethasone treatment. RESULTS: A reduced BMD at any site was observed in 44 of the 89 patients, more frequently in men (66%) than women (33%) (p < 0.001). In comparison with group I, mean BMD was significantly lower at all sites in group II and at the total hip and femoral neck in group III. A multivariate analysis showed independent significant influences of male gender at LS (p < 0.001) and of type of treatment and dexamethasone at the hip (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A low bone mass is frequently observed in adult survivors of childhood ALL and NHL, and is associated with male gender at the LS and with dexamethasone treatment, cranial irradiation and BMT/TBI at the hip.","['Benmiloud, Sarra', 'Steffens, Melanie', 'Beauloye, Veronique', 'de Wandeleer, Ann', 'Devogelaer, Jean-Pierre', 'Brichard, Benedicte', 'Vermylen, Christiane', 'Maiter, Dominique']","['Benmiloud S', 'Steffens M', 'Beauloye V', 'de Wandeleer A', 'Devogelaer JP', 'Brichard B', 'Vermylen C', 'Maiter D']","['Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Horm Res Paediatr,Hormone research in paediatrics,101525157,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Body Height/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Bone Density/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Cranial Irradiation/adverse effects', 'Dexamethasone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Femur Neck/chemistry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hip/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Lumbar Vertebrae/chemistry', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",,2010/04/17 06:00,2011/02/15 06:00,['2010/04/17 06:00'],"['2009/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['000313397 [pii]', '10.1159/000313397 [doi]']",ppublish,Horm Res Paediatr. 2010;74(4):241-50. doi: 10.1159/000313397.

Myeloid nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA) is expressed only in myeloid cells and has been implicated in cell differentiation; however, its function in mature neutrophils is not known. OBJECTIVES: We studied whether MNDA could contribute to regulation of apoptosis of neutrophils from healthy subjects and patients with sepsis, and investigated the impact of MNDA knockdown on apoptosis. METHODS: Human neutrophils were challenged with mediators of sepsis and neutrophils from patients with sepsis were cultured to investigate cleavage and cytoplasmic accumulation of MNDA. MNDA was knocked down in myeloid HL-60 cells to investigate development of apoptosis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During constitutive apoptosis of human neutrophils, MNDA is cleaved by caspases and accumulated in the cytoplasm, where it promotes degradation of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, thereby accelerating collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Culture of neutrophils with LPS, bacterial DNA, or platelet-activating factor prevented MNDA cleavage and cytoplasmic accumulation. MNDA knockdown with short hairpin RNA markedly attenuated Mcl-1 turnover and conferred resistance to stress-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Neutrophils from patients with severe sepsis exhibited markedly suppressed apoptosis that was associated with impaired cytoplasmic MNDA accumulation, preservation of Mcl-1 expression, and mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Culture of neutrophils of healthy subjects with septic plasma delayed apoptosis and cytoplasmic MNDA accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that cytoplasmic accumulation of MNDA facilitates progression of apoptosis and suggest that impaired cytoplasmic MNDA accumulation contributes to delayed neutrophil apoptosis in patients with severe sepsis.","['Fotouhi-Ardakani, Nasser', 'Kebir, Driss El', 'Pierre-Charles, Natacha', 'Wang, Lili', 'Ahern, Stephane P', 'Filep, Janos G', 'Milot, Eric']","['Fotouhi-Ardakani N', 'Kebir DE', 'Pierre-Charles N', 'Wang L', 'Ahern SP', 'Filep JG', 'Milot E']","['Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,9421642,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (MNDA protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/genetics/*physiology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neutrophils/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Sepsis/*pathology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology']",,2010/04/17 06:00,2010/09/16 06:00,['2010/04/17 06:00'],"['2010/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['201001-0075OC [pii]', '10.1164/rccm.201001-0075OC [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2010 Aug 1;182(3):341-50. doi: 10.1164/rccm.201001-0075OC.

Two criteria were used to characterize ZAP-70 expression into positive, negative, and indeterminate categories and applied to 111 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) resulting in 29.7% positive, 56.8% negative, and 13.5% indeterminate cases. A sensitivity-specificity crossover plot between ZAP-70 and CD38 suggested a cutoff of 12.5% for defining CD38 positivity. ZAP-70+ cases were significantly more likely to be at a higher clinical stage and, together with CD38+ cases, were more likely to have unmutated IgV(H). However, for individual patients, the concordance between these markers was not perfect.

Outcome for both groups was poor (relapsed or refractory in 49/61 [80%] cases); however, patients with t-AML were generally older and female, with worse outcome (P = .03), likely secondary to t-AML mostly arising in patients with breast cancer following topoisomerase inhibitor-containing chemotherapy.

However, the precise mechanism of BLT1 expression is not fully understood. Here we report that acute myeloid leukemia 1 (AML1/Runx1) is involved in the enhancement of BLT1 expression in leukocytes. In retinoic acid (RA)-stimulated human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells, the transcription of the BLT1 gene was found to be significantly activated. RA did not directly modulate the BLT1 promoter, suggesting enhancers in other loci. DNase I-hypersensitivity analyses revealed an activated region, termed AE-BLex, at the intron-I:exon-II boundary. AE-BLex acts as an enhancer for the BLT1 promoter and possesses 2 AML1 recognition sites. The importance of AML1 was determined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, reporter assays, and knockdown experiments. We demonstrated that the enhancement of BLT1 expression during the RA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells is due to a loosening of the chromatin structure around AE-BLex, which leads to the incremental binding of AML1. The AML1/AE-BLex complex was confirmed in other BLT1- expressing leukemia cell lines and human peripheral leukocytes. Thus, AML1 enhances BLT1 expression by binding to AE-BLex, which is accessible in leukocytes.","['Hashidate, Tomomi', 'Murakami, Naoka', 'Nakagawa, Masahiro', 'Ichikawa, Motoshi', 'Kurokawa, Mineo', 'Shimizu, Takao', 'Nakamura, Motonao']","['Hashidate T', 'Murakami N', 'Nakagawa M', 'Ichikawa M', 'Kurokawa M', 'Shimizu T', 'Nakamura M']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (LTB4R protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Leukotriene B4)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Binding/genetics/physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, Leukotriene B4/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",,2010/04/17 06:00,2010/09/23 06:00,['2010/04/17 06:00'],"['2010/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['fj.10-156844 [pii]', '10.1096/fj.10-156844 [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2010 Sep;24(9):3500-10. doi: 10.1096/fj.10-156844.

The MLL-AF6 fusion gene represents the most common leukemogenic fusion of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) to a cytoplasmic partner protein. Here, we identified a highly conserved Ras association (RA1) domain at the amino-terminus of AF6 as the minimal region sufficient for MLL-AF6 mediated myeloid progenitor immortalization in vitro and short latency leukemogenesis in vivo. Moreover, the ability of RA1 to activate MLL oncogenesis is conserved with its Drosophila ortholog, Canoe. Although the AF6 RA1 domain has previously been defined as an interaction surface for guanosine triphosphate-bound Ras, single amino acid substitutions known to abolish the AF6-Ras interaction did not abrogate MLL-AF6-mediated oncogenesis. Furthermore, fusion of MLL to heterologous RA domains of c-Raf1 or RalGDS, or direct fusion of MLL to constitutively active K-RAS, H-RAS, or RAP1 was not sufficient for oncogenic activation of MLL. Rather, the AF6 RA1 domain efficiently mediated self-association, suggesting that constitutive MLL self-association is a more common pathogenic mechanism for MLL oncogenesis than indicated by previous studies of rare MLL fusion partners.","['Liedtke, Michaela', 'Ayton, Paul M', 'Somervaille, Tim C P', 'Smith, Kevin S', 'Cleary, Michael L']","['Liedtke M', 'Ayton PM', 'Somervaille TC', 'Smith KS', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, 300 Pasteur Drive, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Afdn protein, mouse)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)', 'EC 3.6.4.4 (Kinesins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinesins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myosins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'ras Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",,2010/04/17 06:00,2010/08/25 06:00,['2010/04/17 06:00'],"['2010/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34761-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-09-243386 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jul 8;116(1):63-70. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-09-243386.

We evaluated the association of HDI with rates and outcomes of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for patients with acute leukemia. For the analysis of HSCT rates, all adults with acute leukemia (n = 16 403) treated in 30 European countries, between 2001 and 2005, were included. Association of HDI with the outcome was analyzed for 2015 patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated with myeloablative allotransplantation. Countries were classified according to HDI quintiles. Highly significant correlation was found for HDI and the total number of HSCT per population (R = 0.78; P < .001), as well as separately for sibling HSCT (R = 0.84; P < .001), unrelated HSCT (R = 0.66; P < .001), and autologous HSCT (R = 0.43; P = .02). The probabilities of leukemia-free survival for 5 consecutive groups of countries with increasing HDI were: 56%, 59%, 63%, 58%, and 68% (P = .01). In a multivariate analysis, transplantations performed in countries belonging to the upper HDI category were associated with higher leukemia-free survival compared with the remaining ones (HR = 1.36, P = .008), which resulted mainly from reduced risk of relapse (HR = 0.72, P = .04).

Although necessary for viral propagation in vivo, the mechanism of function of p13 is incompletely understood. Drawing from studies in isolated mitochondria, we analyzed the effects of p13 on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in transformed and primary T cells. In transformed cells (Jurkat, HeLa), p13 did not affect ROS unless the cells were subjected to glucose deprivation, which led to a p13-dependent increase in ROS and cell death. Using RNA interference we confirmed that expression of p13 also influences glucose starvation-induced cell death in the context of HTLV-1-infected cells. ROS measurements showed an increasing gradient from resting to mitogen-activated primary T cells to transformed T cells (Jurkat). Expression of p13 in primary T cells resulted in their activation, an effect that was abrogated by ROS scavengers. These findings suggest that p13 may have a distinct impact on cell turnover depending on the inherent ROS levels; in the context of the HTLV-1 propagation strategy, p13 could increase the pool of ""normal"" infected cells while culling cells acquiring a transformed phenotype, thus favoring lifelong persistence of the virus in the host.","['Silic-Benussi, Micol', 'Cavallari, Ilaria', 'Vajente, Nicola', 'Vidali, Silvia', 'Chieco-Bianchi, Luigi', 'Di Lisa, Fabio', 'Saggioro, Daniela', ""D'Agostino, Donna M"", 'Ciminale, Vincenzo']","['Silic-Benussi M', 'Cavallari I', 'Vajente N', 'Vidali S', 'Chieco-Bianchi L', 'Di Lisa F', 'Saggioro D', ""D'Agostino DM"", 'Ciminale V']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, Institute of Neuroscience at the Department of Biomedical Sciences, Universita di Padova, Via Gattamelata 64, Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (rof protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'RNA Interference', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism/virology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,2010/04/17 06:00,2010/08/25 06:00,['2010/04/17 06:00'],"['2010/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34760-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-07-235861 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jul 8;116(1):54-62. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-07-235861.

The WT1 gene is highly expressed in leukemia and various types of solid tumors, whereas WT1 is a tumor marker convenient for the detection of minimal residual disease of leukemia. The WT1 gene was originally defined as a tumor suppressor gene, but we proposed that it was, on the contrary, an oncogene. Furthermore, the WT1 protein has proven to be a promising tumor-associated antigen, in which many human leukocyte antigen class I- or II-restricted WT1 epitopes have been identified. Clinical trials of WT1-targeted immunotherapy have confirmed its safety and clinical efficacy. WT1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and WT1 antibodies are spontaneously induced in tumor-bearing patients, probably because of high immunogenicity of the WT1 protein. WT1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes make a major contribution to the graft-versus-leukemia effect after allogenic stem cell transplantation. When 75 cancer antigens including WT1 were prioritized according to several criteria such as therapeutic function and immunogenicity, WT1 was ranked as the top antigen.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 111 and 45 mouse atrophic thymuses at 40 and 80 days, respectively, after gamma-irradiation were analyzed with polymerase chain reaction for D-J rearrangements at the TCRbeta locus, flow cytometry for cell cycle, and Western blotting for the activation of DNA damage checkpoints. RESULTS: Limited D-J rearrangement patterns distinct from normal thymus were detected at high frequencies (43 of 111 for 40-day thymus and 21 of 45 for 80-day thymus). Those clonally expanded thymocytes mostly consisted of CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive cells, indicating the retention of lineage capability. They exhibited pausing at a late G1 phase of cell cycle progression but did not show the activation of DNA damage checkpoints such as gammaH2AX, Chk1/2, or p53. Of interest is that 17 of the 52 thymuses showing normal D-J rearrangement patterns at 40 days after irradiation showed allelic loss at the Bcl11b tumor suppressor locus, also indicating clonal expansion. CONCLUSION: The thymocytes of clonal growth detected resemble human chronic myeloid leukemia in possessing self-renewal and lineage capability, and therefore they can be a candidate of the lymphoma-initiating cells.","['Yamamoto, Takashi', 'Morita, Shin-ichi', 'Go, Rieka', 'Obata, Miki', 'Katsuragi, Yoshinori', 'Fujita, Yukari', 'Maeda, Yoshitaka', 'Yokoyama, Minesuke', 'Aoyagi, Yutaka', 'Ichikawa, Hitoshi', 'Mishima, Yukio', 'Kominami, Ryo']","['Yamamoto T', 'Morita S', 'Go R', 'Obata M', 'Katsuragi Y', 'Fujita Y', 'Maeda Y', 'Yokoyama M', 'Aoyagi Y', 'Ichikawa H', 'Mishima Y', 'Kominami R']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Chuo-ku, Niigata, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (MDC1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (gamma-H2AX protein, mouse)', '144713-63-3 (Neuropilin-1)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Atrophy/pathology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/pathology/radiation effects', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/pathology/radiation effects', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Proliferation/radiation effects', '*DNA Damage', 'Gamma Rays', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/genetics/*pathology', 'Neuropilin-1/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Precancerous Conditions/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology/*radiation effects', 'Thymus Gland/pathology/*radiation effects', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",,2010/04/17 06:00,2010/04/29 06:00,['2010/04/17 06:00'],"['2009/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/05 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0360-3016(09)03454-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.11.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 May 1;77(1):235-43. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.11.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Omalizumab (Xolair) is a humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibody directed at the FcepsilonRI-binding domain of human IgE, which represents a novel therapeutic approach in the management of asthma. In this study, we developed a monoclonal antibody (7A5) against human IgE via hybridoma technique. Our data showed that 7A5 could inhibit free IgE molecules to bind to receptors without affecting IgE already bound to cellular receptors. Importantly, 7A5 was able to inhibit IgE-induced histamine release of basophilic leukemia cells. Next, the phage display peptide library technology was employed to select peptides binding to 7A5 and a striking peptide sequence motif was recovered, which is homologous to the sequence (391)KQR(393) within the Cepsilon3 domain of IgE-Fc, Our results further indicated that 7A5 specifically bound to the synthesized peptide ""(388)KEEKQRN(394)"" containing the (391)KQR(393) motif in IgE-Fc. The epitope of 7A5 was found to be spatially close to the FcepsilonRI-binding site, suggesting that 7A5 binding to IgE might block IgE binding to receptors via steric hindrance. The anti-IgE monoclonal antibody 7A5 may have the potential to be developed as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of allergic diseases.","['Qian, Weizhu', 'Zhang, Xunmin', 'Li, Bohua', 'Zhang, Dapeng', 'Tong, Qing', 'Chen, Lin', 'Zheng, Lei', 'Kou, Geng', 'Wang, Hao', 'Hou, Sheng', 'Guo, Yajun']","['Qian W', 'Zhang X', 'Li B', 'Zhang D', 'Tong Q', 'Chen L', 'Zheng L', 'Kou G', 'Wang H', 'Hou S', 'Guo Y']","[""International Joint Cancer Institute, Second Military Medical University, 800 Xiangyin Road, Shanghai 200433, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (anti-IgE antibodies)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/biosynthesis/chemistry/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis/chemistry/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides/immunology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*immunology']",,2010/04/17 06:00,2010/06/23 06:00,['2010/04/17 06:00'],"['2010/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(10)00732-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.04.063 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2010 May 14;395(4):547-52. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.04.063.

We present previously unpublished data from two large phase III trials describing common adverse events (AEs) associated with azacitidine and methods to manage them. METHODS: In the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9221 study, patients with any French-American-British (FAB) subtype of MDS were randomized to azacitidine or best supportive care (BSC). After 56 d, patients randomized to BSC with disease progression could cross over to receive azacitidine. In the AZA-001 study, patients with higher-risk MDS (FAB-defined refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation, or chronic myelomonocitic leukaemia and IPSS int-2 or high) were randomized to azacitidine or to conventional care regimens (CCR), which included low-dose ara-C, BSC, or intensive chemotherapy. In both studies, azacitidine dose was 75 mg/m(2)/d SC for 7 d every 28 d. AEs were graded per National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0 (AZA-001) or CALGB Expanded CTC (CALGB 9221). RESULTS: In safety-evaluable patients in AZA-001 (N = 175) or CALGB 9221 (N = 150), the most common AEs with azacitidine included hematologic (eg, cytopenias) and non-hematologic administration-related events (eg, injection-site reactions and gastrointestinal disorders). Most AEs were transient and resolved during ongoing therapy (> 83%). Hematologic AEs, most frequently observed during early treatment cycles, decreased during subsequent cycles and were usually managed with dosing delays (23-29%). Gastrointestinal symptoms were primarily managed with anti-emetics and laxatives. CONCLUSION: Hematologic and non-hematologic AEs with azacitidine decreased in frequency as treatment continued. Awareness of the onset, duration and management of AEs can facilitate treatment, permitting patients to continue therapy for maximum benefit.","['Santini, Valeria', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva', 'Silverman, Lewis R', 'List, Alan', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Seymour, John F', 'Backstrom, Jay', 'Beach, Charles L']","['Santini V', 'Fenaux P', 'Mufti GJ', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Silverman LR', 'List A', 'Gore SD', 'Seymour JF', 'Backstrom J', 'Beach CL']","['Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy. valeria.santini@unifi.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic', 'Azacitidine/*adverse effects', 'Disease Management', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2010/04/17 06:00,2010/08/18 06:00,['2010/04/17 06:00'],"['2010/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/18 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1456 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01456.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 Aug;85(2):130-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01456.x.

In contrast to typical HCL, there was no significant clinical response to splenectomy or treatment with alpha-interferon but leucophoresis was found to be important in maintaining a stable WBC count. Additionally, morphological (light and electron microscopy), cytochemical (ANAE +, AcP +, TRAcP -) and immunophenotypic (CDlc +, CDllc +, CD19 +, CD20 +, CD23-, CD25-, FMC7 +, HC2-) studies of HCL-v cells were undertaken together with an extensive analysis of cellular characteristics (including RNA/DNA synthesis) following in-vitro culture. In contrast to typical HCL cells, but in common with CLL/PLL cells, TPA did not induce the 'acquisition' of long fibroblast-like cytoplasmic extensions. However, plasmacytoid features could be induced by culture in the presence of TPA plus the calcium ionophore A23187. Furthermore, although some TRAcP isoenzyme synthesis could be induced by TPA, its level of staining (IEF) did not reach the same intensity as that usually observed for HCL. In-vitro culture studies, with TPA and TPA/A23187 as well as a number of immunomodulators, were also used to examine the rates of immunoglobulin (Ig) and beta(2)-microglobulin (B(2)m) secretion. TPA alone was the most potent stimulator of both Ig and B(2)m production whereas the addition of A23187 to TPA cultures induced a marked suppression of Ig production but only minimally affected B(2)m secretion. For comparison, bryostatin-1, r IFN-lambda, r IL-2 and r TNF were all considerably less effective than TPA in the induction of B(2)m production. These observations further support the contention that HCL-v represents a leukaemia subtype intermediate between HCL and B-PLL and that recognition of this variant is of particular importance in therapeutic management.","['Scott, C S', 'Hunt, K M', 'Jones, R A', 'Gignac, S M', 'Matutes, E', 'Drexler, H G']","['Scott CS', 'Hunt KM', 'Jones RA', 'Gignac SM', 'Matutes E', 'Drexler HG']","['Department of Haematology, Cookridge Hospital, Leeds.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['2010/04/17 06:00'],"['2010/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1080/10428199009169600 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1990;1(5-6):307-17. doi: 10.1080/10428199009169600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings coupled with the observations that B-CLL cells produce cytokines which are normally secreted by stimulated B cells provide further evidence for the similarity between normal activated B cells and B-CLL cells.","['Freedman, A S', 'Nadler, L M']","['Freedman AS', 'Nadler LM']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['2010/04/17 06:00'],"['2010/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1080/10428199009169598 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1990;1(5-6):293-300. doi: 10.1080/10428199009169598.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report that packaging of IM into a biodegradable carrier based on polyelectrolyte microcapsules increases drug retention and antitumor activity in CML stem cells, also improving the ex vivo purging of malignant progenitors from patient autografts. MATERIALS & METHODS: Microparticles/capsules were obtained by layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly of oppositely charged polyelectrolyte multilayers on removable calcium carbonate (CaCO(3)) templates and loaded with or without IM. A leukemic cell line (KU812) and CD34(+) cells freshly isolated from healthy donors or CML patients were tested. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: Polyelectrolyte microcapsules (PMCs) with an average diameter of 3 microm, fluorescently labelled multilayers sensitive to the action of intracellular proteases and 95-99% encapsulation efficiency of IM, were prepared. Cell uptake efficiency of such biodegradable carriers was quantified in KU812, leukemic and normal CD34(+) stem cells (range: 70-85%), and empty PMCs did not impact cell viability. IM-loaded PMCs selectively targeted CML cells, by promoting apoptosis at doses that exert only cytostatic effects by IM alone. More importantly, residual CML cells from patient leukapheresis products were reduced or eliminated more efficiently by using IM-loaded PMCs compared with freely soluble IM, with a purging efficiency of several logs. No adverse effects on normal CD34(+) stem-cell survival and their clonogenic potential was noticed in long-term cultures of hematopoietic progenitors in vitro. CONCLUSION: This pilot study provides the proof-of-principle for the clinical application of biodegradable IM-loaded PMC as feasible, safe and effective ex vivo purging agents to target CML stem cells, in order to improve transplant outcome of resistant/relapsed patients or reduce IM dose escalation.","['Palama, Ilaria E', 'Leporatti, Stefano', 'de Luca, Emanuela', 'Di Renzo, Nicola', 'Maffia, Michele', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Rinaldi, Ross', 'Gigli, Giuseppe', 'Cingolani, Roberto', 'Coluccia, Addolorata M L']","['Palama IE', 'Leporatti S', 'de Luca E', 'Di Renzo N', 'Maffia M', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Rinaldi R', 'Gigli G', 'Cingolani R', 'Coluccia AM']","['National Nanotechnology Laboratory of CNR-INFM, IIT Research Unit, Scuola Superiore ISUFI, University of Salento, Via Arnesano 73100 Lecce, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nanomedicine (Lond),"Nanomedicine (London, England)",101278111,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Capsules)', '0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Capsules/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Delayed-Action Preparations/*chemistry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",,2010/04/17 06:00,2010/07/06 06:00,['2010/04/17 06:00'],"['2010/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/nnm.10.8 [doi]'],ppublish,Nanomedicine (Lond). 2010 Apr;5(3):419-31. doi: 10.2217/nnm.10.8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: MTT assay was used to detect the proliferating activity of K562 cells, and the cellular apoptosis was assayed with Annexin V/PI double staining. Flow cytometry (FCM) was employed to determine the relative proportion of LSC in K562 cells. The self-renewal and proliferating potential were examined with methylcellulose colony-forming units (CFU) assay. RESULT: By use of MTT assay, we found PTL had significant inhibitory effect on the proliferation of K562 cells, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were 17.1, 8.67, 9.42 micromol x L(-1) for 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. After administration with 5 micromol x L(-1) and 10 micromol x L(-1) PTL, the apoptotic rate of K562 cells was (49.56 +/- 5.11)% and (71.88 +/- 2.12)%, and (52.63 +/- 4.14)% and (57.50 +/- 4.47)% in LCS-like (CD34 + CD38-) cells in K562 cell population, respectively. A slightly increase of relative content of LSC in K562 cells was observed. There was an 15-fold increase in the higher concentration of the PTL-treated cells. The methylcellulose colony-forming units assay showed a 24.1% to 89.2% decrease in the CFU of K562 cells administrated with 0.5 micromol x L(-1) to 4.0 micromol x L(-1) PTL, and the CFU of the surviving cells increased by 5.0% to 50.0% on condition that K562 cells were pre-treated with 5 micromol x L(-1) to 15 micromol x L(-1) PTL for 48 h.

METHODS: A total number of 37 patients were included in this analysis. We evaluated complete remission and molecular remission rate, incidence of relapse, patients' status at the end of the follow-up period, incidence of chemotherapy-related adverse events and causes of death. A statistical analysis of risk factors affecting survival was carried out. RESULTS: Complete remission was achieved in 36 (97%) patients and molecular remission in 16 (62%) of 26 evaluable patients. Disease relapse occurred in 5 (14%) patients. At the end of the follow-up period with a median of 261 days, 28 (76%) patients were alive in complete remission, one (3%) with relapsed disease and 8 (22%) dead. Treatment toxicity resulted in death in 5 cases, relapse or progression of ALL in 3 patients. Adverse events most often followed consolidation I, induction phase I, consolidation II and induction phase II. Infectious complications in the context of febrile neutropenia, GIT mucositis and side effects of PEG-asparaginase were the most common adverse events observed. The toxicity of allogeneic transplantation was not unexpected, four (25%) patients died after transplantation. Two-year progression-free and overall survival were 66% and 70%, respectively. High risk ALL, age over 35 years, CNS infiltration, disease relapse and permanent minimal residual disease were identified as the major adverse prognostic risk factors. Practical experiences and possible pitfalls of the protocol are described in the discussion. CONCLUSION: Our initial impression is promising. The treatment is feasible, the results very good and the toxicity acceptable. Patients at high risk should be headed to allogeneic transplantation, since the results ofconsolidation chemotherapy alone are very poor in this group.

Several autoimmune diseases (AD) are associated with enhanced frequencies of CD5(+) B cells. Since AD are also associated with elevated IL-21 and GzmB levels, we postulated a link between CD5(+) B cells, IL-21 and GzmB. Here, we demonstrate that IL-21 and GzmB serum levels are highly correlated in subjects with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and that freshly isolated CD5(+) SLE B cells constitutively express GzmB. IL-21 directly induced GzmB expression and secretion by CD5(+) B cells from several AD and from cord blood in vitro, and the simultaneous presence of BCR stimulation strongly enhanced this process. Furthermore, IL-21 suppressed both viability and expansion of CD5(+) B cells from SLE individuals. In summary, our study may explain the elevated levels of IL-21 and GzmB in SLE and other AD. Moreover, our data suggest that IL-21 may have disease-modifying characteristics by inducing GzmB in CD5(+) B cells and by suppressing their expansion. Our results provide the rationale for further evaluation of the therapeutic potential of IL-21 in certain AD such as SLE.","['Hagn, Magdalena', 'Ebel, Verena', 'Sontheimer, Kai', 'Schwesinger, Elisabeth', 'Lunov, Oleg', 'Beyer, Thamara', 'Fabricius, Dorit', 'Barth, Thomas F E', 'Viardot, Andreas', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Hepp, Julia', 'Scharffetter-Kochanek, Karin', 'Simmet, Thomas', 'Jahrsdorfer, Bernd']","['Hagn M', 'Ebel V', 'Sontheimer K', 'Schwesinger E', 'Lunov O', 'Beyer T', 'Fabricius D', 'Barth TF', 'Viardot A', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Hepp J', 'Scharffetter-Kochanek K', 'Simmet T', 'Jahrsdorfer B']","['Institute of Pharmacology of Natural Products and Clinical Pharmacology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-21)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'MKM3CA6LT1 (interleukin-21)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'CD5 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Female', 'Granzymes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Interleukins/*biosynthesis/blood/genetics/immunology', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/blood/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptor Cross-Talk/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-21/biosynthesis/genetics']",,2010/04/16 06:00,2010/11/04 06:00,['2010/04/16 06:00'],"['2010/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.200940113 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2010 Jul;40(7):2060-9. doi: 10.1002/eji.200940113.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ligand binding triggers a conformational change in the receptor negative regulatory region (NRR) that enables ADAM protease cleavage at a juxtamembrane site that otherwise lies buried within the quiescent NRR. Subsequent intramembrane proteolysis catalysed by the gamma-secretase complex liberates the intracellular domain (ICD) to initiate the downstream Notch transcriptional program. Aberrant signalling through each receptor has been linked to numerous diseases, particularly cancer, making the Notch pathway a compelling target for new drugs. Although gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) have progressed into the clinic, GSIs fail to distinguish individual Notch receptors, inhibit other signalling pathways and cause intestinal toxicity, attributed to dual inhibition of Notch1 and 2 (ref. 11). To elucidate the discrete functions of Notch1 and Notch2 and develop clinically relevant inhibitors that reduce intestinal toxicity, we used phage display technology to generate highly specialized antibodies that specifically antagonize each receptor paralogue and yet cross-react with the human and mouse sequences, enabling the discrimination of Notch1 versus Notch2 function in human patients and rodent models. Our co-crystal structure shows that the inhibitory mechanism relies on stabilizing NRR quiescence. Selective blocking of Notch1 inhibits tumour growth in pre-clinical models through two mechanisms: inhibition of cancer cell growth and deregulation of angiogenesis. Whereas inhibition of Notch1 plus Notch2 causes severe intestinal toxicity, inhibition of either receptor alone reduces or avoids this effect, demonstrating a clear advantage over pan-Notch inhibitors. Our studies emphasize the value of paralogue-specific antagonists in dissecting the contributions of distinct Notch receptors to differentiation and disease and reveal the therapeutic promise in targeting Notch1 and Notch2 independently.","['Wu, Yan', 'Cain-Hom, Carol', 'Choy, Lisa', 'Hagenbeek, Thijs J', 'de Leon, Gladys P', 'Chen, Yongmei', 'Finkle, David', 'Venook, Rayna', 'Wu, Xiumin', 'Ridgway, John', 'Schahin-Reed, Dorreyah', 'Dow, Graham J', 'Shelton, Amy', 'Stawicki, Scott', 'Watts, Ryan J', 'Zhang, Jeff', 'Choy, Robert', 'Howard, Peter', 'Kadyk, Lisa', 'Yan, Minhong', 'Zha, Jiping', 'Callahan, Christopher A', 'Hymowitz, Sarah G', 'Siebel, Christian W']","['Wu Y', 'Cain-Hom C', 'Choy L', 'Hagenbeek TJ', 'de Leon GP', 'Chen Y', 'Finkle D', 'Venook R', 'Wu X', 'Ridgway J', 'Schahin-Reed D', 'Dow GJ', 'Shelton A', 'Stawicki S', 'Watts RJ', 'Zhang J', 'Choy R', 'Howard P', 'Kadyk L', 'Yan M', 'Zha J', 'Callahan CA', 'Hymowitz SG', 'Siebel CW']","['Department of Antibody Engineering, Genentech, Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH2 protein, human)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Notch2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptor, Notch2)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/immunology/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/adverse effects/immunology/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody Specificity/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Goblet Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neoplasms/blood supply/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy', 'Peptide Library', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptor, Notch1/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Receptor, Notch2/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Receptors, Notch/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,2010/04/16 06:00,2010/06/03 06:00,['2010/04/16 06:00'],"['2009/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/03 06:00 [medline]']","['nature08878 [pii]', '10.1038/nature08878 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2010 Apr 15;464(7291):1052-7. doi: 10.1038/nature08878.,,,,,,,,['Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2010 Jun;9(6):431.

Although all MM tumors and cell lines with a t(4;14) translocation have dysregulated MMSET, about 25% do not express FGFR3. Therefore, the function of dysregulated wild-type (WT) FGFR3 in the pathogenesis of MM remains unclear. We developed a murine transgenic (TG) model in which WT FGFR3 is overexpressed in B lymphoid cells. Although high levels of FGFR3 resulted in lymphoid hyperplasia in about one-third of older mice, no increase in tumorigenesis was observed. However, double TG FGFR3/Myc mice develop mature B lymphoma tumors that occur with a higher penetrance and shorter latency than in single TG Myc mice (P=0.006). We conclude that expression of high levels of WT FGFR3 can be oncogenic and cooperate with MYC to generate B lymphoid tumors. This suggests that dysregulated FGFR3 expression is likely to be essential at least for the early stages of pathogenesis of MM tumors that have a t(4;14) translocation.","['Zingone, A', 'Cultraro, C M', 'Shin, D-M', 'Bean, C M', 'Morse, H C 3rd', 'Janz, S', 'Kuehl, W M']","['Zingone A', 'Cultraro CM', 'Shin DM', 'Bean CM', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Janz S', 'Kuehl WM']","['Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20889-5105, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Multiple Myeloma/*etiology/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2010/04/16 06:00,2010/07/07 06:00,['2010/04/16 06:00'],"['2010/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201050 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.50 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Jun;24(6):1171-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.50.

Previously, we reported that in UVB-irradiated keratinocytes, p38(MAPK) instigates Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) activation and mitochondrial apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the pro-apoptotic function of p38(MAPK) remained unclear. Here, we show that in UVB-treated human primary keratinocytes the activation of p38(MAPK) is necessary to upregulate Noxa, a BH3-only pro-apoptotic dominantly induced by UVB and required for apoptosis. Whereas p53-silencing was marginally cytoprotective and poorly affected Noxa expression, p38(MAPK) inhibition in p53-silenced keratinocytes or in p53(-/-) cells could still efficiently prevent Noxa induction and intrinsic apoptosis after UVB, indicating that p38(MAPK) signals mainly through p53-independent mechanisms. Furthermore, p38(MAPK) was required for the induction and activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) in response to UVB, and HIF-1 knockdown reduced Noxa expression and apoptosis. In UVB-irradiated keratinocytes, Noxa targeted the anti-apoptotic myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) for degradation, and small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of Noxa or p38(MAPK) inhibition restored levels of Mcl-1 and abolished apoptosis. Thus, the pro-apoptotic mechanisms orchestrated by p38(MAPK) in human keratinocytes in response to UVB involve an HIF-1/Noxa axis, which prompts the downregulation of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1, thereby favoring Bax-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis of UVB-damaged keratinocytes.","['Nys, Kris', 'Van Laethem, An', 'Michiels, Carine', 'Rubio, Noemi', 'Piette, Jacques G', 'Garmyn, Maria', 'Agostinis, Patrizia']","['Nys K', 'Van Laethem A', 'Michiels C', 'Rubio N', 'Piette JG', 'Garmyn M', 'Agostinis P']","['Cell Death Research and Therapy Laboratory, Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Catholic University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '3FT64DYG8K (triflumuron)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology/radiation effects', 'Benzamides', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*metabolism', '*Keratinocytes/cytology/enzymology/radiation effects', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Skin Neoplasms/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays/*adverse effects', 'Up-Regulation/physiology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",,2010/04/16 06:00,2010/09/18 06:00,['2010/04/16 06:00'],"['2010/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-202X(15)34977-0 [pii]', '10.1038/jid.2010.93 [doi]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 2010 Sep;130(9):2269-76. doi: 10.1038/jid.2010.93.

We designed a new trial (LPA2005) with the objective of achieving stepwise improvements in outcome. Between July 2005 and April 2009, low- and intermediate-risk patients (leukocytes < 10 x 10(9)/L) received a reduced dose of mitoxantrone for the second consolidation course, whereas high- risk patients younger than 60 years of age received cytarabine combined with ATRA and idarubicin in the first and third consolidation courses. Of 372 patients attaining complete remission after ATRA plus idarubicin (92.5%), 368 proceeded to consolidation therapy. For low- and intermediate-risk patients, duration of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and hospital stay were significantly reduced without sacrificing antileukemic efficacy, compared with the previous LPA99 trial. For high-risk patients, the 3-year relapse rate was significantly lower in the LPA2005 trial (11%) than in the LPA99 (26%; P = .03). Overall disease-free survival was also better in the LPA2005 trial (P = .04). In conclusion, the lower dose of mitoxantrone resulted in a significant reduction of toxicity and hospital stay while maintaining the antileukemic activity, and the combination of ATRA, idarubicin, and cytarabine for high-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia significantly reduced the relapse rate in this setting.

However, activating mutations of Flt3 are among the most common genetic events in acute myeloid leukemia and mice harboring internal tandem duplications within Flt3 (Flt3-ITD) develop myeloproliferative disease, with characteristic expansion of granulocyte-monocyte (GM) progenitors (GMP), possibly compatible with FLT3-ITD promoting a myeloid fate of multipotent progenitors. Alternatively, FLT3 might be expressed at the earliest stages of GM development. Herein, we investigated the expression, function, and role of FLT3 in recently identified early GMPs. Flt3-cre fate-mapping established that most progenitors and mature progeny of the GM lineage are derived from Flt3-expressing progenitors. A higher expression of FLT3 was found in preGMP compared with GMP, and preGMPs were more responsive to stimulation with FLT3 ligand (FL). Whereas preGMPs and GMPs were reduced in Fl(-/-) mice, megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors were unaffected and lacked FLT3 expression. Notably, mice deficient in both thrombopoietin (THPO) and FL had a more pronounced GMP phenotype than Thpo(-/-) mice, establishing a role of FL in THPO-dependent and -independent regulation of GMPs, of likely significance for myeloid malignancies with Flt3-ITD mutations.","['Boiers, Charlotta', 'Buza-Vidas, Natalija', 'Jensen, Christina T', 'Pronk, Cornelis J H', 'Kharazi, Shabnam', 'Wittmann, Lilian', 'Sitnicka, Ewa', 'Hultquist, Anne', 'Jacobsen, Sten Eirik W']","['Boiers C', 'Buza-Vidas N', 'Jensen CT', 'Pronk CJ', 'Kharazi S', 'Wittmann L', 'Sitnicka E', 'Hultquist A', 'Jacobsen SE']","['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Lineage/physiology', 'Gene Expression/physiology', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Thrombopoietin/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/*metabolism']",,2010/04/16 06:00,2010/07/10 06:00,['2010/04/16 06:00'],"['2010/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34864-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-12-258756 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jun 17;115(24):5061-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-12-258756.

To identify a powerful and easily assessable miRNA bio-marker of prognosis and survival, we performed quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) profiling in 104 CLL patients with a well-defined chromosome 17p status, and we validated our findings with miRNA microarray data from an independent cohort of 80 patients. We found that miR-15a, miR-21, miR-34a, miR-155, and miR-181b were differentially expressed between CLLs with chromosome 17p deletion and CLLs with normal 17p and normal karyotype, and that miR-181b was down-regulated in therapy-refractory cases. miR-21 expression levels were significantly higher in patients with poor prognosis and predicted overall survival (OS), and miR-181b expression levels significantly predicted treatment-free survival. We developed a 21FK score (miR-21 qRT-PCR, fluorescence in situ hybridization, Karyotype) to stratify patients according to OS and found that patients with a low score had a significantly longer OS time. When we evaluated the relative power of the 21FK score with the most used prognostic factors, the score was the most significant in both CLL cohorts. We conclude that the 21FK score represents a useful tool for distinguishing between good-prognosis and poor-prognosis CLL patients.","['Rossi, Simona', 'Shimizu, Masayoshi', 'Barbarotto, Elisa', 'Nicoloso, Milena S', 'Dimitri, Federica', 'Sampath, Deepa', 'Fabbri, Muller', 'Lerner, Susan', 'Barron, Lynn L', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Jiang, Li', 'Xiao, Lianchun', 'Hu, Jianhua', 'Secchiero, Paola', 'Zauli, Giorgio', 'Volinia, Stefano', 'Negrini, Massimo', 'Wierda, William', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Plunkett, William', 'Coombes, Kevin R', 'Abruzzo, Lynne V', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Calin, George A']","['Rossi S', 'Shimizu M', 'Barbarotto E', 'Nicoloso MS', 'Dimitri F', 'Sampath D', 'Fabbri M', 'Lerner S', 'Barron LL', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Jiang L', 'Xiao L', 'Hu J', 'Secchiero P', 'Zauli G', 'Volinia S', 'Negrini M', 'Wierda W', 'Kipps TJ', 'Plunkett W', 'Coombes KR', 'Abruzzo LV', 'Keating MJ', 'Calin GA']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.

However, the prognosis of older patients with APL remains poorer as compared to young adults because of substantial morbidity of either induction or consolidation therapy. We describe therapeutic results in a series of 34 consecutive APL patients aged over 60 years, with particular emphasis on those patients managed outside of clinical trials because of comorbidities at diagnosis. All patients were programmed to receive the GIMEMA AIDA protocol, based on all transretinoic acid as induction followed by chemotherapy as consolidation. The median age was 70 years. Twenty-three patients (68%) received the protocol, while 11 (32%) were given a personalized approach. The median age was 69 years for patients on protocol as opposed to 75 years for the remaining ones (p=0.02). Six patients (18%) died within two days of diagnosis; among these, only one was on the AIDA protocol. Overall, complete response (CR) was achieved in 68% of cases; the CR rate was 74% for patients on the protocol as opposed to 54 % for those not. The most frequent cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage. Patients accrued into the GIMEMA AIDA protocol achieved longer survival (median not reached vs. 10 months, p=0.03). In conclusion, our data demonstrate that at least 30% of older APL patients are not eligible to accrual in multicenter trials; furthermore, in this subset, the possibility of early death is substantial. However, when CR is achieved, a personalized consolidation approach can be adopted with the possibility of achieving long-term disease control.","['Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Finizio, Olimpia', ""D'Arco, Alfonso"", 'Mastrullo, Lucia', 'Cantore, Nicola', 'Musto, Pellegrino']","['Ferrara F', 'Finizio O', ""D'Arco A"", 'Mastrullo L', 'Cantore N', 'Musto P']","['Via Nicolo Piccinni 6, 80128, Napoli, Italy. felicettoferrara@katamail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2010/04/16 06:00,2010/05/19 06:00,['2010/04/16 06:00'],"['2010/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/19 06:00 [medline]']",['30/3/967 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2010 Mar;30(3):967-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the effects of the novel HDACi LGP1, a new simplified analogue of FR235222, in human leukaemia U937 cells resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: U937 cells were incubated with TRAIL/LGP1 for 24 h and apoptosis was evaluated using flow cytometric assay and cleavage of caspase-3 and (PARP) by Western blot. Western blot analysis was also used to detect the expression of p21, p27, (NF-kappaB), Bcl-2 and the levels of H4 histone acetylation. Finally, flow cytometry was used to monitor the enhancement of TRAIL-receptor levels. RESULTS: Treatment with LGP1 caused accumulation of acetylated histone H4 and G(1) cycle arrest accompanied by increase of p21. The compound was also able to sensitize U937 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through multiple mechanisms: (i) activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP; (ii) induction of p21 and p27; (iii) cleavage of NF-kappaB and down-regulation of Bcl-2. Finally, LGP1 induced up-regulation of TRAIL-R1 receptor expression. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that U937 cells can be effectively killed by a combination treatment of subtoxic doses of LGP1 and TRAIL.","[""D'Acunto, Cosimo Walter"", 'Carratu, Anna', 'Rodriquez, Manuela', 'Taddei, Maurizio', 'Parente, Luca', 'Petrella, Antonello']","[""D'Acunto CW"", 'Carratu A', 'Rodriquez M', 'Taddei M', 'Parente L', 'Petrella A']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Science, University of Salerno, Via Ponte Don Melillo 84084 Fisciano (Salerno), Italy. apetrella@unisa.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (LGP1 compound)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Peptides, Cyclic', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",,2010/04/16 06:00,2010/05/19 06:00,['2010/04/16 06:00'],"['2010/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/19 06:00 [medline]']",['30/3/887 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2010 Mar;30(3):887-94.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present collective data from NMR spectroscopy and titration calorimetry to reveal the selectivity of MCL-1 in binding BCL-2 homology 3 (BH3) ligands of interest for mammalian biology. The N-terminal sequence weakens the BH3 interactions but does not affect selectivity. Its removal by calpain-mediated limited proteolysis results in a stable BCL-2-like core domain of MCL-1 (cMCL-1). This core is necessary and sufficient for BH3 ligand binding. Significantly, we also characterized the in vitro protein-protein interaction between cMCL-1 and activated BID by size exclusion chromatography and NMR titrations. This interaction occurs in a very slow manner in solution but is otherwise similar to the interaction between cMCL-1 and BID-BH3 peptides. We also present the solution structure of complex cMCL-1xhBID-BH3, which completes the family portrait of MCL-1 complexes and may facilitate drug discovery against human tumors.","['Liu, Qian', 'Moldoveanu, Tudor', 'Sprules, Tara', 'Matta-Camacho, Edna', 'Mansur-Azzam, Nura', 'Gehring, Kalle']","['Liu Q', 'Moldoveanu T', 'Sprules T', 'Matta-Camacho E', 'Mansur-Azzam N', 'Gehring K']","['Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec H3G 1Y6, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Apoptosis', 'Calorimetry/methods', 'Calpain/chemistry', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",,2010/04/16 06:00,2010/07/22 06:00,['2010/04/16 06:00'],"['2010/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)58093-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.105452 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Jun 18;285(25):19615-24. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.105452.

Most previously established mouse iPS cell lines have been derived using feeder layers supplemented with exogenous LIF (leukaemia inhibitory factor). Although a feeder-free induction system has been developed in recent studies, LIF is still required for reprogramming, but its role in the generation of mouse iPS cells has remained elusive. In this study, we investigated its contribution to the induction of pluripotency. Our results showed that LIF activates AP (alkaline phosphatase) through a c-Myc-dependent mechanism. Moreover, it acts as a protective factor during the transition from AP-positive colonies to Oct3/4-positive cells.

Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL) is a peripheral T-cell neoplasm composed of highly pleomorphic lymphoid cells. We report an unusual case ofprimary PCL with misleading cellular morphology and some clinical and biologic similarities simulating ATLL. CASE: A 40-year-old Caribbean man presented with asthenia, epistaxis and diffuse bone pain. Blood cell count showed anemia and thrombocytopenia and a hyperleukocytosis composed of deeply basophilic cells with a polylobulated nucleus resembling flower cells. An ATLL diagnosis was given at first, without ruling out the possibility of a PCL diagnosis. Hypercalcemia and lytic bone lesions were compatible with both diagnoses. Immunophenotyping was key to the diagnosis of primary PCL. CONCLUSION: Some clinical and biological overlap may exist between PCL and ATLL, leading to a false diagnosis or delaying a correct one. An accurate cytologic analysis leading to a rapid detection of plasma cell markers is essential for an early diagnosis.","['Delhommeau, Francois', 'Huguet, Stephanie', 'Gachet, Julie', 'van den Akker, Jacqueline', 'Lagrange, Monique']","['Delhommeau F', 'Huguet S', 'Gachet J', 'van den Akker J', 'Lagrange M']","['Department of Biological Immunology and Haematology, Hopital Saint-Antoine, France. fdelhom@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,"['0 (Syndecan-1)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/analysis', 'Adult', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Male', 'Plasma Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Syndecan-1/analysis']",,2010/04/16 06:00,2010/05/19 06:00,['2010/04/16 06:00'],"['2010/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1159/000325006 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Cytol. 2010 Mar-Apr;54(2):187-9. doi: 10.1159/000325006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene function was evaluated in immortalized human B lymphocytes derived from a Chinese Han population with independent genotypes at 2 NQO1 SNP sites. 1,4-Benzoquinone was incubated with these immortalized lymphocytes of differing genotypes. Among the genotypes of 2 SNP examined, cell lines with rs1800566CC showed a higher NQO1 enzymic activity after a 48 h of treatment with 10 muM 1,4-BQ, and a lower comet rate compared with cells of CT/TT genotypes. Data suggested that NQO1 rs1800566 might serve as a functional genetic marker for benzene toxicity in the Chinese Han population.

METHODS: This population-based study on potential risk factors for childhood cancer was conducted by the German Childhood Cancer Registry (GCCR) and included a total of 1,867 registered cancer cases aged 0-14, diagnosed between October 1992 and September 1994. A total of 2,057 controls were randomly drawn from population registries, matched by age, gender, and region. Conditional logistic regression models for frequency-matched datasets were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Positive statistically significant associations with self-reported maternal antibiotic use were observed for acute lymphoid leukemia (based on 59 mothers exposed to antibiotics, OR = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.06-2.04), acute myeloid leukemia (18 exposed, OR = 3.21; 95% CI: 1.83-5.62), and Burkitt lymphoma (three exposed, OR = 5.89; 95% CI: 1.47-23.69), but not other cancer types. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide some support for the hypothesis that maternal use of antibiotics increases the risk of cancer in the offspring. Although recall bias is a concern, it is unlikely that this fully explains the observed effect. Further, the observed associations might be related to the underlying infections.","['Kaatsch, Peter', 'Scheidemann-Wesp, Ulrike', 'Schuz, Joachim']","['Kaatsch P', 'Scheidemann-Wesp U', 'Schuz J']","['German Childhood Cancer Registry, 55101 Mainz, Germany. peter.kaatsch@unimedizin-mainz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', '*Maternal Exposure', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",,2010/04/15 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/04/15 06:00'],"['2009/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-010-9561-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2010 Aug;21(8):1335-45. doi: 10.1007/s10552-010-9561-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, administration of Na2SeO3 antagonized the cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by NaAsO2. The NaAsO2 treatment resulted in a marked increase in p53 protein as early as 4 h and in Bcl-2 protein level by 12 h. In addition, p53 downregulation accompanied the combined treatment of NaAsO2 and Na2SeO3. Thus, our results indicate upregulation of p53 and Bcl-2 play acrucial role in the NaAsO2-induced G1 arrest and apoptosis of A375 cells and that downregulation p53 appears to contribute to the inhibition by Na2SeO3 of the effects induced by NaAsO2.","['Wang, Zhi-Fang', 'Guo, Xiong']","['Wang ZF', 'Guo X']","[""Faculty of Public Health, College of Medicine, Key Laboratory of Environment and Genes Related to Diseases, Ministry of Education, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Trace Elem Res,Biological trace element research,7911509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sodium Compounds)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '48OVY2OC72 (sodium arsenite)', 'HIW548RQ3W (Sodium Selenite)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenites/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Sodium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Sodium Selenite/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2010/04/15 06:00,2011/08/30 06:00,['2010/04/15 06:00'],"['2009/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12011-010-8674-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Trace Elem Res. 2011 Apr;140(1):7-17. doi: 10.1007/s12011-010-8674-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, predisposing germline mutations have not been identified. We will discuss the spectrum of conditions associated with CLL in families and the advances in identifying the underlying susceptibility genes. RECENT FINDINGS: Familial CLL does not appear to differ substantially from sporadic CLL in terms of prognostic markers and clinical outcome, although it may be associated with more indolent disease. The precursor condition, monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, also aggregates in CLL families. Linkage studies have been conducted in high-risk CLL families to screen the whole genome for susceptibility loci but no gene mutations have yet been identified by this method. Association studies of candidate genes have implicated several genes as being important in CLL but more studies are needed. Results from whole-genome association studies are promising. SUMMARY: The ability to conduct large-scale genomic studies in unrelated CLL patients and in high-risk CLL families will play an important role in detecting susceptibility genes for CLL over the next few years and thereby help to delineate causal pathways.","['Goldin, Lynn R', 'Slager, Susan L', 'Caporaso, Neil E']","['Goldin LR', 'Slager SL', 'Caporaso NE']","['Genetic Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7236, USA. goldinl@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Family Health', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Pedigree']",56,2010/04/15 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2010/04/15 06:00'],"['2010/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e328338cd99 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2010 Jul;17(4):350-5. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e328338cd99.,,,"['U01 CA118444/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 CP004410-31/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'CA118444/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2891437,['NIHMS203536'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE REPORT: We describe a 50-year-old woman with inoperable cervical carcinoma and chronic lymphatic B cell leukemia (B-CLL). Due to thrombocytopenia, a combined radiochemotherapy could not be performed. Intensitymodulated radiotherapy (IMRT) aiming at maximal bone sparing was planned. After a total dose of 45 Gy, a laparoscopic omentum plastic was performed to enable radiotherapy (RT) to full dose. 3 days later, an external beam boost was restarted to a cumulative dose of 50.4 Gy. Regular blood analysis showed low but stable blood counts. 4 weeks after RT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 30% regression of the tumor volume and, after transfusion of fresh-frozen plasma, a hysterectomy could be performed. 6 months after therapy, no recurrence or late toxicities had occurred. CONCLUSION: The clinical implementation of IMRT may potentially improve the therapeutic outcome of patients with cervix cancer, allowing dose escalation without increasing normal-tissue toxicity.","['Simeonova, Anna', 'Abo-Madyan, Yasser', 'Strobel, Philipp', 'Kleine, Werner', 'Schwarzbach, Matthias', 'Fleckenstein, Katharina', 'Wenz, Frederik']","['Simeonova A', 'Abo-Madyan Y', 'Strobel P', 'Kleine W', 'Schwarzbach M', 'Fleckenstein K', 'Wenz F']","['Klinik fur Strahlentherapie und Radioonkologie, Universitatsmedizin Mannheim, Universitat Heidelberg, Germany. anna.simeonova@umm.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Diseases/*etiology/*prevention & control', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Radiotherapy, Conformal/*adverse effects/*methods', 'Thrombocytopenia/*complications', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*complications/*radiotherapy']",,2010/04/15 06:00,2010/07/23 06:00,['2010/04/15 06:00'],"['2010/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['000286279 [pii]', '10.1159/000286279 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2010;33(4):189-92. doi: 10.1159/000286279.

VX-680 is a pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor active against all Bcr/Abl proteins but has not been extensively examined in preclinical models of Ph-positive ALL. Here, we have tested VX-680 for the treatment of Bcr/Abl-positive ALL when leukemic cells are protected by the presence of stroma. Under these conditions, VX-680 showed significant effects on primary human Ph-positive ALL cells both with and without the T315I mutation, including ablation of tyrosine phosphorylation downstream of Bcr/Abl, decreased viability, and induction of apoptosis. However, drug treatment of human Ph-positive ALL cells for 3 days followed by drug removal allowed the outgrowth of abnormal cells 21 days later, and on culture of mouse Bcr/Abl ALL cells on stroma with lower concentrations of VX-680, drug-resistant cells emerged. Combined treatment of human ALL cells lacking the T315I mutation with both VX-680 and dasatinib caused significantly more cytotoxicity than each drug alone. We suggest that use of VX-680 together with a second effective drug as first-line treatment for Ph-positive ALL is likely to be safer and more useful than second-line treatment with VX-680 as monotherapy for drug-resistant T315I Ph-positive ALL.","['Fei, Fei', 'Stoddart, Sonia', 'Groffen, John', 'Heisterkamp, Nora']","['Fei F', 'Stoddart S', 'Groffen J', 'Heisterkamp N']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '639089-54-6 (VX680)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2010/04/15 06:00,2010/08/21 06:00,['2010/04/15 06:00'],"['2010/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-10-0069 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0069 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2010 May;9(5):1318-27. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0069.

Here we report that Slug over-expression associated with Bcr-Abl is conditional upon the tyrosine kinase (TK) activity of 210 fusion protein. Slug over-expression is driven by transcriptional events eventually integrated by post-transcriptional mechanisms leading to protein stabilization and is at least partly regulated by the ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). It contributes to apoptosis resistance of leukemic progenitors through the repression of pro-apoptotic Puma. Moreover, Slug is a component of leukemic progenitor resistance to imatinib mesylate (IM) driven by Bcr-Abl point mutations and, in particular, by T315I. Slug over-expression associated with p210 Bcr-Abl TK either in the wild type (wt) or mutated conformation results in a significant reduction of E-cadherin, the substrate of Beta catenin at cell membranes. In conclusion, our results suggest that Slug has a central role in a complex network involved in prolonged survival and IM resistance of CML progenitors.","['Mancini, Manuela', 'Petta, Sara', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Salvestrini, Valentina', 'Barbieri, Enza', 'Santucci, Maria Alessandra']","['Mancini M', 'Petta S', 'Iacobucci I', 'Salvestrini V', 'Barbieri E', 'Santucci MA']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology Lorenzo e Ariosto Seragnoli, University of Bologna-Medical School, Via Massarenti 9, 40138-Bologna, Italy. mancini_manu@yahoo.com <mancini_manu@yahoo.com>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Snai2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Snail Family Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cadherins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Snail Family Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",,2010/04/15 06:00,2010/06/09 06:00,['2010/04/15 06:00'],"['2010/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(10)00096-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2010.04.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2010 Aug;22(8):1247-53. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2010.04.002.

METHODS: A standard analysis system was established by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) under the condition of 55 degrees C oven temperature and a linear acetonitrile gradient (4.0/min). While, a total of 10 cases of gastric biopsy samples were detected for methylation status of COX-2. RESULTS: The complete methylated human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) and unmethylated gastric cancer cell line (MGC803) were used as positive and negative control. The proportion of the methylated copies of COX-2 was calculated according to the peak heights of methylated (M) and unmethylated (U) COX-2 in same PCR amplicon. The formula was Y = 1.0608 x M/(M + U), R(2) = 0.9894. Among 10 biopsy samples, the proportions of methylated copies of COX-2 in 2 cases of dysplasia were higher than superficial gastritis and chronic atrophy gastritis (24.5%, 18.4% vs 7.6%, 9.6%).

Our method uses high affinity single strand DNA (ssDNA) aptamers against surface exposed target molecules on cells. The aptamers are subsequently removed from the cell surface using DNase nuclease treatment. We exemplified our method by labelling human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells with Qdot-ssDNA aptamers, and restoring them to the label-free condition by treatment with Benzonase. Binding of the fluorescent-aptamers to the cells was evaluated by measuring fluorescence intensity and was further confirmed using flow cytometry. Removal of the aptamers can be achieved in ~10 min by the DNase nuclease digestion. Incubation of cells with aptamers or with the nucleases results in no apparent damage to the cells and does not affect their growth rates. The latter were equivalent to the rates measured for the untreated cells. Our method provides an alternative to traditional antibody-based techniques and could be especially suitable for non-invasive reversible cell labelling and cell separations where maintaining native cell activity is needed.","['Terazono, Hideyuki', 'Anzai, Yu', 'Soloviev, Mikhail', 'Yasuda, Kenji']","['Terazono H', 'Anzai Y', 'Soloviev M', 'Yasuda K']","['Kanagawa Academy of Science and Technology, KSP East 310, 3-2-1 Sakado, Takatsu, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 213-0012, Japan. yasuda.bmi@tmd.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Nanobiotechnology,Journal of nanobiotechnology,101152208,,,,,2010/04/15 06:00,2010/04/15 06:01,['2010/04/15 06:00'],"['2006/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/15 06:01 [medline]']","['1477-3155-8-8 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-3155-8-8 [doi]']",epublish,J Nanobiotechnology. 2010 Apr 13;8:8. doi: 10.1186/1477-3155-8-8.,,,,20100413,PMC2861636,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The specific associations reported in one population, however, are rarely replicated in other populations. We attempted to explore these associations by performing a meta-analysis of published studies. Following a Medline search, we identified four studies which presented raw data on all allele associations with CML (significant and non-significant). Meta-analysis of these revealed a significant risk association with the HLA-A*02 (pooled odds ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval 1.10-1.61) allele and a significant protective effect with the HLA-B*35 allele (pooled odds ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.48-0.86). To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate the epidemiologic association between HLA-A*02 and the risk of CML, and we discuss this in the context of recent immunological studies reporting data on BCR-ABL fusion peptide presentation and subsequent immune response. Our findings suggest that individual epidemiological studies may lack statistical power, or may have other interfering factors which prevent the unmasking of overall associations. Meta-analyses of published studies may overcome these limitations and may prove useful in uncovering allele-disease associations.","['Naugler, Christopher', 'Liwski, Robert']","['Naugler C', 'Liwski R']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. christopher.naugler@cls.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'HLA-A Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-B Antigens/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Risk Factors']",,2010/04/15 06:00,2010/10/01 06:00,['2010/04/15 06:00'],"['2010/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428191003802340 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Jul;51(7):1288-92. doi: 10.3109/10428191003802340.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Fifteen patients with LIL and 12 healthy subjects (control group) were scanned with liver 2D CSI(31)P MRS by a 1.5T MR Scanner(Sonata, Siemens Corporation). Relative quantification of phosphorus metabolites including phosphomonoesters (PME), inorganic phosphate (Pi), phosphodiesters (PDE) and beta-adenosine- triphosphate (beta-ATP) were detected and after calibrated with model factor, the ratios of PME/PDE, PME/(PME+PDE), PME/ATP, PDE/ATP and Pi/ATP were analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with control group, the PME value, PME/PDE ratio, PME/(PME+PDE) ratio and PME/ATP ratio were increased in LIL group (1.992 +/-0.876 Compared with 1.167 +/-0.427, P <0.05), (0.551 +/-0.339 Compared with 0.254 +/-0.059,P <0.01), (0.326 +/-0.13 Compared with 0.199 +/-0.049, P <0.01)and (1.402 +/-0.654 Compared with 0.792 +/-0.232, P <0.01) respectively.

Aptamers have the ability to bind specifically to a range of targets, from small organic molecules to proteins. However, by using cell-based aptamer selection, we have developed a strategy to identify the molecular signatures on the surface of targeted cells by exploiting the differences at the molecular level between any two given cell types. By applying this method, we have generated a panel of aptamers for the specific recognition of leukemia cells, and we report the results in this study. The selected aptamers were found to bind to target cells with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K (d)) in the nanomolar-to-picomolar range. Overall, the cell-based selection process is simple, fast, straightforward, and reproducible. Most importantly, since this strategy can be implemented without prior knowledge of a target's specific molecular signature, cell-based aptamer selection holds great promise for the development of specific molecular probes for cancer diagnosis and cancer biomarker discovery.","['Meng, Ling', 'Sefah, Kwame', 'Colon, Dalia Lopez', 'Chen, Hui', ""O'Donoghue, Meghan"", 'Xiong, Xiangling', 'Tan, Weihong']","['Meng L', 'Sefah K', 'Colon DL', 'Chen H', ""O'Donoghue M"", 'Xiong X', 'Tan W']","['Department of Chemistry, Shands Cancer Center and Center for Research at the Bio/Nano Interface, UF Genetics Institute and McKnight Brain Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', '0 (DNA Primers)']",IM,"['Aptamers, Nucleotide/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Primers/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'SELEX Aptamer Technique/*methods']",,2010/04/14 06:00,2010/06/30 06:00,['2010/04/14 06:00'],"['2010/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-60761-657-3_23 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2010;629:355-67. doi: 10.1007/978-1-60761-657-3_23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We questioned whether the dual SRC/ABL kinase inhibitor dasatinib can affect AML cells and whether differences can be observed with normal CD34(+) cells. First, we demonstrated that normal cord blood (CB) CD34(+) cells were unaffected by dasatinib at a low concentration (0.5 nM) in the long-term culture on MS5 stromal cells. No changes were observed in proliferation, differentiation, and colony formation. In a subset of AML cases (3/15), a distinct reduction in cell proliferation was observed, ranging from 48% to 91% inhibition at 0.5 nM of dasatinib, in particular, those characterized by BCR-ABL or KIT mutations. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of dasatinib were cytokine specific. Stem cell factor-mediated proliferation was significantly impaired, associated with a reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and STAT5, whereas no effect was observed on interleukin-3 and thrombopoietin-mediated signaling despite SRC activation. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that dasatinib is a potential inhibitor in a subgroup of AML, especially those that express BCR-ABL or KIT mutations.","['Han, Lina', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob', 'Mulder, Andre', 'Vellenga, Edo']","['Han L', 'Schuringa JJ', 'Mulder A', 'Vellenga E']","['Department of Hematology, University of Groningen and University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dasatinib', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects/*pathology', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Thiazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Time Factors']",,2010/04/14 06:00,2010/08/17 06:00,['2010/04/14 06:00'],"['2010/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-010-0948-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2010 Sep;89(9):861-71. doi: 10.1007/s00277-010-0948-7.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the activation of Src/Stat3 pathway in chordomas cells and to determine the efficiency of inhibiting this pathway by 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9 (11)-dien-28-oic acid-methyl ester (CDDO-Me) as a potential chemotherapeutic agent for chordoma treatment. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The advent of molecularly targeted therapies has raised interest for their use in the treatment of chordomas. Unfortunately, the current understanding of molecular markers in chordomas is limited. Constitutive activation of Stat3 is a common finding in a wide spectrum of human cancers. The function of Stat3 pathway in chordomas has not been elucidated. METHODS: The expression of key components of the Src/Stat3 signaling cascade was evaluated by Western blot in chordoma tissues and chordoma cell lines. The effects of CDDO-Me on chordoma cell growth were evaluated in these chordoma cell lines by MTT assay. The expression of key components of the Src/Stat3 signaling cascade and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage in these CDDO-Me treated cells were analyzed by Western blot and immunofluorescence. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of CDDO-Me on cisplatin and doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT. Finally, chordoma cells were grown in a 3-dimensional (3D) culture and treated with CDDO-Me. RESULTS: The key components of the Src/Stat3 signaling cascade, including Stat3, pStat3, Src, pSrc, Bcl-xL, and Myeloid Cell Leukemia-1, were all highly expressed in chordomas. Expression of the key components of the Src/Stat3 signaling cascade was inhibited in chordoma cells after treatment with CDDO-Me. The growth of chordoma cells was inhibited and apoptosis associated poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage was detected after treatment with CDDO-Me. Additionally, CDDO-Me has a synergistic effect on cisplatin or doxorubicin-induced chordoma cell death (P < 0.001). Finally, expression of pSrc and pStat3 and chordoma cell growth was inhibited by treatment of CDDO-Me using 3D culture. CONCLUSION: The Src/Stat3 signaling pathway was activated in chordomas. Blockage of Src/Stat3 pathway by CDDO-Me is a potential strategy for chordoma treatment and may be focus for future research.","['Yang, Cao', 'Hornicek, Francis J', 'Wood, Kirkham B', 'Schwab, Joseph H', 'Choy, Edwin', 'Mankin, Henry', 'Duan, Zhenfeng']","['Yang C', 'Hornicek FJ', 'Wood KB', 'Schwab JH', 'Choy E', 'Mankin H', 'Duan Z']","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Center for Sarcoma and Connective Tissue Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Spine (Phila Pa 1976),Spine,7610646,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'CEG1Q6OGU1 (bardoxolone methyl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/therapeutic use', 'Chordoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Spinal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology']",,2010/04/14 06:00,2012/01/12 06:00,['2010/04/14 06:00'],"['2010/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181c2d2b4 [doi]'],ppublish,Spine (Phila Pa 1976). 2010 Aug 15;35(18):1668-75. doi: 10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181c2d2b4.,,,['R01-CA119617/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five hundred twenty-five patients stratified into risk groups A (early bone marrow [BM] relapses), B (late BM relapses), and C (isolated extramedullary relapses) received alternating short-course intensive polychemotherapy (in blocks R1, R2, or R3) and cranial/craniospinal irradiation followed by maintenance therapy. Block R3 (high-dose cytarabine and etoposide) was introduced to improve the outcome compared with historical controls. Patients with early BM or T-ALL relapse (poor prognosis group [PPG]) were eligible for experimental regimens. One hundred seventeen patients received stem-cell transplantation (SCT). RESULTS: The probabilities (and standard deviations) of event-free survival (pEFS) and overall survival (pOS) at 10 years were 0.30 +/- .02 and 0.36 +/- .02, respectively. Significant differences existed between strategic groups (pEFS(A) = .17 +/- .03; pEFS(B) = .43 +/- .04; pEFS(C) = .54 +/- .06; pEFS(PPG) = .15 +/- .03; log-rank P < .001). Patients of high-risk groups A plus PPG did better with SCT than with chemotherapy (pEFS = .33 +/- .05 v 0.20 +/- .05; P = .005). The pEFS was similar to trials ALL-REZ BFM 85/87 (.36 +/- .03. v 0.37 +/- .03; P = .419; PPG excluded). Time point, site of relapse, immunophenotype, and SCT were significant predictors of pEFS in multivariate analyses. CONCLUSION: More than one third of patients in this large, population-based trial were cured. Neither R3 nor adaptation of chemotherapy intensity was capable of improving pEFS or of overcoming prognostic factors. In high-risk patients, remission induction regimens must be improved, and allogeneic SCT should be recommended in patients achieving second complete remission.","['Tallen, Gesche', 'Ratei, Richard', 'Mann, Georg', 'Kaspers, Gertjan', 'Niggli, Felix', 'Karachunsky, Alexandr', 'Ebell, Wolfram', 'Escherich, Gabriele', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Fengler, Ruediger', 'Henze, Gunter', 'von Stackelberg, Arend']","['Tallen G', 'Ratei R', 'Mann G', 'Kaspers G', 'Niggli F', 'Karachunsky A', 'Ebell W', 'Escherich G', 'Schrappe M', 'Klingebiel T', 'Fengler R', 'Henze G', 'von Stackelberg A']","['Departments of Pediatric and Arend von Stackelberg Oncology/Hematology and of General Pediatrics, Charit-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2010/04/14 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/04/14 06:00'],"['2010/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.25.1983 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.25.1983 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 May 10;28(14):2339-47. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.25.1983.

METHODS: Electronic databases searched through October 2008 identified 3,794 articles for initial screening. Eligibility included solid tumor or lymphoma patients randomly assigned to chemotherapy with or without G-CSF support, > or = 2 years of follow-up, and reporting AML/MDS or all second malignancies. Dual blinded data extraction was performed. Relative risk (RR) and absolute risk (AR) estimates +/- 95% CIs were calculated by the Mantel-Haenszel method. RESULTS: In the 25 eligible RCTs, 6,058 and 6,746 patients were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy with and without initial G-CSF support, respectively. At mean and median follow-up across studies of 60 and 53 months, respectively, AML/MDS was reported in 22 control patients and 43 G-CSF-treated patients, with an estimated RR of 1.92 (95% CI, 1.19 to 3.07; P = .007) and AR increase of 0.41% (95% CI, 0.10% to 0.72%; P = .009). Deaths were reported in 1,845 patients randomly assigned to G-CSF and in 2,099 controls, for estimates of RR and AR decrease of 0.897 (95% CI, 0.857 to 0.938; P < .001) and 3.40% (95% CI, 2.01% to 4.80%; P < .001), respectively. Greater RR reduction for mortality was seen for both larger studies (P = .05) and greater chemotherapy dose-intensity (P = .012). CONCLUSION: Delivered chemotherapy dose-intensity and risk of AML/MDS are increased but all-cause mortality is decreased in patients receiving chemotherapy with G-CSF support. Greater reductions in mortality were observed with greater chemotherapy dose-intensity.","['Lyman, Gary H', 'Dale, David C', 'Wolff, Debra A', 'Culakova, Eva', 'Poniewierski, Marek S', 'Kuderer, Nicole M', 'Crawford, Jeffrey']","['Lyman GH', 'Dale DC', 'Wolff DA', 'Culakova E', 'Poniewierski MS', 'Kuderer NM', 'Crawford J']","['Duke University and Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center, 2424 Erwin Rd, Ste 205, Durham, NC 27705, USA.

These differences could result from variable therapy adherence. METHODS: Eighty-seven patients with chronic-phase CML treated with imatinib 400 mg/d for a median of 59.7 months (range, 25 to 104 months) who had achieved complete cytogenetic response had adherence monitored during a 3-month period by using a microelectronic monitoring device. Adherence was correlated with levels of molecular response. Other factors that could influence outcome were also analyzed. RESULTS: Median adherence rate was 98% (range, 24% to 104%). Twenty-three patients (26.4%) had adherence <or= 90%; in 12 of these patients (14%), adherence was <or= 80%. There was a strong correlation between adherence rate (<or= 90% or > 90%) and the 6-year probability of a 3-log reduction (also known as major molecular response [MMR]) in BCR-ABL1 transcripts (28.4% v 94.5%; P < .001) and also complete molecular response (CMR; 0% v 43.8%; P = .002). Multivariate analysis identified adherence (relative risk [RR], 11.7; P = .001) and expression of the molecular human organic cation transporter-1 (RR, 1.79; P = .038) as the only independent predictors for MMR. Adherence was the only independent predictor for CMR. No molecular responses were observed when adherence was <or= 80% (P < .001). Patients whose imatinib doses were increased had poor adherence (86.4%). In this latter population, adherence was the only independent predictor for inability to achieve an MMR (RR, 17.66; P = .006). CONCLUSION: In patients with CML treated with imatinib for some years, poor adherence may be the predominant reason for inability to obtain adequate molecular responses.","['Marin, David', 'Bazeos, Alexandra', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier', 'Eliasson, Lina', 'Milojkovic, Dragana', 'Bua, Marco', 'Apperley, Jane F', 'Szydlo, Richard', 'Desai, Ritti', 'Kozlowski, Kasia', 'Paliompeis, Christos', 'Latham, Victoria', 'Foroni, Letizia', 'Molimard, Mathieu', 'Reid, Alistair', 'Rezvani, Katy', 'de Lavallade, Hugues', 'Guallar, Cristina', 'Goldman, John', 'Khorashad, Jamshid S']","['Marin D', 'Bazeos A', 'Mahon FX', 'Eliasson L', 'Milojkovic D', 'Bua M', 'Apperley JF', 'Szydlo R', 'Desai R', 'Kozlowski K', 'Paliompeis C', 'Latham V', 'Foroni L', 'Molimard M', 'Reid A', 'Rezvani K', 'de Lavallade H', 'Guallar C', 'Goldman J', 'Khorashad JS']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Rd, London W12 0NN, United Kingdom. d.marin@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-1)', '0 (POU2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Drug Monitoring/instrumentation', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', '*Medication Adherence', 'Micro-Electrical-Mechanical Systems/instrumentation', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-1/genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2010/04/14 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/04/14 06:00'],"['2010/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.26.3087 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.26.3087 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 May 10;28(14):2381-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.26.3087.

We assessed the second-generation purine nucleoside analog, clofarabine, in two similar phase II studies in this group of patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two consecutive studies, UWCM-001 and BIOV-121, recruited untreated older patients with AML to receive up to four or six 5-day courses of clofarabine. Patients in UWCM-001 were either older than 70 years or 60 to 69 years of age with poor performance status (WHO > 2) or with cardiac comorbidity. Patients in BIOV-121 were >or= 65 years of age and deemed unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were treated in the two monotherapy studies. Median age was 71 years (range, 60 to 84 years), 30% had adverse-risk cytogenetics, and 36% had a WHO performance score >or= 2. Forty-eight percent had a complete response (32% complete remission, 16% complete remission with incomplete peripheral blood count recovery), and 18% died within 30 days. Interestingly, response and overall survival were not inferior in the adverse cytogenetic risk group. The safety profile of clofarabine in these elderly patients with AML who were unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy was manageable and typical of a cytotoxic agent in patients with acute leukemia. Patients had similar prognostic characteristics to matched patients treated with low-dose cytarabine in the United Kingdom AML14 trial, but had significantly superior response and overall survival. CONCLUSION: Clofarabine is active and generally well tolerated in this patient group. It is worthy of further evaluation in comparative trials and might be of particular use in patients with adverse cytogenetics.","['Burnett, Alan K', 'Russell, Nigel H', 'Kell, Jonathan', 'Dennis, Michael', 'Milligan, Donald', 'Paolini, Stefania', 'Yin, John', 'Culligan, Dominic', 'Johnston, Peter', 'Murphy, John', 'McMullin, Mary-Frances', 'Hunter, Ann', 'Das-Gupta, Emma', 'Clark, Richard', 'Carr, Robert', 'Hills, Robert K']","['Burnett AK', 'Russell NH', 'Kell J', 'Dennis M', 'Milligan D', 'Paolini S', 'Yin J', 'Culligan D', 'Johnston P', 'Murphy J', 'McMullin MF', 'Hunter A', 'Das-Gupta E', 'Clark R', 'Carr R', 'Hills RK']","['Department of Haematology, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff CF14 4XN, United Kingdom. burnettak@cardiff.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Clofarabine', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Medication Adherence', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', '*Patient Selection', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United Kingdom']",,2010/04/14 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/04/14 06:00'],"['2010/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.26.4242 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.26.4242 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 May 10;28(14):2389-95. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.26.4242.

Lower numbers and shorter lifespan are characteristic of CD8(+)CD57(+) in normal individuals. However, CD8(+)CD57(+) are expanded in certain disease states including T cell large granular leukemia and other hematologic malignancies. The mechanisms responsible for the differences in CD8(+)CD57(-) and CD8(+)CD57(+) lifespan remain elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that the small heat shock protein (Hsp) 27 is a key regulator of CD8(+)CD57(+) lymphocyte lifespan. We found that Hsp27 expression is significantly lower in CD8(+)CD57(+) than in CD8(+)CD57(-) lymphocytes. In contrast, Hsp60 and Hsp70 are expressed at comparable levels. Unlike other antiapoptotic Bcl-2-like molecules, the expression of Hsp27 tightly correlates with CD8(+)CD57(+) and CD8(+)CD57(-) lifespan. We demonstrate that Hsp27 overexpression in CD8(+)CD57(+) lymphocytes to levels found normally in CD8(+)CD57(-) lymphocytes decreased apoptosis. Accordingly, silencing of Hsp27 in CD8(+)CD57(-) lymphocytes increased apoptosis. Collectively these results demonstrate that Hsp27 is a critical regulator of normal CD8(+)CD57(+) lifespan supporting its use as a marker of lifespan in this lineage, and suggest a mechanism responsible for the decreased apoptosis and clonal expansion characteristic of certain disease states.","['Wood, Karen L', 'Voss, Oliver H', 'Huang, Qin', 'Parihar, Arti', 'Mehta, Neeraj', 'Batra, Sanjay', 'Doseff, Andrea I']","['Wood KL', 'Voss OH', 'Huang Q', 'Parihar A', 'Mehta N', 'Batra S', 'Doseff AI']","['Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CD57 Antigens)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/immunology', 'CD57 Antigens/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Lineage/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Survival/genetics/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Down-Regulation/genetics/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/immunology/metabolism']",,2010/04/14 06:00,2010/07/20 06:00,['2010/04/14 06:00'],"['2010/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0902953 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0902953 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2010 May 15;184(10):5582-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0902953.

Proteolytic cleavage mediated by the retroviral protease forms the bioactive retroviral protein subunits before cell entry. We hypothesized that this process could be exploited for targeted, transient, and dose-controlled transduction of nonretroviral proteins into cultured cells. We demonstrate that gammaretroviral particles tolerate the incorporation of foreign protein at several positions of their Gag or Gag-Pol precursors. Receptor-mediated and thus potentially cell-specific uptake of engineered particles occurred within minutes after cell contact. Dose and kinetics of nonretroviral protein delivery were dependent upon the location within the polyprotein precursor. Proteins containing nuclear localization signals were incorporated into retroviral particles, and the proteins of interest were released from the precursor by the retroviral protease, recognizing engineered target sites. In contrast to integration-defective lentiviral vectors, protein transduction by retroviral polyprotein precursors was completely transient, as protein transducing retrovirus-like particles could be produced that did not transduce genes into target cells. Alternatively, bifunctional protein-delivering particle preparations were generated that maintained their ability to serve as vectors for retroviral transgenes. We show the potential of this approach for targeted genome engineering of induced pluripotent stem cells by delivering the site-specific DNA recombinase, Flp. Protein transduction of Flp after proteolytic release from the matrix position of Gag allowed excision of a lentivirally transduced cassette that concomitantly expresses the canonical reprogramming transcription factors (Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, c-Myc) and a fluorescent marker gene, thus generating induced pluripotent stem cells that are free of lentivirally transduced reprogramming genes.","['Voelkel, Christine', 'Galla, Melanie', 'Maetzig, Tobias', 'Warlich, Eva', 'Kuehle, Johannes', 'Zychlinski, Daniela', 'Bode, Juergen', 'Cantz, Tobias', 'Schambach, Axel', 'Baum, Christopher']","['Voelkel C', 'Galla M', 'Maetzig T', 'Warlich E', 'Kuehle J', 'Zychlinski D', 'Bode J', 'Cantz T', 'Schambach A', 'Baum C']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, and Research Group Stem Cell Biology, Hannover Medical School, D-30625 Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Gene Products, gag/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Genetic Engineering/methods', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Localization Signals/metabolism', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods', 'Virion/genetics/*metabolism', '*Virus Internalization']",,2010/04/14 06:00,2010/06/03 06:00,['2010/04/14 06:00'],"['2010/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/03 06:00 [medline]']","['0914517107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0914517107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Apr 27;107(17):7805-10. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0914517107.

We studied the outcomes of 5876 patients (16-59 years of age) who were classified into 54 cytogenetic subgroups and treated in the Medical Research Council trials. In multivariable analysis, t(15;17)(q22;q21), t(8;21)(q22;q22), and inv(16)(p13q22)/t(16;16)(p13;q22) were the only abnormalities found to predict a relatively favorable prognosis (P < .001). In patients with t(15;17) treated with extended all-trans retinoic acid and anthracycline-based chemotherapy, additional cytogenetic changes did not have an impact on prognosis. Similarly, additional abnormalities did not have a significant adverse effect in t(8;21) AML; whereas in patients with inv(16), the presence of additional changes, particularly +22, predicted a better outcome (P = .004). In multivariable analyses, various abnormalities predicted a significantly poorer outcome, namely abn(3q) (excluding t(3;5)(q25;q34)), inv(3)(q21q26)/t(3;3)(q21;q26), add(5q)/del(5q), -5, -7, add(7q)/del(7q), t(6;11)(q27;q23), t(10;11)(p11 approximately 13;q23), other t(11q23) (excluding t(9;11)(p21 approximately 22;q23) and t(11;19)(q23;p13)), t(9;22)(q34;q11), -17, and abn(17p). Patients lacking the aforementioned favorable or adverse aberrations but with 4 or more unrelated abnormalities also exhibited a significantly poorer prognosis (designated ""complex"" karyotype group). These data allow more reliable prediction of outcome for patients with rarer abnormalities and may facilitate the development of consensus in reporting of karyotypic information in clinical trials involving younger adults with AML.

Its turnover, believed to be mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, facilitates apoptosis induction in response to cellular stress. To investigate the contribution of ubiquitinylation in regulating murine MCL-1 turnover, we generated an MCL-1 mutant lacking the lysine residues required for ubiquitinylation (MCL-1(KR)). Here, we demonstrate that despite failing to be ubiquitinylated, the MCL-1(KR) protein is eliminated at a rate similar to that of wild-type MCL-1 under basal and stressed conditions. Moreover, the degradation of wild-type MCL-1 is not affected when ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 activity is blocked. Likewise, both wild-type and MCL-1(KR) proteins are similarly degraded when expressed in primary lymphocytes. Supporting these findings, unmodified, in vitro-translated MCL-1 can be degraded in a cell-free system by the 20S proteasome. Taken together, these data demonstrate that MCL-1 degradation can occur independently of ubiquitinylation.","['Stewart, Daniel P', 'Koss, Brian', 'Bathina, Madhavi', 'Perciavalle, Rhonda M', 'Bisanz, Kristen', 'Opferman, Joseph T']","['Stewart DP', 'Koss B', 'Bathina M', 'Perciavalle RM', 'Bisanz K', 'Opferman JT']","[""Department of Biochemistry, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Half-Life', 'Hematopoietic System/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects']",,2010/04/14 06:00,2010/06/18 06:00,['2010/04/14 06:00'],"['2010/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.01266-09 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01266-09 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2010 Jun;30(12):3099-110. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01266-09.

Five-year relative survival rates were obtained for incident cases from 1993 to 2002 using a period analysis method. Overall incidence had increased in both males and females. Among males, lung cancer was the leading cancer and reached a peak in 1988-92. Colorectal and prostate cancers showed rising trends and became more common than liver cancer, with stable incidence over time. Stomach cancer incidence fell steeply. Among females, there was a steady increase in incidence of breast cancer. There was a slight decrease in the incidence of the second common cancer, cervical cancer, and colorectal cancer became equally common. Lung cancer incidence in females also reached a peak by 1998-2002 and then slightly decreased. Oral cavity cancer decreased strongly in the last period. In general, survival rates among Philippine residents were one-third lower than among Filipino-Americans and Whites in the USA especially in cancer sites wherein effective early detection methods may be available such as breast, cervix, colorectal and thyroid cancers. Survival was also lower in Philippine leukemia cases, a disease wherein effective treatment is proven in some types but is quite expensive.

Sp1 enhances its own expression by participating in a NFkappaB/HDAC complex that further represses miR-29b transcription. Upregulated Sp1 then binds NFkappaB and transactivates KIT. Therefore, activated KIT ultimately induces its own transcription. Our results provide evidence that the mechanisms of Sp1/NFkappaB/HDAC/miR-29b-dependent KIT overexpression contribute to leukemia growth and can be successfully targeted by pharmacological disruption of the Sp1/NFkappaB/HDAC complex or synthetic miR-29b treatment in KIT-driven AML.","['Liu, Shujun', 'Wu, Lai-Chu', 'Pang, Jiuxia', 'Santhanam, Ramasamy', 'Schwind, Sebastian', 'Wu, Yue-Zhong', 'Hickey, Christopher J', 'Yu, Jianhua', 'Becker, Heiko', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Radmacher, Michael D', 'Li, Chenglong', 'Whitman, Susan P', 'Mishra, Anjali', 'Stauffer, Nicole', 'Eiring, Anna M', 'Briesewitz, Roger', 'Baiocchi, Robert A', 'Chan, Kenneth K', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Byrd, John C', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Marcucci, Guido']","['Liu S', 'Wu LC', 'Pang J', 'Santhanam R', 'Schwind S', 'Wu YZ', 'Hickey CJ', 'Yu J', 'Becker H', 'Maharry K', 'Radmacher MD', 'Li C', 'Whitman SP', 'Mishra A', 'Stauffer N', 'Eiring AM', 'Briesewitz R', 'Baiocchi RA', 'Chan KK', 'Paschka P', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Byrd JC', 'Croce CM', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Perrotti D', 'Garzon R', 'Marcucci G']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. shujun.liu@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (SP1 antigen)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Histone Deacetylases/*physiology', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/physiopathology', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,2010/04/14 06:00,2010/05/01 06:00,['2010/04/14 06:00'],"['2009/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-6108(10)00100-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ccr.2010.03.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2010 Apr 13;17(4):333-47. doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2010.03.008.,,,"['CA077658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA102031-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025755/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA114725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA102031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA102031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2917066,['NIHMS222986'],,,,['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Patients with recently diagnosed symptomatic MM received dexamethazone to induce clinical response. Cytokine mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) were split into 2 aliquots and cryopreserved. Patients then received Mel 100 mg/m(2) (Mel100) and infusion of the first PBPC aliquot in an ambulatory facility. Individuals received standard neutropenia prophylaxis and no growth factor support, but were seen regularly at the clinic until recovery. The cost of this step was calculated in a cohort of 23 patients where information for the expenditure was available. Six months later patients were conditioned in the hospital with Mel 200 mg/m(2) (Mel 200) followed by nfusion of the second aliquot. This study tested the cost, effectiveness, and the toxicity of out-patient-based transplantation, as well as the rate of response (complete remission [CR], very good partial remission [VGPR], partial remission [PR], and stable disease [SD]) and overall survival (OS) of this strategy. Twenty-six female and 16 male patients, with a median age of 53 years (range: 33-68 years) and median Salmon & Durie clinical disease stage III (range: II-III) were studied. The paraprotein was IgA in 17%, IgG in 52%, and light chains in 26%. The median harvested CD34(+) x 10(6) cells/kg was 12.03 (2.25-55.4). The median interval between the 2 transplant procedures was 239 (105-376) days. The median Karnofsky presentation score was 40%, but improved to 80% after the Mel 100 and was 90% following Mel 200. Subsequent to MEL 100 response was complete (CR) in 7 and it was VGPR in 9. Mel 100 grade 3-4 toxicity was mainly hematologic, but 15 (36%) required hospital admission for a median of 5 days. The median cost of MEL100 and corresponding supportive therapy was U.S. $2,142.35. In addition, the total median cost of those who needed admission to hospital was U.S. $6,042.78. Thus, pooling costs from patients who needed or did not need admissions the average cost of this strategy was U.S. $3,546.50 per patient. Among Mel 200 patients, except for hematologic toxicity, no patient had greater than grade 2 side effects. On completion of the program, 20 (48%) patients achieved CR, a further 14 (33%) had VGPR, whereas 6 had PR. At a median follow-up of 659 days there were 8 deaths, 1 (2%) was related to the treatment procedures and 6 from disease progression; thus, the 1000 days OS was 73%. Significant adverse factors included older age, lower presentation Hb, and lower Karnofsky %. Nonparametric testing confirmed that good performance scores and VGPR or CR were associated with more favorable outcome. Importantly, these satisfactory results were obtained in the absence of the new biologic cell modifiers. Mel 100 was well tolerated in the outpatient setting and the overall strategy seems to be effective in inducing durable responses with acceptable toxicity.","['Novitzky, Nicolas', 'Thomson, Jaqueline', 'Thomas, Valda', 'du Toit, Cecile', 'Mohamed, Zainab', 'McDonald, Andrew']","['Novitzky N', 'Thomson J', 'Thomas V', 'du Toit C', 'Mohamed Z', 'McDonald A']","['The University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa. nicolas.novitzky@uct.ac.za']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Ambulatory Care/economics', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dexamethasone/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Costs', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hospital Costs', 'Humans', 'Karnofsky Performance Status', 'Male', 'Melphalan/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/economics/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/economics/mortality/*surgery', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/economics/therapeutic use', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'South Africa', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/economics/*methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2010/04/14 06:00,2011/02/01 06:00,['2010/04/14 06:00'],"['2009/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00157-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.04.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2010 Oct;16(10):1402-10. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.04.002.

MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells decreased the amount of C6-ceramide metabolized to C6-sphingomyelin (C6-SM) and increased the amount metabolized to C6-glucosylceramide (C6-GC) in response to increasing concentrations. A similar trend was seen in DU-145 (prostate cancer), PANC-1 (pancreatic cancer), and LoVo (colorectal cancer) cells. KG-1 leukemia cells favored C6-SM synthesis at low (0.6muM) and high-dose (12muM) C6-ceramide. Partnering C6-ceramide with tamoxifen, a P-glycoprotein antagonist that impedes ceramide glycosylation, was an effective regimen for enhancing cytotoxicity in cells. Experiments to assess the mechanism of cell death using KG-1 cells showed that tamoxifen inhibited synthesis of C6-GC and C6-SM from C6-ceramide by 80% and 50%, respectively, which was accompanied by enhanced apoptosis. Radiolabeling of KG-1 cells with [(3)H]palmitic acid produced a 2-fold increase in (3)H-long-chain ceramides when unlabeled C6-ceramide was added and a 9-fold increase when C6-ceramide and tamoxifen were added. The increase in (3)H-palmitate radiolabeling of long-chain ceramides was blocked by inclusion of a ceramide synthase inhibitor; however, inhibiting synthesis of long-chain ceramide did not rescue cells. These studies show that tamoxifen enhances the apoptotic effects of C6-ceramide. The proposed mechanism involves blocking short-chain ceramide anabolism to favor hydrolysis and generation of sphingosine. We propose that use of tamoxifen and other P-glycoprotein antagonists can be an effective means for enhancing cytotoxic potential of short-chain ceramides in the treatment of cancer.","['Chapman, Jacqueline V', 'Gouaze-Andersson, Valerie', 'Messner, Maria C', 'Flowers, Margaret', 'Karimi, Ramin', 'Kester, Mark', 'Barth, Brian M', 'Liu, Xin', 'Liu, Yong-Yu', 'Giuliano, Armando E', 'Cabot, Myles C']","['Chapman JV', 'Gouaze-Andersson V', 'Messner MC', 'Flowers M', 'Karimi R', 'Kester M', 'Barth BM', 'Liu X', 'Liu YY', 'Giuliano AE', 'Cabot MC']","[""John Wayne Cancer Institute at Saint John's Health Center, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, 2200 Santa Monica Boulevard, Santa Monica, CA 90404, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Ceramides)', '038753E78J (N-caproylsphingosine)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Ceramides/chemistry/*metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tamoxifen/chemistry/metabolism/therapeutic use']",,2010/04/14 06:00,2010/06/23 06:00,['2010/04/14 06:00'],"['2010/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/24 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(10)00246-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2010.04.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2010 Aug 1;80(3):308-15. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2010.04.001.

FcgammaRIIA harbours three tyrosine (Y) residues within its cytoplasmic domain. Y1 is upstream of both Y2 and Y3, which are contained within an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), required for many signaling events. We have demonstrated that the two ITAM tyrosines are required for phagocytic signaling and that mutation of a single ITAM tyrosine decreases but does not abolish phagocytic signaling. Furthermore, we have identified that the YMTL motif is required for endocytosis. These observations suggest that FcgammaRIIA utilizes different sequences for various signaling events. Therefore, we investigated the sequence requirements for another important FcgammaRIIA-mediated signaling event, serotonin secretion, using Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells transfected with wildtype (WT) FcgammaRIIA or mutant FcgammaRIIA. Stimulation of cells expressing WT FcgammaRIIA induced release of serotonin at a level 7-fold greater than that in nonstimulated WT FcgammaRIIA-transfected cells or nontransfected RBL cells. Mutation of either ITAM tyrosine (Y2 or Y3) to phenylalanine was sufficient to abolish serotonin secretion. Further, while inhibition of Syk with piceatannol blocked phagocytosis as expected, it did not inhibit serotonin secretion. Additionally, inhibition of phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) with wortmannin only had a partial effect on serotonin signaling, despite the fact that the concentrations used completely abolished phagocytic signaling. These data suggest that the requirements for serotonin secretion differ from those for phagocytosis mediated by FcgammaRIIA.","['Daniels, A B', 'Worth, R G', 'Dickstein, R J', 'Dickstein, J S', 'Kim-Han, T-H', 'Kim, M-K', 'Schreiber, A D']","['Daniels AB', 'Worth RG', 'Dickstein RJ', 'Dickstein JS', 'Kim-Han TH', 'Kim MK', 'Schreiber AD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Fc gamma receptor IIA)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Platelets/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Phagocytosis/physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgG/*metabolism', 'Serotonin/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transfection']",,2010/04/14 06:00,2010/04/28 06:00,['2010/04/14 06:00'],"['2010/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['SJI2369 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-3083.2010.02369.x [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 2010 Apr;71(4):232-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.2010.02369.x.,,,"['R01 HL028207/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL028207-25/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2855141,['NIHMS185372'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to analyze the associations between estrogen receptor gene alpha polymorphisms and cancers susceptibility, we genotyped six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 163 Caucasian cancer patients--103 breast cancers and 60 other malignancies (colorectal, bladder, hepatocellular carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia)--and 114 healthy controls using hybridization probes. We performed Armitage`s association trend-test to evaluate the risk. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was assessed for each pair of markers. The genotypes CC and CT of rs3798577 were significantly associated with the cancers risk (p-trend breast = 4 x 10(-5); p-trend cancers = 1 x 10(-5)); in discrepancy with breast cancer where the C-allele represented the risk allele, for bladder, hepatocellular carcinomas and leukemia, the T allele seems to confer susceptibility. The minor G allele of rs1801132 was protective in our cases (p = 1 x 10(-4)); for rs2228480, the heterozygous frequency was higher for cancer groups (p = 0.03); the SNP pairs rs2228480&rs3798577 and rs2234693&rs9340799 were in low LD; the haplotypes T-A of rs2234693&rs9340799 and G-C of rs2228480&rs3798577 showed a trend to be higher represented in breast cancers; T allele of rs2234693 was higher expressed in breast, colon cancers and leukemia; rs2077647 was associated with colon (p = 0.008, C-risk allele) and bladder (p = 0.01, T-risk allele) cancers.

Nodal has been shown to have a central role in the tumorigenic signaling pathways of malignant melanoma. In this study, we show that grade IV human glioma cell lines expressed different levels of Nodal, paralleled to the potential for cell invasiveness. Treatment of glioma cell lines with recombinant Nodal (rNodal) increased matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) secretion and cell invasiveness. The ectopic expression of Nodal in GBM glioma cells that expressed Nodal at low level resulted in increased MMP-2 secretion, enhanced cell invasiveness, raised cell proliferation rates in vitro, increased tumor growth in vivo, and was associated with poor survival in a mice xenograft model. In contrast, the knockdown of Nodal expression in U87MG glioma cells with high Nodal expression level had reduced MMP-2 secretion, less cell invasiveness, lower tumor growth in vivo and longer lifespan in mice with U87MG/shNodal cell xenografts. In addition, Nodal knockdown promoted the reversion of malignant glioma cells toward a differentiated astrocytic phenotype. Furthermore, our data support the notion that Nodal may regulate glioma progression through the induction of the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and Cripto-1 through activated Smad.","['Lee, C-C', 'Jan, H-J', 'Lai, J-H', 'Ma, H-I', 'Hueng, D-Y', 'Lee, Y-C Gladys', 'Cheng, Y-Y', 'Liu, L-W', 'Wei, H-W', 'Lee, H-M']","['Lee CC', 'Jan HJ', 'Lai JH', 'Ma HI', 'Hueng DY', 'Lee YC', 'Cheng YY', 'Liu LW', 'Wei HW', 'Lee HM']","['Department of Pathology, Shin Kong Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NOMO3 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Smad Proteins)', '0 (TDGF1 protein, human)', '127497-59-0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/biosynthesis', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Glioma/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Smad Proteins/metabolism', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2/metabolism', 'Transfection']",,2010/04/13 06:00,2010/07/08 06:00,['2010/04/13 06:00'],"['2010/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201055 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2010.55 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 May 27;29(21):3110-23. doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.55.

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE using key words related to low dose and cancer risk. The selected articles were restricted to those written in English from 1990 to January 2009. We excluded those studies with no fit to the selection criteria and we included the cited references in published articles to minimize publication bias. Through this process, a total of 11 epidemiologic studies were finally included. RESULTS: We found significant decreased deaths from all cancers (SMR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.62 - 0.90), all cancers excluding leukemia, solid cancer, mouth and pharynx, esophagus, stomach, rectum, liver and gallbladder, pancreas, lung, prostate, lymphopoietic and hematopoitic cancer. The findings of this meta-analysis were similar with those of the 15 Country Collaborative Study conducted by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. A publication bias was found only for liver and gallbladder cancer (p = 0.015). Heterogeneity was observed for all cancers, all cancers excluding leukemia, solid cancer, esophagus, colon and lung cancer.

With its very young age at diagnosis, exposures occurring in the perinatal period are suspected. Parental infertility and infertility treatment have been studied with regard to childhood cancer in general, but rarely in individual cancer subtypes. METHODS: A case-control study of infant leukemia was conducted through the Children's Oncology Group, including cases diagnosed from January 1996 to December 2006 and controls selected through random digit dialing and birth certificate tracing. Maternal phone interviews were conducted to obtain information about infertility, infertility treatment and demographic factors. All cases as well as subgroups defined by mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) translocation status and leukemia subtype were examined. Statistical analysis was performed using multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: No significant associations between infertility or its treatment and combined infant leukemia were found. In subgroup analyses, there was a significant increase in the risk of MLL--leukemia for children born to women not trying to conceive compared with those trying for <1 year for all types combined [odds ratio (OR) = 1.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01-2.59] and for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (OR = 2.50, 95% CI = 1.36-4.61). CONCLUSIONS: There were no positive associations between parental infertility or infertility treatment and infant leukemia. While this is the largest study to date, both selection and recall bias may have impacted the results. However, for infant leukemia, we can potentially rule out large increases in risk associated with parental infertility or its treatment.","['Puumala, Susan E', 'Spector, Logan G', 'Wall, Melanie M', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Roesler, Michelle A', 'Ross, Julie A']","['Puumala SE', 'Spector LG', 'Wall MM', 'Robison LL', 'Heerema NA', 'Roesler MA', 'Ross JA']","['Division of Epidemiology/Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infertility/*complications', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Parents', 'Risk Factors']",,2010/04/13 06:00,2010/08/18 06:00,['2010/04/13 06:00'],"['2010/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/18 06:00 [medline]']","['deq090 [pii]', '10.1093/humrep/deq090 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2010 Jun;25(6):1561-8. doi: 10.1093/humrep/deq090.

The genesis of these diseases is believed to be associated with the route (mucosa versus blood) and mode (cell-free versus cell-associated) of primary infection as well as the modulation of dendritic cell (DC) functions. To explore the role of DCs during early HTLV-1 infection in vivo, we used a chimeric HTLV-1 with a replaced envelope gene from Moloney murine leukemia virus to allow HTLV-1 to fuse with murine cells, which are generally not susceptible to infection with human retroviruses. We also used a CD11c-diphtheria toxin receptor transgenic mouse model system that permits conditional transient depletion of CD11c(+) DCs. We infected these transgenic mice with HTLV-1 using both cell-free and cell-associated infection routes in the absence and presence of DCs. The ablation of DCs led to an enhanced susceptibility to infection with cell-free but not cell-associated HTLV-1 in both CD4 and non-CD4 fractions, as measured by the proviral load. Infection with cell-free virus in the absence of DCs was also found to have increased levels of Tax mRNA in the non-CD4 fraction. Moreover, depletion of DCs significantly dampened the cellular immune response (IFN-gamma(+)CD8(+) T cells) against both cell-free and cell-associated virus. These results uniquely differentiate the involvement of DCs in early cell-free versus late cell-associated infection of HTLV-1 and highlight a significant aspect of viral immunopathogenesis related to the progression of adult T cell leukemia and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis after the initial infection.","['Rahman, Saifur', 'Manuel, Sharron L', 'Khan, Zafar K', 'Wigdahl, Brian', 'Acheampong, Edward', 'Tangy, Frederic', 'Jain, Pooja']","['Rahman S', 'Manuel SL', 'Khan ZK', 'Wigdahl B', 'Acheampong E', 'Tangy F', 'Jain P']","['Drexel Institute for Biotechnology and Virology Research, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19127, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CD11c Antigen)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (HBEGF protein, human)', '0 (Hbegf protein, mouse)', '0 (Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD11c Antigen/*genetics', 'Cell Death/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell-Free System/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Diphtheria Toxin/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Susceptibility/immunology/virology', 'Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', '*Leukapheresis/methods', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*immunology/metabolism/virology']",,2010/04/13 06:00,2010/07/20 06:00,['2010/04/13 06:00'],"['2010/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0903226 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0903226 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2010 May 15;184(10):5553-61. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0903226.

This issue was addressed in the present study, by searching for genes that are uniquely expressed in senescent endothelial cells and functionally involved in inflammatory leukocyte adhesion recognized as a critical step in the initiation of atherogenesis. Senescent human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) prepared by continuous subculturing in vitro showed higher binding affinity for monocytes (THP-1 cells, human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) compared with young cells. Gene expression profiles between young and senescent endothelial cells were compared by the cDNA microarray method, and CD44 was identified as one of the ""senescence-induced cell adhesion genes"" whose expression was upregulated in senescent cells and whose gene ontology annotation indicated their role in cell adhesion. The enhanced gene expression of CD44 in senescent endothelial cells was verified both at the mRNA and protein levels. Adhesion of monocytes to senescent endothelial cells was significantly reduced following pretreatment of endothelial cells with the CD44 antibody or small-interfering RNA, thus reinforcing the critical role of CD44 in the inflammatory event. Exogenous expression of CD44 in young HUVECs and in human aortic endothelial cells led to an increase in monocyte adhesion. CD44 expression levels in the rat aorta endothelium were found to increase in an age-dependent manner, as determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. CD44 and other senescence-induced cell adhesion genes identified in this study may provide the novel targets for the prevention of inflammatory leukocyte adhesion leading to the development atherosclerosis.","['Mun, Gyeong In', 'Boo, Yong Chool']","['Mun GI', 'Boo YC']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Cell and Matrix Research Institute, BK21 Medical Education Program for Human Resources, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,American journal of physiology.

Here, we evaluated Ang2 glycoprotein levels in plasma samples collected from a multicentric cohort of CLL patients (n = 316) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method, and we investigated its prognostic role in relation to time to first treatment (TTFT) and overall survival. Based on a cutoff equal to 2459 pg/mL, we divided our cohort in 2 subsets (high and low Ang2) composing 100 (31.6%) and 216 (68.4%) patients, respectively. High Ang2 was predictive of reduced TTFT (P < .001) and overall survival (P = .002). Multivariate analysis confirmed that high Ang2 was an independent prognosticator for TTFT (hazard ratio = 1.739; 95% confidence interval, 1.059-2.857; P = .029). Significant associations were found between high Ang2 and advanced Binet stages (P < .001), high beta(2)-microglobulin (P < .001), unmutated variable region of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene status (P < .001), high CD38 and zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 expression (P < .001 and P = .003), and intermediate/high cytogenetic risk (P = .005). Moreover, Ang2 added prognostic power to other conventional prognosticators and helped to refine prognosis among CLL subsets with both high and low vascular endothelial growth factor plasma levels.

The graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect mediated by the allogeneic graft, however, is typically coexpressed with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which is the major complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In this study, we used genetic and antibody-based strategies to examine the effect that blockade of interleukin 23 (IL-23) signaling had on GVH and GVL reactivity in murine transplantation recipients. These studies demonstrate that the selective protection of the colon that occurs as a consequence of inhibition of IL-23 signaling reduces GVHD without loss of the GVL effect. The separation of GVH and GVL reactivity was noted in both acute and chronic hematologic malignancy models, indicating that this approach was not restricted by the kinetic profile of the underlying leukemia. Furthermore, a potent GVL response could be mounted in the colon under conditions where tumor cells migrated to this site, indicating that this organ did not serve as a sanctuary site for subsequent systemic relapse in GVHD-protected animals. These studies demonstrate that blockade of IL-23 signaling is an effective strategy for separating GVH and GVL responses and identify IL-23 as a therapeutic target for the regulation of alloresponses in humans.","['Das, Rupali', 'Komorowski, Richard', 'Hessner, Martin J', 'Subramanian, Hariharan', 'Huettner, Claudia S', 'Cua, Daniel', 'Drobyski, William R']","['Das R', 'Komorowski R', 'Hessner MJ', 'Subramanian H', 'Huettner CS', 'Cua D', 'Drobyski WR']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Il23a protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-23 Subunit p19)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colon/immunology/pathology', 'Colonic Diseases/genetics/immunology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/immunology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-23 Subunit p19', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/immunology', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2010/04/13 06:00,2010/07/10 06:00,['2010/04/13 06:00'],"['2010/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34844-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-11-255422 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jun 24;115(25):5249-58. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-11-255422.

We previously showed that Gemini-23-yne-26,27-hexafluoro-D(3) inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in association with inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. This study explored the drug interaction of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and rapamycin analog RAD001 (everolimus) in AML cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Effects of RAD001 and 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) on the proliferation and differentiation of U937 cells were assessed by colony-forming assay and quantification of CD11b cell surface antigens and their endocytic capability, respectively. Effects of RAD001 and 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) on Akt/mTOR complex-1 (mTORC1) signaling and cell-cycle-related molecules were explored by Western blot analysis. The reporter gene and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were employed to examine the effects of RAD001 and 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) on the promoter of the p21(waf1) gene. U937 murine xenograft model was utilized to explore the effects of RAD001 and 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) in vivo. RESULTS: RAD001 potentiated the ability of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) to induce growth arrest and differentiation of AML cells in parallel with downregulation of the levels of p-S6K and p-4E-BP1, substrates of mTORC1. In addition, RAD001 significantly enhanced 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-mediated transcriptional activity of p21(waf1) in association with increased levels of the acetylated forms of histone H3 and vitamin D receptor bound to the p21(waf1) promoter in U937 cells. Moreover, RAD001 (3 mg/kg, every another day) significantly enhanced 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-induced growth inhibition of U937 tumor xenografts in nude mice without adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant administration of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and the mTORC1 inhibitor may be a promising treatment strategy for individuals with AML.","['Yang, Jing', 'Ikezoe, Takayuki', 'Nishioka, Chie', 'Ni, Lei', 'Koeffler, H Phillip', 'Yokoyama, Akihito']","['Yang J', 'Ikezoe T', 'Nishioka C', 'Ni L', 'Koeffler HP', 'Yokoyama A']","['Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi University, Nankoku, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (ITGAM protein, human)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Vitamins)', '9HW64Q8G6G (Everolimus)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Animals', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', '*Calcitriol/agonists/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Everolimus', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Histones', 'Humans', '*Immunosuppressive Agents/agonists/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proteins', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/agonists/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', '*Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'U937 Cells', '*Vitamins/agonists/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2010/04/13 06:00,2010/07/31 06:00,['2010/04/13 06:00'],"['2009/12/25 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00136-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.03.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Aug;38(8):666-76. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.03.020.

However, despite the success of these agents in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), the majority of patients continue to present with minimal residual disease contained within the bone marrow microenvironment. These clinical observations suggest that the bone marrow microenvironment may provide survival signals that contribute to the failure to eliminate minimal residual disease. The bone marrow microenvironment is comprised of multiple sub-domains which vary in cellular composition and gradients of soluble factors and matrix composition. Experimental evidence indicate that exposure of tumor cells to either bone marrow derived soluble factors or the extracellular matrix can confer a multi-drug resistance phenotype. Together, these data indicate that targeting such pathways may be a viable approach for increasing the efficacy of chemotherapy. Moreover, we propose that personalized medicine must go beyond understanding predictive models inherent to tumors but rather build predictive models that consider diversity in response due to interactions with the tumor microenvironment. Although review will focus on CML, understanding the contribution of the bone marrow microenvironment could contribute to rationale combination therapy in other types of leukemia, multiple myeloma and solid tumors which metastasize to the bone.","['Nair, Rajesh R', 'Tolentino, Joel', 'Hazlehurst, Lori A']","['Nair RR', 'Tolentino J', 'Hazlehurst LA']","['Molecular Oncology Program, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', '*Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology']",174,2010/04/13 06:00,2010/07/20 06:00,['2010/04/13 06:00'],"['2010/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(10)00248-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2010.04.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2010 Sep 1;80(5):602-12. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2010.04.003.

Indeed, traditional methods such as the Western blot or ELISA remain a standard method for determining the phosphorylation status of endogenous STAT proteins. Here we present data for the rapid detection of endogenous receptor-mediated phosphorylation of multiple STAT proteins using the bead-based AlphaScreen SureFire technology. With three different cell lines (human acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells, human erythroleukemic TF-1 cells, and human T lymphocytic Jurkat cells), we have optimized a rapid and homogeneous methodology for monitoring endogenous, receptor-mediated signaling via STAT 1, STAT 3, or STAT 5 phosphorylation, in response to several agonists.

Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) from the stem cell donor is an attractive clinical option to salvage this group of patients. METHODS: We reviewed the important studies looking at donor lymphocyte infusion as a therapy for the treatment of hematological disorders that are either refractory to or have relapsed after allogeneic SCT. RESULTS: The response to DLI is dependent upon type of disease, dose of infused lymphocytes, and the development of graft vs. host disease (GvHD). The best response rates are seen in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) followed by patients with lymphomas, multiple myeloma and acute leukemias, respectively. The responses in patients with CML are durable whereas durable responses in other diseases are rare. CONCLUSIONS: Given the development of new drugs to treat some hematological diseases, DLI has taken a backseat. New modalities to target the infused cells to the tumor and new approaches to reduce GvHD that will augment the graft vs. leukemia/lymphoma (GvL) effect and decrease the injury to normal host tissues need to be developed. Understanding the factors and mechanisms that differentiate the GvL effect from GvHD will help in the development of newer treatment modalities.","['Deol, Abhinav', 'Lum, Lawrence G']","['Deol A', 'Lum LG']","['Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, 4th Floor, Hudson Webber Cancer Research Center, 4100 John R., Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Treat Rev,Cancer treatment reviews,7502030,,IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion/adverse effects', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy', 'Recurrence', '*Tissue Donors']",,2010/04/13 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/04/13 06:00'],"['2009/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/11 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0305-7372(10)00056-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ctrv.2010.03.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Treat Rev. 2010 Nov;36(7):528-38. doi: 10.1016/j.ctrv.2010.03.004.

Cancer/testis antigens (CTAs) encoding immunogenic proteins are not expressed in almost all normal tissues and many tumor types, but are consistently derepressed by epigenetically active agents in various cancer cell lines. Since the expression of CTA genes is usually very low or absent in myeloid leukemias, we treated various AML cell lines with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) and quantified mRNA expression of the CTAs NY-ESO-1, MAGEA1, MAGEA3 and MAGEB2. Consistent time- and dose-dependent reactivation of all 4 CTA genes was observed, with maximum mRNA levels 72-144h after treatment start. As determined by RNA microarray analyses, numerous other CTA genes (all located on the X-chromosome) were also derepressed in a time-dependent fashion by DAC. NY-ESO-1 derepression was confirmed at the protein level. By Elispot and chromium release assays we showed that the de novo expressed NY-ESO-1 protein was naturally processed and presented in a time- and dose-dependent fashion up to 8 days after the start of DAC treatment, and converted the cell lines susceptible to antigen-specific recognition by CD8+ T-cell clones. In conclusion, NY-ESO-1 and numerous other CTAs localized on the X-chromosome are readily and transiently derepressed in AML cell lines treated with DAC. The susceptibility of DAC-treated AML cell lines to antigen-specific T-cell recognition has clear implications for future clinical trials combining DAC and specific immunotherapy in AML.","['Almstedt, Maika', 'Blagitko-Dorfs, Nadja', 'Duque-Afonso, Jesus', 'Karbach, Julia', 'Pfeifer, Dietmar', 'Jager, Elke', 'Lubbert, Michael']","['Almstedt M', 'Blagitko-Dorfs N', 'Duque-Afonso J', 'Karbach J', 'Pfeifer D', 'Jager E', 'Lubbert M']","['Department of Medicine, Division Hematology and Oncology, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CTAG1B protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (MAGEA1 protein, human)', '0 (MAGEA3 protein, human)', '0 (MAGEB2 protein, human)', '0 (Melanoma-Specific Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, X/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genes, X-Linked/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Melanoma-Specific Antigens', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'U937 Cells/drug effects/metabolism']",,2010/04/13 06:00,2010/06/15 06:00,['2010/04/13 06:00'],"['2009/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2010/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(10)00082-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2010.02.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Jul;34(7):899-905. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2010.02.004.

Finally, several cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibiting factor (LIF), and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) are expressed in thyroid cancer cell lines, and they can be used for evaluating the inhibitory effects of several drugs in redifferentiation therapies. This review reports the latest advances in defining the actions of cytokines, and resumes the relationship between cytokines, thyroid diseases and thyroid cancer.","['Lumachi, Franco', 'Basso, Stefano M M', 'Orlando, Rocco']","['Lumachi F', 'Basso SM', 'Orlando R']","['Department of Surgical & Gastroenterological Sciences, University of Padua, School of Medicine, 35128 Padova, Italy. flumachi@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmunity/immunology', 'Cytokines/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/immunology/pathology', 'Thyroid Gland/*immunology/*pathology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/diagnosis/*immunology/*pathology/therapy']",58,2010/04/13 06:00,2010/07/31 06:00,['2010/04/13 06:00'],"['2009/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S1043-4666(10)00066-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cyto.2010.03.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2010 Jun;50(3):229-33. doi: 10.1016/j.cyto.2010.03.005.

Moreover, activating mutations of the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) receptor can be found in approximately 30% of patients, thereby representing one of the most frequent single genetic alterations in AML. AEE788, a novel dual receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of endothelial growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is being studied in several solid tumors with remarkable success. It is not known, however, about the efficacy of this inhibitor in the treatment of AML. Therefore, we investigated the effect of AEE788 in the treatment of three human AML cell lines and seven AML patient samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell survival in THP-1, MOLM-13, and MV4-11 cell lines (the two last harboring the FLT3/internal tandem duplication mutation) and AML blasts incubated with 0.5 to 15 microM AEE788 were quantified. We also studied the activation of VEGF/VEGF receptors loop, FLT3, and their downstream effectors (Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, signal transducers and activators of transcription 5, and nuclear factor-kappaB). RESULTS: Our data showed that AEE788 was a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of FLT3 activity and had antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity in AML-derived cell lines and AML blasts that presented phosphorylation of the FLT3 receptor. Consistently, in these cells AEE788 abrogated VEGF/VEGF receptors activation and the survival signaling pathways studied. CONCLUSION: Taken together, the activity of AEE788 might represent a promising new option of targeting FLT3 for the treatment of AML.","['Barbarroja, Nuria', 'Torres, Luis-Aristides', 'Rodriguez-Ariza, Antonio', 'Valverde-Estepa, Araceli', 'Lopez-Sanchez, Laura Maria', 'Ruiz-Limon, Patricia', 'Perez-Sanchez, Carlos', 'Carretero, Rosario Maria', 'Velasco, Francisco', 'Lopez-Pedrera, Chary']","['Barbarroja N', 'Torres LA', 'Rodriguez-Ariza A', 'Valverde-Estepa A', 'Lopez-Sanchez LM', 'Ruiz-Limon P', 'Perez-Sanchez C', 'Carretero RM', 'Velasco F', 'Lopez-Pedrera C']","['Fundacion IMABIS, Hospital Universitario Virgen de la Victoria, Malaga, Spain. nuria.barbarroja.exts@juntadeandalucia.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'F9JLR95I3I (AEE 788)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",,2010/04/13 06:00,2010/07/31 06:00,['2010/04/13 06:00'],"['2010/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00132-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.03.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Aug;38(8):641-52. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.03.017.

So far, there have been no reports of a functional consequence of this aberrant expression. The granulocytic marker carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 6 (CEACAM6, CD66c) is a GPI-anchored molecule that is reported to be the most frequently aberrantly expressed myeloid marker in ALL with a strong correlation with genotype. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We mimicked CEACAM6 signaling in ALL cells by cross-linking with anti-CEACAM6 antibody. Next, we measured a response to CEACAM6 signaling by integrin subunits expression, integrin ligand binding, phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2), Akt, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and apoptosis by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Following CEACAM6 cross-linking in ALL cells, we detected Erk1/2, Akt, and p38 MAPK phosphorylation and integrin upregulation, as well as enhanced binding of integrin ligands (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [VCAM-1] and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1]). However, CEACAM6 signaling resulted in an increase in apoptosis, unlike other GPI-anchored molecules, such as CD24. CONCLUSION: The present study is the first to demonstrate the functional consequences of CEACAM6 cross-linking in B-cell precursor ALL cells.","['Kanderova, Veronika', 'Hrusak, Ondrej', 'Kalina, Tomas']","['Kanderova V', 'Hrusak O', 'Kalina T']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Charles University Prague, University Hospital Motol, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CEACAM6 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Integrins)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology/*metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Capping', 'Integrins/immunology/metabolism', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/immunology/metabolism', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/immunology/metabolism', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/immunology/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects/immunology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/immunology/metabolism']",,2010/04/13 06:00,2010/07/31 06:00,['2010/04/13 06:00'],"['2009/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00133-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.03.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Aug;38(8):653-660.e1. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.03.018.

This work aims to develop analysis techniques that rapidly detect stimulus-specific intracellular protein phosphorylation and association, with specific emphasis on identifying phosphoproteins associated with p65, a nuclear regulatory factor. The analytical strategy includes immunoprecipitation of the target protein along with its associated proteins, tryptic digestion directly on the antibody beads, on-plate phosphopeptide enrichment for matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), and collision-induced dissociation-tandem mass spectrometry (CID-MS/MS) to identify phosphopeptides and phosphorylation sites. Enrichment of the phosphopeptides from the tryptic digest occurs on a polymer-oxotitanium-modified gold wafer (Au-P-oxoTi) and consumes as little as 1 microL of digest solution. The Au-P-oxoTi wafers can capture both mono- and multiphosphorylated peptides from model protein digests containing high concentrations of nonphosphopeptides, urea, and salts. When combined with MALDI-MS/MS, the enrichment technique reveals nine phosphopeptides from p65-associated proteins immunoprecipitated from human acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cell nuclear extracts. Semiquantitative MALDI-MS shows that the levels of these proteins increase dramatically after treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Overall, these techniques facilitated the identification of five p65-associated proteins, two of which were not previously reported to interact with p65.","['Wang, Wei-Han', 'Palumbo, Amanda M', 'Tan, Yu-Jing', 'Reid, Gavin E', 'Tepe, Jetze J', 'Bruening, Merlin L']","['Wang WH', 'Palumbo AM', 'Tan YJ', 'Reid GE', 'Tepe JJ', 'Bruening ML']","['Department of Chemistry, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,"['0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'D1JT611TNE (Titanium)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Extracts/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Computational Biology', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/metabolism', 'Phosphopeptides/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Polymers/chemistry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization/*methods', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry/*methods', 'Titanium/chemistry', 'Transcription Factor RelA/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Trypsin/chemistry/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/chemistry/metabolism']",,2010/04/13 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/04/13 06:00'],"['2010/04/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/pr901200m [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2010 Jun 4;9(6):3005-15. doi: 10.1021/pr901200m.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We designed a process to decrease the number of manual differential cell counts without impacting patient care. METHODS: We selected new criteria that prompt manual counts and studied the impact these changes had in 2 days of work and in samples of patients with newly diagnosed leukemia, sickle cell disease, and presence of left shift. RESULTS: By using fewer parameters and expanding our ranges we decreased the number of manual counts by 20%. The parameters that prompted manual counts most frequently were the presence of blast flags and nucleated red blood cells, 2 parameters that were not changed. The parameters that accounted for a decrease in the number of manual counts were the white blood cell count and large unstained cells. Eight of 32 patients with newly diagnosed leukemia did not show blast flags; however, other parameters triggered manual counts. In 47 patients with sickle cell disease, nucleated red cells and red cell variability prompted manual review. Bands were observed in 18% of the specimens and 4% would not have been counted manually with the new criteria, for the latter the mean band count was 2.6%.

It is estimated that about 50,000 BMT per year are currently performed at more than 500 clinical centers all over the world. Total body irradiation (TBI) in combination with intensive chemotherapy (CT) proves to be a method without alternative in the preparation of patients with hematologic diseases for bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cells transplantation. Fractionated TBI is applied in myeloablative regimens where patients receive between 10 and 15 Gy. In the recent decade establishing the immunoreactivity of the graft lead to the introduction of nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens, including TBI, most often with a single dose of the order of 2 Gy received before transplantation. It is only in the last decade that the Bulgarian onco-radiologic community extended its knowledge and experience in the field of bone marrow transplantology. The first autologous BMT in Bulgaria was carried out in 1997, the first allogeneic BMT with conditioning TBI regimen--in 2002 and the first BMT with nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen including TBI with 2 Gy--in 2005. AIM OF The aim of the present review was to go over some aspects of the clinical experience that has been accumulated for the last ten years in the field of nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens and BMT. We also survey the basis for developing nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens, their aims and purposes, the main indications for their application, observed toxicity and therapeutic efficiency.

This feasibility study addressed MiCK in endometrial cancer specimens. METHODS: Endometrial cancer specimens from total abdominal hysterectomies were processed at a central laboratory. Single cell suspensions of viable endometrial cancer cells were plated in individual wells. Single and combination regimens were tested: combinations of doxorubicin, cisplatin, and paclitaxel and carboplatin and paclitaxel (Gynecologic Oncology Group [GOG] 209 endometrial cancer phase III trial arms) as well as single agent testing with paclitaxel, carboplatin, doxorubicin, cisplatin, ifosfamide, and vincristine (active agents in GOG trials). Apoptosis was measured continuously over 48 hours. RESULTS: Fifteen of nineteen patients had successful assays. The highest mean chemo sensitivity was noted in the combination of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel with lower mean chemosensitivity for carboplatin and paclitaxel. Combination chemotherapy had higher chemosensitivity than single drug chemotherapy. However, in 25% of patients a single drug had higher chemosensitivity than combination chemotherapy. As single agents, ifosfamide, cisplatin, and paclitaxel had the highest kinetic unit values. CONCLUSION: Using a panel of agents simulating clinical dose regimens, the MiCK assay was feasible in evaluating in vitro chemosensitivity of endometrial cancer. MiCK assay results correlated with GOG clinical trial results. However, 25% of patients might be best treated with single agent chemotherapy selected by MiCK. Ifosfamide, cisplatin, and paclitaxel appear to have high activity as single agents. MiCK may be useful in future new drug testing and individualizing endometrial cancer patient's chemotherapy management.","['Ballard, Karen S', 'Homesley, Howard D', 'Hodson, Charles', 'Presant, Cary A', 'Rutledge, James', 'Hallquist, Allan', 'Perree, Mathieu']","['Ballard KS', 'Homesley HD', 'Hodson C', 'Presant CA', 'Rutledge J', 'Hallquist A', 'Perree M']","['Deptartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology, East Carolina University Brody School of Medicine, Greenville, NC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),J Gynecol Oncol,Journal of gynecologic oncology,101483150,,,,,2010/04/10 06:00,2010/04/10 06:01,['2010/04/10 06:00'],"['2009/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/04 00:00 [revised]', '2010/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3802/jgo.2010.21.1.45 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gynecol Oncol. 2010 Mar;21(1):45-9. doi: 10.3802/jgo.2010.21.1.45.

It is a heavily glycosylated protein with six potential N-linked glycosylation sites. Previous reports showed that abnormal glycosylation of FcalphaR was involved in some diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus infection, alcoholic liver cirrhosis and IgA nephropathy. In this study, we examined the effects of N-glycosylation on interaction between FcalphaR and IgA. We found that depletion of N-glycosylation of FcalphaR transfected in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by tunicamycin resulted in increased IgA binding. To identify which glycosylation site is responsible for increased IgA binding, we performed site-directed mutagenesis at each N-linked glycosylation site by changing asparagine to glutamine. Flow cytometry analysis of IgA binding to CHO cells transfected with mutated FcalphaR showed that deglycosylation of FcalphaR at individual N44, N120, N156, N165 or N177 site did not affect IgA binding but deglycosylation at N58 resulted in marked increase of IgA binding. Similar result was shown for N58Q-FcalphaR transfected RBL2H3, a rat basophilic leukemia cell line. Furthermore, increased IgA binding was also observed on desialylated FcalphaR after neuraminidase treatment and desialylation of N58 contributed most to the increased IgA binding. These data demonstrated that glycosylation at N58 site influenced FcalphaR binding to IgA.","['Xue, Jing', 'Zhao, Qing', 'Zhu, Liping', 'Zhang, Wei']","['Xue J', 'Zhao Q', 'Zhu L', 'Zhang W']","['Department of Immunology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, School of Basic Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, 100005 Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Glycobiology,Glycobiology,9104124,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Fc(alpha) receptor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*metabolism', 'Asparagine/genetics', 'Binding Sites', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glutamine/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin A/*metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/genetics/*metabolism']",,2010/04/10 06:00,2010/10/13 06:00,['2010/04/10 06:00'],"['2010/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['cwq048 [pii]', '10.1093/glycob/cwq048 [doi]']",ppublish,Glycobiology. 2010 Jul;20(7):905-15. doi: 10.1093/glycob/cwq048.

Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) exerts its therapeutic effect by promoting degradation of an oncogenic protein that drives the growth of APL cells, PML-RARalpha (a fusion protein containing sequences from the PML zinc finger protein and retinoic acid receptor alpha). PML and PML-RARalpha degradation is triggered by their SUMOylation, but the mechanism by which As2O3 induces this posttranslational modification is unclear. Here we show that arsenic binds directly to cysteine residues in zinc fingers located within the RBCC domain of PML-RARalpha and PML. Arsenic binding induces PML oligomerization, which increases its interaction with the small ubiquitin-like protein modifier (SUMO)-conjugating enzyme UBC9, resulting in enhanced SUMOylation and degradation. The identification of PML as a direct target of As2O3 provides new insights into the drug's mechanism of action and its specificity for APL.","['Zhang, Xiao-Wei', 'Yan, Xiao-Jing', 'Zhou, Zi-Ren', 'Yang, Fei-Fei', 'Wu, Zi-Yu', 'Sun, Hong-Bin', 'Liang, Wen-Xue', 'Song, Ai-Xin', 'Lallemand-Breitenbach, Valerie', 'Jeanne, Marion', 'Zhang, Qun-Ye', 'Yang, Huai-Yu', 'Huang, Qiu-Hua', 'Zhou, Guang-Biao', 'Tong, Jian-Hua', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Wu, Ji-Hui', 'Hu, Hong-Yu', 'de The, Hugues', 'Chen, Sai-Juan', 'Chen, Zhu']","['Zhang XW', 'Yan XJ', 'Zhou ZR', 'Yang FF', 'Wu ZY', 'Sun HB', 'Liang WX', 'Song AX', 'Lallemand-Breitenbach V', 'Jeanne M', 'Zhang QY', 'Yang HY', 'Huang QH', 'Zhou GB', 'Tong JH', 'Zhang Y', 'Wu JH', 'Hu HY', 'de The H', 'Chen SJ', 'Chen Z']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 Rui Jin Road II, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxazines)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (ReAsH-EDT2 compound)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (SUMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (p-aminophenylarsine oxide)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic/*metabolism', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxazines/metabolism', 'Oxides/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination', 'Zinc Fingers']",,2010/04/10 06:00,2010/04/27 06:00,['2010/04/10 06:00'],"['2010/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [medline]']","['328/5975/240 [pii]', '10.1126/science.1183424 [doi]']",ppublish,Science. 2010 Apr 9;328(5975):240-3. doi: 10.1126/science.1183424.,,,,,,,,['Science. 2010 Apr 9;328(5975):184-5.

To assess its possible prognostic value, CRLF2 expression was analyzed in 555 childhood pB-ALL patients treated according to the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster 2000 (ALL-BFM 2000) protocol. Besides CRLF2 rearrangements, high-level CRLF2 expression was seen in cases with supernumerary copies of the CRLF2 locus. On the basis of the detection of CRLF2 rearrangements, a CRLF2 high-expression group (n = 49) was defined. This group had a 6-year relapse incidence of 31% plus or minus 8% compared with 11% plus or minus 1% in the CRLF2 low-expression group (P = .006). This difference was mainly attributable to an extremely high incidence of relapse (71% +/- 19%) in non-high-risk patients with P2RY8-CRLF2 rearrangement. The assessment of CRLF2 aberrations may therefore serve as new stratification tool in Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster-based protocols by identifying additional high-risk patients who may benefit from an intensified and/or targeted treatment.","['Cario, Gunnar', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Romey, Renja', 'Gesk, Stefan', 'Vater, Inga', 'Harbott, Jochen', 'Schrauder, Andre', 'Moericke, Anja', 'Izraeli, Shai', 'Akasaka, Takashi', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Siebert, Reiner', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Stanulla, Martin']","['Cario G', 'Zimmermann M', 'Romey R', 'Gesk S', 'Vater I', 'Harbott J', 'Schrauder A', 'Moericke A', 'Izraeli S', 'Akasaka T', 'Dyer MJ', 'Siebert R', 'Schrappe M', 'Stanulla M']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Arnold-Heller-Strasse 3, Kiel, Germany. g.cario@pediatrics.uni-kiel.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CRLF2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)']",IM,"['Child', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2010/04/10 06:00,2010/08/03 06:00,['2010/04/10 06:00'],"['2010/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)58388-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-11-256131 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jul 1;115(26):5393-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-11-256131.

Factors affecting the speed of introduction, international diffusion, and durability of use of innovations are, however, poorly understood. DESIGN AND METHODS: We used data on 251,106 hematopoietic stem cell transplants from 591 teams in 36 European countries to analyze the increase and decrease in such transplants for breast cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia and the replacement of bone marrow by peripheral blood as the source of stem cells as processes of diffusion. Regression analyses were used to measure the quantitative impact of defined macro- and microeconomic factors, to look for significant associations (t-test), and to describe the coefficient of determination or explanatory content (R(2)). RESULTS: Gross national income per capita, World Bank category, team density, team distribution, team size, team experience and, team innovator status were all significantly associated with some or all of the changes. The analyses revealed different patterns of associations and a wide range of explanatory content. Macro- and micro-economic factors were sufficient to explain the increase of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants in general (R(2) = 78.41%) and for chronic myeloid leukemia in particular (R(2) = 79.39%). They were insufficient to explain the changes in stem cell source (R(2) =26.79% autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplants; R(2) = 9.67% allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants) or the decreases in hematopoietic stem cell transplants (R(2) =10.22% breast cancer; R(2)=33.17% chronic myeloid leukemia). CONCLUSIONS: The diffusion of hematopoietic stem cell transplants is more complex than previously thought. Availability of resources, evidence, external regulations and, expectations were identified as key determinants. These data might serve as a model for diffusion of medical technology in general.","['Gratwohl, Alois', 'Schwendener, Alvin', 'Baldomero, Helen', 'Gratwohl, Michael', 'Apperley, Jane', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Frauendorfer, Karl']","['Gratwohl A', 'Schwendener A', 'Baldomero H', 'Gratwohl M', 'Apperley J', 'Niederwieser D', 'Frauendorfer K']","['Department of Medicine, University Hospital, University of Basel, Switzerland. hematology@uhbs.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/economics/*therapy', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/economics/*statistics & numerical data/trends', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/economics/*therapy', 'Medical Laboratory Science', 'Models, Biological', 'Prognosis']",,2010/04/10 06:00,2010/08/25 06:00,['2010/04/10 06:00'],"['2010/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['95/4/637 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.015586 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Apr;95(4):637-43. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.015586.,,,['MC_G0802523/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,PMC2857194,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we investigated the mechanism by which bortezomib induces apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: Using western blot analysis, we monitored the regulation of BCL2 family members, proteins of the unfolded protein response (endoplasmic reticulum stress response) and activation of caspases in relation to induction of apoptosis (measured by annexin-propidium iodide staining and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential) by bortezomib in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. RESULTS: Bortezomib induced apoptosis through activation of the mitochondrial pathway independently of changes associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress. Perturbation of mitochondria was regulated by a rapid and transcription-independent increase of NOXA protein, which preceded release of cytochrome c, HtrA2, Smac and activation of caspase-9 and -3. NOXA had a short half life (approximately 1-2 h) and was ubiquitinated on at least three primary lysine residues, resulting in proteasomal-dependent degradation. Down-regulation of NOXA, using short interfering RNA in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, decreased bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Finally bortezomib when combined with seliciclib resulted in a stronger and earlier increase in NOXA protein, caspase-3 cleavage and induction of apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight a critical role for NOXA in bortezomib-induced apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and suggest that this drug may become more efficient for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia if combined with other agents able to interfere with the basal levels of MCL1.","['Baou, Maria', 'Kohlhaas, Susan L', 'Butterworth, Michael', 'Vogler, Meike', 'Dinsdale, David', 'Walewska, Renata', 'Majid, Aneela', 'Eldering, Eric', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Cohen, Gerald M']","['Baou M', 'Kohlhaas SL', 'Butterworth M', 'Vogler M', 'Dinsdale D', 'Walewska R', 'Majid A', 'Eldering E', 'Dyer MJ', 'Cohen GM']","['MRC Toxicology Unit, PO Box 138, Leicester, LE1 9HN.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism/*physiology', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Ubiquitination']",,2010/04/10 06:00,2012/11/09 06:00,['2010/04/10 06:00'],"['2010/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.022368 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.022368 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Sep;95(9):1510-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.022368.

Our aim was to determine whether dexamethasone results in a better outcome than prednisolone. DESIGN AND METHODS: Adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma were randomized to receive, as part of their induction therapy on days 1-8 and 15-22, either dexamethasone 8 mg/m(2) or prednisolone 60 mg/m(2). Those who reached complete remission were given two courses of consolidation therapy with high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone and methotrexate and asparaginase. Subsequently patients younger than 50 years, with a suitable donor, were to undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation, whereas the others were planned to receive either an autologous stem cell transplant or high-dose maintenance chemotherapy with prophylactic central nervous system irradiation. Randomization was done with a minimization technique. The primary endpoint was event-free survival and the analyses was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: Between August 1995 and October 2003, 325 patients between 15 to 72 years of age were randomized to receive either dexamethasone (163 patients) or prednisolone (162 patients). After induction and the course of first consolidation therapy, 131 (80.4%) patients in the dexamethasone group and 124 (76.5%) in the prednisolone group achieved complete remission. No significant difference was observed between the two treatment groups with regards to 6-year event-free survival rates (+/-SE) which were 25.9% (3.6%) and 28.7% (3.5%) in the dexamethasone and prednisolone groups, respectively (P=0.82, hazard ratio 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.75-1.25). Disease-free survival after complete remission was also similar in the dexamethasone and prednisolone groups, the 6-year rates being 32.3% and 37.5%, respectively (hazard ratio 1.03; 95% confidence interval 0.76-1.40). The 6-year cumulative incidences of relapse were 49.8% and 53.5% (Gray's test: P=0.30) while the 6-year cumulative incidences of death were 18% and 9% (Gray's test: P=0.07).

This study describes the clinical and biological characteristics of 229 patients with T-cell or NK-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: The diagnosis was based on a large granular lymphocyte expansion (> 0.5x10(9)/L) lasting more than 6 months. Monoclonal T-cell receptor gamma gene rearrangement was detected in all the cases of T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia. Patients with chronic NK-cell lymphocytosis had an indolent disease, while those with multiorgan large granular lymphocyte infiltration and an aggressive clinical disease were considered to have NK-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia. RESULTS: The diagnosis of T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia was confirmed in 201 cases, chronic NK-cell lymphocytosis in 27 cases and NK-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia in one case. Associated autoimmune diseases or other neoplasms were present in 74 and 32 cases, respectively. One hundred patients (44%) required treatment, mainly for neutropenia-associated infections (n=45), symptomatic autoimmune diseases (n =24), transfusion-dependant anemia (n=18), and other causes (n=13). Patients were treated with steroids (n= 33), methotrexate (n=62), cytoxan (n=32), or cyclosporine (n=24) either as first-, second-, third- or fourth-line therapy. The overall response rate at 3 months and complete response rate for the various treatments were as follows: steroids (12% and 3%), methotrexate (55% and 21%), cytoxan (66% and 47%), cyclosporine (21% and 4%), respectively. Four out of 13 patients responded to splenectomy. Eleven out of 15 patients responded to cytoxan after methotrexate treatment had failed. The mean number of treatments was 3.4 (range, 1-7). There were 15 large granular lymphocyte leukemia-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia and chronic NK-cell lymphocytosis have similar clinical and biological features and responses to treatment.

Generally, endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are not pathogenic in their original hosts; however, some ERVs induce diseases.

This virus was closely related to xenotropic murine leukemia virus (X-MLV) and designated as xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV). The origin and transmission route of XMRV are still unknown at present; however, XMRV may be derived from ERVs of rodents because X-MLVs are ERVs of inbred and wild mice.

At diagnosis, we determined the characteristic immunophenotype of the leukemic cells by flow cytometry and also investigated the expression of CD34 and CD38 to define a population of immunophenotypically immature cells (CD34(+)/CD38(-)). We then studied levels of minimal residual disease (MRD) after induction therapy (day 33) and after consolidation therapy (week 12). We found a significant, increasing correlation between the prevalence of CD34(+)/CD38(-) cells at diagnosis and MRD levels at day 33 and week 12.

The features of restrictive usage and absence of partial T cell clones have been found in patients with CML. However, the T-cell clonal evolution of Ph-negative malignancies during treatment for CML is still unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the dynamic change of clonal proliferation of T cell receptor (TCR) Valpha and Vbeta subfamilies in one CML patient who developed Ph-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after interferon and imatinib therapy. METHODS: The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples were collected at the 3 time points (diagnosis of Ph-positive chronic phase (CP) CML, developing Ph-negative ALL and post inductive chemotherapy (CT) for Ph-negative ALL, respectively). The CDR3 size of TCR Valpha and Vbeta repertoire were detected by RT-PCR. The PCR products were further analyzed by genescan to identify T cell clonality. RESULTS: The CML patient who achieved complete cytogenetic remission (CCR) after 5 years of IFN-alpha therapy suddenly developed Ph-negative ALL 6 months following switch to imatinib therapy. The expression pattern and clonality of TCR Valpha/Vbeta T cells changed in different disease stages. The restrictive expression of Valpha/Vbeta subfamilies could be found in all three stages, and partial subfamily of T cells showed clonal proliferation. Additionally, there have been obvious differences in Valpha/Vbeta subfamily of T cells between the stages of Ph-positive CML-CP and Ph-negative ALL. The Valpha10 and Vbeta3 T cells evolved from oligoclonality to polyclonality, the Vbeta13 T cells changed from bioclonality to polyclonality, when Ph-negative ALL developed. CONCLUSIONS: Restrictive usage and clonal proliferation of different Valpha/Vbeta subfamily T cells between the stages of Ph-positive CP and Ph-negative ALL were detected in one patient. These changes may play a role in Ph- negative leukemogenesis.","['Wang, Liang', 'Zhu, Kanger', 'Zha, Xianfeng', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Chen, Si', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Wang L', 'Zhu K', 'Zha X', 'Chen S', 'Yang L', 'Chen S', 'Li Y']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Child', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interferons/administration & dosage', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/*genetics', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2010/04/10 06:00,2010/08/11 06:00,['2010/04/10 06:00'],"['2009/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-3-14 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-3-14 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2010 Apr 9;3:14. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-3-14.,,,,20100409,PMC2859394,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, this potential has largely been unrealized to date due to the high variability of measurements, uncertainties in the distribution of proteins in a given population, and the difficulty of extracting repeatable diagnostic markers using current statistical tools. With studies consisting of perhaps only dozens of samples, and possibly hundreds of variables, overfitting is a serious complication. To overcome these difficulties, we have developed a Bayesian inductive method which uses model-independent methods of discovering relationships between spectral features. This method appears to efficiently discover network models which not only identify connections between the disease and key features, but also organizes relationships between features--and furthermore creates a stable classifier that categorizes new data at predicted error rates. RESULTS: The method was applied to artificial data with known feature relationships and typical TOF-MS variability introduced, and was able to recover those relationships nearly perfectly. It was also applied to blood sera data from a 2004 leukemia study, and showed high stability of selected features under cross-validation. Verification of results using withheld data showed excellent predictive power. The method showed improvement over traditional techniques, and naturally incorporated measurement uncertainties. The relationships discovered between features allowed preliminary identification of a protein biomarker which was consistent with other cancer studies and later verified experimentally. CONCLUSIONS: This method appears to avoid overfitting in biologic data and produce stable feature sets in a network model. The network structure provides additional information about the relationships among features that is useful to guide further biochemical analysis. In addition, when used to classify new data, these feature sets are far more consistent than those produced by many traditional techniques.","['Kuschner, Karl W', 'Malyarenko, Dariya I', 'Cooke, William E', 'Cazares, Lisa H', 'Semmes, O J', 'Tracy, Eugene R']","['Kuschner KW', 'Malyarenko DI', 'Cooke WE', 'Cazares LH', 'Semmes OJ', 'Tracy ER']","['Department of Physics, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, USA. kwkusc@wm.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Bayes Theorem', 'Biomarkers/chemistry', 'Mass Spectrometry/*methods', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated', 'Proteomics/*methods']",,2010/04/10 06:00,2010/10/28 06:00,['2010/04/10 06:00'],"['2009/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-11-177 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-11-177 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2010 Apr 8;11:177. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-11-177.,,,"['R01 CA126118/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA126118/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",20100408,PMC3098056,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The methods of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization were utilized to examine protein expression and amplification of Bmi-1 in 30 normal ovaries, 30 ovarian cystadenomas, 40 borderline ovarian tumors and 179 ovarian carcinomas. RESULTS: Intensive expression of Bmi-1 was detected in none of the normal ovaries, 3% cystadenomas, 10% borderline tumors, and 37% ovarian carcinomas, respectively. Amplification of Bmi-1 was detected in 8% of ovarian carcinomas. In ovarian carcinomas, significant positive associations were found between intensive expression of Bmi-1 and the tumors ascending histological grade, later pT/pN/pM and FIGO stages (P < 0.05). In univariate survival analysis of the ovarian carcinoma cohorts, a significant association of intensive expression of Bmi-1 with shortened patient survival (mean 49.3 months versus 100.3 months, p < 0.001) was demonstrated. Importantly, Bmi-1 expression provided significant independent prognostic parameters in multivariate analysis (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence that intensive expression of Bmi-1 might be important in the acquisition of an invasive and/or aggressive phenotype of ovarian carcinoma, and serve as a independent biomarker for shortened survival time of patients.","['Yang, Guo-Fen', 'He, Wei-Peng', 'Cai, Mu-Yan', 'He, Li-Ru', 'Luo, Jun-Hang', 'Deng, Hai-Xia', 'Guan, Xin-Yuan', 'Zeng, Mu-Sheng', 'Zeng, Yi-Xin', 'Xie, Dan']","['Yang GF', 'He WP', 'Cai MY', 'He LR', 'Luo JH', 'Deng HX', 'Guan XY', 'Zeng MS', 'Zeng YX', 'Xie D']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, No, 651, Dongfeng Road East, 510060 Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/biosynthesis']",,2010/04/10 06:00,2010/06/15 06:00,['2010/04/10 06:00'],"['2009/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-10-133 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-10-133 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2010 Apr 8;10:133. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-10-133.,,,,20100408,PMC2858112,,,['Epigenomics. 2010 Oct;2(5):609-10.

Our analyses provided unprecedented evidence that remarkably different pathognomonic transcriptomes dominate the biology of infant versus paediatric high risk ALL. The genetic signature of infant ALL is characterized by concomitant overexpression of mitogenic and anti-apoptotic genes, some of which have been associated with early relapse in ALL. Our study demonstrated that primary leukaemia cells from infant ALL patients expressed significantly higher levels of genes for cytokines that mediate their biological effects through stimulation of the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway including interleukin 1a, interleukin 1b, interleukin 2, and interleukin 7. We further showed that the JAK/STAT signalling pathway is constitutively active in CD10(-) infant ALL cells and treatment with a JAK3 inhibitor or a pan-JAK kinase inhibitor effectively triggered their apoptosis. These findings identified JAK3 as an attractive molecular target for disrupting the constitutively deregulated anti-apoptotic STAT3 and STAT5 signalling pathways in infant ALL cells.","['Qazi, Sanjive', 'Uckun, Fatih M']","['Qazi S', 'Uckun FM']","['Molecular Oncology and Drug Discovery Program, Parker Hughes Institute, St. Paul, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Janus Kinase 3/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",,2010/04/10 06:00,2010/07/30 06:00,['2010/04/10 06:00'],"['2010/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH8177 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08177.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Jun;149(6):865-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08177.x.

Several methods have been proposed for modeling the cumulative incidence function with independent observations. However, when subjects are clustered, one needs to account for the presence of a cluster effect either through frailty modeling of the hazard or subdistribution hazard, or by adjusting for the within-cluster correlation in a marginal model. We propose a method for modeling the marginal cumulative incidence function directly. We compute leave-one-out pseudo-observations from the cumulative incidence function at several time points. These are used in a generalized estimating equation to model the marginal cumulative incidence curve, and obtain consistent estimates of the model parameters. A sandwich variance estimator is derived to adjust for the within-cluster correlation. The method is easy to implement using standard software once the pseudovalues are obtained, and is a generalization of several existing models. Simulation studies show that the method works well to adjust the SE for the within-cluster correlation. We illustrate the method on a dataset looking at outcomes after bone marrow transplantation.","['Logan, Brent R', 'Zhang, Mei-Jie', 'Klein, John P']","['Logan BR', 'Zhang MJ', 'Klein JP']","['Division of Biostatistics, Medical College of Wisconsin, 8701 Watertown Plank Road, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53226, USA. blogan@mcw.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Biometrics,Biometrics,0370625,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biometry/*methods', '*Cluster Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Statistical', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,2010/04/10 06:00,2011/07/12 06:00,['2010/04/10 06:00'],"['2010/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['BIOM1416 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1541-0420.2010.01416.x [doi]']",ppublish,Biometrics. 2011 Mar;67(1):1-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1541-0420.2010.01416.x.,,,"['R01 CA054706/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA054706-10A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA54706-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2902638,['NIHMS187313'],,,,"['(c) 2010, The International Biometric Society.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address this issue, the anti-tumor activity of alemtuzumab was studied in disseminated and subcutaneous xenograft tumor models. The density of CD52 target antigen on the surface of tumor cells appeared to correlate with the anti-tumor activity of alemtuzumab. Deglycosylation of alemtuzumab resulted in a loss of cytotoxicity in vitro and was found to abolish anti-tumor activity in vivo. Individual inactivation of effector mechanisms in tumor-bearing mice indicated that the protective activity of alemtuzumab in vivo was primarily dependent on ADCC mediated by neutrophils and to a lesser extent NK cells. Increasing the number of circulating neutrophils by treatment with G-CSF enhanced the anti-tumor activity of the antibody, thus providing further evidence for the involvement of neutrophils as effector cells in the activity of alemtuzumab.","['Siders, William M', 'Shields, Jacqueline', 'Garron, Carrie', 'Hu, Yanping', 'Boutin, Paula', 'Shankara, Srinivas', 'Weber, William', 'Roberts, Bruce', 'Kaplan, Johanne M']","['Siders WM', 'Shields J', 'Garron C', 'Hu Y', 'Boutin P', 'Shankara S', 'Weber W', 'Roberts B', 'Kaplan JM']","['Genzyme Corporation, Framingham, MA 010701, USA. bill.siders@genzyme.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'CD52 Antigen', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*immunology/pathology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2010/04/10 06:00,2010/10/01 06:00,['2010/04/10 06:00'],"['2010/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428191003777963 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Jul;51(7):1293-304. doi: 10.3109/10428191003777963.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: ES-FISH probe and D-FISH probe were used, respectively, to detect the BCR/ABL fusion gene in 74 cases with typical t(9;22)(q34;q11) and 37 cases with variant t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation or complex karyotypic abnormalities containing Ph translocation. RESULTS: The BCR/ABL fusion gene in all cases with typical t(9;22)(q34;q11) could be detected by both FISH probes. D-FISH had a signal pattern of 1O1G2F, while ES-FISH showed a signal pattern of 2O1G1F. ES-FISH enables the minor breakpoint cluster region to be identified in 9 cases (12.2% ) of Ph-positive leukemia, whereas D-FISH could not differentiate the minor breakpoint cluster region from major breakpoint cluster region. D-FISH could distinguish simple ABL gene deletion from simultaneous deletion of the ABL and BCR genes in 8 cases (10.8%) of Ph-positive leukemia patients, but ES-FISH could not. For variant Ph translocation or complex karyotypic abnormalities containing Ph translocation, each FISH probe showed four or six types of signal pattern, most of which were atypical. The exact interpretation was dependent on conventional karyotypic analysis and FISH on metaphases. CONCLUSION: ES-FISH and D-FISH probes displayed different signal patterns in Ph-positive leukemia due to their differences in size and covered regions. ES-FISH and D-FISH probes may be selected as better probe for Ph-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia and Ph-positive chronic myeloid leukemia, respectively. When imatinib was used for treatment, there was no preference between ES-FISH and D-FISH probe, because major breakpoint cluster region, minor breakpoint cluster region and partial sequence deletion of derivative chromosome 9, would not affect the prognosis of Ph-positive leukemia. However, considering that ES-FISH probe has a better cost-performance than D-FISH probe does, it is recommended as first choice.","['Jiang, Hui', 'Xue, Yong-quan', 'Pan, Jin-lan', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Dai, Hai-ping', 'Wu, Ya-fang', 'Wang, Yong', 'Shen, Juan', 'Chen, Su-ning']","['Jiang H', 'Xue YQ', 'Pan JL', 'Zhang J', 'Dai HP', 'Wu YF', 'Wang Y', 'Shen J', 'Chen SN']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Thrombosis and Hemostasis Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Health, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, P.R.

METHODS: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction with EvaGreen dye was established to detect the expression level of PRAME transcripts in the bone marrow mononuclear cells of 56 AML cases and 20 controls. The clinical association of PRAME transcripts was analyzed. RESULTS: The PRAME transcripts were 0-1.46% (median 0.18%) and 0-21 618.09% (median 9.79%) in controls and AML cases, respectively (P< 0.01).

The AML cell release of various chemokines is often correlated and three release clusters have been identified: CCL2-4/CXCL1/8, CCL5/CXCL9-11, and CCL13/17/22/24/CXCL5. CXCL8 is the chemokine usually released at highest levels. Based on their overall constitutive release profile, patients can be classified into distinct subsets that differ in their T cell chemotaxis towards the leukemic cells. The release profile is modified by hypoxia, differentiation status, pharmacological interventions, and T cell cytokine responses. The best investigated single chemokine in AML is CXCL12 that binds to CXCR4. CXCL12/CXCR4 is important in leukemogenesis through regulation of AML cell migration, and CXCR4 expression is an adverse prognostic factor for patient survival after chemotherapy. Even though AML cells usually release high levels of several chemokines, there is no general increase of serum chemokine levels in these patients and the levels are also influenced by patient age, disease status, chemotherapy regimen, and complicating infections. However, serum CXCL8 levels seem to partly reflect the leukemic cell burden in AML. Specific chemokine inhibitors are currently being developed, although redundancy and pleiotropy of the chemokine system are obstacles in drug development.","['Kittang, Astrid Olsnes', 'Hatfield, Kimberley', 'Sand, Kristoffer', 'Reikvam, Hakon', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Kittang AO', 'Hatfield K', 'Sand K', 'Reikvam H', 'Bruserud O']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,0110513,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Cell Movement', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*immunology/metabolism', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology']",,2010/04/09 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/04/09 06:00'],"['2010/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/82_2010_25 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 2010;341:149-72. doi: 10.1007/82_2010_25.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results showed that the emergence time of WT1(+)CD(8) (+)CTL/WT1(+)Tc1 cells after NST in AL patients was similar to that in CML patients (P = 0.58), while the emergence time of WT1(+)Th1 cells after NST in AL patients was shorter than in CML patients (P = 0.047).

No patient had chronic graft-versus-host disease. We found no difference in glomerular filtration rate estimated from cystatin C (105 vs 111 ml/min/1.73 m(2), p = 0.28). Patients had higher albumin excretion (0.8 vs 0.4 mg/mmol, p = 0.001), but no patient had overt albuminuria (>200 mg/L). Patients had higher diastolic blood pressure (74 vs 67 mmHg, p = 0.003). Two patients (11%) had hypertension. Patients had lower tubular reabsorption of phosphate (0.78 vs 0.91 mmol/L, p = 0.014) and higher excretion of alpha-1-microglobulin (AMG/urine creatinine, 0.4 vs 0.25 mg/mmol, p = 0.038), which correlated with time after SCT (r = 0.6, p = 0.01). We found no difference in fractional excretion (FE) of other electrolytes, amino acid excretion, or urine osmolality. We conclude that renal function was relatively well preserved at a median follow-up of 18 years after childhood SCT. The higher albumin excretion in our patients is of concern, as is the association between excretion of AMG and time after SCT, suggesting that both glomerular and tubular function may deteriorate further.","['Frisk, Per', 'Arvidson, Johan', 'Neveus, Tryggve']","['Frisk P', 'Arvidson J', 'Neveus T']","[""Unit of Pediatric Oncology, Children's Hospital, Uppsala, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. per.frisk@kbh.uu.se""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Pediatr Nephrol,"Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",8708728,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Chemical Analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/diagnosis/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects', 'Urinalysis', 'Young Adult']",,2010/04/09 06:00,2010/08/27 06:00,['2010/04/09 06:00'],"['2010/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00467-010-1501-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Nephrol. 2010 Jul;25(7):1337-42. doi: 10.1007/s00467-010-1501-6.

Designed in 1963 and re-discovered in 1990s, this drug's unique mechanism of action and favorable side-effect profile promise a major role in the management of lymphoproliferative disorders. Bendamustine has been designated as an orphan drug in the United States, conferring prolonged market exclusivity. OBJECTIVE: This article provides a comprehensive review of the data on efficacy and toxicity from trials investigating the use of bendamustine for the treatment of lymphoproliferative neoplasms. The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and pre-clinical studies with bendamustine are also reviewed. METHODS: MEDLINE and Pubmed databases (1970-2010) were searched using the terms bendamustine, bendamustin, Treanda, Ribomustin, SDX-105, IMET-3393, and Cytostasan. All relevant articles were reviewed and references screened for additional articles. The databases of the American Society of Hematology (2004-2009) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (1995-2009) were also searched for relevant abstracts. RESULTS: Bendamustine induces a remission in more than three-fourths of patients with rituximab-refractory indolent B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Combined with rituximab in vitro, bendamustine shows synergistic effects against various leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. Clinical trials supporting these results show that bendamustine plus rituximab is highly effective in patients with relapsed-refractory indolent lymphoma, inducing remissions in 90% or more and a median progression-free survival of 23-24 months. Bendamustine has been reasonably well tolerated in clinical trials with low propensity to induce alopecia. CONCLUSIONS: Combination of bendamustine and rituximab has the potential to become a new standard first-line treatment option for patients with FL, MCL, and indolent lymphomas. Results of ongoing trials will help to further elucidate the optimal role of bendamustine in indolent NHL.","['Tageja, Nishant', 'Nagi, Jasdeepa']","['Tageja N', 'Nagi J']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Detroit Medical Center, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA. ntageja@med.wayne.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Rituximab']",67,2010/04/09 06:00,2010/07/14 06:00,['2010/04/09 06:00'],"['2009/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-010-1317-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2010 Aug;66(3):413-23. doi: 10.1007/s00280-010-1317-x.

Both diseases affect a large fraction of the world population, with prostate cancer affecting one in six men, and CFS affecting an estimated 0.4 to 1% of the population. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Forty-five compounds, including twenty-eight drugs approved for use in humans, were evaluated against XMRV replication in vitro. We found that the retroviral integrase inhibitor, raltegravir, was potent and selective against XMRV at submicromolar concentrations, in MCF-7 and LNCaP cells, a breast cancer and prostate cancer cell line, respectively. Another integrase inhibitor, L-000870812, and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, zidovudine (ZDV), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) also inhibited XMRV replication. When combined, these drugs displayed mostly synergistic effects against this virus, suggesting that combination therapy may delay or prevent the selection of resistant viruses. CONCLUSIONS: If XMRV proves to be a causal factor in prostate cancer or CFS, these discoveries may allow for rational design of clinical trials.","['Singh, Ila R', 'Gorzynski, John E', 'Drobysheva, Daria', 'Bassit, Leda', 'Schinazi, Raymond F']","['Singh IR', 'Gorzynski JE', 'Drobysheva D', 'Bassit L', 'Schinazi RF']","['Department of Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States of America. ila.singh@path.utah.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Pyrrolidinones)', '43Y000U234 (Raltegravir Potassium)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/*methods', 'Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic/*virology', 'Female', 'Gammaretrovirus/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/drug effects', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*virology', 'Pyrrolidinones/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Raltegravir Potassium', 'Retroviridae Infections/*drug therapy', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*drug therapy', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",,2010/04/09 06:00,2011/06/17 06:00,['2010/04/09 06:00'],"['2010/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0009948 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Apr 1;5(4):e9948. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0009948.,,,"['P30 AI050409/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA149719/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2P30-AI-50409/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",20100401,PMC2848589,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dysregulation of the Pit/Oct/Unc (POU) domain-containing transcription factor POU4F1 is a recurring abnormality in t(8;21) AML. In this study, we showed that POU4F1 overexpression is highly correlated with, but not caused by, AE. We observed that AE markedly increases the self-renewal capacity of myeloid progenitors from murine bone marrow or fetal liver and drives the expansion of these cells in liquid culture. POU4F1 is neither necessary nor sufficient for these AE-dependent properties, suggesting that it contributes to leukemia through novel mechanisms. To identify targets of POU4F1, we performed gene expression profiling in primary mouse cells with genetically defined levels of POU4F1 and identified 140 differentially expressed genes. This expression signature was significantly enriched in human t(8;21) AML samples and was sufficient to cluster t(8;21) AML samples in an unsupervised hierarchical analysis. Among the most highly differentially expressed genes, half are known AML1/ETO targets, implying that the unique transcriptional signature of t(8;21) AML is, in part, attributable to POU4F1 and not AML1/ETO itself. These genes provide novel candidates for understanding the biology and developing therapeutic approaches for t(8;21) AML.","['Fortier, J M', 'Payton, J E', 'Cahan, P', 'Ley, T J', 'Walter, M J', 'Graubert, T A']","['Fortier JM', 'Payton JE', 'Cahan P', 'Ley TJ', 'Walter MJ', 'Graubert TA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology, Stem Cell Biology Section, Washington University, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (POU4F1 protein, human)', '0 (Pou4f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factor Brn-3A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Fetus/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Liver/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factor Brn-3A/*genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",,2010/04/09 06:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2010/04/09 06:00'],"['2010/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201061 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.61 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 May;24(5):950-7. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.61.

We report herein a comprehensive, retrospective, multivariate analysis of prognostic factors for survival and first on-study SRE in MM patients using data from the phase III, randomized study comparing zoledronic acid with pamidronate in MM or breast cancer. Cox regression analyses were used to assess 22 variables for prognostic significance (defined as associations with P<0.05) in patients with bone metabolism marker assessments and complete baseline variable data. Of 510 evaluable MM patients, 282 had complete covariate information and were included in models. Reduced Cox multivariate models identified five significant prognostic factors for first SRE (weight, race, high N-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX), high pain score, and need for narcotic analgesics) and seven for survival (age, SRE history, myeloma subtype, anemia, high lactate dehydrogenase, high NTX, and low albumin levels). High NTX was the only variable associated with elevated risks of both first SRE and death (P< or =0.02 for each). These analyses identified prognostic factors for SREs and survival in patients with MM. Taken together with current staging systems, these factors could further facilitate decision making for optimal treatment of myeloma bone disease, although further prospective assessments are needed.","['Terpos, E', 'Berenson, J', 'Cook, R J', 'Lipton, A', 'Coleman, R E']","['Terpos E', 'Berenson J', 'Cook RJ', 'Lipton A', 'Coleman RE']","['Department of Clinical Therapeutics, University of Athens School of Medicine, Athens, Greece. eterpos@med.uoa.gr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Bone Density Conservation Agents)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '6XC1PAD3KF (Zoledronic Acid)', 'OYY3447OMC (Pamidronate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Bone Density Conservation Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Diseases/*etiology/*mortality/pathology', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Diphosphonates/therapeutic use', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications/*mortality/pathology', 'Osteolysis/*pathology', 'Pamidronate', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Zoledronic Acid']",,2010/04/09 06:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2010/04/09 06:00'],"['2010/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201062 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.62 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 May;24(5):1043-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.62.

The tumor suppressor function of C/EBPalpha is shown by the findings that loss of expression or function of C/EBPalpha in leukemic blasts contributes to a block in myeloid cell differentiation and to leukemia. C/EBPalpha mutations are found in around 9% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The mechanism by which the mutant form of C/EBPalpha (C/EBPalpha-p30) exerts a differentiation block is not well understood. By using a proteomic screen, we have recently reported PIN1 as a target of C/EBPalpha-p30 in AML. In the present study, we show that C/EBPalpha-p30 induces PIN1 expression. We observed elevated PIN1 expression in leukemic patient samples. Induction of C/EBPalpha-p30 results in recruitment of E2F1 in the PIN1 promoter. We show that the inhibition of PIN1 leads to myeloid differentiation in primary AML blasts with C/EBPalpha mutations. Overexpression of PIN1 in myeloid cells leads to block of granulocyte differentiation. We also show that PIN1 increases the stability of the c-Jun protein by inhibiting c-Jun ubiquitination, and c-Jun blocks granulocyte differentiation mediated by C/EBPalpha. Our data suggest that the inhibition of PIN1 could be a potential strategy of treating AML patients with C/EBPalpha mutation.","['Pulikkan, J A', 'Dengler, V', 'Peer Zada, A A', 'Kawasaki, A', 'Geletu, M', 'Pasalic, Z', 'Bohlander, S K', 'Ryo, A', 'Tenen, D G', 'Behre, G']","['Pulikkan JA', 'Dengler V', 'Peer Zada AA', 'Kawasaki A', 'Geletu M', 'Pasalic Z', 'Bohlander SK', 'Ryo A', 'Tenen DG', 'Behre G']","['State Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Department of Oncology and Hematology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (PIN1 protein, human)', 'EC 5.2.1.8 (Peptidylprolyl Isomerase)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Blotting, Western', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*physiology', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proteomics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism']",,2010/04/09 06:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2010/04/09 06:00'],"['2010/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201037 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.37 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 May;24(5):914-23. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.37.

Use of dasatinib is frequently complicated by pleural effusions. This review highlights the risk factors for development of effusions as well as characteristics of the pleural fluid. Potential mechanisms involved and a set of management recommendations based on available evidence are also discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of dasatinib-associated pleural effusions is approximately 20%. A twice-daily dosing regimen was found to significantly correlate with development of effusions, and therefore once-daily dosing is now approved for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Dasatinib-associated pleural effusions are generally lymphocyte-predominant exudates. The mechanism of occurrence is unknown but may involve an immune-mediated pathway or off-target inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptor, beta polypeptide. Management typically involves dose interruption or reduction, diuretics and short-term corticosteroid therapy. SUMMARY: Dasatinib is a promising agent for the treatment of refractory chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Its use can be complicated by development of exudative pleural effusions of unclear etiology. Incidence is decreasing with once-daily dosing, but when effusions do occur, most can be managed with specific measures without necessitating discontinuation of therapy.","['Brixey, Anupama G', 'Light, Richard W']","['Brixey AG', 'Light RW']","['Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Tennessee 37232, USA. anupama.brixey@vanderbilt.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Pulm Med,Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,9503765,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dasatinib', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Pleural Effusion/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/*adverse effects']",27,2010/04/09 06:00,2010/09/30 06:00,['2010/04/09 06:00'],"['2010/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MCP.0b013e328338c486 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Pulm Med. 2010 Jul;16(4):351-6. doi: 10.1097/MCP.0b013e328338c486.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Hairy cells are highly activated clonal B cells related to memory cells, normally resident in the marginal zone of the spleen. Their activation results from multiple stimuli arising from the microenvironment, autocrine cytokines and the still unknown transforming oncogenic event(s) responsible for the disease. Protein kinase Cepsilon is a central player in the activation process. SUMMARY: The activation of hairy cells makes them unusually sensitive to interferon and nucleosides. Future important research topics include characterization of the oncogenic events responsible for the disease and for its associated differentiation block.","['Cawley, John C', 'Hawkins, Stephen F']","['Cawley JC', 'Hawkins SF']","['Division of Haematology, School of Cancer Studies, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK. haem@liv.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/metabolism/*pathology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism']",45,2010/04/09 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2010/04/09 06:00'],"['2010/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e328338c417 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2010 Jul;17(4):341-9. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e328338c417.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NR mRNA expression accurately classified melanoma, colon, and renal cancers, whereas lung, breast, prostate, central nervous system, and leukemia cell lines exhibited heterogeneous receptor expression. Importantly, receptor mRNA levels faithfully predicted the growth-inhibitory qualities of receptor ligands in nonendocrine tumors. Correlation analysis using NR expression profiles and drug response information across the cell line panel uncovered a number of new potential receptor-drug interactions, suggesting that in these cases, individual receptor levels may predict response to chemotherapeutic interventions. Similarly, by cross-comparing receptor levels within our expression dataset and relating these profiles to existing microarray gene expression data, we defined interactions among receptors and between receptors and other genes that can now be mechanistically queried. This work supports the strategy of using NR expression profiling to classify various types of cancer, define NR-drug interactions and receptor-gene networks, predict cancer-drug sensitivity, and identify druggable targets that may be pharmacologically manipulated for potential therapeutic intervention.","['Holbeck, Susan', 'Chang, Jianjun', 'Best, Anne M', 'Bookout, Angie L', 'Mangelsdorf, David J', 'Martinez, Elisabeth D']","['Holbeck S', 'Chang J', 'Best AM', 'Bookout AL', 'Mangelsdorf DJ', 'Martinez ED']","['National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland 20852, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (COUP Transcription Factor II)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'COUP Transcription Factor II/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*genetics/*metabolism']",,2010/04/09 06:00,2010/09/03 06:00,['2010/04/09 06:00'],"['2010/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['me.2010-0040 [pii]', '10.1210/me.2010-0040 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2010 Jun;24(6):1287-96. doi: 10.1210/me.2010-0040.

In this study, we have developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for rapid detection of ALV-J from culture isolates and clinical samples. The ALV-J-specific LAMP assay efficiently amplified the target gene within 45 min at 63 degrees C using only a simple laboratory water bath. To determine the specificity of the LAMP assay, various subgroup ALVs and other related viruses were detected. A ladder pattern on gel electrophoresis was observed for ALV-J isolates but not for other viruses. To evaluate the sensitivities of the LAMP assay and conventional PCR, the NX0101 isolate plasmid DNA was amplified by them. The detection limit of the LAMP assay was 5 target gene copies/reaction, which was up to 20 times higher than that of conventional PCR. To evaluate the application of the LAMP assay for detection of ALV-J in clinical samples, 49 samples suspected of ALV infection from breeder flocks were tested by the LAMP assay and PCR. Moreover, virus isolation from these samples was also performed using cell culture. The positive-sample ratios were 21/49 (43%) by conventional PCR, 26/49 (53%) by the LAMP assay, and 19/46 (41%) by virus isolation. Additionally, a positive LAMP reaction can be visually ascertained by the observation of turbidity or a color change after addition of SYBR green I dye. Consequently, the LAMP assay is a simple, rapid, and sensitive diagnostic method and can potentially be developed for rapid detection of ALV-J infection in the field.","['Zhang, Xiaotao', 'Liao, Ming', 'Jiao, Peirong', 'Luo, Kaijian', 'Zhang, Henan', 'Ren, Tao', 'Zhang, Guihong', 'Xu, Chenggang', 'Xin, Chaoan', 'Cao, Weisheng']","['Zhang X', 'Liao M', 'Jiao P', 'Luo K', 'Zhang H', 'Ren T', 'Zhang G', 'Xu C', 'Xin C', 'Cao W']","[""Key Laboratory of Animal Disease Control and Prevention of the Ministry of Agriculture, College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, 483 Wushan Road, Tianhe District, Guangzhou 510642, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*diagnosis/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Chickens', 'China', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques/*methods', 'Poultry Diseases/*diagnosis/virology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Virology/*methods']",,2010/04/09 06:00,2010/09/15 06:00,['2010/04/09 06:00'],"['2010/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['JCM.02530-09 [pii]', '10.1128/JCM.02530-09 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 2010 Jun;48(6):2116-21. doi: 10.1128/JCM.02530-09.

However, the mechanisms by which the polymorphisms at the APOBEC3 locus affect the production of neutralizing antibodies remain unclear. Here we show that the APOBEC3 genotypes do not directly affect the B-cell repertoire, and mice lacking B6-derived APOBEC3 still produce FV-neutralizing antibodies in the presence of primed T helper cells. Instead, higher viral loads at a very early stage of FV infection caused by either a lack of the B6-derived APOBEC3 or a lack of the wild-type BAFF-R resulted in slower production of neutralizing antibodies. Indeed, B cells were hyperactivated soon after infection in the APOBEC3- or BAFF-R-deficient mice. In contrast to mice deficient in the B6-derived APOBEC3, which cleared viremia by 4 weeks after FV infection, mice lacking the functional BAFF-R allele exhibited sustained viremia, indicating that the polymorphisms at the BAFF-R locus may better explain the Rfv3-defining phenotype of persistent viremia.","['Tsuji-Kawahara, Sachiyo', 'Chikaishi, Tomomi', 'Takeda, Eri', 'Kato, Maiko', 'Kinoshita, Saori', 'Kajiwara, Eiji', 'Takamura, Shiki', 'Miyazawa, Masaaki']","['Tsuji-Kawahara S', 'Chikaishi T', 'Takeda E', 'Kato M', 'Kinoshita S', 'Kajiwara E', 'Takamura S', 'Miyazawa M']","['Department of Immunology, Kinki University School of Medicine, 377-2 Ohno-Higashi, Osaka-Sayama, Osaka 589-8511, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor)', '0 (Tnfrsf13c protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Apobec3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/blood/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood/immunology', 'B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor/genetics/immunology', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*genetics/immunology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/immunology/*veterinary/virology', 'Rodent Diseases/*genetics/*immunology/virology', 'Viremia/*genetics/immunology/virology']",,2010/04/09 06:00,2010/06/16 06:00,['2010/04/09 06:00'],"['2010/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02516-09 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02516-09 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Jun;84(12):6082-95. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02516-09.

The experimental evidence gathered from studies using cell culture and animal models strongly supports a critical and, in some circumstances, their oncogenic function. We summarize results that the SRCs may contribute to tumorigenesis and disease progression through transcription factors such as E2F, PEA3, and AP-1 and through an intimate control of signaling pathways of growth factors-Akt and the receptor tyrosine kinases. The finding that a recently identified nuclear receptor coregulator ANCCA, like the SRCs, is frequently overexpressed in many types of cancers again underscores their broader roles in cancer.","['Hsia, Elaine Y C', 'Zou, June X', 'Chen, Hong-Wu']","['Hsia EY', 'Zou JX', 'Chen HW']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, University of California at Davis, Sacramento, California 95817, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Prog Mol Biol Transl Sci,Progress in molecular biology and translational science,101498165,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Nuclear Receptor Coactivators/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",,2009/01/01 00:00,2011/07/28 06:00,['2010/04/09 06:00'],"['2010/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S1877-1173(09)87008-7 [pii]', '10.1016/S1877-1173(09)87008-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Prog Mol Biol Transl Sci. 2009;87:261-98. doi: 10.1016/S1877-1173(09)87008-7.

Here, we report a case-control study of 127 Chinese patients with adult precursor B lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) to examine correlation between the MTHFR polymorphisms and B-ALL susceptibility in adults. Our data show that although the prevalence of genotype 1298CC was significantly higher in the female patients than in the controls (P = 0.04), the differences in distributions of combined genotypes of 1298CC with either 677CC or 677CT between the cases and the controls were statistically insignificant.

This study shows that honokiol can induce a cell death distinct from apoptosis at lower concentrations. The death was characterized by cytoplasmic vacuolization with the endoplasmic reticulum swelling and accompanied by apoptosis at higher concentrations in NB4 and K562 cells. The two death processes may be in sequence at lower concentrations and in parallel with the increase of honokiol concentration. Membrane-associated cytotoxicity was involved in honokiol-induced paraptosis and apoptosis. Furthermore, honokiol inhibited concentration-dependent cell adhesion to extracellular matrix for NB4 cells. In addition, the cytotoxicity of honokiol combined treatment with imatinib was schedule- and concentration-dependent and the sequential administration of honokiol before imatinib appeared to be more beneficial in K562 cells. Taken together, the data suggest that honokiol induced a novel cell death pathway and there was cross-talk between apoptotic and non-apoptotic programmed cell death caused by honokiol in leukemia cells. Moreover, honikiol exhibited schedule-dependent synergy in combination with imatinib and sequential administration of imatinib followed by honokiol could be the optimal sequence to combine these two drugs in K562 cells.","['Wang, Yao', 'Yang, Zehong', 'Zhao, Xiaojun']","['Wang Y', 'Yang Z', 'Zhao X']","['Institute for Nanobiomedical Technology and Membrane Biology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Toxicol Mech Methods,Toxicology mechanisms and methods,101134521,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Lignans)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '11513CCO0N (honokiol)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Biphenyl Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lignans/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Vacuoles/drug effects']",,2010/04/09 06:00,2010/06/18 06:00,['2010/04/09 06:00'],"['2010/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/15376511003758831 [doi]'],ppublish,Toxicol Mech Methods. 2010 Jun;20(5):234-41. doi: 10.3109/15376511003758831.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Atiprimod inhibited more efficaciously the proliferation of FDCP-EpoR JAK2 (V617F) (IC(50) 0.42 muM) and SET-2 cells (IC(50) 0.53 muM) than that of CMK (IC(50) 0.79 muM) or FDCP-EpoR JAK2 (WT) cells (IC(50) 0.69 muM). This activity was accompanied by inhibition of the phosphorylation of JAK2 and downstream signaling proteins STAT3, STAT5, and AKT in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Atiprimod-induced cell growth inhibition of JAK2 (V617F)-positive cells was coupled with induction of apoptosis, as evidenced by heightened mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase-3 activity, as well as PARP cleavage, increased turnover of the anti-apoptotic X-linked mammalian inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) protein, and inhibition of the pro-apoptotic protein BCL-2 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, atiprimod was more effective at inhibiting the proliferation of peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitors obtained from patients with JAK2 (V617F)-positive polycythemia vera than at inhibiting hematopoietic progenitors from normal individuals (p = 0.001). The effect on primary expanded erythroid progenitors was paralleled by a decrease in JAK2(V617F) mutant allele burden in single microaspirated BFU-E and CFU-GM colonies. Taken together, our data supports the clinical testing of atiprimod in patients with hematologic malignancies driven by constitutive activation of JAK2 or JAK3 kinases.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Manshouri, Taghi', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Harris, David', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Gaikwad, Amos', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Manshouri T', 'Estrov Z', 'Harris D', 'Zhang Y', 'Gaikwad A', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Verstovsek S']","['Department of Leukemia, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Unit 428, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '123018-47-3 (azaspirane)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Spiro Compounds/*pharmacology', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism']",,2010/04/08 06:00,2012/01/25 06:00,['2010/04/08 06:00'],"['2010/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-010-9429-z [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2011 Oct;29(5):818-26. doi: 10.1007/s10637-010-9429-z.

Is it necessary?,1894-8,10.1007/s00586-010-1388-8 [doi],"Vertebral augmentation procedures are currently widely performed to treat vertebral compression fractures. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of underlying previously unrecognized etiology in a consecutive series of patients undergoing kyphoplasty to treat vertebral compression fractures. A prospective histological evaluation of vertebral body biopsy specimens from presumed osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were performed in order to identify aforementioned causes. Over a 2-year period, vertebral body biopsies from 154 vertebral levels were performed in 75 patients undergoing kyphoplasty for vertebral compression fractures. All patients received a preoperative workup that included plain radiographs, MRI, whole body bone scan, and laboratory examinations. Bone specimens were obtained from affected vertebral bodies and submitted for histologic evaluation to identify the prevalence of an underlying cause. All specimens demonstrated fragmented bone with variable amounts of unmineralised bone, signs of bone-remodeling and/or fracture-healing. In 11 patients underlying pathology other than osteoporosis was identified (prostate cancer, 1; pancreatic cancer, 1; colon cancer, 1; breast cancer, 2; multiple myeloma, 3; leukemia, 1; and lung cancer, 2). In all but one patient the results of the biopsy confirmed the diagnosis suspected from the preoperative workup. For the last patient, namely the one with pancreatic cancer, the workup did not identify the origin of the primary tumor, although the patient was considered to have a compression fracture secondary to metastatic disease of unknown origin, the vertebral biopsy suggested the presence of adenocarcinoma which eventually was proven to be pancreatic cancer. In augmentation procedures for vertebral compression fractures, bone biopsy should be reserved for the patients where the preoperative evaluation raises the suspicion of a non-osteoporotic etiology.","['Pneumaticos, Spiros G', 'Chatziioannou, Sofia N', 'Savvidou, Christiana', 'Pilichou, Anastasia', 'Rontogianni, Dimitra', 'Korres, Dimitrios S']","['Pneumaticos SG', 'Chatziioannou SN', 'Savvidou C', 'Pilichou A', 'Rontogianni D', 'Korres DS']","['3rd Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece. irosp@bcm.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Eur Spine J,"European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society",9301980,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Neoplasms/complications/diagnosis/secondary', 'Colonic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Female', 'Fractures, Compression/etiology/pathology/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Kyphoplasty/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteoporosis/complications', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Spinal Injuries/pathology/*surgery', 'Spine/*pathology/surgery']",,2010/04/08 06:00,2011/03/18 06:00,['2010/04/08 06:00'],"['2008/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/01/12 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00586-010-1388-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Spine J. 2010 Nov;19(11):1894-8. doi: 10.1007/s00586-010-1388-8.

Previous studies have shown that Notch-1 is overexpressed in many glioma cell lines and primary human gliomas. Blocking of Notch signaling pathway can induces glioma cell apoptosis and growth suppression. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not clear. We report that activation of the Notch pathway by intracellular domain of human Notch-1 (NIC-1) strongly activates Akt and promotes U251 glioma cell proliferation. Knockdown of Notch-1 by RNA interference suppresses Akt activation, reduces glioma cell growth rate and induce cell apoptosis. Following Notch-1 suppression, phosphorylated Akt and its downstream effector mTOR were reduced. Knockdown of Notch-1 also involves down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1, in parallel with activation of apoptotic associate proteins PARP, caspase-9 and caspase-3. Our data demonstrate that Notch-1 can positively regulate Akt-mTOR pathways, which is associated with glioma cell proliferation and apoptosis. This also suggests a molecular mechanism for the inhibitory effect of Notch-1 RNA interference on glioma cell proliferation through Akt-mTOR signaling pathway.","['Zhao, Nengjiang', 'Guo, Ya', 'Zhang, Mingfang', 'Lin, Ling', 'Zheng, Zhihong']","['Zhao N', 'Guo Y', 'Zhang M', 'Lin L', 'Zheng Z']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Research Center of Molecular Medicine, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou 350004, P.R.

Here, we identified IL28RA genes from the genome of human, chimpanzee, macaque, orangutan, mouse, horse, rat, dog, chicken, and found that only one IL28RA existed in each genome. All the identified IL28RAs are single-pass type I membrane proteins except chicken IL28RA. They belong to the type II cytokine receptor family and contain one fibronectin type-III domain. We found human IL28RA was expressed in lymphs, testes, lymphoma, teratocarcinoma, pediatric pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, germinal center B cells, embryonic stem cells, fetal lung, and also expressed in bladder, blood and breast cancers, glioma, head and neck cancer and lung cancer tissues. Three tumor-related transcriptional factor binding sites (AP-2, c-Jun and P53) were identified within the 1.0-kb regions upstream of the transcriptional start site of human IL28RA. Meta-analysis of the prognostic value of IL28RA genes in various cancers found that the expression of IL28RA was indeed related to the cancer prognosis in certain cancers. The STAT1 binding sites in the promoter region of IL28RA implied a specific mechanism for the amplifying effects of IFN-lambdas.

Aberrant expression or activation of Lck kinase has been reported in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid malignancies. We showed previously that the signal transduction pathway involving Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) is constitutively activated and contributes to Lck-mediated oncogenesis. Under normal physiological conditions, active STAT proteins induce the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family proteins to inhibit further JAK/STAT signaling. It is not fully understood whether and how SOCS-mediated negative feedback control is dysregulated in Lck-transformed cells. Here we report that two SOCS family members, SOCS1 and SOCS3, are not expressed in Lck-transformed LSTRA leukemia. While SOCS1 gene is silenced by DNA hypermethylation, loss of SOCS3 expression is through a mechanism independent of epigenetic silencing by DNA methylation. Furthermore, ectopic expression of SOCS1 or SOCS3 leads to reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in Lck-transformed cells. This is consistent with the attenuation of Lck kinase activity by exogenous SOCS1 or SOCS3 expression. Downstream STAT5 activity is also inhibited as shown by reduced STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and in vitro DNA binding. All together, our data highlight the importance of silencing multiple SOCS genes in tumorigenesis and support the roles of SOCS1 and SOCS3 as tumor suppressors toward oncogenic Lck kinase.","['Cooper, John C', 'Shi, Mingjian', 'Chueh, Fu-Yu', 'Venkitachalam, Srividya', 'Yu, Chao-Lan']","['Cooper JC', 'Shi M', 'Chueh FY', 'Venkitachalam S', 'Yu CL']","['Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37221, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (Socs1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*biosynthesis']",,2010/04/08 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/04/08 06:00'],"['2010/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo_00000603 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2010 May;36(5):1201-8. doi: 10.3892/ijo_00000603.,,,"['CA107210/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107210-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107210-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107210-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107210/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107210-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107210-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107210-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC3031791,['NIHMS264949'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified a heat shock protein MRJ (DNAJB6) as a novel uPAR-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed the interaction and co-localization by GST-pull down assays, and co-immunoprecipitation in cells transfected with MRJ. Endogenous interaction between uPAR and MRJ was also detected in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Deletion mapping demonstrated that the C-terminal region of MRJ is required to mediate its interaction with uPAR. To understand the biological function of the uPAR-MRJ complex, we determined whether MRJ regulated uPAR mediated adhesion to vitronectin in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably transfected with uPAR. After transfection with full length MRJ, there was a 50% increase in cell adhesion compared to the mock transfected control (p<0.01). This increase in adhesion is dependent on the uPAR/full length MRJ interaction as cells transfected with the mutant construct containing only N-terminal region or C-terminal region of MRJ had no increase in cell adhesion. The observed increase in adhesion to vitronectin by MRJ was also blocked by an anti-uPAR domain I antibody suggesting that the induced adhesion is at least in part contributed by uPAR on the cell surface. These data provide a novel mechanism by which uPAR plays a role in cell adhesion to vitronectin.","['De Bock, Charles Edo', 'Lin, Zhen', 'Mekkawy, Ahmed H', 'Byrne, Jennifer A', 'Wang, Yao']","['De Bock CE', 'Lin Z', 'Mekkawy AH', 'Byrne JA', 'Wang Y']","['Leukaemia Foundation Research Laboratory, Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Herston, QLD, Australia. charlesB@qimr.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (DNAJB6 protein, human)', '0 (HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '0 (Vitronectin)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Chaperones/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Vitronectin/metabolism']",,2010/04/08 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/04/08 06:00'],"['2010/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo_00000598 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2010 May;36(5):1155-63. doi: 10.3892/ijo_00000598.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined four envelope proteins for their ability to mediate lentiviral transduction of mobilized human CD34(+) peripheral blood cells. Lentiviral particles encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) were pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus envelope glycoprotein (VSV-G), the amphotropic (AMPHO) murine leukemia virus envelope protein, the endogenous feline leukemia viral envelope protein or the feline leukemia virus type C envelope protein. Because the relative amount of genome RNA per ml was similar for each pseudotype, we transduced CD34(+) cells with a fixed volume of each vector preparation. Following an overnight transduction, CD34(+) cells were transplanted into immunodeficient mice which were sacrificed 12 weeks later. The average percentages of engrafted human CD45(+) cells in total bone marrow were comparable to that of the control, mock-transduced group (37-45%). Lenti-particles pseudotyped with the VSV-G envelope protein transduced engrafting cells two- to tenfold better than particles pseudotyped with any of the gamma-retroviral envelope proteins. There was no correlation between receptor mRNA levels for the gamma-retroviral vectors and transduction efficiency of primitive hematopoietic cells.

Thus, Cdk4/6 is an attractive target for cancer therapy. Here we report the biological characterization of a 2-aminothiazole-derived Cdk4/6 selective inhibitor, named Compound A in vitro and in vivo. Compound A potently inhibits Cdk4 and Cdk6 with high selectivity (more than 57-fold) against other Cdks and 45 serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases. Compound A inhibits Rb protein (pRb) phosphorylation at Ser780, inhibits E2F-dependent transcription, and induces cell-cycle arrest at G1 in the T98G human glioma cell line. Among 82 human cells derived from various tissues, cell lines derived from hematological cancers (leukemia/lymphoma) tended to be more sensitive to Compound A in cell proliferation assay. Rb-negative cells tended to be insensitive to Compound A, as we had expected. In a nude rat xenograft model, Compound A inhibited pRb phosphorylation and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in Eol-1 xenograft tumor at plasma concentration of 510 nM. Interestingly Compound A only moderately inhibited those pharmacodynamic and cell cycle parameters of normal crypt cells in small intestine even at 5 times higher plasma concentration. In F344 rats, Compound A did not cause immunosuppression even at 17 times higher plasma conc. These results suggest that Cdk4/6 selective inhibitors only moderately affects on the cell cycle of normal proliferating tissues and has a safer profile than pan-Cdk inhibitor in vivo.","['Hirai, Hiroshi', 'Shimomura, Toshiyasu', 'Kobayashi, Makiko', 'Eguchi, Tomohiro', 'Taniguchi, Eri', 'Fukasawa, Kazuhiro', 'Machida, Takumitsu', 'Oki, Hiroko', 'Arai, Tsuyoshi', 'Ichikawa, Koji', 'Hasako, Shinichi', 'Haze, Kyosuke', 'Kodera, Tsutomu', 'Kawanishi, Nobuhiko', 'Takahashi-Suziki, Ikuko', 'Nakatsuru, Yoko', 'Kotani, Hidehito', 'Iwasawa, Yoshikazu']","['Hirai H', 'Shimomura T', 'Kobayashi M', 'Eguchi T', 'Taniguchi E', 'Fukasawa K', 'Machida T', 'Oki H', 'Arai T', 'Ichikawa K', 'Hasako S', 'Haze K', 'Kodera T', 'Kawanishi N', 'Takahashi-Suziki I', 'Nakatsuru Y', 'Kotani H', 'Iwasawa Y']","['Department of Oncology, Merck Research Laboratories, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. yrdyc661@yahoo.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '5K8WKN668K (2-aminothiazole)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'E2F Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Nude', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,2010/04/08 06:00,2011/09/10 06:00,['2010/04/08 06:00'],"['2010/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['11306 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.9.8.11306 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2010 Apr 15;9(8):1590-600. doi: 10.4161/cc.9.8.11306.

In this study, we investigated the suppression mechanism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on the growth of an MDA-LDL-induced human acute monocyte leukemia suspension cell line (THP-1 cells). We found that PAHs suppressed MDA-LDL-induced THP-1 cell growth. Cotreatment with benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) or 3-methylchoranthrene (3-MC) decreased MDA-LDL-induced THP-1 cell growth, whereas treatment with benzo[e]pyrene (BeP) or pyrene, which is not a ligand for the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR), did not decrease THP-1 cell growth. Our findings clearly demonstrated that THP-1 cell growth, which was suppressed by PAHs, was restored by the addition of alpha-naphtoflavone, which is a partial antagonist to AhR. Moreover, it was shown that cotreatment with MDA-LDL and BaP markedly induced the expression of human cytochrome P4501A1 (hCYP1A1) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and significantly induced the expressions of p53 and p21 mRNAs. In support of these findings, AhR small interfering RNA suppressed the induced level of p21 mRNA and by BaP and the overexpression of hCYP1A1 significantly induced levels of p21 mRNA. On the other hand, the uptake rate of [(14)C]BaP into cells was increased more significantly by cotreatment with MDA-LDL than by treatment with [(14)C]BaP alone. These results strongly suggest that the suppression of MDA-LDL-induced THP-1 cell growth is caused by the increased uptake of PAHs, which strongly activate the AhR signal pathway accompanying DNA damage.","['Suzuki, Hiroyuki', 'Sasaki, Takamitsu', 'Kumagai, Takeshi', 'Sakaguchi, Shuhei', 'Nagata, Kiyoshi']","['Suzuki H', 'Sasaki T', 'Kumagai T', 'Sakaguchi S', 'Nagata K']","['Tohoku Pharmaceutical University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan. aube@msd.biglobe.ne.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Toxicol Sci,The Journal of toxicological sciences,7805798,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)', '0 (malondialdehyde-low density lipoprotein, mouse)', '3417WMA06D (Benzo(a)pyrene)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)']",IM,"['Benzo(a)pyrene/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/genetics', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*pharmacology', 'Malondialdehyde/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/physiology']",,2010/04/08 06:00,2010/07/07 06:00,['2010/04/08 06:00'],"['2010/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jts/35.137 [pii]', '10.2131/jts.35.137 [doi]']",ppublish,J Toxicol Sci. 2010 Apr;35(2):137-47. doi: 10.2131/jts.35.137.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of compound KIR-HLA genotype on susceptibility to acute leukemia. METHODS: Cohorts of Iranian patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n=40) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL; n=38) were genotyped for seventeen KIR genes and their three major HLA class I ligand groups (C1, C2, Bw4) by a combined polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) assay. The results were compared with those of 200 healthy control individuals. RESULTS: We found a significantly decreased frequency of KIR2DS3 in AML patients compared to control group (12.5% vs. 38%, odds ratio=0.23, p=0.0018). Also, the KIR3DS1 was less common in AML group than controls (27.5% vs. 44.5%, p=0.0465, not significant after correction). Other analyses including KIR genotypes, distribution and balance of inhibitory and activating KIR+HLA combinations, and co-inheritance of activating KIR genes with inhibitory KIR+HLA pairs were not significantly different between leukemia patients and the control group. However, in AML patients a trend toward less activating and more inhibitory KIR-HLA state was observed. Interestingly, this situation was not found in ALL patients and inhibition enhancement through increase of HLA ligands and inhibitory combinations was the main feature in this group. CONCLUSION: Our findings may suggest a mechanism for escape of leukemic cells from NK cell immunity.","['Shahsavar, Farhad', 'Tajik, Nader', 'Entezami, Kobra-Zinat', 'Fallah Radjabzadeh, Masoomeh', 'Asadifar, Behnam', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Ostadali Dahaghi, Mohammadreza', 'Jalali, Arash', 'Ghashghaie, Andisheh', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir']","['Shahsavar F', 'Tajik N', 'Entezami KZ', 'Fallah Radjabzadeh M', 'Asadifar B', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Ostadali Dahaghi M', 'Jalali A', 'Ghashghaie A', 'Ghavamzadeh A']","['Division of Transplant Immunology and Immunogenetics, Department of Immunology, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Iran J Immunol,Iranian journal of immunology : IJI,101282932,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (KIR2DS3 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*immunology', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, KIR/*genetics/*immunology', 'Tumor Escape/genetics/immunology']",,2010/04/08 06:00,2010/07/31 06:00,['2010/04/08 06:00'],"['2010/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['02 [pii]', 'IJIv7i1A2 [doi]']",ppublish,Iran J Immunol. 2010 Mar;7(1):8-17. doi: IJIv7i1A2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE SUMMARY: Continuous infusion ceftazidime or aztreonam was administered to achieve target drug concentrations at or above the minimum inhibitory concentration, when possible, in 3 patients with P. aeruginosa infections. The maximal calculated target drug concentration was 100 mg/L. In the first patient, with primary immunodeficiency, neutropenia, and aggressive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/leukemia, continuous infusion ceftazidime (6.5-9.6 g/day) was used to successfully treat multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa bacteremia. In the second patient, with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1, continuous infusion aztreonam (8.4 g/day) was used to successfully treat multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa wound infections. In the third patient, with severe aplastic anemia, continuous infusion ceftazidime (7-16.8 g/day) was used to treat P. aeruginosa pneumonia and bacteremia. In each patient, bacteremia cleared, infected wounds healed, and pneumonia improved in response to continuous infusion ceftazidime or aztreonam. DISCUSSION: Treatment strategies for multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa infections are limited. A novel treatment strategy, when no other options are available, is the continuous infusion of existing beta-lactam antibiotics to maximize their pharmacodynamic activity. High-dose continuous infusion ceftazidime or aztreonam was used for the successful treatment of resistant systemic P. aeruginosa infections in 3 chronically immunocompromised patients. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous infusion beta-lactam antibiotics are a potentially useful treatment strategy for resistant P. aeruginosa infections in immunocompromised patients.","['Moriyama, Brad', 'Henning, Stacey A', 'Childs, Richard', 'Holland, Steven M', 'Anderson, Victoria L', 'Morris, John C', 'Wilson, Wyndham H', 'Drusano, George L', 'Walsh, Thomas J']","['Moriyama B', 'Henning SA', 'Childs R', 'Holland SM', 'Anderson VL', 'Morris JC', 'Wilson WH', 'Drusano GL', 'Walsh TJ']","['National Institutes of Health Clinical Center Pharmacy Department, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. bmoriyama@cc.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (beta-Lactams)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Pseudomonas Infections/*drug therapy/immunology/microbiology', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/*drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'beta-Lactams/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",,2010/04/08 06:00,2010/07/17 06:00,['2010/04/08 06:00'],"['2010/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['aph.1M717 [pii]', '10.1345/aph.1M717 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2010 May;44(5):929-35. doi: 10.1345/aph.1M717.

However, whether these genes genetically interact remains largely unknown. Here, we show that PTEN-mammalian target of rapamycin signaling acts upstream to dictate the ratio of wild-type p42 C/EBPalpha to its dominant-negative p30 isoform, which critically determines whether p30 C/EBPalpha (lower p42/p30 ratio) or p42 C/EBPalpha (higher p42/p30 ratio) binds to the proximal promoter of the retained CTNNA1 allele. Binding of p30 C/EBPalpha recruits the polycomb repressive complex 2 to suppress CTNNA1 transcription through repressive H3K27me3 modification, whereas binding of p42 C/EBPalpha relieves this repression and promotes CTNNA1 expression through activating H3K4me3 modification. Loss of Pten function in mice and zebrafish induces myelodysplasia with abnormal invasiveness of myeloid progenitors accompanied by significant reductions in both wild-type C/EBPalpha and alpha-catenin protein. Importantly, frame-shift mutations in either PTEN or CEBPA were detected exclusively in the primary LICs with low CTNNA1 expression.

Inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase by PD98059 dramatically accelerates vinblastine-mediated apoptosis in ML-1 leukemia with cells dying in 4 hours from all phases of the cell cycle. Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide also markedly accelerated vinblastine-induced apoptosis, showing that the proteins required for this acute apoptosis are constitutively expressed. Vinblastine induced the rapid induction of Mcl-1 that was inhibited by PD98059 and cycloheximide. No change in Bcl-2 or Bcl-X was observed. We hypothesize that ML-1 cells use Mcl-1 for protection from the rapid vinblastine-induced apoptosis. This was confirmed by targeting Mcl-1 with short hairpin RNA. We also investigated the response of 13 other leukemia and lymphoma cell lines and cells from seven chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. Four cell lines and all chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells were killed in 6 hours by vinblastine alone. Two additional cell lines were sensitized to vinblastine by PD98059, which suppressed Mcl-1. This acute apoptosis either alone or in combination with PD98059 required vinblastine-mediated activation of c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase. PD98059 did not suppress Mcl-1 in other cell lines whereas sorafenib did, but this did not sensitize the cells to vinblastine, suggesting that the acute apoptosis varies depending on which Bcl-2 protein mediates protection. Most of the cell lines were sensitized to vinblastine by cycloheximide, suggesting that inhibition of a short-lived protein in addition to Mcl-1 can acutely sensitize cells.

Here, we report that sorafenib (< or =10 micromol/L) inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in two established cell lines (U87 and U251) and two primary cultures (PBT015 and PBT022) from human glioblastomas. The effects of sorafenib on these tumor cells were associated with inhibiting phosphorylated signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3; Tyr705). Expression of a constitutively activated STAT3 mutant partially blocked the effects of sorafenib, consistent with a role for STAT3 inhibition in the response to sorafenib. Phosphorylated Janus-activated kinase (JAK)1 was inhibited in U87 and U251 cells, whereas phosphorylated JAK2 was inhibited in primary cultures. Sodium vanadate, a general inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases, blocked the inhibition of phosphorylation of STAT3 (Tyr705) induced by sorafenib. These data indicate that the inhibition of STAT3 activity by sorafenib involves both the inhibition of upstream kinases (JAK1 and JAK2) of STAT3 and increased phosphatase activity. Phosphorylation of AKT was also reduced by sorafenib. In contrast, mitogen-activated protein kinases were not consistently inhibited by sorafenib in these cells. Two key cyclins (D and E) and the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 were downregulated by sorafenib in both cell lines and primary cultures. Our data suggest that inhibition of STAT3 signaling by sorafenib contributes to growth arrest and induction of apoptosis in glioblastoma cells. These findings provide a rationale for potential treatment of malignant gliomas with sorafenib. Mol Cancer Ther; 9(4); 953-62.

Emergence of GC-resistant lymphoma cells is a major obstacle in GC therapy, emphasizing the need for novel strategies that maintain the sensitivity of lymphoma cells to the proapoptotic effects of GC. We have undertaken a kinome study to elucidate the signal transduction pathways involved in mediating GC-induced apoptosis. Our study shows that glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3) plays a central role in promoting GC-induced apoptosis. In the absence of a ligand, GSK3alpha, but not GSK3beta, is sequestered to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Exposure to GCs leads to dissociation of GSK3alpha from GR and subsequent interaction of GSK3alpha and GSK3beta with the proapoptotic Bim protein, an essential mediator of GC-induced apoptosis. Chemical inhibition of GSK3 by SB216763, BIO-Acetoxime, or LiCl and GSK3 inhibition using a dominant-negative mutant of GSK3 impede this cell death process, indicating that GSK3 is involved in transmitting the apoptotic signal. GC resistance in lymphoma cells can be relieved by inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-Akt survival pathway, which inactivates GSK3. Notch1, a transcription factor frequently activated in T acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, confers GC resistance through activation of Akt. Altogether, this study illuminates the link connecting upstream GR signals to the downstream mediators of GC-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest that targeting protein kinases involved in GSK3 inactivation should improve the outcome of GC therapy.","['Spokoini, Rachel', 'Kfir-Erenfeld, Shlomit', 'Yefenof, Eitan', 'Sionov, Ronit Vogt']","['Spokoini R', 'Kfir-Erenfeld S', 'Yefenof E', 'Sionov RV']","['The Lautenberg Center of Immunology, Institute of Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Gsk3b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/metabolism']",,2010/04/08 06:00,2010/09/03 06:00,['2010/04/08 06:00'],"['2010/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['me.2009-0466 [pii]', '10.1210/me.2009-0466 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2010 Jun;24(6):1136-50. doi: 10.1210/me.2009-0466.

Moreover, because of the limited knowledge of the mechanisms involved in malignant evolution, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge and a poor prognosis disease. We aimed to verify the biological and clinical significance of the discrimination, based on the leukocyte count, between myelodysplastic chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (MD-CMML) and myeloproliferative chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (MP-CMML). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Peripheral blood samples from 22 patients classified as MD-CMML and 18 as MP-CMML were collected at different time points during disease course, and patients' clinical characteristics were examined. RAS mutational screening was done by sequencing and, for each substitution identified, a highly selective allele-specific PCR was set up to screen all specimens. RESULTS: MP-CMML patients showed a significantly poorer survival (P = 0.003) and a higher frequency of RAS mutations (P = 0.033) by sequencing compared with MD-CMML. Overall, five MD-CMML patients progressed to myeloproliferative disease: in two, allele-specific PCR unveiled low levels of the RAS mutations predominating in the myeloproliferative phase at the time of myelodysplastic disease, documenting for the first time the expansion of a RAS mutated clone in concomitance with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia evolution. Moreover, one of the progressed patients harbored the FLT3-ITD and two MP-CMML patients presented with the JAK2 V617F substitution. All these lesions were mutually exclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly suggest RAS mutations to function as a secondary event that contributes to development of the chronic myelomonocytic leukemia variant with the poorer prognosis (MP-CMML) and therefore advise their detection to be implemented in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia diagnostics and monitoring.","['Ricci, Clara', 'Fermo, Elisa', 'Corti, Stefania', 'Molteni, Mauro', 'Faricciotti, Alessio', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino', 'Lambertenghi Deliliers, Giorgio', 'Beran, Miloslav', 'Onida, Francesco']","['Ricci C', 'Fermo E', 'Corti S', 'Molteni M', 'Faricciotti A', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Lambertenghi Deliliers G', 'Beran M', 'Onida F']","['Fondazione Matarelli, Dipartimento di Farmacologia, Chemioterapia e Tossicologia Medica e Universita di Milano, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Disease Progression', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Female', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics/pathology', 'Life Expectancy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'Survival Rate', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics', 'ras Proteins/*genetics']",,2010/04/08 06:00,2010/08/13 06:00,['2010/04/08 06:00'],"['2010/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-09-2112 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-2112 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Apr 15;16(8):2246-56. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-2112.

Herein, we describe the case of an 18-year-old man with Crohn's disease who developed HSTCL after 5 years of 6-MP treatment. He died 7 months after diagnosis from chemotherapy-refractory lymphoma. Through a literature review, we identified 28 cases of HSTCL in Crohn's patients. All patients were treated with azathioprine or 6-MP; 22 of 28 (79%) received concomitant treatment with infliximab, and 3 of these 22 patients later received treatment with adalimumab. The median age at diagnosis of HSTCL was 22 years (range, 12-40 years). The median survival for all patients was 8 months (range, 5 days-31+ months), with only 1 patient achieving remission. Additional research is needed to better understand the role of thiopurines and TNF-alpha inhibitors in promoting HSTCL and what can be done to prevent and treat this devastating malignancy in young patients with Crohn's disease.","['Ochenrider, Mark G', 'Patterson, David J', 'Aboulafia, David M']","['Ochenrider MG', 'Patterson DJ', 'Aboulafia DM']","['Division of Internal Medicine, Virginia Mason Medical Center, Seattle, WA 98101, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'B72HH48FLU (Infliximab)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'FYS6T7F842 (Adalimumab)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)']",IM,"['Adalimumab', 'Adolescent', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Azathioprine/therapeutic use', 'Crohn Disease/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Infliximab', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Liver Neoplasms/*chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/therapeutic use', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/therapeutic use']",24,2010/04/08 06:00,2010/07/14 06:00,['2010/04/08 06:00'],"['2010/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)70101-X [pii]', '10.3816/CLML.2010.n.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2010 Apr;10(2):144-8. doi: 10.3816/CLML.2010.n.021.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An MMP subgroup, the gelatinases, has been focused during last years, since over-expression of gelatinase A (MMP-2) and gelatinase B (MMP-9) has been linked with severe homeostasis disorders such as tumor growth, metastasis formation, and chronic inflammation. In this study, a phage display library-derived novel antigelatinolytic decapeptide, the CTT-peptide, was expressed as a carboxyl terminal, histidine-tagged fusion with the green fluorescent protein (CTT-GFP) in Escherichia coli. In addition, a biologically intact chimera, in which residues in the CTT-peptide critical for gelatinase binding were replaced with alanine (Ala-CTT-GFP), was constructed. The GFP-fusion proteins were purified to homogeneity with a simple one-step procedure utilizing nickel affinity chromatography. The purified chimeras were tested for their binding properties to 4beta-phorbol-12,13-butyrate (PdBu) activated, MMP-9 expressing THP-1 cells, and it was demonstrated that the CTT-GFP strongly bound to the cells, whereas Ala-CTT-GFP lacked the binding ability. Furthermore, the adherence of the CTT-GFP to MMP-9 expressing cells was demonstrated to be mediated by the CTT-moiety, since the binding could be dose-relatedly inhibited with increasing concentrations of synthetic soluble CTT-peptide. In conclusion, this novel tool, combining the gelatinase binding ability of the CTT-peptide with the fluorescing property of the GFP, should clearly improve both experimental and clinical studies of the role and function of gelatinases.","['Reunanen, Justus', 'Ranta, Tanja-Maria', 'Penate-Medina, Oula', 'Suojanen, Juho', 'Sorsa, Timo', 'Salo, Tuula', 'Koivunen, Erkki', 'Saris, Per E J']","['Reunanen J', 'Ranta TM', 'Penate-Medina O', 'Suojanen J', 'Sorsa T', 'Salo T', 'Koivunen E', 'Saris PE']","['Department of Food and Environmental Sciences, Division of Microbiology, Viikinkaari 9, P.O.

This study was performed to elucidate whether the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways are involved in NFD-induced apoptosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Immunoblot showed that NFD suppressed the phosphorylation of EGF receptor and activation of PI3K/Akt, downstream molecules of EGF receptor signaling pathway, in Ca9-22 cells. The levels of downstream targets of Akt, including phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (p-GSK-3beta), GSK-3beta, forkhead transcription factor (FKHR), and cyclin D1, were also reduced after NFD treatment. Moreover, inactivation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF kappaB), modulation of I kappa K beta and I kappaB alpha, up-regulation of Bad, and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins including phospho-Bad, Bcl-X(L), myeloid cell leukemia-1(Mcl-1), and XIAP were found in NFD-treated cells. In addition, NFD treatment disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi m), resulted in release of cytochrome c, and activation of both caspases-9 and caspase-3. Taken together, these results indicate that NFD induces apoptosis in Ca9-22 cells via inactivation of the EGF receptor-mediated survival pathway.","['Chien, Ching-Ming', 'Lin, Kuei-Li', 'Su, Jung-Chen', 'Chuang, Pei-Wen', 'Tseng, Chih-Hua', 'Chen, Yeh-Long', 'Chang, Long-Sen', 'Lin, Shinne-Ren']","['Chien CM', 'Lin KL', 'Su JC', 'Chuang PW', 'Tseng CH', 'Chen YL', 'Chang LS', 'Lin SR']","['Department of Medicinal and Applied Chemistry, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '32358-83-1 (naphtho(1,2-b)furan-4,5-dione)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'ErbB Receptors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mouth Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",,2010/04/08 06:00,2010/08/10 06:00,['2010/04/08 06:00'],"['2009/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-2999(10)00227-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.03.030 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2010 Jun 25;636(1-3):52-8. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.03.030.

METHODS: Patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy were enrolled, and biologic specimens were obtained at surgery. The patients were genotyped for the R462Q RNASEL variant using a TaqMan genotyping assay on DNA from the peripheral blood. A serum assay that detects XMRV neutralizing antibodies was developed and used to determine which patients had serologic evidence of previous infection with XMRV virus. Some of these patients were also tested for the presence of XMRV nucleotide sequences in their prostate using polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. RESULTS: At a serum dilution of 1:150, our assay detected 11 (27.5%) of 40 patients with XMRV neutralizing antibodies, including 8 (40%) of 20 with the RNASEL genotype QQ and 3 (15%) of 20 with either the RQ or RR genotype. These results were in complete concordance with 2 other assays (polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization), which were designed to detect XMRV infection. CONCLUSIONS: XMRV infects some patients with prostate cancer. Neutralizing antibodies against XMRV correlated with 2 independent methods of detecting the virus in the prostate. The antibody response suggests that with clinical serologic assay development, it might be possible to screen patients for XMRV infection. The cases presented in the present report provided biologic samples that can be used for the development of a clinically relevant assay.","['Arnold, Rebecca S', 'Makarova, Natalia V', 'Osunkoya, Adeboye O', 'Suppiah, Suganthi', 'Scott, Takara A', 'Johnson, Nicole A', 'Bhosle, Sushma M', 'Liotta, Dennis', 'Hunter, Eric', 'Marshall, Fray F', 'Ly, Hinh', 'Molinaro, Ross J', 'Blackwell, Jerry L', 'Petros, John A']","['Arnold RS', 'Makarova NV', 'Osunkoya AO', 'Suppiah S', 'Scott TA', 'Johnson NA', 'Bhosle SM', 'Liotta D', 'Hunter E', 'Marshall FF', 'Ly H', 'Molinaro RJ', 'Blackwell JL', 'Petros JA']","['Department of Urology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Urology,Urology,0366151,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/*blood', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*complications/*virology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*complications/*virology', 'Serologic Tests', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*complications/*virology']",,2010/04/08 06:00,2010/05/06 06:00,['2010/04/08 06:00'],"['2009/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/16 00:00 [revised]', '2010/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0090-4295(10)00117-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.urology.2010.01.038 [doi]']",ppublish,Urology. 2010 Apr;75(4):755-61. doi: 10.1016/j.urology.2010.01.038.,,,,,,,,,,['Published by Elsevier Inc.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CREB is a critical regulator of cell differentiation, proliferation and survival in the nervous system. Recent studies have shown that CREB is involved tumor initiation, progression and metastasis, supporting its role as a proto-oncogene. Overexpression and over-activation of CREB were observed in cancer tissues from patients with prostate cancer, breast cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer and acute leukemia while down-regulation of CREB in several distinct cancer cell lines resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis, suggesting that CREB may be a promising target for cancer therapy. Although CREB, as a transcription factor, is a challenging target for small molecules, various small molecules have been discovered to inhibit CREB phosphorylation, CREB-DNA, or CREB-CBP interaction.

Misexpression of miRNA has been linked to disruption of normal cellular functions, which results in various disorders including cancers such as leukemias. MicroRNA involvement in disease has been the subject of much attention and is increasing our current understanding of disease biology. Such linkages have been determined by high-throughput studies, which provide a framework for characterizing differential miRNA expression levels correlating to different cytogenetic abnormalities and their corresponding malignancies. In addition, functional studies of particular miRNAs have begun to define the effects of miRNA on predicted mRNA targets. It is clear that miRNAs can serve as molecular markers of leukemias and the hope is that they can also serve as new therapeutic targets. Studies are beginning to elucidate how to deliver therapeutic antagonists to attenuate overexpressed miRNAs and to replace underexpressed miRNAs. In this review, we: i) discuss the current understanding of miRNA function and expression in normal hematopoiesis, ii) provide examples of miRNAs that are misregulated in leukemias, and iii) evaluate the current status and potential future directions for the burgeoning field of antisense oligonucleotides and other therapeutic attempts to intervene in miRNA disregulation in leukemias.","['Mian, Yousaf A', 'Zeleznik-Le, Nancy J']","['Mian YA', 'Zeleznik-Le NJ']","['Molecular Biology Program, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL 60153, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)']",IM,"['Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Drug Design', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/therapeutic use']",93,2010/04/08 06:00,2010/09/02 06:00,['2010/04/08 06:00'],"['2009/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['BSP/CDT/E-Pub/00076 [pii]', '10.2174/138945010791320872 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2010 Jul;11(7):801-11. doi: 10.2174/138945010791320872.,,,"['R01 HL087188/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL087188-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL087188/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2987689,['NIHMS250811'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although treatment options exist for most of these diseases, many types remain incurable and the emergence of drug resistance is pervasive. Thus, novel treatment approaches are essential to improve outcome. Nearly half of the agents used in cancer therapy today are either natural products or derivatives of natural products. The enormous chemical diversity in nature, coupled with millennia of biological selection, has generated a vast and underexplored reservoir of unique chemical structures with biologic activity. This review will describe the investigation and application of natural products derived from higher plants in the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma and the rationale behind these efforts. In addition to the approved vinca alkaloids and the epipodophyllotoxin derivatives, a number of other plant compounds have shown promise in clinical trials and in preclinical investigations. In particular, we will focus on the discovery and biological evaluation of the plant-derived agent silvestrol, which shows potential for additional development as a new therapeutic agent for B-cell malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Lucas, David M', 'Still, Patrick C', 'Perez, Lynette Bueno', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Kinghorn, A Douglas']","['Lucas DM', 'Still PC', 'Perez LB', 'Grever MR', 'Kinghorn AD']","['Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, 410 W. 12th Avenue, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. david.lucas@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (silvestrol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Biological Products/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Structure', 'Triterpenes/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",123,2010/04/08 06:00,2010/09/02 06:00,['2010/04/08 06:00'],"['2009/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['BSP/CDT/E-Pub/00077 [pii]', '10.2174/138945010791320809 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2010 Jul;11(7):812-22. doi: 10.2174/138945010791320809.,,,"['P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA125066-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 CA052956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 CA52956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA125066/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 CA052956-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025755/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA140158-015401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2892601,['NIHMS212569'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ubiquitous exposures result from its presence in gasoline vapors, cigarette smoke, and industrial processes. Benzene increases the incidence of leukemia in humans when they are exposed to high doses for extended periods; however, leukemia risks in humans subjected to low exposures are uncertain. The exposure-dose- response relationship of benzene in humans is expected to be nonlinear because benzene undergoes a series of metabolic transformations, detoxifying and activating, resulting in various metabolites that exert toxic effects on the bone marrow. Since benzene is a known human leukemogen, the toxicity of benzene in the bone marrow is of most importance. And because blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, we investigated the effects of benzene on hematopoiesis (blood cell production and development). An age-structured model was used to examine the process of erythropoiesis, the development of red blood cells. This investigation proved the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the system of coupled partial and ordinary differential equations. In addition, we formulated an optimal control problem for the control of erythropoiesis and performed numerical simulations to compare the performance of the optimal feedback law and another feedback function based on the Hill function.","['Banks, H T', 'Cole, Cammey E', 'Schlosser, Paul M', 'Tran, Hien T']","['Banks HT', 'Cole CE', 'Schlosser PM', 'Tran HT']","['Center for Research in Scientific Computation, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695.

METHODS: The NB4 cells were treated with Tan II A, ATO, and Tan II A combined with ATO, respectively. The proliferative inhibition rates of NB4 cells induce by Tan II A, ATO and their combination were calculated on the fifth day. The morphology of cell differentiation was observed by Giemsa stain and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The cell cycle, proliferation index and apoptosis induced by these drugs were measured by flow cytometry (FCM). RESULTS: 1) Combination treatment of Tan II A with ATO had synergistic effects on the proliferative inhibition of NB4 cells. This synergistic effects showed a dose and time-dependent manner. The proliferative inhibition rates of NB4 cells were increased gradually after the treatment of 1.0 microg/mL Tan II A combination with 0.125 micromol/L, 0.25 micromol/L and 0.5 micromol/L ATO respectively, which was much higher than those treated by corresponding ATO alone (P < 0.01); 2) Combination treatment of Tan lI A with ATO had synergistic effects on the apoptosis of NB4 cells. The synergistic effects of 1.0 microg/mL Tan II A combined with 0.5 micromol/L ATO on the apoptosis of NB4 cells lasted for 3 days; 3) Combination treatment of Tan II A with ATO had synergistic inhibition effects on proliferation of NB4 cells, which decreased the number of cells in S phase and increased cells in G0/G1 phase. The proliferation indices (PI) of NB4 cells treated with the combination of Tan II A and different level of ATO were lower than those treated by corresponding ATO alone (P < 0.05). Combination treatment of Tan II A with ATO had no significant synergistic effects on the differentiation of NB4 cells. CONCLUSION: Combination treatment of Tan II A with ATO has significant synergistic effects on the apoptosis of NB4 cells. This synergistic effects is related to the dosage and treatment time. The significant synergistic effects of Tan II A and ATO on NB4 cells differentiation is not demonstrated in our experiment.","['Zhang, Ge', 'Yang, Yi-Ming', 'Meng, Wen-Tong', 'Zhou, Jie']","['Zhang G', 'Yang YM', 'Meng WT', 'Zhou J']","['Department of Hematology and Hematologic Research Laboratory, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Sichuan da xue xue bao.

These cells have effector functions as they recognize and kill transformed cells as well as microbially infected cells. In addition, alloreactive NK cells have been successfully used to treat patients with acute myeloid leukemia and other hematological malignancies. NK cells are also endowed with immunoregulatory functions since they secrete cytokines such as IFN-gamma, which favor the development of T helper 1 (Th1) cells, and chemokines such as CCL3/MIP-1alpha and CCL4/MIP-1beta, which recruit various inflammatory cells into sites of inflammation. In human blood, NK cells are divided into CD56(bright) CD16(dim) and CD56(dim) CD16(bright) subsets. These subsets have different phenotypic expression and may have different functions; the former subset is more immunoregulatory and the latter is more cytolytic. The CD56(bright)CD16(dim) NK cells home into tissues such as the peripheral lymph nodes (LNs) under physiological conditions because they express the LN homing receptor CCR7 and they respond to CCL19/MIP-3beta and CCL21/SLC chemokines. They also distribute into adenoid tissues or decidual uterus following the CXCR3/CXCL10 or CXCR4/CXCL12 axis. On the other hand, both NK cell subsets migrate into inflammatory sites, with more CD56(dim)CD16(bright) NK cells distributing into inflamed liver and lungs. CCR5/CCL5 axis plays an important role in the accumulation of NK cells in virally infected sites as well as during parasitic infections. CD56(bright)CD16(dim) cells also migrate into autoimmune sites such as inflamed synovial fluids in patients having rheumatoid arthritis facilitated by the CCR5/CCL3/CCL4/CCL5 axis, whereas they distribute into inflamed brains aided by the CX(3)CR1/CX(3)CL1 axis. On the other hand, CD56(dim)CD16(bright) NK cells accumulate in the liver of patients with primary biliary disease aided by the CXCR1/CXCL8 axis. However, the types of chemokines that contribute to their accumulation in target organs during graft vs. host (GvH) disease are not known. Further, chemokines activate NK cells to become highly cytolytic cells known as CC chemokine-activated killer (CHAK) cells that kill tumor cells. In summary, chemokines whether secreted in an autocrine or paracrine fashion regulate various biological functions of NK cells. Depending on the tissue and the chemokine secreted, NK cells may ameliorate the disease such as their roles in combating tumors or virally infected cells, and their therapeutic potentials in treating leukemias and other hematological malignancies, as well as reducing the incidence of GvH disease. In contrast, they may exacerbate the disease by damaging the affected tissues through direct cytotoxicity or by the release of multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Examples are their deleterious roles in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and primary biliary cirrhosis.","['Maghazachi, Azzam A']",['Maghazachi AA'],"['Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Blindern, 0317 Oslo, Norway. azzam.maghazachi@medisin.uio.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,0110513,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/immunology', 'Cell Movement/immunology', 'Chemokines/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/immunology', 'Receptors, Chemokine/metabolism', 'Virus Diseases/immunology']",,2010/04/07 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/04/07 06:00'],"['2010/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/82_2010_20 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 2010;341:37-58. doi: 10.1007/82_2010_20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although in vitro data show that both agents can inhibit all mutations except T315I, some discrepancies have been observed in a small subset of mutation clones. Cytogenetic clonal evolution is the important resistance mechanism of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Accordingly, we observed the clinical significance of coexisting with clonal evolution and BCR-ABL mutant in CML patients treated with second TKIs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We monitored BCR-ABL transcript kinetics, interrelationship of clones expressing non-mutated and mutant transcripts and clonal aberrations within Philadelphia (Ph) positive and negative clones, respectively, in eight patients with CML receiving dasatinib or nilotinib for 3~41 months. RESULTS: Clinical responses were correlated with in vitro sensitivity of the BCR-ABL mutants to the second TKIs in four patients. Four patients showed resistance to the second TKIs as compared to in vitro observations; three of them developed chromosomal abnormalities in the Ph chromosome positive or negative metaphases. Another patient lost the original mutation but acquired a more resistant new mutation and became resistant to the second TKI. CONCLUSION: Cytogenetic clonal evolution is an independent poor prognostic factor in CML, which could explain the onset of mechanisms for second TKIs resistance to ABL kinase domain mutations. The results indicate that an additional evaluation of chromosomal abnormalities is warranted when BCR-ABL mutants are more resistant than indicated by in vitro data.","['Ahn, Jae-Sook', 'Kim, Yeo-Kyeoung', 'Lee, Se Ryeon', 'Yu, Li', 'Yang, Deok-Hwan', 'Cho, Sang-Hee', 'Shim, Hyun Jeong', 'Bae, Woo Kyun', 'Lee, Je-Jung', 'Chung, Ik-Joo', 'Shin, Myung Gun', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon']","['Ahn JS', 'Kim YK', 'Lee SR', 'Yu L', 'Yang DH', 'Cho SH', 'Shim HJ', 'Bae WK', 'Lee JJ', 'Chung IJ', 'Shin MG', 'Kim HJ']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Cancer Res Treat,Cancer research and treatment,101155137,,,,,2010/04/07 06:00,2010/04/07 06:01,['2010/04/07 06:00'],"['2009/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4143/crt.2010.42.1.37 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Res Treat. 2010 Mar;42(1):37-41. doi: 10.4143/crt.2010.42.1.37.

In this study, the ability of As(4)O(6) to suppress cell growth and induce gene expression patterns was tested using a cDNA microarray in HPV16 immortalized cervical carcinoma cells, SiHa cells, along with As(2)O(3). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A novel arsenical compound, As(4)O(6), was designed and its ability to induce cell growth inhibition as well as gene expression profiles along with As(2)O(3) in HPV16 infected SiHa cervical cancer cells was compared. Both As(2)O(3) and As(4)O(6) induced apoptosis in SiHa cells, as determined by DNA ladder formation. To further compare the gene expression profiles between these two drugs, a 384 cDNA microarray system was employed. Also, the gene expression profiles were classified into the Gene Ontology (GO) to investigate apoptosis-related cellular processes. RESULTS: As(4)O(6) was more effective i suppressing the growth of SiHa cells in vitro compared to As(2)O(3). In the case of treatment with As(2)O(3), 41 genes were up- or down-regulated at least 2 fold compared to non-treatment. However, 65 genes were up- or down-regulated by As(4)O(6) treatment. In particular, 27 genes were commonly regulated by both arsenic compounds. Also, the GO analysis indicated that down-regulation of cell-regulatory functions, such as cell cycle, protein kinase activity and DNA repair, induced anti-tumor effect. CONCLUSION: These data support that As(4)O(6) could be more effective than As(2)O(3) in inhibiting the growth of HPV16 infected cervical cancer cells. This appears to be mediated through a unique, but overlapping regulatory mechanism(s), suggesting that the regulated genes and cellular processes could be further used as a new potential drug approach for treating cervical cancer in clinical settings.","['Kim, Yong Wook', 'Bae, Su Mi', 'Lee, Keun Ho', 'Lee, Joon Mo', 'Namkoong, Sung Eun', 'Lee, Insu P', 'Kim, Chong Kook', 'Seo, Jeong-Sun', 'Sin, Jeong-Im', 'Kim, Yong-Wan', 'Ahn, Woong Shick']","['Kim YW', 'Bae SM', 'Lee KH', 'Lee JM', 'Namkoong SE', 'Lee IP', 'Kim CK', 'Seo JS', 'Sin JI', 'Kim YW', 'Ahn WS']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Retracted Publication']",Korea (South),Cancer Res Treat,Cancer research and treatment,101155137,,,,,2004/08/01 00:00,2004/08/01 00:01,['2010/04/07 06:00'],"['2004/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2004/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2004/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.4143/crt.2004.36.4.255 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Res Treat. 2004 Aug;36(4):255-62. doi: 10.4143/crt.2004.36.4.255.

However, their survival can be regulated by signals from the environment. Flagellin, the primary component of the bacterial flagella, is known to induce neutrophil activation. In this study we examined the ability of flagellin to modulate neutrophil apoptosis. Neutrophils cultured for 12 and 24 h in the presence of flagellin from Salmonella typhimurium at concentrations found in pathological situations underwent a marked prevention of apoptosis. In contrast, Helicobacter pylori flagellin did not affect neutrophil survival, suggesting that Salmonella flagellin exerts the antiapoptotic effect by interacting with TLR5. The delaying in apoptosis mediated by Salmonella flagellin was coupled to higher expression levels of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 and lower levels of activated caspase-3. Analysis of the signaling pathways indicated that Salmonella flagellin induced the activation of the p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK pathways as well as the PI3K/Akt pathway. Furthermore, it also stimulated IkappaBalpha degradation and the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit, suggesting that Salmonella flagellin also triggers NF-kappaB activation. Moreover, the pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 pathway and NF-kappaB activation partially prevented the antiapoptotic effects exerted by flagellin. Finally, the apoptotic delaying effect exerted by flagellin was also evidenced when neutrophils were cultured with whole heat-killed S. typhimurium. Both a wild-type and an aflagellate mutant S. typhimurium strain promoted neutrophil survival; however, when cultured in low bacteria/neutrophil ratios, the flagellate bacteria showed a higher capacity to inhibit neutrophil apoptosis, although both strains showed a similar ability to induce neutrophil activation. Taken together, our results indicate that flagellin delays neutrophil apoptosis by a mechanism partially dependent on the activation of ERK1/2 MAPK and NF-kappaB. The ability of flagellin to delay neutrophil apoptosis could contribute to perpetuate the inflammation during infections with flagellated bacteria.","['Salamone, Gabriela V', 'Petracca, Yanina', 'Fuxman Bass, Juan I', 'Rumbo, Martin', 'Nahmod, Karen A', 'Gabelloni, Maria L', 'Vermeulen, Monica E', 'Matteo, Mario J', 'Geffner, Jorge R', 'Trevani, Analia S']","['Salamone GV', 'Petracca Y', 'Fuxman Bass JI', 'Rumbo M', 'Nahmod KA', 'Gabelloni ML', 'Vermeulen ME', 'Matteo MJ', 'Geffner JR', 'Trevani AS']","['Departamento de Inmunologia, Instituto de Investigaciones Hematologicas, Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina. salamone.gabriela@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '12777-81-0 (Flagellin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flagella/physiology', 'Flagellin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Salmonella Infections/immunology', 'Salmonella typhimurium/physiology']",,2010/04/07 06:00,2010/07/20 06:00,['2010/04/07 06:00'],"['2010/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['labinvest201077 [pii]', '10.1038/labinvest.2010.77 [doi]']",ppublish,Lab Invest. 2010 Jul;90(7):1049-59. doi: 10.1038/labinvest.2010.77.

However, only the combinations of all-trans retinoic acid or arsenic trioxide with chemotherapy have been successful, and only in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia (also called AML3). We show that iron homeostasis is an effective target in the treatment of AML. Iron chelating therapy induces the differentiation of leukemia blasts and normal bone marrow precursors into monocytes/macrophages in a manner involving modulation of reactive oxygen species expression and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). 30% of the genes most strongly induced by iron deprivation are also targeted by vitamin D3 (VD), a well known differentiating agent. Iron chelating agents induce expression and phosphorylation of the VD receptor (VDR), and iron deprivation and VD act synergistically. VD magnifies activation of MAPK JNK and the induction of VDR target genes. When used to treat one AML patient refractory to chemotherapy, the combination of iron-chelating agents and VD resulted in reversal of pancytopenia and in blast differentiation. We propose that iron availability modulates myeloid cell commitment and that targeting this cellular differentiation pathway together with conventional differentiating agents provides new therapeutic modalities for AML.","['Callens, Celine', 'Coulon, Severine', 'Naudin, Jerome', 'Radford-Weiss, Isabelle', 'Boissel, Nicolas', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Wang, Pamella Huey Mei', 'Agarwal, Saurabh', 'Tamouza, Houda', 'Paubelle, Etienne', 'Asnafi, Vahid', 'Ribeil, Jean-Antoine', 'Dessen, Philippe', 'Canioni, Danielle', 'Chandesris, Olivia', 'Rubio, Marie Therese', 'Beaumont, Carole', 'Benhamou, Marc', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth', 'Monteiro, Renato C', 'Moura, Ivan C', 'Hermine, Olivier']","['Callens C', 'Coulon S', 'Naudin J', 'Radford-Weiss I', 'Boissel N', 'Raffoux E', 'Wang PH', 'Agarwal S', 'Tamouza H', 'Paubelle E', 'Asnafi V', 'Ribeil JA', 'Dessen P', 'Canioni D', 'Chandesris O', 'Rubio MT', 'Beaumont C', 'Benhamou M', 'Dombret H', 'Macintyre E', 'Monteiro RC', 'Moura IC', 'Hermine O']","['Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 8147, Paris 75015, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (CD71 antigen)', '0 (Hydroxycholecalciferols)', '0 (ITGAM protein, human)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blood Cell Count', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Homeostasis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxycholecalciferols/therapeutic use', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron Chelating Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Iron Deficiencies', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2010/04/07 06:00,2010/05/07 06:00,['2010/04/07 06:00'],"['2010/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20091488 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20091488 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2010 Apr 12;207(4):731-50. doi: 10.1084/jem.20091488.

We sought to measure adherence among women randomly assigned to capecitabine in a preplanned substudy of a multicenter clinical trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer and Leukemia Group B study CALGB 49907 was a randomly assigned trial comparing standard chemotherapy versus oral chemotherapy with capecitabine in patients age 65 years or older with early-stage breast cancer. We used microelectronic monitoring system (MEMS) caps on participants' capecitabine bottles to record pill bottle openings. Capecitabine was given in two divided daily doses for 14 consecutive days of a 21-day cycle for six cycles. Adherence was calculated as the number of doses taken divided by doses expected, taking into account toxicity-related dosing changes. A participant was defined as adherent if 80% or more of expected doses were recorded by MEMS. RESULTS: Overall, 161 patients were enrolled. Median age was 71 years (range, 65 to 89 years); 124 patients (83%) persisted with capecitabine to completion of planned protocol therapy. Adherence was 78% across all cycles, and adherence did not vary by cycle (P = .32). Twenty-five percent of participants took fewer than 80% of expected doses and were nonadherent. In a logistic regression model, participants with node-negative disease (P = .01) and mastectomy (P = .01) were more likely to be nonadherent. Adherence was not related to age, tumor stage, or hormone receptor status. Adherence was not significantly associated with relapse-free survival or grade 3 or 4 toxicity.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Diagnostic bone marrow or blood samples from 358 patients were analyzed for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations by DNA polymerase chain reaction amplification/sequencing. FLT3, NPM1, CEBPA, WT1, and MLL mutational analyses and gene- and microRNA-expression profiling were performed centrally. Results IDH mutations were found in 33% of the patients. IDH1 mutations were detected in 49 patients (14%; 47 with R132). IDH2 mutations, previously unreported in AML, were detected in 69 patients (19%; 13 with R172 and 56 with R140). R172 IDH2 mutations were mutually exclusive with all other prognostic mutations analyzed. Younger age (< 60 years), molecular low-risk (NPM1-mutated/FLT3-internal tandem duplication-negative) IDH1-mutated patients had shorter disease-free survival than molecular low-risk IDH1/IDH2-wild-type (wt) patients (P = .046). R172 IDH2-mutated patients had lower complete remission rates than IDH1/IDH2wt patients (P = .007). Distinctive microarray gene- and microRNA-expression profiles accurately predicted R172 IDH2 mutations. The highest expressed gene and microRNAs in R172 IDH2-mutated patients compared with the IDH1/IDH2wt patients were APP (previously associated with complex karyotype AML) and miR-1 and miR-133 (involved in embryonal stem-cell differentiation), respectively. CONCLUSION IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are recurrent in CN-AML and have an unfavorable impact on outcome. The R172 IDH2 mutations, previously unreported in AML, characterize a novel subset of CN-AML patients lacking other prognostic mutations and associate with unique gene- and microRNA-expression profiles that may lead to the discovery of novel, therapeutically targetable leukemogenic mechanisms.","['Marcucci, Guido', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Wu, Yue-Zhong', 'Radmacher, Michael D', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Margeson, Dean', 'Holland, Kelsi B', 'Whitman, Susan P', 'Becker, Heiko', 'Schwind, Sebastian', 'Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Carter, Thomas H', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Wetzler, Meir', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Marcucci G', 'Maharry K', 'Wu YZ', 'Radmacher MD', 'Mrozek K', 'Margeson D', 'Holland KB', 'Whitman SP', 'Becker H', 'Schwind S', 'Metzeler KH', 'Powell BL', 'Carter TH', 'Kolitz JE', 'Wetzler M', 'Carroll AJ', 'Baer MR', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Larson RA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: IDH1 exon four was directly sequenced in 275 CN-AML patients from two subsequent AML multicenter treatment trials and 120 healthy volunteers. Moreover, mutations in NPM1, FLT3, CEBPA, and WT1 were analyzed, and mRNA expression of IDH1 was quantified. RESULTS: IDH1 R132 mutations were found in 10.9% of CN-AML patients. IDH1 SNP rs11554137 was found in 12% of CN-AML patients and 11.7% of healthy volunteers. IDH1 R132 mutations had no impact on prognosis. In contrast, IDH1 SNP rs11554137 was an adverse prognostic factor for overall survival in univariate and multivariate analysis. Other significant factors were age, NPM1/FLT3 mutational status, WT1 SNP rs16754, and platelet count. The impact of IDH1 SNP rs11554137 was most pronounced in the NPM1/FLT3 high-risk patients (either NPM1 wild-type or FLT3-internal tandem duplication positive). Patients with IDH1 SNP rs11554137 had a higher expression of IDH1 mRNA than patients with two wild-type alleles. CONCLUSION: IDH1 SNP rs11554137 but not IDH1 R132 mutations are associated with an inferior outcome in CN-AML.","['Wagner, Katharina', 'Damm, Frederik', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Gorlich, Kerstin', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Schafer, Irina', 'Ottmann, Oliver', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Heit, Wolfgang', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Schlimok, Gunter', 'Raghavachar, Aruna A', 'Fiedler, Walter', 'Kirchner, Hartmut H', 'Brugger, Wolfram', 'Zucknick, Manuela', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Heil, Gerhard', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Krauter, Jurgen']","['Wagner K', 'Damm F', 'Gohring G', 'Gorlich K', 'Heuser M', 'Schafer I', 'Ottmann O', 'Lubbert M', 'Heit W', 'Kanz L', 'Schlimok G', 'Raghavachar AA', 'Fiedler W', 'Kirchner HH', 'Brugger W', 'Zucknick M', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Heil G', 'Ganser A', 'Krauter J']","['Department of Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg Str 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany. wagner.katharina@mh-hannover.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

We aimed to determine the clinical implication of WT1 mutation in 470 de novo non-M3 AML patients and its stability during the clinical course. WT1 mutations were identified in 6.8% of total patients and 8.3% of younger patients with normal karyotype (CN-AML). The WT1 mutation was closely associated with younger age (P < .001), French-American-British M6 subtype (P = .006), and t(7;11)(p15;p15) (P = .003). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the WT1 mutation was an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival and relapse-free survival among total patients and the CN-AML group. A scoring system incorporating WT1 mutation, NPM1/FLT3-ITD, CEBPA mutations, and age into survival analysis proved to be very useful to stratify CN-AML patients into different prognostic groups (P < .001). Sequential analyses were performed on 133 patients. WT1 mutations disappeared at complete remission in all WT1-mutated patients studied. At relapse, 3 of the 16 WT1-mutated patients who had paired samples lost the mutation and 2 acquired additional mutations, whereas 3 of 110 WT1-wild patients acquired novel mutations. In conclusion, WT1 mutations are correlated with poor prognosis in AML patients.

Although elevated levels of reactive oxygen species in CLL cells have been implicated, the molecular mechanism underlying this selectivity is unclear. In other cell types, the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway regulates the oxidative stress response. We found elevated Nrf2 signaling in untreated CLL cells compared with normal lymphocytes. Therefore, we tested 27 known electrophilic and antioxidant compounds with drug-like properties and determined their CLL-selective cytotoxicity and effect on Nrf2 signaling. The selected compounds were from five distinct structural classes; alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyls, isothiocyanates, sulfhydryl reactive metals, flavones, and polyphenols. Our results show that compounds containing alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyls, sulfhydryl reactive metals, and isothiocyanates are strong activators of Nrf2 in a reporter assay system and in primary human CLL based on increased expression of the Nrf2 target heme oxygenase-1. alpha-beta Unsaturated carbonyl-containing compounds were selectively cytotoxic to CLL, and loss of the alpha-beta unsaturation abrogated Nrf2 activity and CLL toxicity. The alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl containing compounds ethacrynic acid and parthenolide activated Nrf2 in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, but had a less potent effect in CLL cells. Furthermore, ethacrynic acid bound directly to the Nrf2-negative regulator Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) in CLL cells. These experiments document the presence of Nrf2 signaling in human CLL and suggest that altered Nrf2 responses may contribute to the observed selective cytotoxicity of electrophilic compounds in this disease.","['Wu, Raymond P', 'Hayashi, Tomoko', 'Cottam, Howard B', 'Jin, Guangyi', 'Yao, Shiyin', 'Wu, Christina C N', 'Rosenbach, Michael D', 'Corr, Maripat', 'Schwab, Richard B', 'Carson, Dennis A']","['Wu RP', 'Hayashi T', 'Cottam HB', 'Jin G', 'Yao S', 'Wu CC', 'Rosenbach MD', 'Corr M', 'Schwab RB', 'Carson DA']","['Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Polyphenols)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flavonoids/chemistry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/*biosynthesis', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Phenols/chemistry', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polyphenols', 'Signal Transduction', 'Up-Regulation']",,2010/04/07 06:00,2010/05/28 06:00,['2010/04/07 06:00'],"['2010/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1002890107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1002890107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Apr 20;107(16):7479-84. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1002890107.

Subjects received low-dose decitabine at 20 mg/m(2) i.v. over 1 h on days 1 to 10. Fifty-three subjects enrolled with a median age of 74 years (range, 60-85). Nineteen (36%) had antecedent hematologic disorder or therapy-related AML; 16 had complex karyotypes (>or=3 abnormalities). The complete remission rate was 47% (n = 25), achieved after a median of three cycles of therapy. Nine additional subjects had no morphologic evidence of disease with incomplete count recovery, for an overall response rate of 64% (n = 34). Complete remission was achieved in 52% of subjects presenting with normal karyotype and in 50% of those with complex karyotypes. Median overall and disease-free survival durations were 55 and 46 weeks, respectively. Death within 30 days of initiation of treatment occurred in one subject (2%), death within 8 weeks in 15% of subjects. Given the DNA hypomethylating effect of decitabine, we examined the relationship of clinical response and pretreatment level of miR-29b, previously shown to target DNA methyltransferases. Higher levels of miR-29b were associated with clinical response (P = 0.02). In conclusion, this schedule of decitabine was highly active and well tolerated in this poor-risk cohort of older AML patients. Levels of miR-29b should be validated as a predictive factor for stratification of older AML patients to decitabine treatment.","['Blum, William', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Klisovic, Rebecca B', 'Schwind, Sebastian', 'Walker, Alison', 'Geyer, Susan', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Havelange, Violaine', 'Becker, Heiko', 'Schaaf, Larry', 'Mickle, Jon', 'Devine, Hollie', 'Kefauver, Cheryl', 'Devine, Steven M', 'Chan, Kenneth K', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Byrd, John C', 'Villalona-Calero, Miguel', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Marcucci, Guido']","['Blum W', 'Garzon R', 'Klisovic RB', 'Schwind S', 'Walker A', 'Geyer S', 'Liu S', 'Havelange V', 'Becker H', 'Schaaf L', 'Mickle J', 'Devine H', 'Kefauver C', 'Devine SM', 'Chan KK', 'Heerema NA', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Grever MR', 'Byrd JC', 'Villalona-Calero M', 'Croce CM', 'Marcucci G']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, and Center for Biostatistics, Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. william.blum@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2010/04/07 06:00,2010/05/28 06:00,['2010/04/07 06:00'],"['2010/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1002650107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1002650107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Apr 20;107(16):7473-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1002650107.

It studied 3 diseases and totaled direct and indirect costs and cost of premature death. The 2001 study can be updated by using current breastfeeding rates and adding additional diseases analyzed in the 2007 breastfeeding report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. STUDY DESIGN: Using methods similar to those in the 2001 study, we computed current costs and compared them to the projected costs if 80% and 90% of US families could comply with the recommendation to exclusively breastfeed for 6 months. Excluding type 2 diabetes (because of insufficient data), we conducted a cost analysis for all pediatric diseases for which the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reported risk ratios that favored breastfeeding: necrotizing enterocolitis, otitis media, gastroenteritis, hospitalization for lower respiratory tract infections, atopic dermatitis, sudden infant death syndrome, childhood asthma, childhood leukemia, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and childhood obesity. We used 2005 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention breastfeeding rates and 2007 dollars. RESULTS: If 90% of US families could comply with medical recommendations to breastfeed exclusively for 6 months, the United States would save $13 billion per year and prevent an excess 911 deaths, nearly all of which would be in infants ($10.5 billion and 741 deaths at 80% compliance). CONCLUSIONS: Current US breastfeeding rates are suboptimal and result in significant excess costs and preventable infant deaths. Investment in strategies to promote longer breastfeeding duration and exclusivity may be cost-effective.","['Bartick, Melissa', 'Reinhold, Arnold']","['Bartick M', 'Reinhold A']","['Department of Medicine, Cambridge Health Alliance and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. melissabartick@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,,IM,"['Breast Feeding/*epidemiology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Female', 'Health Care Costs/*statistics & numerical data', 'Health Services Research', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Mortality/trends', 'Infant, Low Birth Weight', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Very Low Birth Weight', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pediatrics/*economics', 'Pregnancy', 'Survival Rate', 'United States']",,2010/04/07 06:00,2010/05/19 06:00,['2010/04/07 06:00'],"['2010/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['peds.2009-1616 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2009-1616 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2010 May;125(5):e1048-56. doi: 10.1542/peds.2009-1616.

CSC biology necessitates a detailed delineation of normal stem cell functioning and maintenance of homeostasis within the organ. Ovarian CSC biology has unfortunately not benefited from a pre-established knowledge of stem cell lineage demarcation and functioning in the normal organ. In the absence of such information, some of the classical parameters such as long-term culture-initiating assays to isolate stem cell clones from tumors, screening and evaluation of other epithelial stem cell surface markers, dye efflux, and label retention have been applied toward the putative isolation of CSCs from ovarian tumors.

However, it is still a great challenge to pathologists. The aim of this study was to survey and evaluate the accuracy of pathological diagnosis using the ultrasonography (US)-guided core-needle biopsy (CNB) of the lymph node. METHODS: Lymph node CNBs of 1119 consecutive patients from the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital were reviewed retrospectively. Biopsies were performed following outpatient procedures with direct US guiding by using 18-gauge cutting needle. The tissues of CNB were prepared according to the routine paraffin embedding and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Ancillary studies, including acid-fast staining and immunohistochemical staining, were performed when necessary. RESULTS: The age range was 1 year old to 85 years old. Locations of the lymph node were as follows: cervical area (n = 482), clavicular region (n = 227), retroperitoneum (n = 150), axilla (n = 93), groin (n = 79), abdomen/mesentery (n = 44), submaxillary region (n = 33), postauricular region (n = 4), iliac fosa (n = 3), parotid (n = 2), hepatic hilar region (n = 1), and elbow (n = 1). The histological diagnoses were conclusive in 815 cases (73%) and inconclusive in 304 cases (27%). The conclusive cases mainly included metastatic carcinoma (n = 449), tuberculosis (n = 111), lymphoma/leukemia (n = 124), reactive hyperplasia (n = 87), and other rare diseases (n = 44). The reasons for inconclusive cases were insufficient material for diagnosis, noncompliance of outpatients, or crushing artifacts of tissues caused by operation. CONCLUSIONS: US-guided CNB can obtain lymphoid tissues from nearly all parts of the body for diagnostic purposes. Conclusive pathological diagnosis can be made in most of cases when adequate material was provided. Besides metastatic carcinoma, lymphomas with special immunophenotype can be accurately diagnosed and subclassified by US-guided CNB.","['Yuan, Jing', 'Li, Xiang-hong']","['Yuan J', 'Li XH']","['Department of Pathology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy, Needle/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymph Nodes/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/pathology', 'Ultrasonography']",,2010/04/07 06:00,2010/06/30 06:00,['2010/04/07 06:00'],"['2010/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2010 Mar 20;123(6):690-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the 12 patients with hematologic malignancies, four patients with acute leukemia died of B. cereus sepsis within a few days.

Novel anti-CD20 mAbs are in development that may enhance mAb therapy. Ofatumumab (human anti-CD20 mAb) induces highly potent cell lysis, including in cells with low CD20 expression, and is the most clinically advanced new anti-CD20 mAb. Positive phase III interim data for ofatumumab in fludarabine-refractory CLL that is also refractory to alemtuzumab or less suitable for alemtuzumab due to bulky (>5 cm) lymphadenopathy has led to FDA approval of this agent in this population.

Despite the initial high rates of hematological and cytogenetic responses, many patients develop resistance. We prospectively studied 40 patients with CML with primary cytogenetic resistance to imatinib mesylate. A semi-nested reverse transcriptase-PCR approach was used for amplification of the ABL kinase domain, which was then subjected to direct sequencing for the detection of point mutations. Expression of BCR-ABL transcripts was quantified using the real-time Taqman assay, and BCR-ABL gene amplification was detected using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Twelve different point mutations were detected in 18/40 (45%) patients. Five patients had mutations in the P-loop region and 13 had mutations in other regions of the BCR-ABL kinase domain. Progression-free survival at 2 years was inferior for patients with mutations compared to those without mutations (72% vs. 95%, p < 0.0045). The BCR-ABL fusion gene was over-expressed in five patients (5/18); the mean BCR-ABL/ABL ratio was 75.38 vs. 28.72 for imatinib responders, p < 0.001. Amplification of the BCR-ABL fusion gene was detected in 4/40 (10%) patients. Point mutation was the major mechanism of primary cytogenetic resistance to imatinib mesylate in the present study.

We investigated the effect of resveratrol on human leukemia cell lines, in particular its ability to induce intracellular reactive oxygen species production and the effect of Bcl-2 overexpression on this model. Exposure of CEM cells to increasing concentrations of resveratrol (0-50 microM) resulted in an increase in mitochondrial superoxide production, decrease in transmembrane potential, and a concomitant decrease in cell viability. Whereas overexpression of Bcl-2 increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and complex IV activity, CEM/Bcl-2 cells responded to the increased mitochondrial oxidative stress induced by resveratrol by significantly reducing mitochondrial respiration, complex IV activity, and O(2)(-) production, and promoted cell survival. The inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 on resveratrol-induced mitochondrial O(2)(-) production is further corroborated by the neutralization of this regulatory effect upon siRNA-mediated gene silencing of Bcl-2. These data provide evidence implicating mitochondrial metabolism in the anticancer activity of resveratrol, and underscore a novel regulatory role of Bcl-2 against exogenous oxidative stress through its ability to fine tune mitochondrial respiration, and by doing so maintaining mitochondrial O(2)(-) at a level optimal for survival.","['Low, Ivan Cherh Chiet', 'Chen, Zhi Xiong', 'Pervaiz, Shazib']","['Low IC', 'Chen ZX', 'Pervaiz S']","['Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antioxid Redox Signal,Antioxidants & redox signaling,100888899,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Stilbenes)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology']",,2010/04/07 06:00,2010/10/07 06:00,['2010/04/07 06:00'],"['2010/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/ars.2009.3050 [doi]'],ppublish,Antioxid Redox Signal. 2010 Sep 15;13(6):807-19. doi: 10.1089/ars.2009.3050.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A questionnaire was completed by 6 pediatric oncologists, to identify their referral patterns. The chart review demonstrated that 25 of the 35 patients had reports of musculoskeletal complications sometime during their treatment, but only 10 (30%) were referred to PT. The most common reason for referral was decreased functional mobility. Patients were referred evenly through all phases of therapy. Vincristine was reduced in 5 patients, the most common cause being peripheral neuropathy and foot drop. The majority (5/6) of the physicians reported that they ""sometimes"" refer patients to PT, through different phases of therapy, with 1/3 reporting all phases. The results show that although physicians identified the musculoskeletal complications, only a minority of patients were referred for PT.

Thus, there remains a need for new therapies, particularly for patients who develop chemoresistance to DNA-targeting treatments. AICA-riboside (acadesine) is a nucleoside with a wide range of metabolic effects, including release of adenosine and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which was initially developed as a cardioprotective agent. More recently, it has been shown that AICA-riboside induces apoptosis in various models of leukemia, including CLL. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: The literature data show that apoptosis induced by AICA-riboside in CLL is not dependent on a functionally normal p53 pathway. Moreover, AICA-riboside is active towards resting and proliferative models of leukemia cells, including resistant phenotypes. Finally, studies in healthy subjects and during coronary artery bypass graft surgery show that AICA-riboside is devoid of serious toxicity. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: This paper reviews the mechanisms of action of AICA-riboside in normal and malignant cells and discusses how AICA-riboside could impact CLL treatment. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: We propose that AICA-riboside, which displays a relative selectivity and a favorable toxicity profile, may offer a new treatment option for CLL.","['Van Den Neste, Eric', 'Van den Berghe, Georges', 'Bontemps, Francoise']","['Van Den Neste E', 'Van den Berghe G', 'Bontemps F']","['de Duve Institute, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry, UCL 7539, Avenue Hippocrate 75, 1200 Brussels, Belgium. eric.vandenneste@uclouvain.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Ribonucleosides)', '360-97-4 (Aminoimidazole Carboxamide)', '53IEF47846 (acadesine)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/trends', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",66,2010/04/07 06:00,2010/11/03 06:00,['2010/04/07 06:00'],"['2010/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543781003703694 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2010 Apr;19(4):571-8. doi: 10.1517/13543781003703694.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2010 Jun;19(6):807'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein we describe a case of HCL diagnosed in a Thai patient. A 36-year-old man presented with abdominal discomfort, frequent gum bleeding and significant weight loss for 2 months. Physical examination revealed moderate anemia, petechial hemorrhage on the extremities and an enlarged spleen down to the umbilicus. No hepatomegaly or lymphadenopathy was detected. Complete blood counts revealed a hemoglobin (Hb) of 6.6 g/dL, a white blood cell (WBC) count of 1.6 x 10(9)/L (neutrophil 16%, lymphocyte 71%, monocyte 11%, atypical lymphocyte 1%), and a platelet (PLT) count of 17 x 10(9)/L. Abnormal large mononuclear cells with villous projections were seen in the blood smear. Although bone marrow (BM) aspiration resulted in a dry tap, abnormal lymphocytes with villous projections could again be identified in the touch preparation. Flow cytometric analysis showed a distinct population above the normal lymphocyte region on CD45/SSC gates with a strong expression of CD19, CD20, CD22, CD25, CD11c, and kappa. CD5, CD23, CD10, CD4, and CD8 were all negative. BM biopsy was consistent with HCL. The patient was treated with splenectomy followed by 8 cycles of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. At 21 months after diagnosis, the patient was doing well with a Hb of 16.9 g/dl, a WBC count of 6.8 x 10(9)/L, neutrophil 49.9%, lymphocyte 39.6%, monocyte 8.6%, and a PLT count of 329 x 10(9)/L).

The current gold standard method is based on a morphologic counting of 500 marrow nucleated cells despite its operator dependence and inter-observer variability. OBJECTIVES: To compare the percentages of marrow blasts derived from two different approaches comprising routine morphology-based manual counting and flow cytometric analysis. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Fifty-five marrow samples were collected from 38 acute leukemia patients (36 AML and 19 ALL) after hematologic recovery from chemotherapy. The blast percentages were enumerated manually and by flow cytometer using CD45 and side scatter gates. RESULTS: A good correlation was found in the overall 55 samples (r = 0.829) and 36 AML samples (r = 0.86). The blast percentages derived from flow cytometer were higher than from morphologic counting in 46 samples (83.6%). Using a cut-off point of < 5% blasts to define complete remission (CR), 48 cases (87%) were classified as morphological CR (83% CR in AML and 95% CR in ALL). By flow cytometry, only 24 cases (44%) were in CR (28% CR in AML and 74% CR in ALL). The results from each method were concordant in determining CR in 27 samples (49%), with a kappa value of 0.07 for overall samples, 0.057 for AML and -0.096 for ALL samples. CONCLUSION: A good correlation between the percentages of blasts achieved by either method was demonstrated, particularly in AML samples. Discordant results occurred when <5% blasts were used as a cut-offpoint to determine CR. Both methods should be complementarily performed to ensure a truly complete response to chemotherapy. The method discrepancy should be further investigated in order to increase the level of confidence in CR status.","['Wongprajun, Somwong', 'Auewarakul, Chirayu U']","['Wongprajun S', 'Auewarakul CU']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Thailand,J Med Assoc Thai,Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet,7507216,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Cell Count/*methods', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",,2010/04/07 06:00,2010/05/05 06:00,['2010/04/07 06:00'],"['2010/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Med Assoc Thai. 2010 Jan;93 Suppl 1:S157-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study included 97 children patients with ALL (mean age 5.4+/-2.5) and 131 healthy children (mean age 6.2+/-2.8) used as controls. Genetic polymorphisms in BER pathway genes were examined using PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). We have demonstrated that the OGG1 Cys/Cys genotype increases the risk of ALL (OR 5.36) whereas the Ser/Ser genotype variant strongly reduces the risk of this cancer among Polish children (OR 0.45). Although we did not observe the differences in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MUTYH and XRCC1 genes between control group and children with ALL, we have shown that the combined genotypes of examined genes can modulate the risk of childhood ALL in Polish population. We found that the combined genotype Arg/Gln-Cys/Cys of XRCC1/OGG1 (OR 3.83) as well as the Cys/Cys-Tyr/Tyr of OGG1/MUTYH (OR 6.75) increases the risk of ALL. In contrast, the combined genotype Arg/Arg-Ser/Ser of XRCC1/OGG1 (OR 0.40) as well as the Ser/Ser-Tyr/Tyr of OGG1/MUTYH (OR 0.43) played a protective role against this malignant disease. In conclusion, we suggest that polymorphisms of BER genes may be used as an important predictive factor for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children.","['Stanczyk, M', 'Sliwinski, T', 'Cuchra, M', 'Zubowska, M', 'Bielecka-Kowalska, A', 'Kowalski, M', 'Szemraj, J', 'Mlynarski, W', 'Majsterek, I']","['Stanczyk M', 'Sliwinski T', 'Cuchra M', 'Zubowska M', 'Bielecka-Kowalska A', 'Kowalski M', 'Szemraj J', 'Mlynarski W', 'Majsterek I']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Banacha 12/16 St, 90-237, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (X-ray Repair Cross Complementing Protein 1)', '0 (XRCC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (DNA Glycosylases)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (mutY adenine glycosylase)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (oxoguanine glycosylase 1, human)']",IM,"['Child', 'DNA Glycosylases/*genetics', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'X-ray Repair Cross Complementing Protein 1']",,2010/04/07 06:00,2011/03/22 06:00,['2010/04/06 06:00'],"['2010/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11033-010-0127-x [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2011 Jan;38(1):445-51. doi: 10.1007/s11033-010-0127-x.

EVI1 is a member of a group of transcription factors with C-terminal binding protein (CtBP)-binding motifs that act as transcriptional co-repressors; however, we recently found that EVI1 directly activates GATA2 transcription, which is an important gene for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells. We show here that EVI1-activated GATA2 transcripts derive from exon 1S of GATA2, which is specifically activated in neural and hematopoietic cells. EVI1 was acetylated by the histone acetyltransferase p300/CBP association factor (P/CAF) in myeloid leukemia cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells. Acetylation at Lys(564), which is adjacent to the CtBP-binding consensus sequence of EVI1, was found to be important for transcriptional activation of GATA2. Mutation of Lys(564) to alanine (K564A) markedly reduced the ability of EVI1 to bind DNA and activate transcription of GATA2. Furthermore, we confirmed that Lys(564) in EVI1 was specifically acetylated in leukemia and primary hematopoietic cells by using an antibody directed against an acetylated Lys(564) EVI1 peptide. Moreover, co-transfection of P/CAF with EVI1 overcame the suppressive effect of the CtBP co-repressor and resulted in GATA2 transcriptional activation; nonetheless, CtBP2 was still included in the protein complex with EVI1 and P/CAF on the EVI1-binding site in the GATA2 promoter region. Thus, acetylation of EVI1 at Lys(564) by P/CAF enhances the DNA binding capacity of EVI1 and thereby contributes to the activation of GATA2.","['Shimahara, Akiko', 'Yamakawa, Norio', 'Nishikata, Ichiro', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro']","['Shimahara A', 'Yamakawa N', 'Nishikata I', 'Morishita K']","['Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki 889-1692, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*chemistry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lysine/*chemistry', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Zinc Fingers']",,2010/04/07 06:00,2010/06/18 06:00,['2010/04/06 06:00'],"['2010/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)35622-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.102046 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 May 28;285(22):16967-77. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.102046.

Subclassification, however, may be difficult in low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. OBJECTIVE: To determine the yield of EUS-guided biopsy to classify lymphoma based on the World Health Organization classification of tumors of hematopoietic lymphoid tissues. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: A total of 24 patients referred for EUS-guided biopsy who had a final diagnosis of lymphoma or ""highly suspicious for lymphoma."" INTERVENTIONS: EUS-guided FNA and TCB combined with flow cytometry (FC) analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASUREMENT: Lymphoma subclassification accuracy of EUS guided biopsy. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were included in this study. Twenty-three patients underwent EUS-FNA, and 1 patient had only TCB. Twenty-two underwent EUS-TCB combined with FNA. EUS correctly diagnosed lymphoma in 19 out of 24 patients (79%), and subclassification was determined in 16 patients (66.6%). Flow cytometry correctly identified B-cell monoclonality in 95% (18 out of 19). In 1 patient diagnosed as having marginal-zone lymphoma by EUS-FNA/FC only, the diagnosis was changed to hairy cell leukemia after a bone marrow biopsy was obtained. EUS had a lower yield in nonlarge B-cell lymphoma (only 9 out of 15 cases [60%]) compared with large B-cell lymphoma (78%; P = .3 [Fisher exact test]). LIMITATIONS: Retrospective, small number of patients. CONCLUSION: EUS-guided biopsy has a lower yield to correctly classify Hodgkin lymphoma and low-grade lymphoma compared with high-grade diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","['Ribeiro, Afonso', 'Pereira, Denise', 'Escalon, Maricer P', 'Goodman, Mark', 'Byrne, Gerald E Jr']","['Ribeiro A', 'Pereira D', 'Escalon MP', 'Goodman M', 'Byrne GE Jr']","['Division of Gastroenterology, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida 33101, USA. aribeiro@med.miami.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Gastrointest Endosc,Gastrointestinal endoscopy,0010505,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Biopsy, Fine-Needle', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Endosonography', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hodgkin Disease/classification/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Lymphoma/classification/*diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/classification/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Ultrasonography, Interventional', 'Young Adult']",,2010/04/07 06:00,2010/07/07 06:00,['2010/04/06 06:00'],"['2009/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0016-5107(09)02899-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gie.2009.12.033 [doi]']",ppublish,Gastrointest Endosc. 2010 Apr;71(4):851-5. doi: 10.1016/j.gie.2009.12.033.,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2010 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.

Prosurvival members of the family interact with proapoptotic BH3 (Bcl-2-homology-3)-only members, inhibiting execution of cell death through the mitochondrial pathway. Structurally, this interaction is mediated by binding of the alpha-helical BH3 region of the proapoptotic proteins to a conserved hydrophobic groove on the prosurvival proteins. Native BH3-only proteins exhibit selectivity in binding prosurvival members, as do small molecules that block these interactions. Understanding the sequence and structural basis of interaction specificity in this family is important, as it may allow the prediction of new Bcl-2 family associations and/or the design of new classes of selective inhibitors to serve as reagents or therapeutics. In this work, we used two complementary techniques--yeast surface display screening from combinatorial peptide libraries and SPOT peptide array analysis--to elucidate specificity determinants for binding to Bcl-x(L)versus Mcl-1, two prominent prosurvival proteins. We screened a randomized library and identified BH3 peptides that bound to either Mcl-1 or Bcl-x(L) selectively or to both with high affinity. The peptides competed with native ligands for binding into the conserved hydrophobic groove, as illustrated in detail by a crystal structure of a specific peptide bound to Mcl-1. Mcl-1-selective peptides from the screen were highly specific for binding Mcl-1 in preference to Bcl-x(L), Bcl-2, Bcl-w, and Bfl-1, whereas Bcl-x(L)-selective peptides showed some cross-interaction with related proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-w. Mutational analyses using SPOT arrays revealed the effects of 170 point mutations made in the background of a peptide derived from the BH3 region of Bim, and a simple predictive model constructed using these data explained much of the specificity observed in our Mcl-1 versus Bcl-x(L) binders.","['Dutta, Sanjib', 'Gulla, Stefano', 'Chen, T Scott', 'Fire, Emiko', 'Grant, Robert A', 'Keating, Amy E']","['Dutta S', 'Gulla S', 'Chen TS', 'Fire E', 'Grant RA', 'Keating AE']","['Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Peptide Library', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Substrate Specificity', 'bcl-X Protein/*genetics/*metabolism']",,2010/04/07 06:00,2010/05/19 06:00,['2010/04/06 06:00'],"['2009/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2836(10)00333-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2010.03.058 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2010 May 21;398(5):747-62. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2010.03.058.

Since epigenetic modifying agents are FDA approved for treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, laboratory correlative tools to monitor response to this targeted therapy are important. Methylation specific quantum dot fluorescence resonance energy transfer (MS-qFRET) is a nanotechnology assay that enables the detection of methylation and its changes in a sensitive, quantifiable manner. It utilizes quantum dot-mediated fluorescence resonance energy transfer to achieve highly sensitive detection of DNA methylation. Template DNA is first treated with sodium bisulfite such that unmethylated cytosines are converted to uracil while methylated cytosines remain unconverted. Thereafter, the converted template is amplified using biotinylated methylation-specific primers. Quantum dots, functionalized with streptavidin, serve both as a scaffold to capture amplicons and as a donor for transferring energy to the Cy5 acceptor that is incorporated into the amplicons during PCR. Thus, the status of DNA methylation can be determined according to the level of FRET. In this report, MS-qFRET is validated in cell lines and then used to detect the status of p15(INK4B) methylation in clinical samples from eight patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","['Bailey, Vasudev J', 'Keeley, Brian P', 'Razavi, Christopher R', 'Griffiths, Elizabeth', 'Carraway, Hetty E', 'Wang, Tza-Huei']","['Bailey VJ', 'Keeley BP', 'Razavi CR', 'Griffiths E', 'Carraway HE', 'Wang TH']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, 720 Rutland Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21205, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Methods,"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",9426302,,IM,"['*DNA Methylation', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Nanotechnology/*methods', '*Quantum Dots']",,2010/04/07 06:00,2011/03/15 06:00,['2010/04/06 06:00'],"['2009/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S1046-2023(10)00106-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.03.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Methods. 2010 Nov;52(3):237-41. doi: 10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.03.007.

Here we tested the hypothesis that integration of peri-operative immunostimulation and blockade of immunosuppression could synergistically improve post-operative anti-metastatic immunity and long-term survival. METHODS: Two syngeneic tumor models in F344 rats were employed, studying post-operative tumor progression. In the first model, survival following laparotomy and CRNK-16 leukemia was studied. Rats were peri-operatively treated with the immuno-stimulant poly I-C (5x0.2 mg/kg/inj), with catecholamine- and prostaglandin-blockers (shown to prevent post-operative immunosuppression: 4.5 mg/kg nadolol, 4 mg/kg indomethacin), with both interventions, or with neither. Long-term survival was assessed thereafter. The second model used the MADB106 mammary adenocarcinoma, assessing its lung tumor retention (LTR) following i.v. inoculation, as well as host marginating-pulmonary NK numbers and activity against this tumor. IL-12 was employed for immunostimulation (4x1.5 microg/kg/inj), with and without the above blockers. RESULTS: Post-operative CRNK-16 survival rates were significantly improved only by the integrated approach of immune stimulation and endocrine blockers. Post-operative MADB106 LTR was additively reduced by the two interventions. Importantly, while IL-12 increased pulmonary NK cytotoxicity against MADB106, surgery markedly suppressed this cytotoxicity in both IL-12 and vehicle treated animals. The blockers prevented this suppression per lung and per single NK cell. CONCLUSIONS: Immunostimulation could be rendered ineffective post-operatively due to immunosuppression; therefore integrating endocrine-blocker therapies into the realm of peri-operative immunotherapy could optimize immune control over residual disease, potentially improving clinical outcomes.","['Avraham, Roi', 'Benish, Marganit', 'Inbar, Shelly', 'Bartal, Inbal', 'Rosenne, Ella', 'Ben-Eliyahu, Shamgar']","['Avraham R', 'Benish M', 'Inbar S', 'Bartal I', 'Rosenne E', 'Ben-Eliyahu S']","['Department of Psychology, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Brain Behav Immun,"Brain, behavior, and immunity",8800478,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)', '0 (Catecholamines)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hormone Antagonists)', '0 (Prostaglandin Antagonists)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '42200-33-9 (Nadolol)', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Catecholamines/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Disease Progression', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hormone Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Immune Tolerance/*physiology', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-12/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural', 'Laparotomy', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Nadolol/pharmacology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*pathology/*surgery', 'Poly I-C/pharmacology', 'Postoperative Complications/*immunology/*pathology', 'Prostaglandin Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Survival']",,2010/04/07 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/04/06 06:00'],"['2010/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/24 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0889-1591(10)00088-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbi.2010.03.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Behav Immun. 2010 Aug;24(6):952-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bbi.2010.03.010.

We explored the potential of detecting CD33 as cell-free circulating protein in patients with leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a quantitative bead-based immunoflow cytometry assay to measure cell-free circulating CD33 (cCD33) levels in the plasma of patients with acute leukemia, and correlated these results with corresponding clinical behavior. We measured cCD33 levels in the plasma of 48 healthy subjects and in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 98), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 46), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (n = 50), and myeloproliferative disorder (n = 49). RESULTS: Patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myeloproliferative disorders had significantly higher concentrations of cCD33 than the other patient groups and normal individuals (p = 0.0001), and among these groups, MDS patients displayed the lowest cCD33 levels (p = 0.02). Circulating CD33 values correlated positively with the CD33(+) blast cell counts in these patients. While there was no correlation between cCD33 levels and survival in acute myelogenous leukemia and MDS, higher cCD33 plasma concentrations did correlate with shorter survival in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (p = 0.03), and with shorter complete remission duration in acute myelogenous leukemia (p = 0.04) and MDS (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Circulating CD33 can be detected in the plasma from patients with leukemias, and cCD33 levels may have clinical implication, e.g., predictive and prognostic value, in these patients.","['Abdool, Adam', 'Yeh, Chen-Hsiung', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Bruey, JeanMarie', 'Giles, Francis', 'Albitar, Maher']","['Abdool A', 'Yeh CH', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Bruey J', 'Giles F', 'Albitar M']","['Hematology and Oncology Department, Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/*blood', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell-Free System', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",,2010/04/07 06:00,2010/06/02 06:00,['2010/04/06 06:00'],"['2009/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00131-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.03.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Jun;38(6):462-71. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.03.016.

In addition, using an in vitro culture system, we clearly showed that blastoma cell adhesion to OP9 stromal cells accelerates blastoma cell proliferation that is associated with up-regulation of BMI1 gene expression; increased levels of beta-catenin and the Notch1 intra-cellular domain; and changed the expression pattern of variant CD44 forms, which are constitutively expressed in these blastoma cells. These findings strongly suggest that adhesion of leukemic stem cells to stromal cells via CD44 might be indispensable for their cellular defense against attack by immune cells and for maintenance of their self-renewal ability.","['Funayama, Keiji', 'Saito-Kurimoto, Yumi', 'Ebihara, Yasuhiro', 'Shimane, Miyuki', 'Nomura, Hitoshi', 'Tsuji, Ko-ichiro', 'Asano, Shigetaka']","['Funayama K', 'Saito-Kurimoto Y', 'Ebihara Y', 'Shimane M', 'Nomura H', 'Tsuji K', 'Asano S']","['Department of Integrative Bioscience and Biomedical Engineering, Waseda University, 4-3-1 Ohkubo, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 169-555, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Bmi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",,2010/04/07 06:00,2010/07/08 06:00,['2010/04/06 06:00'],"['2010/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(10)00647-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.03.172 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2010 May 28;396(2):193-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.03.172.

In the present study, a high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS) method for free sialic acid (FSA) and total sialic acid (TSA) in human CSF was validated. METHODS: The method utilized a simple sample-preparation procedure of protein precipitation for FSA and acid hydrolysis for TSA. Negative electrospray ionisation was used to monitor the transitions m/z 308.2-->87.0 (SA) and m/z 311.2--> 90.0 ((13)C(3)-SA). Conjugated sialic acid (CSA) was calculated by subtracting FSA from TSA. We established reference intervals for FSA, TSA and CSA in CSF in 217 control subjects. The method has been applied to patients' samples with known differences in SA metabolites like meningitis (n=6), brain tumour (n=2), leukaemia (n=5), and Salla disease (n=1). RESULTS: Limit of detection (LOD) was 0.54 microM for FSA and 0.45 mM for TSA. Intra- and inter-assay variation for FSA (21.8 microM) were 4.8% (n=10) and 10.4% (n=40) respectively. Intra- and inter-assay variation for TSA (35.6 microM) were 9.7% (n=10) and 12.8% (n=40) respectively. Tested patients showed values of TSA above established reference value. CONCLUSION: The validated method allows sensitive and specific measurement of SA metabolites in CSF and can be applied for clinical diagnoses.","['van der Ham, Maria', 'de Koning, Tom J', 'Lefeber, Dirk', 'Fleer, Andre', 'Prinsen, Berthil H C M T', 'de Sain-van der Velden, Monique G M']","['van der Ham M', 'de Koning TJ', 'Lefeber D', 'Fleer A', 'Prinsen BH', 'de Sain-van der Velden MG']","['Department of Metabolic and Endocrine Diseases, University Medical Centre Utrecht, WKZ and Netherlands Metabolomics Centre, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci,"Journal of chromatography.

We recently showed that elevated levels of Ki-67 circulating in plasma (cKi-67) are associated with shorter survival in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The current study included 194 patients with CLL and 96 healthy control subjects. cKi-67 levels in plasma were determined using an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. We normalized the cKi-67 level to the absolute number of lymphocytes in the patient's peripheral blood to establish the plasma cKi-67 index. The cKi-67 index showed significant correlation with lymph node involvement and Rai stage (P=0.05). Higher cKi-67 index values were significantly associated with shorter survival. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis demonstrated that the association of the cKi-67 index with shorter survival was independent of IgV(H) mutation status. In a multivariate model incorporating the cKi-67 index with B2M and IgV(H), only cKi-67 index and B2M levels remained as independent predictors of survival. The results of this study suggest that the plasma cKi-67 index, along with B2M level, is a strong predictor of clinical behavior in CLL.","['Bruey, Jean-Marie', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Ma, Wanlong', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Yeh, Chenhsiung', 'Donahue, Amber', 'Sanders, Heather', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Keating, Michael', 'Albitar, Maher']","['Bruey JM', 'Kantarjian H', 'Ma W', 'Estrov Z', 'Yeh C', 'Donahue A', 'Sanders H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Keating M', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology R&D, Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, 33608 Ortega Highway, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92690, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers', 'Blotting, Western', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Ki-67 Antigen/*blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/blood']",,2010/04/07 06:00,2010/10/01 06:00,['2010/04/06 06:00'],"['2009/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/19 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(10)00151-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2010.03.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Oct;34(10):1320-4. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2010.03.010.

Many lymphoid malignancies are well-treated with glucocorticoid (GC); however, GC resistance sometimes develops and its mechanism remains uncertain. Since constitutive activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) has been reported to play roles in lymphoid malignancies, we examined whether inhibition of NF-kappaB activity with a synthetic inhibitor IMD-0354 affected GC sensitivity of canine neoplastic lymphoid cells, CL-1 and GL-1. Dexamethasone failed to inhibit proliferation of these cells, in which low expression of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) was identified. In the presence of IMD-0354, GR expressions in CL-1 and GL-1 were increased, consequently dexamethasone inhibited their proliferation. These results indicated that GR expression might be down-regulated by spontaneous activation of NF-kappaB, resulting in GC resistance. Taken together, interference of NF-kappaB activity may have the synergistic effect in combination chemotherapy with GC for treatment against lymphoid malignancies.","['Matsuda, A', 'Tanaka, A', 'Muto, S', 'Ohmori, K', 'Furusaka, T', 'Jung, K', 'Karasawa, K', 'Okamoto, N', 'Oida, K', 'Itai, A', 'Matsuda, H']","['Matsuda A', 'Tanaka A', 'Muto S', 'Ohmori K', 'Furusaka T', 'Jung K', 'Karasawa K', 'Okamoto N', 'Oida K', 'Itai A', 'Matsuda H']","['Laboratory of Veterinary Molecular Pathology and Therapeutics, Division of Animal Life Science, Graduate School, Institute of Symbiotic Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, 3-5-8 Saiwai-cho, Fuchu, Tokyo 183-8509, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Res Vet Sci,Research in veterinary science,0401300,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '76145IS906 (N-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-5-chloro-2-hydroxybenzamide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western/veterinary', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dog Diseases/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Dogs', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/*veterinary', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/*veterinary', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2010/04/07 06:00,2011/03/11 06:00,['2010/04/06 06:00'],"['2009/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0034-5288(10)00091-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.rvsc.2010.03.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Res Vet Sci. 2010 Dec;89(3):378-82. doi: 10.1016/j.rvsc.2010.03.017.

Forty-five samples from 24 patients (consisting of 11 newly diagnosed and 13 previously diagnosed patients) were included.

Karyotypes before and at relapse after allo-SCT were different in 15 patients (68%), the most frequent type being clonal evolution either alone or combined with clonal devolution (13 patients). Patients with and without a karyotype change did not differ significantly in overall survival (OS) (median, 399 vs. 452 days; P = 0.889) and survival after relapse (median, 120 vs. 370 days; P = 0.923). However, acquisition of additional structural chromosome 1 abnormalities at relapse after allo-SCT occurred more frequently than expected and was associated with reduced OS (median, 125 vs. 478 days; P = 0.008) and shorter survival after relapse (median, 37 vs. 370 days; P = 0.002). We identified a previously undescribed clonal evolution involving t(15;17) without PML-RARA rearrangement in an AML patient. We conclude that a karyotype change is common at relapse after allo-SCT in acute leukemia patients.

Therefore, all measures of cytotoxicity in the absence of cytochalasin B proved to be equally acceptable to select the top-dose without missing micronucleation activity for any of the four compounds.","['Kirchner, Stephan', 'Zeller, Andreas']","['Kirchner S', 'Zeller A']","['Non-Clinical Safety, F.

Many of the resultant MLL fusion proteins are found correlated with Ras signaling. Nevertheless, Ras mutations have only been reported in a small subset of MLL-rearranged leukemia. With the potential of developing new therapeutic regimens targeting Ras signaling pathway, we studied the role of MLL-AF4 family fusions and MLL-septin family fusions in the activation of Ras signaling in leukemogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Elk-1-driven luciferase reporter system was used to study the role of MLL-AF4, MLL-AF5q31, MLL-LAF4, MLL-CDCrel, MLL-MSF, and MLL-Septin 6 in the activation of Ras signaling. Dominant negative Ras S17N mutant and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 were employed to demonstrate the involvement of Ras and MEK in this transactivation event. The activation of endogenous Ras/MEK signaling pathway by MLL fusion proteins in leukemia cell lines was also addressed by immunoblot analysis and small interfering RNA knockdown approach. RESULTS: We demonstrated that MLL-AF4, MLL-AF5q31, and MLL-LAF4 activated Elk-1 transcription factor, one of the major downstream effectors of Ras. This activation was abolished in the presence of dominant negative Ras or MEK inhibitor U0126, indicating the requirements of Ras and MEK. We further showed that endogenous MEK is phosphorylated in a MLL-AF4-expressing leukemia cell line, whereas depletion of MLL-AF4 by small interfering RNA reduced the phospho-MEK level. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that MLL-AF4 family fusion oncoproteins can activate Elk-1 through Ras/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and strongly support the role of Ras signaling in the pathogenesis of MLL-rearranged leukemia.","['Ng, Ming-Him James', 'Ng, Ray Kit', 'Kong, Cheuk-Ting', 'Jin, Dong-Yan', 'Chan, Li-Chong']","['Ng MH', 'Ng RK', 'Kong CT', 'Jin DY', 'Chan LC']","['Division of Haematology, The SH Ho Foundation Research Laboratories in Pathology, Department of Pathology, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong SAR, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (ets-Domain Protein Elk-1)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'ets-Domain Protein Elk-1/*metabolism', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",,2010/04/07 06:00,2010/06/02 06:00,['2010/04/06 06:00'],"['2008/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(10)00105-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2010.03.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Jun;38(6):481-8. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2010.03.014.

Artemisinin and its derivatives are also selectively cytotoxic to cancer cells, which can be modulated by altering heme synthesis. Cytotoxicity to cancer cells is thought to involve generation of oxidative stress, although conflicting data exist. We have analyzed reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation using the fluorescent probes 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF) and dihydroethidine (HET) upon exposure to dihydroartemisinin (DHA) in Molt-4 leukemia cells. HET fluorescence correlated with dose-dependent DHA-induced cytotoxicity, increased within 30 min of DHA exposure, and was significantly enhanced by increasing heme synthesis. Protein levels of copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), manganese-superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidases 1/2 were also found to increase with DHA exposure. 4-hydroxy-tempol (TEMPOL) and DF-Mn, MnSOD mimetics, could significantly inhibit ROS generation and reduce cell death.

This review highlights the current evidence for aberration of the Notch signaling pathway in a wide range of tumors from hematological cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma through to skin, breast, lung, pancreas, colon and brain tumors.

Therefore, the knowledge of its treatment costs is of utmost importance. AIM: To determine and to characterize the direct costs of pharmacotherapy for leukemia at a regional hospital in Chile. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were retrospectively obtained from electronic and manual records of the hospital for all patients treated for leukemia between 2003 and 2006. Patients were classified into four groups: pediatric and adult patients treated for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL children and ALL adults, respectively), and pediatric and adult patients treated for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML children and AML adults, respectively). RESULTS: Total accumulated costs of pharmacotherapy for acute leukemia between 2003 and 2006 were 304,724,845 Chilean pesos (USD 574,952). The higher total or per patient costs, were generated by drugs for chemotherapy compared to other required medications. The exception were AML children, where support drugs, such as antimicrobials, ant emetic drugs and colony stimulating factors, generated the higher costs per patient. Among ALL adults, AML children and AML adults, the costs were concentrated in the first 6 months of treatment. NO children followed this tendency concentrating the costs between the seventh and twenty-fourth months. CONCLUSIONS: Annual costs of pharmacotherapy per patient for acute leukemia in this regional hospital were approximately USD 4,717. Chemotherapy was the item with the greatest impact on cost.","['Molina, Felipe', 'Schramm, Claudia', 'Ruiz, Guido']","['Molina F', 'Schramm C', 'Ruiz G']","['Instituto de Farmacia, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Chile,Rev Med Chil,Revista medica de Chile,0404312,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Chile', 'Health Care Costs/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*economics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*economics', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2010/04/03 06:00,2010/10/13 06:00,['2010/04/03 06:00'],"['2010/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0034-98872009001200002 [pii]', '/S0034-98872009001200002 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Med Chil. 2009 Dec;137(12):1553-60. doi: /S0034-98872009001200002.

We therefore hypothesize that antagonism of lef-1 might lead to killing of CLL cells. We used two small molecule inhibitors of Wnt/beta-catenin/lef-1 signaling (CGP049090 and PKF115-584) to test our hypothesis. DESIGN AND METHODS: Enriched CLL cells and healthy B cells were used in this study. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of lef-1 in primary CLL cells was done using nucleofection, and 50% lethal concentration (LC(50)) of two small molecules was assessed using ATP-based cell viability assay. Apoptotic response was investigated in time course experiments with different apoptotic markers. Specificity of the small molecules was demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments for the lef-1/beta-catenin interaction. In vivo studies were done in JVM-3 subcutaneous xenograft model. RESULTS: Inhibition of lef-1 by siRNA leads to increased apoptosis of CLL cells and inhibited proliferation of JVM-3 cell lines. The two small molecule inhibitors (CGP049090 and PKF115-584) efficiently kill CLL cells (LC(50)<1 microM), whereas normal B cells were not significantly affected. Coimmunoprecipitation showed a selective disruption of beta-catenin/lef-1 interaction. In vivo studies exhibited tumor inhibition of 69% with CGP049090 and 57% with PKF115-584 when compared with vehicle-treated controls, and the intervention was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that targeting lef-1 is a new and selective therapeutic approach in CLL. CGP049090 or PKF115-584 may be attractive compounds for CLL and other malignancies that deserve further (pre)clinical evaluation.","['Gandhirajan, Rajesh Kumar', 'Staib, Peter Anton', 'Minke, Katharina', 'Gehrke, Iris', 'Plickert, Gunther', 'Schlosser, Axel', 'Schmitt, Esther Katharina', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Kreuzer, Karl-Anton']","['Gandhirajan RK', 'Staib PA', 'Minke K', 'Gehrke I', 'Plickert G', 'Schlosser A', 'Schmitt EK', 'Hallek M', 'Kreuzer KA']","['Department I of Internal Medicine I, University at Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CGP049090)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (PKF115-584)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '5QD5427UN7 (Perylene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Weight', 'Perylene/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Wnt Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'beta Catenin/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology']",,2010/04/03 06:00,2010/06/19 06:00,['2010/04/03 06:00'],"['2009/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/28 00:00 [revised]', '2010/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1593/neo.91972 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2010 Apr;12(4):326-35. doi: 10.1593/neo.91972.,,,,,PMC2847740,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also cleaves the side chain of 7-dehydrocholesterol producing 7-dehydropregnenolone (7DHP), which can be transformed to 20(OH)7DHP. UVB induces transformation of the steroidal 5,7-dienes to pregnacalciferol (pD) and a lumisterol-like compounds (pL). METHODS AND FINDINGS: To define the biological significance of these P450scc-initiated pathways, we tested the effects of their 5,7-diene precursors and secosteroidal products on leukemia cell differentiation and proliferation in comparison to 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)(2)D3). These secosteroids inhibited proliferation and induced erythroid differentiation of K562 human chronic myeloid and MEL mouse leukemia cells with 20(OH)D3 and 20,23(OH)(2)D3 being either equipotent or slightly less potent than 1,25(OH)(2)D3, while 1,20(OH)(2)D3, pD and pL compounds were slightly or moderately less potent. The compounds also inhibited proliferation and induced monocytic differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic and U937 promonocytic human leukemia cells. Among them 1,25(OH)(2)D3 was the most potent, 20(OH)D3, 20,23(OH)(2)D3 and 1,20(OH)(2)D3 were less active, and pD and pL compounds were the least potent. Since it had been previously proven that secosteroids without the side chain (pD) have no effect on systemic calcium levels we performed additional testing in rats and found that 20(OH)D3 had no calcemic activity at concentration as high as 1 microg/kg, whereas, 1,20(OH)(2)D3 was slightly to moderately calcemic and 1,25(OH)(2)D3 had strong calcemic activity. CONCLUSIONS: We identified novel secosteroids that are excellent candidates for anti-leukemia therapy with 20(OH)D3 deserving special attention because of its relatively high potency and lack of calcemic activity.","['Slominski, Andrzej T', 'Janjetovic, Zorica', 'Fuller, Brian E', 'Zmijewski, Michal A', 'Tuckey, Robert C', 'Nguyen, Minh N', 'Sweatman, Trevor', 'Li, Wei', 'Zjawiony, Jordan', 'Miller, Duane', 'Chen, Tai C', 'Lozanski, Gerard', 'Holick, Michael F']","['Slominski AT', 'Janjetovic Z', 'Fuller BE', 'Zmijewski MA', 'Tuckey RC', 'Nguyen MN', 'Sweatman T', 'Li W', 'Zjawiony J', 'Miller D', 'Chen TC', 'Lozanski G', 'Holick MF']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America. aslominski@uthsc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (20-hydroxyvitamin D3)', '0 (7-dehydropregnenolone)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dehydrocholesterols)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '73R90F7MQ8 (Pregnenolone)', 'BK1IU07GKF (7-dehydrocholesterol)', 'EC 1.14.15.6 (Cholesterol Side-Chain Cleavage Enzyme)', 'P6YZ13C99Q (Calcifediol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcifediol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cholecalciferol/*metabolism', 'Cholesterol Side-Chain Cleavage Enzyme/*metabolism', 'Dehydrocholesterols/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Pregnenolone/analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'U937 Cells']",,2010/04/03 06:00,2011/01/12 06:00,['2010/04/03 06:00'],"['2009/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0009907 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Mar 26;5(3):e9907. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0009907.,,,"['P30 DK040561/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK040561-14/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR052190/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01A052190/PHS HHS/United States']",20100326,PMC2845617,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evaluations of statins in acute myelogenous leukemia and multiple myeloma have shown that statin efficacy is mixed, with only a subset of tumor cells being highly responsive. Our goal was to distinguish molecular features of statin-sensitive and -insensitive myeloma cells and gain insight into potential predictive markers. We show that dysregulation of the mevalonate pathway is a key determinant of sensitivity to statin-induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma. In sensitive cells, the classic feedback response to statin exposure is lost. This results in deficient up-regulation of 2 isoforms of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase: the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway and hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase 1. To ascertain the clinical utility of these findings, we demonstrate that a subset of primary myeloma cells is sensitive to statins and that monitoring dysregulation of the mevalonate pathway may distinguish these cancers. We also show statins are highly effective and well tolerated in an orthotopic model of myeloma using cells harboring this dysregulation. This determinant of sensitivity further provides molecular rationale for the significant therapeutic index of statins on these tumor cells.","['Clendening, James W', 'Pandyra, Aleksandra', 'Li, Zhihua', 'Boutros, Paul C', 'Martirosyan, Anna', 'Lehner, Richard', 'Jurisica, Igor', 'Trudel, Suzanne', 'Penn, Linda Z']","['Clendening JW', 'Pandyra A', 'Li Z', 'Boutros PC', 'Martirosyan A', 'Lehner R', 'Jurisica I', 'Trudel S', 'Penn LZ']","['Ontario Cancer Institute/Princess Margaret Hospital, Campbell Family Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases)', 'S5UOB36OCZ (Mevalonic Acid)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases/metabolism', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mevalonic Acid/*metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/*metabolism']",,2010/04/03 06:00,2010/07/20 06:00,['2010/04/03 06:00'],"['2010/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34898-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-07-230508 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jun 10;115(23):4787-97. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-07-230508.

To understand interactions between their signaling pathways, we analyzed spontaneous mouse B-LBLs with dual MLV integration into Stat5a and Fiz1 or Stat5a and Hipk2. MLV integration resulted in up-regulation of these genes in lymphoma cells compared with normal pro-B cells from the BM. In lymphomas with both integrations into Stat5a and Fiz1, increases in phosphorylated STAT5A and expression of c-Myc, a target gene of STAT5A, were observed following stimulation of the FLT3. Clones with the dual integrations grew faster in IL-7 and FLT3L-supplemented medium than clones with Stat5a integration alone. On the other hand, in lymphomas with integrations into Stat5a and Hipk2, increases in phosphorylated STAT5A and expression of c-Myc were observed following cross-linking of CD43. In conclusion, FLT3 and CD43 signaling pathways involve STAT5A via Fiz1 and Hipk2 in B-LBLs. Identification of the dual MLV integration sites in B-LBLs, therefore, will provide an excellent tool for identification of the signaling pathways in B-LBLs.","['Tsuruyama, Tatsuaki', 'Imai, Yukiko', 'Takeuchi, Haruya', 'Hiratsuka, Takuya', 'Maruyama, Yasuhiro', 'Kanaya, Kazuya', 'Kaszynski, Richard', 'Jin, Guang', 'Okuno, Tomoko', 'Ozeki, Munetaka', 'Nakamura, Takuro', 'Takakuwa, Tetsuya', 'Manabe, Toshiaki', 'Tamaki, Keiji', 'Hiai, Hiroshi']","['Tsuruyama T', 'Imai Y', 'Takeuchi H', 'Hiratsuka T', 'Maruyama Y', 'Kanaya K', 'Kaszynski R', 'Jin G', 'Okuno T', 'Ozeki M', 'Nakamura T', 'Takakuwa T', 'Manabe T', 'Tamaki K', 'Hiai H']","['Department of Forensic Medicine and Molecular Pathology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan. tsuruyam@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Fiz1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Spn protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat5a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Hipk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*physiology', 'Interleukin-7/*physiology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukosialin/physiology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology/immunology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*physiology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', '*Virus Integration', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/physiology']",,2010/04/03 06:00,2010/07/14 06:00,['2010/04/03 06:00'],"['2010/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['jlb.1109748 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.1109748 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2010 Jul;88(1):107-16. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1109748.

Indeed, a number of these proteins have been shown to have prognostic importance in this disease. The precise ways in which these proteins impact upon CLL and the ways in which they are regulated remain incompletely resolved. However, significant advances have been recently made in our understanding of how these proteins are controlled by genetic, epigenetic and microenvironmental cues. Furthermore, major progress has been made in trying to target these proteins therapeutically. Here we review the current knowledge about this family of apoptosis-regulating proteins and how they impact upon drug resistance and disease progression. We also summarise evolution in the development of Bcl-2 family inhibitors for the treatment of CLL and other cancers.","['Buggins, Andrea G S', 'Pepper, Chris J']","['Buggins AG', 'Pepper CJ']","[""Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College London, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Targeting', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Multigene Family', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/classification/*physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",88,2010/04/03 06:00,2010/06/15 06:00,['2010/04/03 06:00'],"['2010/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/25 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(10)00152-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2010.03.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Jul;34(7):837-42. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2010.03.011.

METHODS: Notch3 expression in cervical cancer was assessed by immunohistochemistry, and data on clinical variables were collected by retrospective chart review. We used dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to analyze DNA copy number alterations in cervical cancer. Inactivation of Notch3 and knocking down Notch3 gene were done using gamma-secretase inhibitor and Notch 3 specific SiRNA to asses Notch3 function in cervical cancer either in vivo or in vitro. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Notch3 was significantly overexpressed in cervical squamous cell carcinomas compared with adenocarcinomas. In contrast to normal cervical tissue and cervical intraepithelial neoplasms [CINs], squamous cell carcinomas demonstrated higher nuclear Notch3 immunoreactivity. Notch3 amplification was not found in any cervical carcinomas using FISH analysis. Notch3 nuclear expression was significantly correlated with Jagged-1, a putative Notch3 ligand, and Pbx1b, a potential Notch3 downstream target (P<0.05).Patients with cervical carcinomas positive for nuclear Notch3 expression had significantly shorter overall survival than their peers whose tumors did not express nuclear Notch3. Inactivation of Notch3 decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in ME180 and SKGIIIb cell lines that overexpressed Notch3. Injection of a gamma-secretase inhibitor into ME180 cell tumors established on mice, demonstrated a reduction in tumor growth. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that Notch3 might play important role for the proliferation and survival of Notch3 overexpressing tumors and that inactivation of Notch3 may represent a new therapeutic avenue for cervical squamous cell carcinomas.","['Yeasmin, Shamima', 'Nakayama, Kentaro', 'Rahman, Mohammed Tanjimur', 'Rahman, Munmun', 'Ishikawa, Masako', 'Iida, Kouji', 'Otsuki, Yoshiro', 'Kobayashi, Hiroshi', 'Nakayama, Satoru', 'Miyazaki, Kohji']","['Yeasmin S', 'Nakayama K', 'Rahman MT', 'Rahman M', 'Ishikawa M', 'Iida K', 'Otsuki Y', 'Kobayashi H', 'Nakayama S', 'Miyazaki K']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shimane University School of Medicine, Shimane, 6938501, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Gynecol Oncol,Gynecologic oncology,0365304,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (JAG1 protein, human)', '0 (Jag1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Jagged-1 Protein)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH3 protein, human)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptor, Notch3)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Serrate-Jagged Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Jagged-1 Protein', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/administration & dosage/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch3', 'Receptors, Notch/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Serrate-Jagged Proteins', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism']",,2010/04/03 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2010/04/03 06:00'],"['2009/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0090-8258(10)00217-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ygyno.2010.03.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Gynecol Oncol. 2010 Jun;117(3):409-16. doi: 10.1016/j.ygyno.2010.03.004.

Recent genetic studies on acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at the single cell level reveal a complex non-linear, branching clonal architecture-with sub-clones having distinctive genetic signatures. Most cancers appropriately interrogated are found to have intra-clonal genetic heterogeneity indicative of divergent clonal evolution. These data further suggest that clonal architecture might be driven by genetic heterogeneity of propagating or 'stem' cells. When assayed for leukaemic regeneration in NOD/SCID/gamma mice, genetically diverse 'stem' cells read-out, broadly reflecting the clonal architecture. This has suggested a 'back to Darwin' model for cancer propagation. In this, cells with self-renewal potency or 'stem-ness' provide genetically diverse units of evolutionary selection in cancer progression.

This study analyzed the genome-wide expression profiles of human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells exposed to VOCs using a 35-K whole human genome oligonucleotide microarray to ascertain potential biomarkers. Genes with a significantly increased expression levels (over 1.5-fold and p-values <0.05) with six VOCs were then classified with gene ontology and KEGG pathway annotation. At IC(20) doses identified genes were functionally categorized as being involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway, whereas exposure at IC(50) doses identified genes associated with the p53 signaling pathway, apoptosis, and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway. Functionally important immune response- and apoptosis-related genes were further validated by real-time RT-PCR. The results showed that IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, USP18, INFGR2, PMAIP1, GADD45A, NFKBIA, TNFAIP3, and BIRC3 genes altered their expression profiles in a dose-dependent manner. Similar expressions profiles were also found in human erythromyeloblastoid leukemia K562 cells and in human leukemic monocyte lymphoma U937 cells.

METHODS: Children with leukemia who were referred to a pain and palliative care clinic attached to the Department of Pediatrics of a medical teaching hospital during a period of 6 months were included in the study. RESULTS: Thirty nine (39) children, who constituted 64% of children on treatment for leukemia, required referral to pain and palliative care services during the study period. Of these 92% had Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) and 8% had Acute Non Lymphocytic Leukemia (ANLL). 95% of children had nociceptive pain and 5% had neuropathic pain. Step - 1 analgesia was effective in 12 (31%) children and 21 (54%) could be managed with Step - 2 analgesia. Step - 3 analgesia was required in only 6 (15%) children. Step 3 analgesia was required in children with neuropathic pain and bone pain. CONCLUSION: WHO analgesic ladder is effective in managing pain in children with leukemia. Majority of cases of cancer pain in children could be managed by the treating physician using non-opioids, weak opioids and adjuvants as per the WHO guidelines. Children with bone pain and neuropathic pain may require referral to specialist services and use of strong opioids like morphine. The study emphasizes the need for establishing specialist pain management services in all centres where children with cancer are treated.","['Geeta, M G', 'Geetha, P', 'Ajithkumar, V T', 'Krishnakumar, P', 'Kumar, K Suresh', 'Mathews, Lulu']","['Geeta MG', 'Geetha P', 'Ajithkumar VT', 'Krishnakumar P', 'Kumar KS', 'Mathews L']","['Department of Pediatrics, Institute of Maternal and Child Health, Medical College, Calicut, Kerala, India, geetakkumar@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Pediatr,Indian journal of pediatrics,0417442,"['0 (Analgesics)', '0 (Analgesics, Opioid)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Analgesia/*methods', 'Analgesics/*therapeutic use', 'Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use', 'Cancer Care Facilities', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Management', 'Female', 'Guideline Adherence', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Pain/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Pain, Intractable/drug therapy', 'Palliative Care/methods', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'World Health Organization']",,2010/04/02 06:00,2010/10/16 06:00,['2010/04/02 06:00'],"['2009/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12098-010-0053-x [doi]'],ppublish,Indian J Pediatr. 2010 Jun;77(6):665-8. doi: 10.1007/s12098-010-0053-x.

Although all RTs have similar catalytic activities, they significantly differ in several aspects of their catalytic properties, their structures and subunit composition. The RT of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), the virus causing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is a prime target for the development of antiretroviral drug therapy of HIV-1/AIDS carriers. Therefore, despite the fundamental contributions of other RTs to the understanding of RTs and retrovirology, most recent RT studies are related to HIV-1 RT. In this review we summarize the basic properties of different RTs. These include, among other topics, their structures, enzymatic activities, interactions with both viral and host proteins, RT inhibition and resistance to antiretroviral drugs.","['Herschhorn, Alon', 'Hizi, Amnon']","['Herschhorn A', 'Hizi A']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, 69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/drug therapy/virology', 'Anti-HIV Agents/therapeutic use', 'HIV/metabolism', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology', 'Models, Molecular', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*enzymology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",201,2010/04/02 06:00,2010/09/14 06:00,['2010/04/02 06:00'],"['2009/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00018-010-0346-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2010 Aug;67(16):2717-47. doi: 10.1007/s00018-010-0346-2.

Free radicals can be important causative agents of a number of human diseases, including cancer and leukaemia. Thus, antioxidants, which control the oxidative stress state, represent a major line of defense for regulating the overall true state of health. The relationship between non-enzymatic antioxidant status and the levels of well-known markers of oxidative stress that are measured as lipid peroxides reflects better health indices. The aim of this study was to evaluate the plasma levels of lipid peroxidation products and non-enzymatic antioxidant status as indices of oxidative stress, disease progression and early responses to chemotherapeutic agents in chronic myeloid leukaemia patients. METHODS: The study included 128 CML patients and 50 age- and gender-matched healthy control volunteers. Indices of oxidative stress were evaluated as lipid peroxidation and non-enzymatic antioxidant status using the spectrophotometric method. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the plasma levels of lipid peroxidation products in CML patients as compared to the healthy volunteers. The plasma levels of lipid peroxidation products continued to rise significantly as the disease progressed. The non-enzymatic antioxidant status was found to be significantly decreased in CML patients as compared to the healthy participants. The plasma levels of non-enzymatic antioxidant status continued to decrease significantly during the disease progression. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that plasma lipid peroxidation and non-enzymatic antioxidant status reflect oxidative stress in CML patients, and may be used as indices for oxidative stress, disease progression and early responses to different therapeutic modalities.","['Ahmad, R', 'Tripathi, A K', 'Tripathi, P', 'Singh, R', 'Singh, S', 'Singh, R K']","['Ahmad R', 'Tripathi AK', 'Tripathi P', 'Singh R', 'Singh S', 'Singh RK']","['Department of Biochemistry, Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj Medical University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Singapore,Singapore Med J,Singapore medical journal,0404516,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antioxidants/*metabolism', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Glutathione/*blood', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/drug therapy', '*Lipid Peroxidation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*blood']",,2010/04/02 06:00,2010/07/09 06:00,['2010/04/02 06:00'],"['2010/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Singapore Med J. 2010 Feb;51(2):110-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is thought to contribute to pathogenesis of many different tumors, including ovarian carcinoma and pancreatic, breast and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Selectively depleted Foxp3-expressing cells with anit-CD25 antibodies or vaccination of Foxp3 mRNA-transfected dendritic cells engender protective immunity against tumor. This study targeted silencing Foxp3 gene expression using RNA interference (RNAi) delivered by a lentiviral vector to evaluate the therapeutic role of Foxp3 short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in a murine model of leukemia. RLmale symbol1, a mouse CD4(+)CD25(+) leukemia cell with Foxp3 expression, was used as the leukemia animal model. By infecting RLmale symbol1 cells with Lenti-Foxp3-siRNA, we reduced Foxp3 gene expression and the suppressive function of CD4(+)CD25(-) effector cells stimulated with ConA. Moreover, lentiviral-mediated Foxp3 RNAi transduced into RLmale symbol1 cell or injected into the tumor showed suppressive effects on tumor growth and prolonged the survival of tumor-transplanted mice. However, this suppressive effect was abrogated in NOD-SCID mice transplanted with Lenti-Foxp3-siRNA-infected RLmale symbol1 cells. In conclusion, inhibiting Foxp3 gene expression by shRNAs effectively decreases tumor growth of Treg cell-like leukemia. The results may provide a novel strategy for future immunotherapy against cancers.","['Tsai, B-Y', 'Suen, J-L', 'Chiang, B-L']","['Tsai BY', 'Suen JL', 'Chiang BL']","['Graduate Institute of Immunology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxp3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*therapy', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA Stability']",,2010/04/02 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2010/04/02 06:00'],"['2010/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['gt201038 [pii]', '10.1038/gt.2010.38 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2010 Aug;17(8):972-9. doi: 10.1038/gt.2010.38.

Here, we sought to determine which major chemoattractant present in peripheral blood (PB) is responsible for the egress of HSPCs from the bone marrow (BM). We noticed that normal and mobilized plasma strongly chemoattracts HSPCs in a stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)-independent manner because (i) plasma SDF-1 level does not correlate with mobilization efficiency; (ii) the chemotactic plasma gradient is not affected in the presence of AMD3100 and (iii) it is resistant to denaturation by heat. Surprisingly, the observed loss of plasma chemotactic activity after charcoal stripping suggested the involvement of bioactive lipids and we focused on sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a known chemoattracant of HSPCs. We found that S1P (i) creates in plasma a continuously present gradient for BM-residing HSPCs; (ii) is at physiologically relevant concentrations a chemoattractant several magnitudes stronger than SDF-1 and (iii) its plasma level increases during mobilization due to CC activation and interaction of the membrane attack complex (MAC) with erythrocytes that are a major reservoir of S1P. We conclude and propose a new paradigm that S1P is a crucial chemoattractant for BM-residing HSPCs and that CC through MAC induces the release of S1P from erythrocytes for optimal egress/mobilization of HSPCs.","['Ratajczak, M Z', 'Lee, H', 'Wysoczynski, M', 'Wan, W', 'Marlicz, W', 'Laughlin, M J', 'Kucia, M', 'Janowska-Wieczorek, A', 'Ratajczak, J']","['Ratajczak MZ', 'Lee H', 'Wysoczynski M', 'Wan W', 'Marlicz W', 'Laughlin MJ', 'Kucia M', 'Janowska-Wieczorek A', 'Ratajczak J']","['Stem Cell Biology Program at the James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA. mzrata01@louisville.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Complement C5)', '0 (Complement Membrane Attack Complex)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-HIV Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzylamines', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', '*Cell Movement', 'Chemokine CXCL12/blood', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Complement Activation', 'Complement C5/*physiology', 'Complement Membrane Attack Complex/*metabolism', 'Cyclams', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/metabolism', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/pharmacology', 'Hot Temperature', 'Lysophospholipids/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",,2010/04/02 06:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2010/04/02 06:00'],"['2010/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201053 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.53 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 May;24(5):976-85. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.53.

EVI1+ was found in 20/213 (9%) of children with de novo AML, and in 4/8 with secondary AML. It was predominantly found in MLL-rearranged AML (13/47), monosomy 7 (2/3), or FAB M6/7 (6/10), and mutually exclusive with core-binding factor AML, t(15;17), and NPM1 mutations. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed to detect cryptic 3q26 abnormalities. However, none of the EVI1+ patients harbored structural 3q26 alterations.

We conclude that EVI1+ can be found in approximately 10% of pediatric AML. Although EVI1+ was not an independent prognostic factor, it was predominantly found in subtypes of pediatric AML that are related with an intermediate to unfavorable prognosis. Further research should explain the role of EVI1+ in disease biology in these cases.

Deregulation of the T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 (TCL1) oncogene in mouse B cells causes a CD5-positive leukemia similar to aggressive human B-CLLs. We recently reported that levels of TCL1 expression in B-CLL are regulated by miR-29 and miR-181 that target 3' UTR of TCL1. To determine whether treatment with microRNAs targeting TCL1 can inhibit B-CLL in mice, we generated TCL1 transgenic mice using a construct containing the 3' and 5' UTRs of TCL1 under B-cell-specific Emicro promoter (Emicro-TCL1FL). At the age of 16-20 months, these mice showed B-CLL-like disease. Immunophenotyping revealed accumulation of CD5+CD23+B220+ population in spleens and lymph nodes. Our results show that CD5+CD23+ B-cell populations from Emicro-TCL1FL mice actively proliferate and show significantly increased levels of phospho-Akt. Emicro-TCL1FL mice showed immunological abnormalities similar to human B-CLL, including hypoimmunoglobulinemia, abnormal levels of cytokines and impaired immune response. These findings revealed biochemical and immunological similarities between Tcl1-driven B-CLL in mice and human B-CLL.","['Efanov, A', 'Zanesi, N', 'Nazaryan, N', 'Santanam, U', 'Palamarchuk, A', 'Croce, C M', 'Pekarsky, Y']","['Efanov A', 'Zanesi N', 'Nazaryan N', 'Santanam U', 'Palamarchuk A', 'Croce CM', 'Pekarsky Y']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, Human Cancer Genetics Program and Comprehensive Cancer Center, OSU School of Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", ""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Cd5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", ""5' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD5 Antigens/*metabolism', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MicroRNAs/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spleen/metabolism/pathology']",,2010/04/02 06:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2010/04/02 06:00'],"['2010/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201046 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.46 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 May;24(5):970-5. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.46.

AID-transgenic mice develop T-lymphoma, indicating that constitutive expression of AID leads to tumorigenesis. Here, we transplanted mouse bone marrow cells transduced with AID. Twenty-four of the 32 recipient mice developed T-lymphoma 2-4 months after the transplantation. Surprisingly, unlike AID-transgenic mice, seven recipients developed B-leukemia/lymphoma with longer latencies. None of the mice suffered from myeloid leukemia. When we used nude mice as recipients, they developed only B-leukemia/lymphoma, presumably due to lack of thymus. Analysis of AID mutants suggested that an intact form with SHM activity is required for maximum ability of AID to induce lymphoma. Except for a K-ras active mutant in one case, specific mutations could not be identified in T-lymphoma; however, Notch1 was constitutively activated in most cases. Importantly, truncations of Ebf1 or Pax5 were observed in B-leukemia/lymphoma. In conclusion, this is the first report on the potential of AID overexpression to promote B-cell lymphomagenesis in a mouse model. Aberrant expression of AID in bone marrow cells induced leukemia/lymphoma in a cell-lineage-dependent manner, mainly through its function as a mutator.","['Komeno, Y', 'Kitaura, J', 'Watanabe-Okochi, N', 'Kato, N', 'Oki, T', 'Nakahara, F', 'Harada, Y', 'Harada, H', 'Shinkura, R', 'Nagaoka, H', 'Hayashi, Y', 'Honjo, T', 'Kitamura, T']","['Komeno Y', 'Kitaura J', 'Watanabe-Okochi N', 'Kato N', 'Oki T', 'Nakahara F', 'Harada Y', 'Harada H', 'Shinkura R', 'Nagaoka H', 'Hayashi Y', 'Honjo T', 'Kitamura T']","['Division of Cellular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (AICDA (activation-induced cytidine deaminase))', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*physiology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*etiology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2010/04/02 06:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2010/04/02 06:00'],"['2010/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201040 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.40 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 May;24(5):1018-24. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.40.

RESULTS: Recurring aberrations, observed in 123 (75%) patients, included hyperdiploidy (n=68, 41%), tetraploidy (n=12, 7.3%), hypodiploidy (n=2, 1.2%), TEL-AML1 fusion (n=11, 7%), mixed-lineage leukemia rearrangement (n=6, 3.6%), t(9;22) (n=4, 2.4%), t(1;19) (n=3, 1.8%), t(8;14) or t(8;22) (n=2, 1.2%), +21 (n=2, 1.2%), del(6) (n=2, 1.2%) and miscellaneous abnormalities (n=9, 5%). The highest observed numerical chromosome abnormality was high hyperdiploidy in 89 patients (54%) with abnormal karyotype while the TEL-AML fusion was the highest observed structural abnormality.

CD74 was recently shown to serve as a survival receptor on CLL cells. In this study, we show that stimulation of CD74 with its natural ligand, migration inhibitory factor, initiates a signaling cascade that results in upregulation of TAp63, which directly regulates CLL survival. In addition, TAp63 expression elevates the expression of the integrin VLA-4, particularly during the advanced stage of the disease. Blocking of CD74, TAp63, or VLA-4 inhibits the in vivo homing of CLL cells to the bone marrow (BM). Thus, CD74 and its target genes TAp63 and VLA-4 facilitate migration of CLL cells back to the BM, where they interact with the supportive BM environment that rescues them from apoptosis. These results could form the basis of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking homing of CLL cells in their return to the BM and attenuating their survival.","['Binsky, Inbal', 'Lantner, Frida', 'Grabovsky, Valentin', 'Harpaz, Nurit', 'Shvidel, Lev', 'Berrebi, Alain', 'Goldenberg, David M', 'Leng, Lin', 'Bucala, Richard', 'Alon, Ronen', 'Haran, Michal', 'Shachar, Idit']","['Binsky I', 'Lantner F', 'Grabovsky V', 'Harpaz N', 'Shvidel L', 'Berrebi A', 'Goldenberg DM', 'Leng L', 'Bucala R', 'Alon R', 'Haran M', 'Shachar I']","['Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Blocking)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors)', '0 (TP63 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (invariant chain)', 'EC 5.3.- (Intramolecular Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 5.3.2.1 (MIF protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Blocking/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology/*pathology', 'Cell Migration Inhibition/immunology', 'Cell Movement/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Survival/genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Intramolecular Oxidoreductases/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/*pathology', 'Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Middle Aged', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Trans-Activators/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation/immunology']",,2010/04/02 06:00,2010/07/02 06:00,['2010/04/02 06:00'],"['2010/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0904149 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0904149 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2010 May 1;184(9):4761-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0904149.

This is believed to occur as a result of iatrogenic immunosuppression leading to a relaxation of T-cell control of EBV infection and thus allowing viral reactivation and proliferation of EBV-infected B-lymphocytes. In support of this notion, reduction of immunosuppressive therapy may lead to regression of PTLD.We present a case of an 18-year-old male developing a monomorphic B-cell PTLD 2 months after receiving an allogenic stem cell transplant for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Reduction of immunosuppressive therapy led to regression of lymphadenopathy. Nevertheless, the patient died 3 months afterwards due to extensive graft-vs.-host-disease and sepsis. As a diagnostic lymph node biopsy was performed only after reduction of immunosuppressive therapy, we are able to study the histopathological changes characterizing PTLD regression. We observed extensive apoptosis of blast cells, accompanied by an abundant infiltrate comprising predominantly CD8-positive, Granzyme B-positive T-cells. This observation supports the idea that regression of PTLD is mediated by cytotoxic T-cells and is in keeping with the observation that T-cell depletion, represents a major risk factor for the development of PTLD.","['Krenauer, Alexander', 'Moll, Alexander', 'Ponisch, Wolfram', 'Schmitz, Nicole', 'Niedobitek, Gerald', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Aigner, Thomas']","['Krenauer A', 'Moll A', 'Ponisch W', 'Schmitz N', 'Niedobitek G', 'Niederwieser D', 'Aigner T']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Leipzig, Liebigstrasse 26, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Diagn Pathol,Diagnostic pathology,101251558,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*virology', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*etiology/immunology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology/pathology/*virology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/immunology/pathology/*virology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/virology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Virus Activation']",,2010/04/02 06:00,2010/04/02 06:01,['2010/04/02 06:00'],"['2009/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/02 06:01 [medline]']","['1746-1596-5-21 [pii]', '10.1186/1746-1596-5-21 [doi]']",epublish,Diagn Pathol. 2010 Mar 31;5:21. doi: 10.1186/1746-1596-5-21.,,,,20100331,PMC2853499,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20100609'],,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Immunohistochemistry for LRP16 was performed in 201 cases of colorectal carcinoma and 60 cases of distal normal mucosa. Medical records were reviewed and clinicopathological analysis was performed. RESULTS: LRP16 expression was detected in 117 of 201 cases of the colorectal carcinoma and in 21 cases of 60 distal normal mucosa. The expression of LRP16 in carcinoma was significantly higher than that in normal mucosa (chi(2) = 9.999, P = 0.002). LRP16 protein expression was found in 43.3% (52/120) of carcinoma at stage I and II, and 80.2% (65/81) of carcinoma at stage III and IV (chi(2) =27.088, P = 0.001). Correlation between LRP16 expression and clinicopathological factors was significant in differentiation (P = 0.010), tumor size (P = 0.001), infiltrative depth (P = 0.000) and distant metastasis (P = 0.027). The difference of median survival time between cancer patients with LRP16 expression (38.0 mo) and those without was statistically significant (105.0 mo, Log rank = 41.455, P = 0.001). The multivariate survival analysis revealed that LRP16 expression was correlated significantly (Cox's regression: P = 0.001, relative risk = 2.082) with shortened survival in the patients with colorectal cancer.

In this study, we investigated the effect of acteoside extracted from CISTANCHE TUBULOSA (Schrenk) R. Wight on the basophilic cell-mediated allergic reaction. The effect of acteoside on beta-hexosaminidase release and intracellular [Ca (2+)] I level from rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells was determined. Also, ELISA was used to determine the level of histamine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- alpha, and interleukin (IL)-4 on human basophilic (KU812) cells. The effect of acteoside on basophilic cell viability was determined using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazolyl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. These results indicated that 0.1-10.0 microg/mL acteoside inhibits the release of beta-hexosaminidase and [Ca (2+)] I influx from IgE-mediated RBL-2H3 cells. Moreover, acteoside inhibited histamine release, TNF- alpha, and IL-4 production in a dose-dependent manner from calcium ionophore A23187 plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or compound 48/80-stimulated KU812 cells.

Simvastatin single also had little pro-apoptotic effect on the CD34+ cells. In contrast, combination of simvastatin and imatinib induced a significant cell death in the subpopulation, which is dependent on the induced ROS by simvastatin as the effect was blocked by ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L: -cysteine (NAC). Our data here point out that combination of simvastatin and imatinib could be a therapeutic option for the resistant CML.","['Chen, Rui', 'Xiao, Wei', 'Li, Ding', 'Mu, Shijie']","['Chen R', 'Xiao W', 'Li D', 'Mu S']","[""Department of Blood Transfusion, Xijing Hospital, The Fourth Military Medical University, 710032, Xi'an, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'AGG2FN16EV (Simvastatin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Simvastatin/*administration & dosage']",,2010/04/01 06:00,2011/10/04 06:00,['2010/04/01 06:00'],"['2010/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-010-9472-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2011 Jun;28(2):528-31. doi: 10.1007/s12032-010-9472-9.

In this study, FLT3/ITD and FLT3/D835 mutations were analyzed in 133 patients with de novo AML with normal cytogenetics by genomic PCR assay. Of 133 patients with AML with normal cytogenetics, FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) and FLT3/D835 mutations were detected in 27 (20%) and 4 (3%) samples, respectively. Although statistically insignificant, the frequency of FLT3/ITD was higher in >15 year age group when compared to <15 year group (23 vs. 13%, P = 0.2). The white blood count was found to be significantly higher in patients with FLT3/ITD mutation when compared to those without the mutation (40 x 10(9)/L vs. 20 x 10(9)/L, P = < 0.002) or those with FLT3/D835 mutations (30 x 10(9)/l). Aberrant expression of CD7 was observed more frequently in patients with FLT3/ITD mutation (P < 0.002). There was no significant difference in the response rate to chemotherapy in patients with or without FLT3/ITD mutation (67 and 64%, respectively). FLT3/ITD mutation was found to be associated with the age, leukocytosis and aberrant expression of CD7, although no influence of FLT3/ITD mutation was seen on the clinical outcome of AML patients with normal cytogenetics.","['Chauhan, Pradeep S', 'Bhushan, Bharat', 'Mishra, Ashwani K', 'Singh, Laishram C', 'Saluja, Sumita', 'Verma, Saurabh', 'Gupta, Dipendra K', 'Mittal, Vishakha', 'Chaudhry, Sumita', 'Kapur, Sujala']","['Chauhan PS', 'Bhushan B', 'Mishra AK', 'Singh LC', 'Saluja S', 'Verma S', 'Gupta DK', 'Mittal V', 'Chaudhry S', 'Kapur S']","['Institute of Pathology, ICMR, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Separation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,2010/04/01 06:00,2011/10/04 06:00,['2010/04/01 06:00'],"['2010/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-010-9485-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2011 Jun;28(2):544-51. doi: 10.1007/s12032-010-9485-4.

An important element of vector design is the selection and evaluation of promoter-enhancer elements with sufficient strength to drive reliable immune reconstitution, but minimal propensity for enhancer-mediated insertional mutagenesis. In this study, we set out to explore the effect of promoter-enhancer selection on the efficacy and safety of human immunodeficiency virus-1-derived lentiviral vectors in gammac-deficient mice. We observed incomplete or absent T- and B-cell development in mice transplanted with progenitors expressing gammac from the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) and Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) promoters, respectively. In contrast, functional T- and B-cell compartments were restored in mice receiving an equivalent vector containing the elongation factor-1-alpha (EF1alpha) promoter; however, 4 of 14 mice reconstituted with this vector subsequently developed lymphoma. Extensive analyses failed to implicate insertional mutagenesis or gammac overexpression as the underlying mechanism. These findings highlight the need for detailed mechanistic analysis of tumor readouts in preclinical animal models assessing vector safety, and suggest the existence of other ill-defined risk factors for oncogenesis, including replicative stress, in gene therapy protocols targeting the hematopoietic compartment.","['Ginn, Samantha L', 'Liao, Sophia H Y', 'Dane, Allison P', 'Hu, Min', 'Hyman, Jessica', 'Finnie, John W', 'Zheng, Maolin', 'Cavazzana-Calvo, Marina', 'Alexander, Stephen I', 'Thrasher, Adrian J', 'Alexander, Ian E']","['Ginn SL', 'Liao SH', 'Dane AP', 'Hu M', 'Hyman J', 'Finnie JW', 'Zheng M', 'Cavazzana-Calvo M', 'Alexander SI', 'Thrasher AJ', 'Alexander IE']","[""Gene Therapy Research Unit of the Children's Medical Research Institute and The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,['0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Therapy/adverse effects', 'Genetic Vectors/adverse effects/genetics', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/genetics/*physiology', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*etiology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, SCID', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'X-Linked Combined Immunodeficiency Diseases/genetics/*therapy']",,2010/04/01 06:00,2010/07/31 06:00,['2010/04/01 06:00'],"['2010/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)31027-9 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2010.50 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2010 May;18(5):965-76. doi: 10.1038/mt.2010.50.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical histories of 2 patients whose conditions were diagnosed with myeloid sarcoma of the vagina were obtained from their medical records. RESULTS: Case 1: A 77-year-old woman with no systemic illnesses presented with a vaginal lump. Clinically, there was a 6-cm periurethral mass that was examined by biopsy. The histopathologic specimen was evaluated on routine and immunohistochemical stains, and myeloid sarcoma was diagnosed after extensive immunohistochemical analysis. The patient was treated with pelvic radiation. She developed extensive myeloid sarcoma of the skin and AML 4.5 months later; she died 2 weeks later, 5 months after the initial presentation. Case 2: A 36-year-old woman with a known history of AML who has had multiple leukemic and extramedullary recurrences presented with a pelvic mass. Physical findings revealed large masses in the vagina and rectovaginal septum, which were confirmed as myeloid sarcoma after biopsy and histologic examination. The patient was treated with pelvic/vaginal radiation. Five months later, she had another leukemic relapse and died within 1 day of palliative chemotherapy.

Because the transcription factor NF-kappaB has been linked with inflammation, survival, proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis in tumors, we hypothesized that noscapine mediates its effects by modulating the NF-kappaB activation pathway. We found that noscapine potentiates apoptosis induced by cytokines and chemotherapeutic agents in tumor cells. Noscapine alone suppressed proliferation of human leukemia and myeloma cells and downregulated the constitutive expression of cell survival proteins. Noscapine also abrogated the inducible expression of proteins involved in survival, proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis, all of which are regulated by NF-kappaB. Noscapine suppressed both inducible and constitutive NF-kappaB activation in tumor cells through inhibition of IkappaB kinase, leading to inhibition of phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha. Noscapine also suppressed phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65, leading to inhibition of NF-kappaB reporter activity induced by various components of the NF-kappaB activation pathway. Activity of the NF-kappaB-containing cyclooxygenase-2 promoter was also inhibited by noscapine. Thus, noscapine inhibits the proliferation of leukemia cells and sensitizes them to tumor necrosis factor and chemotherapeutic agents by suppressing the NF-kappaB signaling pathway.","['Sung, Bokyung', 'Ahn, Kwang Seok', 'Aggarwal, Bharat B']","['Sung B', 'Ahn KS', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antitussive Agents)', '0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '8V32U4AOQU (Noscapine)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Antitussive Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzylisoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Noscapine/*pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction']",,2010/04/01 06:00,2010/04/29 06:00,['2010/04/01 06:00'],"['2010/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/29 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-4230 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-4230 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Apr 15;70(8):3259-68. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-4230.

Although mutations in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene can give rise to therapy resistance in vitro, acquired somatic mutations in the GR are rarely encountered in patients. Here we report that the protein encoded by the BTG1 gene, which is frequently deleted in (pediatric) ALL, is a key determinant of GC responsiveness. Using RNA interference, we show that loss of BTG1 expression causes GC resistance both by decimating GR expression and by controlling GR-mediated transcription. Conversely, reexpression of BTG1 restores GC sensitivity by potentiating GC-induced GR expression, a phenomenon known as GR autoinduction. In addition, the arginine methyltransferase PRMT1, a BTG1-binding partner and transcriptional coactivator, is recruited to the GR gene promoter in a BTG1-dependent manner. These results implicate the BTG1/PRMT1 complex in GR-mediated gene expression and reveal that deregulation of a nuclear receptor coactivator complex can give rise to GC resistance. Further characterization of this complex as part of the GR regulatory circuitry could offer novel opportunities for improving the efficacy of GC-based therapies in ALL and other hematologic malignancies.","['van Galen, Joost C', 'Kuiper, Roland P', 'van Emst, Liesbeth', 'Levers, Marloes', 'Tijchon, Esther', 'Scheijen, Blanca', 'Waanders, Esme', 'van Reijmersdal, Simon V', 'Gilissen, Christian', 'van Kessel, Ad Geurts', 'Hoogerbrugge, Peter M', 'van Leeuwen, Frank N']","['van Galen JC', 'Kuiper RP', 'van Emst L', 'Levers M', 'Tijchon E', 'Scheijen B', 'Waanders E', 'van Reijmersdal SV', 'Gilissen C', 'van Kessel AG', 'Hoogerbrugge PM', 'van Leeuwen FN']","['Department of Pediatrics, Laboratory of Pediatric Oncology, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '146835-72-5 (BTG1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (PRMT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glucocorticoids/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multiprotein Complexes/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/agonists/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/genetics']",,2010/04/01 06:00,2010/07/20 06:00,['2010/04/01 06:00'],"['2010/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34900-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-05-223081 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jun 10;115(23):4810-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-05-223081.

Recently, cyclin-dependent kinases 7, 8, and 9 have been shown to regulate transcription through phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II. B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, rely on the expression of transcripts with a short half-life, such as Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and XIAP, for survival. Here, we describe the characterization of AT7519 in leukemia cell lines, and compare and contrast the response in cell lines derived from solid tumors. Finally, we use these mechanistic insights to show activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from 16 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. AT7519 induced apoptosis at concentrations of 100 to 700 nmol/L and was equally effective regardless of Rai stage or known prognostic markers. Short-term treatments (4-6 hours) resulted in inhibition of phosphorylation of the transcriptional marker RNA polymerase II and downregulation of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, with no effect on either XIAP or Bcl-2 levels.

Nevertheless, its apoptosis-related molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we first investigated the molecular mechanisms by which ION sensitizes cancer cells to the therapeutic potential of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Notably, treatment with subtoxic concentrations of ION and TRAIL effectively inhibited cell viability in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Hep3B and other cancer cell lines such as colon carcinoma cell line HCT116 and leukemia cell line U937. Combined treatment with ION and TRAIL was also more effective in inducing DR5 expression, caspase activities, and apoptosis than treatment with either agent alone. ION-mediated sensitization to TRAIL was efficiently reduced by treatment with a chimeric blocking antibody or small interfering RNA specific for DR5. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that ION treatment upregulates the binding of transcription factor Sp1 to its putative site within the DR5 promoter region, suggesting that Sp1 is an ION-responsive transcription factor. In addition, ION significantly increased hepatocellular carcinoma cell sensitivity to TRAIL by abrogating TRAIL-induced NF-kappaB activation and decreasing the expression of antiapoptotic proteins such as XIAP and IAP-1/2. Taken together, these data suggest that ION is a useful agent for TRAIL-based cancer treatments. Mol Cancer Ther; 9(4); 833-43.

Recent data give evidence for the prognostic relevance of the percentage of smudge cells in B-CLL. In our study we analysed the prognostic potential of this novel marker in a cohort of 100 CLL patients. The percentage of smudge cells ranged from 0% to 70% (median 21%). Patients with <or=20% smudge cells (according to ROC analysis) had a significantly shorter time to first treatment and overall survival than patients with >20% smudge cells. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified percentages of smudge cells, stage according to Binet and CD38 expression as independent prognostic markers. The percentage of smudge cells was significantly lower in CD38+, ZAP-70+ and unmutated IgVH patients. Combined analysis of smudge cell percentages with CD38 expression provided complementary prognostic information identifying three patient subgroups with good, intermediate and poor prognosis. Comparing gene expression profiles in a subset of 12 patients we identified eight differentially expressed genes in groups with high vs. low percentage of smudge cells suggesting a role of these differentially expressed genes, especially for Tribbles homolog 2 (Trib2), in the disease progression of high risk CLL patients. In conclusion, our data confirm previous studies showing that the simple and inexpensive microscopic detection of smudge cells on blood smears prepared for routine diagnostic purposes is a novel independent factor predicting overall survival in CLL.","['Johansson, P', 'Eisele, L', 'Klein-Hitpass, L', 'Sellmann, L', 'Duhrsen, U', 'Durig, J', 'Nuckel, H']","['Johansson P', 'Eisele L', 'Klein-Hitpass L', 'Sellmann L', 'Duhrsen U', 'Durig J', 'Nuckel H']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Vimentin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (TRIB2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/blood', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Cell Death', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Diagnostic Tests, Routine', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/blood/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/blood/genetics/physiology', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vimentin/blood/physiology', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/blood']",,2010/04/01 06:00,2010/06/15 06:00,['2010/04/01 06:00'],"['2009/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2010/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(10)00141-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2010.02.038 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Jul;34(7):892-8. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2010.02.038.

Nevertheless, conflicting data still exist as to its influence on graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) incidence, relapse rate, and survival. To further investigate the relevance of ABO major mismatch on transplantation outcome, we retrospectively analyzed results from 414 patients with major or major/minor ABO-mismatched bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood (PB), and cord blood (CB) allogeneic HSCT. Transplantation outcome was assessed by comparison with results from a 395-patient ABO-compatible population with similar characteristics. Median time to red cell transfusion independence was significantly longer in ABO-incompatible BM recipients (median time, 63 days vs 41 days; P =.001), with faster disappearance of antidonor IgM hemagglutinins in unrelated recipients (median time, 36 days vs 44 days; P = .03) and in patients with grade > or =II acute GVHD (aGVHD) (median time, 35 days vs 59 days ; P = .001). In PB stem cell (PBSC) and CB transplantation, erythroid reconstitution was not significantly delayed, regardless of donor type or presence of aGVHD. A slight correlation between ABO incompatibility and GVHD incidence was found in PBSC recipients when considering grade > or =II aGVHD incidence (63% in ABO-matched HSCT vs 83% in ABO-mismatched HSCT; P = .055), but this was not confirmed in multivariate analysis. In patients with acute leukemia, multivariate analysis revealed an association between major ABO mismatch and decreased relapse rate with borderline statistical significance (hazard ratio, 0.65; P = .04). Major ABO incompatibility mainly, if not exclusively, affects red blood cell engraftment after BM transplantation. Somewhat surprisingly, the graft-versus-plasma cell effect seems to be confined to this stem cell source.","['Blin, Nicolas', 'Traineau, Richard', 'Houssin, Stephanie', 'Peffault de Latour, Regis', 'Petropoulou, Anna', 'Robin, Marie', 'Larghero, Jerome', 'Ribaud, Patricia', 'Socie, Gerard']","['Blin N', 'Traineau R', 'Houssin S', 'Peffault de Latour R', 'Petropoulou A', 'Robin M', 'Larghero J', 'Ribaud P', 'Socie G']","['AP-HP, Saint Louis University Hospital, Hematology Department-Transplant Unit, 1 Avenue Claude Vellefaux, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)'],IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/*immunology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Blood Group Incompatibility', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2010/04/01 06:00,2011/01/05 06:00,['2010/04/01 06:00'],"['2009/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00139-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.03.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2010 Sep;16(9):1315-23. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.03.021.

We further reveal that reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially superoxide radicals, play a crucial role in selenite-induced MnSOD upregulation, with extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) and p53 closely implicated. Specifically, ERK2 translocates into the nucleus driven by ROS, where it directly phosphorylates p53, leading to dissociation of p53 from its inhibitory protein mouse double minute 2 (MDM2). Active p53 directly mediates the expression of MnSOD, serving as the link between ERK2 translocation and MnSOD upregulation.","['Li, Zhushi', 'Shi, Kejian', 'Guan, Liying', 'Cao, Tingming', 'Jiang, Qian', 'Yang, Yang', 'Xu, Caimin']","['Li Z', 'Shi K', 'Guan L', 'Cao T', 'Jiang Q', 'Yang Y', 'Xu C']","['National Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'HIW548RQ3W (Sodium Selenite)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Protein Transport/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Sodium Selenite/*pharmacology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2010/04/01 06:00,2010/06/24 06:00,['2010/04/01 06:00'],"['2010/01/01 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/25 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-5793(10)00260-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.febslet.2010.03.040 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2010 Jun 3;584(11):2291-7. doi: 10.1016/j.febslet.2010.03.040.

Studies have shown that NP can play a role in the development of the nervous system, as well as affect adipogenesis and fat cell function. However, the signaling mechanisms utilized by NP in adipocytes have not been examined. In our present studies, we demonstrate that NP-induced activation of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation is independent of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) phosphorylation and degradation. Although it is widely accepted that NP signals via the LIFR, our studies reveal that NP results in phosphorylation of gp130, but not LIFR.

Epiblasts formed OCs consisting of a central core of epiblast-like cells with a basal plate of flattened cells extending outwards from the core. The cells of the core showed nuclear octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) staining, indicating an epiblast origin, and some also stained positive for cytoplasmic vimentin. Adjacent cells were linked by tight junctions towards the surface of the colony and rested on a basal lamina. The cells of the basal plate predominantly stained for alpha1-fetoprotein (AFP), indicative of a possible hypoblast origin. Only a few cells scattered within the basal plate exhibited cytokeratin 8 staining, indicating a trophectoderm nature.

METHODS: We studied this relation in the Modena and Reggio Emilia municipalities of northern Italy, identifying the corridors along high voltage power lines with calculated magnetic field intensity in the 0.1-<0.2, 0.2-<0.4, and > or = 0.4 microTesla ranges. We identified 64 cases of newly-diagnosed hematological malignancies in children aged <14 within these municipalities from 1986 to 2007, and we sampled four matched controls for each case, collecting information on historical residence and parental socioeconomic status of these subjects. RESULTS: Relative risk of leukemia associated with antecedent residence in the area with exposure > or = 0.1 microTesla was 3.2 (6.7 adjusting for socioeconomic status), but this estimate was statistically very unstable, its 95% confidence interval being 0.4-23.4, and no indication of a dose-response relation emerged. Relative risk for acute lymphoblastic leukemia was 5.3 (95% confidence interval 0.7-43.5), while there was no increased risk for the other hematological malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: Though the number of exposed children in this study was too low to allow firm conclusions, results were more suggestive of an excess risk of leukemia among exposed children than of a null relation.","['Malagoli, Carlotta', 'Fabbi, Sara', 'Teggi, Sergio', 'Calzari, Mariagiulia', 'Poli, Maurizio', 'Ballotti, Elena', 'Notari, Barbara', 'Bruni, Maurizio', 'Palazzi, Giovanni', 'Paolucci, Paolo', 'Vinceti, Marco']","['Malagoli C', 'Fabbi S', 'Teggi S', 'Calzari M', 'Poli M', 'Ballotti E', 'Notari B', 'Bruni M', 'Palazzi G', 'Paolucci P', 'Vinceti M']","['CREAGEN-Environmental, Genetic and Nutritional Epidemiology Research Center, Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, via Campi 287, 41125 Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Environ Health,Environmental health : a global access science source,101147645,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', '*Electric Wiring', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Risk Assessment']",,2010/04/01 06:00,2010/07/30 06:00,['2010/04/01 06:00'],"['2009/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-069X-9-16 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-069X-9-16 [doi]']",epublish,Environ Health. 2010 Mar 30;9:16. doi: 10.1186/1476-069X-9-16.,,,,20100330,PMC2856548,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The thyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 was used as a marker of an activation status of STAT proteins. We demonstrate that in growing culture of K562 both STAT3 and STAT5 are constitutively activated. To determine the significance of STATs activity in maintaining the high level of K562 proliferation we tested two JAK inhibitors: AG-490 (JAK2 and JAK3 inhibitor) and WHI-P131 (a new specific JAK3 inhibitor). We showed that in long-tern cultures (48 h) of K562 cells with AG-490 or WHI-P132 the cells remain viable. It was found that treatment with WHI-P131 (30-100 microM) decreased the thyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 being without effect on the high level of STAT3 phosphorylation. In proliferating K562 cells, AG-490 (25-50 microM) did not influence STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation. The flow cytometry analysis revealed a dose-dependent decrease in G1 and S phases and an increase in G2/M phases in WHI-P131-treated K562 cell cultures and no changes in cell cycle structure in AG-490-treated cells. Thus, our findings indicate a preferential role for STAT5 (not constitutively active STAT3) in proliferation of leukemia to other JAK drugs which stimulate apoptosis and decrease proliferation, WHI-P131 prevents K562 cells growth by arresting in G2/M phases of cell cycle.","['Mitiushova, E V', 'Aksenov, N D', 'Marakhova, I I']","['Mitiushova EV', 'Aksenov ND', 'Marakhova II']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Russia (Federation),Tsitologiia,Tsitologiia,0417363,"['0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (WHI P131)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'K562 Cells', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology']",,2010/04/01 06:00,2010/05/11 06:00,['2010/04/01 06:00'],"['2010/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Tsitologiia. 2010;52(2):184-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we report a case of Aspergillus liver abscesses in a patient with acute monoblastic leukemia. The patient presented with febrile neutropenia and concomitantly with an elevated serum beta-D: -glucan level during chemotherapy. The abscesses were finally diagnosed by liver biopsy. Although antifungal monotherapy of voriconazole or liposomal amphotericin B, both of which are recommended for invasive aspergillosis, showed a poor response, when combined with micafungin, an echinocandin, both had a highly favorable effect against the infection. Therefore, our clinical experience suggests that the serum test is useful for the rapid diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis, especially in deep tissues, and that combination antifungal therapy with micafungin should be considered when initial monotherapy for fungal infection shows an insufficient effect.","['Yamada, Rie', 'Horikawa, Kentaro', 'Ishihara, Sonoko', 'Hoshino, Koyu', 'Kawaguchi, Tatsuya', 'Iyama, Ken-ichi', 'Mitsuya, Hiroaki', 'Asou, Norio']","['Yamada R', 'Horikawa K', 'Ishihara S', 'Hoshino K', 'Kawaguchi T', 'Iyama K', 'Mitsuya H', 'Asou N']","['Department of Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Kumamoto University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', 'R10H71BSWG (Micafungin)']",IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Aspergillosis/complications/*drug therapy', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Echinocandins/*administration & dosage', 'Hepatitis/complications/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*complications', 'Lipopeptides/*administration & dosage', 'Liver Abscess/complications/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Male', 'Micafungin', 'Middle Aged']",,2010/03/31 06:00,2010/08/14 06:00,['2010/03/31 06:00'],"['2009/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-010-0556-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2010 May;91(4):711-5. doi: 10.1007/s12185-010-0556-2.

We have recently demonstrated that the activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta) is a new pathway supporting the chemoresistance of leukemic cells adhered to fibronectin. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show here that in conditions of serum starvation, the fibronectin receptor alpha(5)beta(1) integrin, but not alpha(4)beta(1), induced activation of GSK3beta through Ser-9 dephosphorylation in adherent U937 cells. The GSK3beta-dependent survival pathway occurred in adherent leukemic cells from patients but not in the HL-60 and KG1 cell lines. In adhesion, activated GSK3beta was found in the cytosol/plasma membrane compartment and was co-immunoprecipitated with alpha(5) integrin, the phosphatase PP2A and the scaffolding protein RACK1. PP2A and its regulatory subunit B' regulated the Ser-9 phosphorylation of GSK3beta. In adherent leukemic cells, alpha(5)beta(1) integrin but not alpha(4)beta(1) upregulated the resistance to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis. Both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways were under the control of alpha(5)beta(1) and GSK3beta. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our data show that, upon serum starvation, alpha(5)beta(1) integrin engagement could regulate specific pro-survival functions through the activation of GSK3beta.","['De Toni-Costes, Fabienne', 'Despeaux, Mathieu', 'Bertrand, Jessica', 'Bourogaa, Ezzeddine', 'Ysebaert, Loic', 'Payrastre, Bernard', 'Racaud-Sultan, Claire']","['De Toni-Costes F', 'Despeaux M', 'Bertrand J', 'Bourogaa E', 'Ysebaert L', 'Payrastre B', 'Racaud-Sultan C']","['Unite 563, Institut National des Sciences et de la Recherche Medicale, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin alpha5beta1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPP2CA protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha5beta1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",,2010/03/31 06:00,2011/01/12 06:00,['2010/03/31 06:00'],"['2009/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0009807 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2010 Mar 23;5(3):e9807. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0009807.,,,,20100323,PMC2843713,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

APPROACH: HIV-1-induced neurologic disease is associated with an influx of HIV-infected monocytic cells across the blood-brain barrier. Following neuroinvasion, HIV-1 and viral proteins, in addition to cellular mediators released from infected and uninfected cells participate in astrocytic and neuronal dysregulation, leading to mild to severe neurocognitive disorders. RESULTS: The molecular architecture of viral regulatory components including the Long Terminal Repeat (LTR), genes encoding the viral proteins Tat, Vpr and Nef as well as the envelope gene encoding gp120 and gp41 have been implicated in 'indirect' mechanisms of neuronal injury, mechanisms which are likely responsible for the majority of CNS damage induced by HIV-1 infection. The neuropathogenesis of HAM/TSP is linked, in part, with both intra-and extracellular effectors functions of the viral transactivator protein Tax and likely other viral proteins. Tax is traditionally known to localize in the nucleus of infected cells serving as a regulator of both viral and cellular gene expression. CONCLUSION/RECOMMENDATIONS: However, recent evidence has suggested that Tax may also accumulate in the cytoplasm and be released from the infected cell through regulated cellular secretion processes. Once in the extracellular environment, Tax may cause functional alterations in cells of the peripheral blood, lymphoid organs and the central nervous system. These extracellular biological activities of Tax are likely very relevant to the neuropathogenesis of HTLV-1 and represent attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.","['Irish, Bryan P', 'Khan, Zafar K', 'Jain, Pooja', 'Nonnemacher, Michael R', 'Pirrone, Vanessa', 'Rahman, Saifur', 'Rajagopalan, Nirmala', 'Suchitra, Joyce B', 'Mostoller, Kate', 'Wigdahl, Brian']","['Irish BP', 'Khan ZK', 'Jain P', 'Nonnemacher MR', 'Pirrone V', 'Rahman S', 'Rajagopalan N', 'Suchitra JB', 'Mostoller K', 'Wigdahl B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Center for Molecular Virology and Neuroimmunology, Center for Molecular Therapeutics and Resistance, Center for International Medicine, Institute for Molecular Medicine and Infectious Disease, Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19129, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Infect Dis,American journal of infectious diseases,101235278,,,,,2010/03/31 06:00,2010/03/31 06:01,['2010/03/31 06:00'],"['2010/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3844/ajidsp.2009.231.258 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Infect Dis. 2009 Jul 1;5(3):231-258. doi: 10.3844/ajidsp.2009.231.258.,,,"['R01 AI077414/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA019807/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS032092/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS046263/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2845477,['NIHMS179481'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, HSP90 inhibition is an attractive therapeutic approach when this protein is active, a phenotype commonly observed in transformed but not normal cells. However, preclinical studies with HSP90 inhibitors such as 17-AAG demonstrated depletion of only a subset of client proteins and very modest tumor cytotoxicity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Herein, we describe another HSP90 inhibitor, 17-DMAG, which is cytotoxic to CLL but not normal lymphocytes. Treatment with 17-DMAG leads to depletion of the HSP90 client protein IKK, resulting in diminished NF-kappaB p50/p65 DNA binding, decreased NF-kappaB target gene transcription, and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, treatment with 17-DMAG significantly decreased the white blood cell count and prolonged the survival in a TCL1-SCID transplant mouse model. The ability of 17-DMAG to function as an NF-kappaB inhibitor is of great interest clinically, as few currently available CLL drugs target this transcription factor. Therefore, the effect of 17-DMAG on NF-kappaB signaling pathways represents a novel therapy warranting further clinical pursuit in this and other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Hertlein, Erin', 'Wagner, Amy J', 'Jones, Jeffrey', 'Lin, Thomas S', 'Maddocks, Kami J', 'Towns, William H 3rd', 'Goettl, Virginia M', 'Zhang, Xiaoli', 'Jarjoura, David', 'Raymond, Chelsey A', 'West, Derek A', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Byrd, John C', 'Johnson, Amy J']","['Hertlein E', 'Wagner AJ', 'Jones J', 'Lin TS', 'Maddocks KJ', 'Towns WH 3rd', 'Goettl VM', 'Zhang X', 'Jarjoura D', 'Raymond CA', 'West DA', 'Croce CM', 'Byrd JC', 'Johnson AJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Ohio State University, 410West 12th Avenue, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '001L2FE0M3 (17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/metabolism', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2010/03/31 06:00,2010/08/25 06:00,['2010/03/31 06:00'],"['2010/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34759-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-01-263756 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jul 8;116(1):45-53. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-01-263756.

The severity of exhaustion correlates directly with the level of infection and the number and intensity of inhibitory receptors expressed, and it correlates inversely with the ability to respond to the blockade of inhibitory pathways. Friend virus (FV) is a murine retrovirus complex that induces acute high-level viremia, followed by persistent infection and leukemia development, when inoculated into immunocompetent adult mice. In this article, we provide conclusive evidence that FV infection results in the generation of virus-specific effector CD8(+) T cells that are terminally exhausted. Acute FV-induced disease is characterized by a rapid increase in the number of virus-infected erythroblasts, leading to massive splenomegaly. Most of the expanded erythroblasts strongly express programmed death ligand-1 and MHC class I, thereby creating a highly tolerogenic environment. Consequently, FV-specific effector CD8(+) T cells uniformly express multiple inhibitory receptors, such as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), T cell Ig domain and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3), lymphocyte activation gene-3, and CTLA-4, rapidly become nonresponsive to restimulation and are no longer reinvigorated by combined in vivo blockade of PD-1 and Tim-3 during the memory phase. However, combined blockade of PD-1 and Tim-3 during the priming/differentiation phase rescued FV-specific CD8(+) T cells from becoming terminally exhausted, resulting in improved CD8(+) T cell functionality and virus control. These results highlight FV's unique ability to evade virus-specific CD8(+) T cell responses and the importance of an early prophylactic approach for preventing terminal exhaustion of CD8(+) T cells.","['Takamura, Shiki', 'Tsuji-Kawahara, Sachiyo', 'Yagita, Hideo', 'Akiba, Hisaya', 'Sakamoto, Mayumi', 'Chikaishi, Tomomi', 'Kato, Maiko', 'Miyazawa, Masaaki']","['Takamura S', 'Tsuji-Kawahara S', 'Yagita H', 'Akiba H', 'Sakamoto M', 'Chikaishi T', 'Kato M', 'Miyazawa M']","['Department of Immunology, Kinki University School of Medicine, 377-2 Ohno-Higashi, Osaka-Sayama, Osaka 589-8511, Japan. stakamura@immunol.med.kindai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (Cd274 protein, mouse)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Havcr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Havcr2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 1)', '0 (Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B7-1 Antigen/physiology', 'B7-H1 Antigen', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism/virology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Erythroblasts/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 1', 'Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2', 'Immune Evasion/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Peptides/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Receptors, KIR/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Receptors, Virus/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/pathology/virology']",,2010/03/31 06:00,2010/07/02 06:00,['2010/03/31 06:00'],"['2010/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/02 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0903478 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0903478 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2010 May 1;184(9):4696-707. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0903478.

The SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 enhances SUMO conjugation to SATB1 lysine-744, and this modification regulates caspase-6 mediated cleavage of SATB1 at promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs). Since this regulated caspase cleavage occurs on only a subset of SATB1, and the products are relatively stable, proteolysis likely mediates cellular processes other than programmed cell death. However, the mechanism for the spatial and temporal regulation of SATB1 sumoylation and caspase cleavage is not known. Here we report that these processes are controlled by SATB1 phosphorylation; specifically, PIAS1 interaction with SATB1 is inhibited by phosphorylation. Mutagenesis studies identified interaction of the PIAS SAP (scaffold attachment factor-A/B/acinus/PIAS) motif with SATB1 N-terminal sequences. Notably, phosphorylation of SATB1 at threonine-188 regulates its interaction with PIAS1. Sequences near this phosphorylation site, LXXLL (residues 193 to 197), appear to be conserved among a subset of SUMO substrate proteins. Thus, this motif may be commonly involved in interaction with the PIAS SAP, and phosphorylation may similarly inhibit some of these substrates by preventing their interaction with the ligase.","['Tan, Joseph-Anthony T', 'Song, Jing', 'Chen, Yuan', 'Durrin, Linda K']","['Tan JA', 'Song J', 'Chen Y', 'Durrin LK']","['Division of Molecular Medicine, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, 1500 E.

Whenever possible, children must provide their assent before enrolling in research studies. We studied what children aged 7 to 18 with cancer understand about research, their research-related treatment, and their preferences for inclusion in decision-making. PROCEDURE: Thirty-seven face-to-face, audiorecorded interviews using a novel, semi-structured tool, the quality-of-assent instrument, were conducted. Exploratory univariate and bivariate analyses of the quantitative data elucidated patterns and trends of understanding and preferences. RESULTS: Nineteen of the 37 children (51%) did not know or recall that their treatment was considered research, and 19 of 22 (86%) did not understand their doctor when he or she discussed the trial. More children enrolled in trials to help future children with cancer (27 of 37 [73%]), than to get better personally (22 of 37 [60%]). Irrespective of age, children with Hodgkin's disease, germ-cell tumors, and leukemia had significantly greater research awareness and appreciation than children with other cancers (P = .019 and P < .001, respectively). Although all children wanted to be involved in decision-making, 18 of 37 (49%) did not have or recall having a role in deciding to enroll in their trial, and 14 of 37 (38%) did not feel free to dissent to trial enrollment. Only 4 of 37 children (11%) discussed increased decision-making roles with parents, and only 7 of 37 (19%) discussed them with their doctors. CONCLUSIONS: Most children have limited understanding of research despite physicians' explanations. Many children reported that they feel minimally involved in the decision to enroll in clinical trials. Tools to assist investigators ascertain that children understand what they are agreeing to when they assent to research and to determine their preferences for inclusion in research may help make assent more meaningful.","['Unguru, Yoram', 'Sill, Anne M', 'Kamani, Naynesh']","['Unguru Y', 'Sill AM', 'Kamani N']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Herman and Walter Samuelson Children's Hospital at Sinai, 2401 W Belvedere Ave, Baltimore, MD 21215-5271, USA. yunguru@lifebridgehealth.org""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Biomedical Research', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/methods/*psychology', 'Female', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent/*psychology', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology', 'Patient Participation/methods/*psychology', 'Research Subjects/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",,2010/03/31 06:00,2010/04/28 06:00,['2010/03/31 06:00'],"['2010/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['peds.2008-3429 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2008-3429 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2010 Apr;125(4):e876-83. doi: 10.1542/peds.2008-3429.

METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted for articles published between 1950 and March 2007. Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed, original research articles in English on racial/ethnic disparities in the health and health care of US children. Search terms used included ""child,"" ""disparities,"" and the Index Medicus terms for each racial/ethnic minority group. RESULTS: Of 781 articles initially reviewed, 111 met inclusion criteria and constituted the final database. Review of the literature revealed that racial/ethnic disparities in children's health and health care are quite extensive, pervasive, and persistent. Disparities were noted across the spectrum of health and health care, including in mortality rates, access to care and use of services, prevention and population health, health status, adolescent health, chronic diseases, special health care needs, quality of care, and organ transplantation. Mortality-rate disparities were noted for children in all 4 major US racial/ethnic minority groups, including substantially greater risks than white children of all-cause mortality; death from drowning, from acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and after congenital heart defect surgery; and an earlier median age at death for those with Down syndrome and congenital heart defects. Certain methodologic flaws were commonly observed among excluded studies, including failure to evaluate children separately from adults (22%), combining all nonwhite children into 1 group (9%), and failure to provide a white comparison group (8%). Among studies in the final database, 22% did not perform multivariable or stratified analyses to ensure that disparities persisted after adjustment for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Racial/ethnic disparities in children's health and health care are extensive, pervasive, and persistent, and occur across the spectrum of health and health care. Methodologic flaws were identified in how such disparities are sometimes documented and analyzed. Optimal health and health care for all children will require recognition of disparities as pervasive problems, methodologically sound disparities studies, and rigorous evaluation of disparities interventions.","['Flores, Glenn']",['Flores G'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,,IM,"['Child', 'Delivery of Health Care/economics', 'Ethnicity/*ethnology', 'Health Services Accessibility/economics', 'Health Services Needs and Demand/economics', '*Health Status Disparities', '*Healthcare Disparities/economics', 'Humans', 'Racial Groups/*ethnology', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",136,2010/03/31 06:00,2010/04/28 06:00,['2010/03/31 06:00'],"['2010/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['peds.2010-0188 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2010-0188 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2010 Apr;125(4):e979-e1020. doi: 10.1542/peds.2010-0188.

Consequently, it is important to ascertain which subgroups of patients will benefit from a specific treatment. Despite more than two decades of research into the molecular genetics of colon cancer, there is a lack of prognostic and predictive molecular biomarkers with proven utility in this setting. A secondary objective of the Pan European Trials in Adjuvant Colon Cancer-3 trial, which compared irinotecan in combination with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin in the postoperative treatment of stage III and stage II colon cancer patients, was to undertake a translational research study to assess a panel of putative prognostic and predictive markers in a large colon cancer patient cohort. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B 89803 trial, in a similar design, also investigated the use of prognostic and predictive biomarkers in this setting. In this article, the authors, who are coinvestigators from these trials and performed similar investigations of biomarker discovery in the adjuvant treatment of colon cancer, review the current status of biomarker research in this field, drawing on their experiences and considering future strategies for biomarker discovery in the postgenomic era.","['Tejpar, Sabine', 'Bertagnolli, Monica', 'Bosman, Fred', 'Lenz, Heinz-Joseph', 'Garraway, Levi', 'Waldman, Frederic', 'Warren, Robert', 'Bild, Andrea', 'Collins-Brennan, Denise', 'Hahn, Hejin', 'Harkin, D Paul', 'Kennedy, Richard', 'Ilyas, Mohammad', 'Morreau, Hans', 'Proutski, Vitali', 'Swanton, Charles', 'Tomlinson, Ian', 'Delorenzi, Mauro', 'Fiocca, Roberto', 'Van Cutsem, Eric', 'Roth, Arnaud']","['Tejpar S', 'Bertagnolli M', 'Bosman F', 'Lenz HJ', 'Garraway L', 'Waldman F', 'Warren R', 'Bild A', 'Collins-Brennan D', 'Hahn H', 'Harkin DP', 'Kennedy R', 'Ilyas M', 'Morreau H', 'Proutski V', 'Swanton C', 'Tomlinson I', 'Delorenzi M', 'Fiocca R', 'Van Cutsem E', 'Roth A']","['Digestive Oncology Unit, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium. sabine.tejpar@uz.kuleuven.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Disease Progression', 'Genes, p53/genetics', 'Genomic Instability', '*Genomics', 'Humans', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'ras Proteins/genetics']",54,2010/03/31 06:00,2010/09/11 06:00,['2010/03/31 06:00'],"['2010/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['theoncologist.2009-0233 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2009-0233 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2010;15(4):390-404. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2009-0233.

The modest activity demonstrated in early studies evaluating rituximab in relapsed CLL was improved with higher doses or more dose-intensive regimens that overcame the unfavorable pharmacokinetic features commonly found in CLL. These studies led to a variety of combination trials of rituximab with chemotherapy, where both phase II and later phase III studies have shown great promise for the advancement of CLL therapy. Despite the therapeutic success of rituximab in CLL, studies demonstrating the definitive relative mechanism of tumor clearance are still lacking and this requires further investigation. In addition to being used as a therapy for CLL, rituximab is an effective treatment for autoimmune CLL complications such as hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Patients with CLL may experience early infusion-related side effects that can be diminished with corticosteroid pretreatment and stepped-up dosing. Risk factors for infusion-related toxicity may relate to atypical CLL expressing bright CD20 antigen expression, although several different studies have not clearly implicated elevated white blood cell count as a risk factor. Other adverse events, including delayed cytopenias, reactivation of hepatitis B, and development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, are rare. Future efforts focusing on novel combination-based strategies will be required to fully appreciate the benefit of this therapy in CLL.","['Jaglowski, Samantha M', 'Byrd, John C']","['Jaglowski SM', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Autoimmune Diseases/drug therapy/etiology', 'Disease Progression', 'Hepatitis B/complications', 'Hepatitis B virus/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/complications/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy', 'Lymphopenia/chemically induced', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Rituximab', 'Virus Activation/drug effects']",59,2010/03/31 06:00,2010/06/30 06:00,['2010/03/31 06:00'],"['2010/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0037-1963(10)00006-5 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminhematol.2010.01.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2010 Apr;47(2):156-69. doi: 10.1053/j.seminhematol.2010.01.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigate whether resveratrol, a common ingredient in a broad variety of fruits and vegetables, can reverse drug resistance in AML cells. Three doxorubicin-resistant AML cell lines (AML-2/DX30, AML-2/DX100, AML-2/DX300) were prepared via long-term exposure to doxorubicin for more than 3 months. DNA microarray analysis demonstrated that many genes were differentially expressed in the resistant cells, as compared with the wild type AML-2/WT cells. In particular, the expression level of the MRP1 gene was significantly increased in the AML-2/DX300 cells, as compared to that detected in AML-2 cells. Importantly, the resveratrol was shown not only to induce cell growth arrest and apoptotic death in doxorubicin-resistant AML cells, but was also shown to downregulate the expression of an MRP1 gene. Furthermore, resveratrol treatment induced a significant increase in the uptake of 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, a MRP1 substrate, into the doxorubicin-resistant AML-2/DX300 cells. The results of this study show that resveratrol may facilitate the cellular uptake of doxorubicin via an induced downregulation of MRP1 expression, and also suggest that it may prove useful in overcoming doxorubicin resistance, or in sensitizing doxorubicin-resistant AML cells to anti-leukemic agents.","['Kweon, Sin Ho', 'Song, Ju Han', 'Kim, Tae Sung']","['Kweon SH', 'Song JH', 'Kim TS']","['Division of Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 136-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '3301-79-9 (6-carboxyfluorescein)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Doxorubicin/*metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Fluoresceins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology']",,2010/03/31 06:00,2010/05/08 06:00,['2010/03/31 06:00'],"['2010/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(10)00622-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.03.147 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2010 Apr 23;395(1):104-10. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.03.147.

We show here that human promyeloblastic leukemia KG-1a cells exposed to the histone deacetylase inhibitor phenylbutyrate resemble many characteristics of leukemia stem cells, including expression of functional ABC transporters such as P-glycoprotein, BCRP and MRP8. Consequently, KG-1a cells display resistance to the induction of apoptosis by various chemotherapeutic drugs. Resistance to apoptosis induction by chemotherapeutic drugs can be reversed by cyclosporine A, which effectively inhibits the activity of P-glycoprotein and BCRP, thus demonstrating ABC transporter-mediated drug resistance in KG-1a cells. However, KG-1a are highly sensitive to apoptosis induction by salinomycin, a polyether ionophore antibiotic that has recently been shown to kill human breast cancer stem cell-like cells and to induce apoptosis in human cancer cells displaying multiple mechanisms of drug and apoptosis resistance. Whereas KG-1a cells can be adapted to proliferate in the presence of apoptosis-inducing concentrations of bortezomib and doxorubicin, salinomycin does not permit long-term adaptation of the cells to apoptosis-inducing concentrations. Thus, salinomycin should be regarded as a novel and effective agent for the elimination of leukemia stem cells and other tumor cells exhibiting ABC transporter-mediated multidrug resistance.","['Fuchs, Dominik', 'Daniel, Volker', 'Sadeghi, Mahmoud', 'Opelz, Gerhard', 'Naujokat, Cord']","['Fuchs D', 'Daniel V', 'Sadeghi M', 'Opelz G', 'Naujokat C']","['Research Group Molecular Neuro-Oncology, German Cancer Research Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Pyrans)', '62UXS86T64 (salinomycin)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Pyrans/*pharmacology']",,2010/03/31 06:00,2010/05/14 06:00,['2010/03/31 06:00'],"['2010/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(10)00613-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.03.138 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2010 Apr 16;394(4):1098-104. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.03.138.

Literature searches were conducted of Ovid Medline from 1950 to November 2009 and EMBASE from 1980 to November 2009. We included any study design that described gastrointestinal complications in children and/or adults with AML. Common gastrointestinal complications were typhlitis and enterocolitis. Less common complications included appendicitis, pneumatosis intestinalis, and perianal infections. Both leukemia infiltration and intensive chemotherapy likely play a role in the etiology of these conditions. There is a paucity of carefully conducted studies that describe the natural history of typhlitis and enterocolitis and evidence is needed to help guide the management of gastrointestinal complications. Gastrointestinal complications are relatively common in children with AML. Conduction of carefully performed cohort studies is needed to better understand the spectrum of symptoms and expected consequences of gastrointestinal complications. Randomized trials are required to develop evidence-based guidelines for the management of gastrointestinal complications in pediatric AML.","['Gray, Tyler L V', 'Ooi, Chee Y', 'Tran, Dat', 'Traubici, Jeffrey', 'Gerstle, J Ted', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Gray TL', 'Ooi CY', 'Tran D', 'Traubici J', 'Gerstle JT', 'Sung L']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G1X8.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Child', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/*etiology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/therapy', 'Prognosis']",73,2010/03/31 06:00,2010/08/20 06:00,['2010/03/31 06:00'],"['2010/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428191003695652 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 May;51(5):768-77. doi: 10.3109/10428191003695652.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In total, 792 bone marrow samples were assessed for MRD at the end of induction, and during and after treatment completion. MRD positivity at the end of induction was detected in 12% of patients and was associated with high incidence of relapse, 54.55% (p = 0.0002), at 5 years. On the other hand, 88% of patients were MRD-negative at the end of induction and the relapse rate at 5 years was very low, 5%. The frequency of MRD decreased to 16% in the first 6 months of chemotherapy; however, the incidence of relapse in MRD-positive patients remained high, 42.8%. After treatment completion (24-36 months from diagnosis), 32% patients were MRD-positive and the relapse rate was 36.5% (p = 0.0009).

The TPMT gene promoter contains a variable number of three GC-rich tandem repeats, namely A, B and C, ranging from three to nine in length in a A(n)B(m)C architecture. MATERIALS & METHODS: Here, we investigated the influence of number and type of TPMT gene promoter tandem repeats on human TPMT gene transcription in K562 cells transiently transfected with reporter constructs bearing various variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) and addressed the interaction of transcription factor binding to the VNTRs by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. RESULTS: We found that the distribution patterns of VNTR alleles do not significantly differ among acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, acute myeloid leukemia patients and normal individuals. We also demonstrated that the A repeat has a negative effect in TPMT gene transcription and that a positive regulatory element, identified immediately upstream to the VNTR region of the TPMT gene promoter, is indispensable for TPMT gene transcription. Our electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis indicated that the Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors bind to the VNTR repeats. CONCLUSION: Overall, our data underline that both the number and type of VNTRs, as well as the upstream regulatory region of the TPMT gene promoter, determine the overall level of TPMT gene transcription. It remains to be seen whether these VNTRs can be employed as pharmacogenetic markers to individualize thiopurine therapy.","['Zukic, Branka', 'Radmilovic, Milena', 'Stojiljkovic, Maja', 'Tosic, Natasa', 'Pourfarzad, Farzin', 'Dokmanovic, Lidija', 'Janic, Dragana', 'Colovic, Natasa', 'Philipsen, Sjaak', 'Patrinos, George P', 'Pavlovic, Sonja']","['Zukic B', 'Radmilovic M', 'Stojiljkovic M', 'Tosic N', 'Pourfarzad F', 'Dokmanovic L', 'Janic D', 'Colovic N', 'Philipsen S', 'Patrinos GP', 'Pavlovic S']","['Institute for Molecular Genetics & Genetic Engineering, Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Vojvode Stepe 444a, 11010 Belgrade, Serbia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pharmacogenomics,Pharmacogenomics,100897350,"['EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', '*Minisatellite Repeats', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Whites/genetics']",,2010/03/31 06:00,2010/06/26 06:00,['2010/03/31 06:00'],"['2010/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/pgs.10.7 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenomics. 2010 Apr;11(4):547-57. doi: 10.2217/pgs.10.7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the delivery of D-pen to cancer cells remains a challenge due to its high hydrophilicity, highly reactive thiol group and impermeability to the cell membrane. To overcome this challenge, we investigated a novel poly-L-glutamic acid (PGA) conjugate of D-pen (PGA-D-pen) where D-pen was conjugated to PGA modified with 2-(2-pyridyldithio)-ethylamine (PDE) via disulfide bonds. Confocal microscopy and cell uptake studies showed that the fluorescently labeled PGA-D-pen was taken up by human leukemia cells (HL-60) in a time dependent manner. Treatment of HL-60, murine leukemia cells (P388) and human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-468) with PGA-D-pen resulted in dose dependent cytotoxicity and elevation of intracellular ROS levels. PGA-D-pen induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells which was verified by Annexin V binding. The in vivo evaluation of the conjugate in the P388 murine leukemia model (intraperitoneal) resulted in significant enhancement in the survival of CD2F1 mice over vehicle control.","['Wadhwa, Saurabh', 'Mumper, Russell J']","['Wadhwa S', 'Mumper RJ']","['Division of Molecular Pharmaceutics, UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-7362, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', 'GNN1DV99GX (Penicillamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chelating Agents/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Penicillamine/*administration & dosage/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*chemistry', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",,2010/03/31 06:00,2010/09/08 06:00,['2010/03/31 06:00'],"['2010/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/mp1000058 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2010 Jun 7;7(3):854-62. doi: 10.1021/mp1000058.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxic activity and cell growth inhibition of Ethoxyfagaronine (Etxfag) was tested on murine L1210 leukemia cells using trypan blue assay and MTT assay. At the concentration of 10(-7) M, Etxfag induced less than 10% of cell death. Etxfag (10(-7) M) was tested on L1210 cell invasiveness using matrigel precoated transwell chambers and efficiently reduces the invasive potential of L1210 cells by more than 50% as compared with untreated cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence experiments showed that Etxfag decreased both MT1-MMP expression and activation at the cell surface, decreased plasmin activity by down-regulating u-PAR and uPA expression at the cell surface and increasing PAI-1 secretion in conditioned media.

The modeling approach is based on structured Dirichlet process mixtures of normal distributions. Full inference for functionals of the stochastic precedence constrained mixture distributions is obtained through a Markov chain Monte Carlo posterior simulation method. A motivating application involves study of the discriminatory ability of continuous diagnostic tests in epidemiologic research. Here, stochastic precedence provides a natural restriction for the distributions of test scores corresponding to the non-infected and infected groups. Inference under the model is illustrated with data from a diagnostic test for Johne's disease in dairy cattle.

Seventeen of 18 patients responded to alemtuzumab, six patients are alive with a median follow-up of 108 weeks. Chronic GVHD was observed frequently. Although pronounced lymphocyte depletion requiring close monitoring for signs of infections seems inevitable for efficacy, alemtuzumab given in moderate doses has a substantial activity not only in intestinal but also in severe acute GVHD of the liver.","['Schub, N', 'Gunther, A', 'Schrauder, A', 'Claviez, A', 'Ehlert, C', 'Gramatzki, M', 'Repp, R']","['Schub N', 'Gunther A', 'Schrauder A', 'Claviez A', 'Ehlert C', 'Gramatzki M', 'Repp R']","['Division for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, Second Department of Medicine, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Bacterial Infections/complications', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/complications/drug therapy/immunology', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/therapy', 'Liver Diseases/complications/drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Virus Diseases/complications', 'Young Adult']",,2010/03/30 06:00,2011/05/06 06:00,['2010/03/30 06:00'],"['2010/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt201068 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2010.68 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2011 Jan;46(1):143-7. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2010.68.

Both leukemia-initiating cell frequency and expansion potential were increased by over two orders of magnitude in the two-oncogene compared to the one-oncogene model, documenting the functional heterogeneity of leukemia-initiating cells.

Analyses of mouse mutants revealed that during cortical development, AF9 is involved in the maintenance of TBR2-positive progenitors (intermediate precursor cells, IPCs) in the subventricular zone and prevents premature cell cycle exit of IPCs. Furthermore, in postmitotic neurons of the developing cortical plate, AF9 is implicated in the formation of the six-layered cerebral cortex by suppressing a TBR1-positive cell fate mainly in upper layer neurons. We show that the molecular mechanism of TBR1 suppression is based on the interaction of AF9 with DOT1L, a protein that mediates transcriptional control through methylation of histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79). AF9 associates with the transcriptional start site of Tbr1, mediates H3K79 dimethylation of the Tbr1 gene, and interferes with the presence of RNA polymerase II at the Tbr1 transcriptional start site. AF9 expression favors cytoplasmic localization of TBR1 and its association with mitochondria. Increased expression of TBR1 in Af9 mutants is associated with increased levels of TBR1-regulated expression of NMDAR subunit Nr1. Thus, this study identified AF9 as a developmental active epigenetic modifier during the generation of cortical projection neurons.","['Buttner, Nicole', 'Johnsen, Steven A', 'Kugler, Sebastian', 'Vogel, Tanja']","['Buttner N', 'Johnsen SA', 'Kugler S', 'Vogel T']","['Centre of Anatomy, Department of Neuroanatomy, University Medical Centre Goettingen, Georg-August-University, 37075 Goettingen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Mllt3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (Tbr1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Cerebral Cortex/*embryology', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'T-Box Domain Proteins']",,2010/03/30 06:00,2010/05/15 06:00,['2010/03/30 06:00'],"['2010/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['0912041107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0912041107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Apr 13;107(15):7042-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0912041107.

To identify such compounds, we conducted chemical screens and identified the antihelmintic flubendazole. Flubendazole induced cell death in leukemia and myeloma cell lines and primary patient samples at nanomolar concentrations. Moreover, it delayed tumor growth in leukemia and myeloma xenografts without evidence of toxicity. Mechanistically, flubendazole inhibited tubulin polymerization by binding tubulin at a site distinct from vinblastine. In addition, cells resistant to vinblastine because of overexpression of P-glycoprotein remained fully sensitive to flubendazole, indicating that flubendazole can overcome some forms of vinblastine resistance. Given the different mechanisms of action, we evaluated the combination of flubendazole and vinblastine in vitro and in vivo. Flubendazole synergized with vinblastine to reduce the viability of OCI-AML2 cells. In addition, combinations of flubendazole with vinblastine or vincristine in a leukemia xenograft model delayed tumor growth more than either drug alone. Therefore, flubendazole is a novel microtubule inhibitor that displays preclinical activity in leukemia and myeloma.","['Spagnuolo, Paul A', 'Hu, Jiayi', 'Hurren, Rose', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Gronda, Marcela', 'Sukhai, Mahadeo A', 'Di Meo, Ashley', 'Boss, Jonathan', 'Ashali, Iman', 'Beheshti Zavareh, Reza', 'Fine, Noah', 'Simpson, Craig D', 'Sharmeen, Sumaiya', 'Rottapel, Rob', 'Schimmer, Aaron D']","['Spagnuolo PA', 'Hu J', 'Hurren R', 'Wang X', 'Gronda M', 'Sukhai MA', 'Di Meo A', 'Boss J', 'Ashali I', 'Beheshti Zavareh R', 'Fine N', 'Simpson CD', 'Sharmeen S', 'Rottapel R', 'Schimmer AD']","['Princess Margaret Hospital, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, ON.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antinematodal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '81G6I5V05I (Mebendazole)', 'R8M46911LR (flubendazole)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antinematodal Agents/agonists/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/agonists/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mebendazole/agonists/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Microtubules/*metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'Vinblastine/agonists/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Vinca Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/methods']",,2010/03/30 06:00,2010/07/20 06:00,['2010/03/30 06:00'],"['2010/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34902-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-09-243055 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jun 10;115(23):4824-33. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-09-243055.

The median survival time was 4.1 years; 12 patients remained alive for more than 10 years, 44 progressed to acute ATL, and 63 patients died. The estimated 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates were 47.2%, 25.4%, and 14.1%, respectively, with no plateau in the survival curve. Although most patients were treated with watchful waiting, 12 patients were treated with chemotherapy. Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that advanced performance status (PS), neutrophilia, high concentration of lactate dehydrogenase, more than 3 extranodal lesions, more than 4 total involved lesions, and receiving chemotherapy were unfavorable prognostic factors for survival. Multivariate Cox analysis showed that advanced PS was a borderline significant independent factor in poor survival (hazard ratio, 2.1, 95% confidence interval, 1.0-4.6; P = .06), but it was not a factor when analysis was limited to patients who had not received chemotherapy. The prognosis of indolent ATL in this study was poorer than expected. These findings suggest that even patients with indolent ATL should be carefully observed in clinical practice. Further studies are required to develop treatments for indolent ATL.","['Takasaki, Yumi', 'Iwanaga, Masako', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Tawara, Masayuki', 'Joh, Tatsuro', 'Kohno, Tomoko', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Kamihira, Shimeru', 'Ikeda, Schuichi', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Tomonaga, Masao', 'Tsukasaki, Kunihiro']","['Takasaki Y', 'Iwanaga M', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Tawara M', 'Joh T', 'Kohno T', 'Yamada Y', 'Kamihira S', 'Ikeda S', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Tomonaga M', 'Tsukasaki K']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Japanese Red Cross Nagasaki Genbaku Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models']",,2010/03/30 06:00,2010/06/24 06:00,['2010/03/30 06:00'],"['2010/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34929-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-09-242347 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jun 3;115(22):4337-43. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-09-242347.

Treatment success was defined as disease-free survival at 1 year posttransplantation. For patients at standard risk for disease, the treatment success rate was 57.1% for PBSCT recipients and 80.3% for BMT recipients (P = not significant [NS]). The average total cost per treatment success at 1 year in the standard-risk disease group was $512,294 for PBSCT recipients and $352,885 for BMT recipients (P = NS). For patients with high-risk disease, the treatment success rate was 18.8% for PBSCT recipients and 23.5% for BMT recipients (P = NS). The cumulative average cost was $457,078 in BMT recipients and $377,316 in PBSCT recipients (P = NS). Point estimates of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) indicate that in patients with standard-risk disease, allogeneic BMT had lower costs and greater effectiveness than PBSCT (ICER, -$687,108; 95% confidence interval [CI], $2.4 million to dominated). For patients with high-risk disease, BMT was more effective and more costly, and it had an ICER of $1.69 million (95% CI, $29.7 million to dominated) per additional treatment success. The comparative economic evaluation provides support for BMT in standard-risk patients, but much uncertainty precludes a clear advantage of either treatment option in patients with high-risk disease.

However, neither compound inhibited phosphorylation of STAT3 in human leukemia (U937) cells at low concentrations. We therefore synthesized a biotin-linked cucurbitacin E to isolate target proteins based on affinity for the molecule. As a result, cofilin, which regulates the depolymerization of actin, was isolated and suggested to be a target. Cucurbitacins E and I inhibited the phosphorylation of cofilin in a concentration-dependent manner, and their effective concentrations having the same range as the concentrations at which they had cytotoxic effects in U937 cells. In addition, the fibrous-/globular-actin ratio was decreased after treatment with cucurbitacin E in HT1080 cells. These findings suggested that the inhibition of cofilin's phosphorylation increased the severing activity of cofilin, and then the depolymerization of actin was enhanced after treatment with cucurbitacin E at lower concentrations.","['Nakashima, Souichi', 'Matsuda, Hisashi', 'Kurume, Ai', 'Oda, Yoshimi', 'Nakamura, Seikou', 'Yamashita, Masayuki', 'Yoshikawa, Masayuki']","['Nakashima S', 'Matsuda H', 'Kurume A', 'Oda Y', 'Nakamura S', 'Yamashita M', 'Yoshikawa M']","['Department of Pharmacognosy, Kyoto Pharmaceutical University, Misasagi, Yamashina-ku, Kyoto 607-8412, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,9107377,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cofilin 1)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0115W5MABF (cucurbitacin B)', 'SHQ47990PH (cucurbitacin I)', 'V8A45XYI21 (cucurbitacin E)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cofilin 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Triterpenes/*chemistry/toxicity', 'U937 Cells']",,2010/03/30 06:00,2010/07/28 06:00,['2010/03/30 06:00'],"['2010/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2010/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0960-894X(10)00262-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmcl.2010.02.062 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 2010 May 1;20(9):2994-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2010.02.062.

A lack of this system in phagocytes is known to cause serious life-threatening infections. Here, we describe that curcumin, a polyphenol responsible for the yellow color of curry spice turmeric, dramatically activates the O(2)(-)-generating system during retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation of human monoblastic leukemia U937 cells to macrophage-like cells. When U937 cells were cultured in the presence of RA and curcumin, the O(2)(-)-generating activity increased more than 4-fold compared with that in the absence of the latter. Semiquantitative RT-PCR showed that co-treatment with RA and curcumin slightly enhanced gene expressions of the five components compared with those of the RA-treatment only. On the other hand, immunoblot analysis revealed that co-treatment with RA and curcumin caused remarkable accumulation of protein levels of p47-phox (to 7-fold) and p67-phox (to 4-fold) compared with those of the RA-treatment alone. These results suggested that curcumin dramatically enhances RA-induced O(2)(-)-generating activity via accumulation of cytosolic p47-phox and p67-phox proteins in U937 cells. Therefore, it should have the potential as an effective modifier in therapy of leukemia and/or as an immunopotentiator.","['Kikuchi, Hidehiko', 'Kuribayashi, Futoshi', 'Kiwaki, Naomi', 'Nakayama, Tatsuo']","['Kikuchi H', 'Kuribayashi F', 'Kiwaki N', 'Nakayama T']","['Department of Life Science, Frontier Science Research Center, University of Miyazaki, Kiyotake, Miyazaki 889-1692, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (neutrophil cytosol factor 67K)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.1 (neutrophil cytosolic factor 1)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidases/*metabolism', 'Phagocytes/drug effects', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Superoxides/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,2010/03/30 06:00,2010/05/08 06:00,['2010/03/30 06:00'],"['2010/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(10)00600-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.03.136 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2010 Apr 23;395(1):61-5. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.03.136.

Proteomic studies of B-cell malignancies have made significant progress, but further studies are needed to increase our coverage of the B-cell malignant proteome. To achieve this goal we stress the advantages of using sub-cellular fractionation, protein separation, quantitation and affinity purification techniques to identify hitherto unidentified signalling and regulatory proteins. For example, proteomic analysis of B-cell plasma membranes isolated from patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) identified the voltage-gated proton channel (HVCN1,[1]). This protein has now been characterised as a key modulator of B-cell receptor (BCR) signalling and abrogation of HVCN1 function could have a role in the treatment of B-cell malignancies dependent on maintained BCR signalling [2]. Similarly, proteomic studies on cell lysates from prognostic subtypes of CLL, distinguished by the absence (UM-CLL) or presence (M-CLL) of somatic hypermutation of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus identified nucleophosmin 1 (NMP1) as a potential prognostic marker [3,4]. Thus, targeted proteomic analysis on selected organelles or sub-cellular compartments can identify novel proteins with unexpected localisation or function in malignant B-cells that could be developed for clinical purposes.","['Boyd, Robert S', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Cain, Kelvin']","['Boyd RS', 'Dyer MJ', 'Cain K']","['MRC Toxicology Unit, Hodgkin Building, Lancaster Rd, University of Leicester, Leicester, LE1 9HN, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Proteomics,Journal of proteomics,101475056,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/diagnosis', 'Membrane Microdomains/chemistry', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Proteomics/methods']",,2010/03/30 06:00,2011/01/06 06:00,['2010/03/30 06:00'],"['2009/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S1874-3919(10)00084-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jprot.2010.03.010 [doi]']",ppublish,J Proteomics. 2010 Sep 10;73(10):1804-22. doi: 10.1016/j.jprot.2010.03.010.

Research has confirmed that the NF-kappaB family is one of the target genes in the Notch signaling pathway. This study investigated the effects of Celastrol on the apoptosis of U937 cells and the expression levels of Notch1 and NF-kappaB in these cells. METHODS: U937 cells were treated with various concentrations Celastrol (0.5-16.0) micromol/L for 12-60 h. MTT assay was performed to examine the effect of Celastrol on growth inhibition of U937 cells. Cell apoptosis was detected through both Annexin-V FITC/PI double-labeled cytometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cell cycle regulation was studied by propidium iodide. Western blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technologies were applied to assess the expression level of Notch1 in U937 cells. Subcellular distributions of NF-kappaB/p65 were detected through confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Celastrol presented striking growth inhibition and apoptosis induction potency on U937 cells in vitro in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The IC50 value of Celastrol for 24 h was (6.21 +/- 0.242) micromol/L. Moreover, Celastrol induced apoptosis in U937 cells in a cell-cycle dependent manner, which means that Celastrol could arrest U937 cells in the G0/G1 phase. Through TEM, apoptotic bodies containing nuclear fragments were found in Celastrol-treated U937 cells. Overexpression of Notch1 was found in U937 cells, while Celastrol could downregulate it at both the protein and mRNA level in a dose-dependent manner, and expression of NF-kappaB decreased in nuclei and increased in the cytoplasm (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Celastrol inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in U937 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The possible mechanism might be involved in the regulation of a survival signaling pathway, such as Notch or NF-kappaB.","['Wang, Xiao-Nan', 'Wu, Qing', 'Yang, Xu', 'Zhang, Lian-Sheng', 'Wu, Yi-Ping', 'Lu, Chong']","['Wang XN', 'Wu Q', 'Yang X', 'Zhang LS', 'Wu YP', 'Lu C']","['Medical College of Wuhan University of Science Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430000, PR China. wxnan@sina.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Chin J Cancer,Chinese journal of cancer,101498232,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Pentacyclic Triterpenes)', '0 (RELA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Triterpenes)', 'L8GG98663L (celastrol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Pentacyclic Triterpenes', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factor RelA/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tripterygium/chemistry', 'Triterpenes/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",,2010/03/30 06:00,2012/02/14 06:00,['2010/03/30 06:00'],"['2010/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1000-467X201004385 [pii]', '10.5732/cjc.009.10526 [doi]']",ppublish,Chin J Cancer. 2010 Apr;29(4):385-90. doi: 10.5732/cjc.009.10526.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gene encodes two protein isoforms, a longer form LMO2-L and a shorter form LMO2-S. Both isoforms function as bridge molecules to assemble their partners together to regulate their target genes. A typical LMO2 binding site consists of two elements, a GATA site and an E-box, with an interval of 9 approximately 12 bp. METHODS: In this study, the combination of MBP pulldown assay and mammalian two hybrid assay were used to confirm the homo-binding character of LMO2-L/-S isoforms. Luciferase reporter assay and Real-time PCR assay were used to detect expression levels and relative promoter activities of LMO2-L/-S isoforms. Co-transfection and Luciferase reporter assay were used to reveal the detailed regulatory pattern of LMO2-L/-S isoforms on their targets. RESULTS: Herein we report the homo-interaction character of LMO2-L and LMO2-S and their major difference in manner of regulating their target genes. Our results showed that LMO2-L and LMO2-S could only bind to themselves but not each other. It was also demonstrated that LMO2-L could either positively or negatively regulate the transcription of its different target genes, depending on the arrangement and strand location of the two elements GATA site and E-box, LMO2-S, however, performed constitutively transcriptional inhibiting function on all target genes. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that LMO2 isoforms have independent functions while there is no interaction between each other and they could play synergetic or antagonistic roles precisely in regulating their different genes involved in normal and aberrant hematopoiesis.","['Sun, Wei', 'Shen, Wen-Wen', 'Yang, Shuang', 'Hu, Fen', 'Gao, Yang', 'Qiao, Yu-Huan', 'Zhu, Tian-Hui']","['Sun W', 'Shen WW', 'Yang S', 'Hu F', 'Gao Y', 'Qiao YH', 'Zhu TH']","['Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, College of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biomed Sci,Journal of biomedical science,9421567,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Luciferases', 'Metalloproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Plasmids/genetics', '*Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",,2010/03/30 06:00,2010/08/19 06:00,['2010/03/30 06:00'],"['2010/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1423-0127-17-22 [pii]', '10.1186/1423-0127-17-22 [doi]']",epublish,J Biomed Sci. 2010 Mar 27;17(1):22. doi: 10.1186/1423-0127-17-22.,,,,20100327,PMC2854110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we assessed immune cell subset recovery in these patients in the context of early myeloid malignant disease relapse. Despite the close relationship between the GvL and GvHD immune responses, rapid recovery of lymphocyte subsets was not associated with protection from disease relapse. These results indicated that GvL may be weak in this treatment setting for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukaemia. Consistent with low GvL activity, we previously reported that mixed T cell chimaerism had no detrimental effect on relapse in this treatment setting and instead correlated with better outcome because of reduced GvHD incidence. We now report that patients with significantly higher lymphocyte numbers prior to transplantation subsequently maintained the mixed T cell chimaeric state. This pre-transplant profile, together with absence of the early post-transplant signature indicative of GvHD predisposition, could potentially be used to identify patients suitable for early withdrawal of immunosuppression and prophylactic donor leucocyte infusion to boost GvL activity.","['Matthews, Katie', 'Lim, ZiYi', 'Pearce, Laurence', 'Pagliuca, Antonio', 'Alejandro Madrigal, J', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Barber, Linda D']","['Matthews K', 'Lim Z', 'Pearce L', 'Pagliuca A', 'Alejandro Madrigal J', 'Mufti GJ', 'Barber LD']","['The Anthony Nolan Research Institute, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods']",,2010/03/30 06:00,2010/07/30 06:00,['2010/03/30 06:00'],"['2010/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH8164 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08164.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Jun;149(6):879-89. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08164.x.

Here we reveal the signal transduction pathway responsible for human LF (hLF)-triggered nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. Endotoxin-depleted hLF induces NF-kappaB activation at physiologically relevant concentrations in the human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In MEFs, in which both tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and TRAF5 are deficient, hLF causes NF-kappaB activation at a level comparable to that seen in wild-type MEFs, whereas TRAF6-deficient MEFs show significantly impaired NF-kappaB activation in response to hLF. TRAF6 is known to be indispensable in leading to NF-kappaB activation in myeloid differentiating factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent signaling pathways, while the role of TRAF6 in the MyD88-independent signaling pathway has not been clarified extensively. When we examined the hLF-dependent NF-kappaB activation in MyD88-deficient MEFs, delayed, but remarkable, NF-kappaB activation occurred as a result of the treatment of cells with hLF, indicating that both MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent pathways are involved. Indeed, hLF fails to activate NF-kappaB in MEFs lacking Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a unique TLR group member that triggers both MyD88-depependent and MyD88-independent signalings. Importantly, the carbohydrate chains from hLF are shown to be responsible for TLR4 activation. Furthermore, we show that lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine and chemokine production is attenuated by intact hLF but not by the carbohydrate chains from hLF. Thus, we present a novel model concerning the biological function of hLF: hLF induces moderate activation of TLR4-mediated innate immunity through its carbohydrate chains; however, hLF suppresses endotoxemia by interfering with lipopolysaccharide-dependent TLR4 activation, probably through its polypeptide moiety.","['Ando, Ken', 'Hasegawa, Keiichi', 'Shindo, Ken-Ichi', 'Furusawa, Tomoyasu', 'Fujino, Tomofumi', 'Kikugawa, Kiyomi', 'Nakano, Hiroyasu', 'Takeuchi, Osamu', 'Akira, Shizuo', 'Akiyama, Taishin', 'Gohda, Jin', 'Inoue, Jun-Ichiro', 'Hayakawa, Makio']","['Ando K', 'Hasegawa K', 'Shindo K', 'Furusawa T', 'Fujino T', 'Kikugawa K', 'Nakano H', 'Takeuchi O', 'Akira S', 'Akiyama T', 'Gohda J', 'Inoue J', 'Hayakawa M']","['Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tlr4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Lactoferrin/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/immunology', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/deficiency/immunology/*metabolism']",,2010/03/30 06:00,2010/05/06 06:00,['2010/03/30 06:00'],"['2010/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['EJB7620 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07620.x [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS J. 2010 May;277(9):2051-66. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07620.x.

BACKGROUND: Treatment of CML has been revolutionised with the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson (BCR-ABL) kinase. Imatinib is the only first-line TKI currently available for the treatment of CML; however, intolerance and resistance remain significant clinical challenges. The approved second-line treatment options for CML are dasatinib, nilotinib or escalated-dose imatinib. DESIGN: Review article. METHODS: Searches of PubMed, ASCO and ASH electronic databases for relevant search terms were performed between July 2008-January 2009. FINDINGS: Dasatinib has no cross-intolerance with imatinib, and the most frequent AEs (cytopenias and pleural and pericardial effusions) can generally be managed by dose interruption and reduction. Nilotinib has a high degree of haematologic cross-intolerance with first-line imatinib. As might be expected, high-dose imatinib has the potential for more severe AEs than standard-dose imatinib. CONCLUSIONS: There are known safety issues inherent to each TKI and close monitoring by nursing staff is necessary to identify and effectively manage AEs. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: All three TKIs have demonstrated potential for fluid retention and cardiotoxicity. Nurses should be aware of how these AEs manifest and intervene appropriately. The safety profiles of these TKIs clearly differs and it is important to consider factors such as comorbidities when making treatment decisions.","['Tinsley, Sara M']",['Tinsley SM'],"['Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA. sara.tinsley@moffitt.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Clin Nurs,Journal of clinical nursing,9207302,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",39,2010/03/30 06:00,2010/08/25 06:00,['2010/03/30 06:00'],"['2010/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['JCN3167 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2702.2009.03167.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Nurs. 2010 May;19(9-10):1207-18. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2702.2009.03167.x.

Lack of LIF prevents activation of this signaling cascade and accelerates disease progression leading to a fast loss of photoreceptor cells. In this study, we show that expression of Janus kinase 3 (Jak3), but not of the other members of the family of Janus kinases, is induced in four different models of retinal degeneration and that LIF is essential and sufficient to activate Jak3 gene expression. We also show that the induction of Jak3 and Lif may not depend directly on cell death but rather on the retinal stress during photoreceptor degeneration. However, despite its dependence on LIF, JAK3 is not essential for LIF-mediated photoreceptor protection or gene expression. Also, absence of JAK3 in knockout mice did not affect immune-related responses in the degenerating retina. JAK3 may therefore play a different, yet unknown, role in the retinal response to photoreceptor injury.","['Lange, Christina', 'Thiersch, Markus', 'Samardzija, Marijana', 'Burgi, Sandra', 'Joly, Sandrine', 'Grimm, Christian']","['Lange C', 'Thiersch M', 'Samardzija M', 'Burgi S', 'Joly S', 'Grimm C']","['Lab for Retinal Cell Biology, Department Ophthalmology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Eye', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hypoxia/metabolism', 'Injections', 'Janus Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microglia/physiology', 'Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Retina/pathology', 'Retinal Degeneration/*enzymology/pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Up-Regulation/physiology']",,2010/03/30 06:00,2010/07/09 06:00,['2010/03/30 06:00'],"['2010/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['JNC6686 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06686.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 2010 Jun;113(5):1210-20. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06686.x.

However, little is known about the regulation of HO-1 in human primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Here we investigated the expression of HO-1 in primary and established AML cells as well as other types of leukemic cells and normal monocytes, and its regulatory mechanism by the transcriptional repressor, BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bach1), and the activator, nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2). Leukemic cell lines such as U937 expressed little HO-1, whereas most freshly isolated AML cells and monocytes expressed substantial amounts of HO-1, along with Bach1 and Nrf2. When U937 cells were treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PHA) or gamma-interferon, they significantly expressed both HO-1 and Bach1, like primary AML cells. Treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhanced HO-1 expression in U937 cells but suppressed it in primary monocytes and PMA-treated U937 cells. In HO-1-expressing cells, Bach1 was localized in the cytoplasm, but Nrf2 was localized in the nuclei. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay of these cells revealed the preferential binding of Nrf2 over Bach1 to Maf-recognition elements, the enhancer regions of the HO-1 gene. The downregulation of the HO-1 gene with siRNA increased a cytotoxic effect of an anticancer drug on primary AML cells, whereas the downregulation of Bach1 increased HO-1 expression, leading to enhanced survival. These and other results show that Bach1 plays a critical role in regulating HO-1 gene expression in AML cells and its expression suppresses their survival by downregulating HO-1 expression. Thus, functional upregulation of Bach1 is a potential strategy for antileukemic therapy.","['Miyazaki, Takuya', 'Kirino, Yohei', 'Takeno, Mitsuhiro', 'Samukawa, Sei', 'Hama, Maasa', 'Tanaka, Masatsugu', 'Yamaji, Satoshi', 'Ueda, Atsuhisa', 'Tomita, Naoto', 'Fujita, Hiroyuki', 'Ishigatsubo, Yoshiaki']","['Miyazaki T', 'Kirino Y', 'Takeno M', 'Samukawa S', 'Hama M', 'Tanaka M', 'Yamaji S', 'Ueda A', 'Tomita N', 'Fujita H', 'Ishigatsubo Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (BACH1 protein, human)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (HMOX1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",,2010/03/30 06:00,2010/09/16 06:00,['2010/03/30 06:00'],"['2010/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['CAS1550 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2010.01550.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2010 Jun;101(6):1409-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2010.01550.x.

The aim of this study was to characterize the mRNA expression levels of APAF-1 transcripts in low-risk and high-risk MDS and to elucidate whether the expression levels of APAF-1 transcripts are modulated with increased apoptosis in CD34(+) MDS cells undergoing erythroid differentiation. METHODS: APAF-1 (NM_181861) expression was verified, by quantitative RT-PCR, in bone marrow aspirates from 33 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), at the time of diagnosis, and in erythroid differentiation cultures from CD34(+) from normal donors and patients with MDS. RESULTS: APAF-1 expression was significantly higher in low-risk, compared to high-risk MDS, according to IPSS (P < 0.0001), FAB (P = 0.0265), and cytogenetic risk (P = 0.0134). Low-risk MDS-derived differentiated erythroid cells demonstrated an increased expression of APAF-1, compared with normal cells, accompanied by an augmented rate of apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Increased expression of APAF-1 in low-risk disease and its positive correlation with the apoptotic rate observed during the erythroblast differentiation of low-risk MDS cells may indicate that the modulation of APAF-1, at the transcriptional level, participates in the pathophysiology of MDS.","['Benites, Bruno Deltreggia', 'Traina, Fabiola', 'Duarte, Adriana da Silva Santos', 'Lorand-Metze, Irene Gyongyver H', 'Costa, Fernando Ferreira', 'Saad, Sara Teresinha']","['Benites BD', 'Traina F', 'Duarte Ada S', 'Lorand-Metze IG', 'Costa FF', 'Saad ST']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Hemotherapy Center, University of Campinas, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (APAF1 protein, human)', '0 (Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory/genetics', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/genetics', 'Anemia, Sideroblastic/genetics', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Risk Factors']",,2010/03/30 06:00,2010/07/16 06:00,['2010/03/30 06:00'],"['2010/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1429 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01429.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 Jun;84(6):525-30. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01429.x.

The aim was to promote the inherent anti-leukemic activity of the transplant whilst reducing toxicity and transplant-related mortality (TRM). More than 10 years on, much has been learnt about the role of conditioning in determining outcomes after transplantation. The use of RIC as a preparative regimen has increased the number of patients that can benefit from HSCT because the initial therapy is less toxic. However, many of the early pioneers of RIC quickly realized that the toxicity from graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) was equally as potent as that from conditioning. Furthermore, questions remain concerning the efficacy of RIC regimens in retaining anti-leukemic immunity, especially in cases of aggressive disease. The undoubted synergy between chemotherapeutic and immunologic treatment of malignancy means that reduction of conditioning intensity to minimal levels may not be entirely logical.","['Turner, Brie E', 'Collin, Matthew', 'Rice, Alison M']","['Turner BE', 'Collin M', 'Rice AM']","['Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/adverse effects', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Myeloablative Agonists/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Transplantation Conditioning']",,2010/03/30 06:00,2011/02/15 06:00,['2010/03/30 06:00'],"['2010/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3109/14653241003709678 [doi]', 'S1465-3249(10)70408-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2010 Jul;12(4):440-54. doi: 10.3109/14653241003709678.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigation of fever in a 10-year-old boy with acute myeloblastic leukaemia, including blood cultures on selective media, allowed the diagnosis of a fungaemia due to the slow-growing fungus Acremonium strictum. The patient recovered with liposomal amphotericin B (AmB) and voriconazole, followed by voriconazole alone due to AmB resistance. Facing a neutropenic patient with fever, clinicians usually suspect bacterial or viral aetiologies. This case, however, illustrates the need for mycological analysis of blood samples in febrile neutropenic patients and for antifungal susceptibility testing.","['Hitoto, Hikombo', 'Pihet, Marc', 'Weil, Beatrice', 'Chabasse, Dominique', 'Bouchara, Jean-Philippe', 'Rachieru-Sourisseau, Petronella']","['Hitoto H', 'Pihet M', 'Weil B', 'Chabasse D', 'Bouchara JP', 'Rachieru-Sourisseau P']","['Laboratoire de Parasitologie-Mycologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Angers, France. hikombo.hitoto@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Mycopathologia,Mycopathologia,7505689,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (liposomal amphotericin B)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Acremonium/*isolation & purification', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Blood/microbiology', 'Child', 'Fever/etiology', 'Fungemia/*diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/etiology', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Triazoles/therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole']",,2010/03/27 06:00,2010/10/12 06:00,['2010/03/27 06:00'],"['2010/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11046-010-9306-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Mycopathologia. 2010 Sep;170(3):161-4. doi: 10.1007/s11046-010-9306-5.

The dose related Dox-induced cardiotoxicity often poses challenge in clinical practice, lowering its dose and administering it in combination with other compound is an option. In this study, we found that a nontoxic concentration of Dox at 34.5 nM (20 ng/ml) combined with Compound C, an inhibitor used in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, could kill human leukemia K562 cells. Additionally, this study confirmed that the combined effect was related to the inhibition of some key proteins such as AMPK and acetyl CoA carboxylase. Moreover, down-regulation of these key proteins in AMPK pathway using siRNA technology also sensitized K562 cells to nontoxic concentration of Dox. The study also showed that Dox at a concentration of 345.0 nM (200 ng/ml) or 862.0 nM (500 ng/ml) that is lower than a typical value of 1-2 microM Dox in patients could kill human leukemia K562 cells. Taken together, our results suggest that inhibition of AMPK pathway by Compound C or siRNA sensitizes K562 cells to nontoxic concentration of Dox which is much lower than typical concentration in plasma of clinical patients.","['Zhu, Qun', 'Shen, Bo', 'Zhang, Boshao', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Chin, Steve H', 'Jin, Junfei', 'Liao, Duan-fang']","['Zhu Q', 'Shen B', 'Zhang B', 'Zhang W', 'Chin SH', 'Jin J', 'Liao DF']","[""Department of Endocrinology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210011, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '10K52CIC1Z (dorsomorphin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 6.4.1.2 (Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference']",,2010/03/27 06:00,2010/09/23 06:00,['2010/03/27 06:00'],"['2009/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11010-010-0428-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2010 Jul;340(1-2):275-81. doi: 10.1007/s11010-010-0428-3.

These key functions render them potential targets for anti-parasite chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Schistosomes feed on host blood and the digested haemoglobin is their major source of amino acids. Haemoglobin digestion is essential for parasite development, growth, and reproduction. We recently reported the use of pseudotyped Moloney murine leukaemia virus to accomplish transformation of Schistosoma mansoni. Here, we report the design of a viral vector expressing a dsRNA hairpin to silence expression of the schistosome cathepsin B1 (SmCB1) gene. We observed 80% reduction in transcript level 72 h after virus exposure and complete silencing of enzyme activity in transduced worms. This is the first report using this technology in any helminth parasite. It will facilitate the evaluation of potential drug targets and biochemical pathways for novel interventions in schistosomes.","['Tchoubrieva, Elissaveta B', 'Ong, Poh C', 'Pike, Robert N', 'Brindley, Paul J', 'Kalinna, Bernd H']","['Tchoubrieva EB', 'Ong PC', 'Pike RN', 'Brindley PJ', 'Kalinna BH']","['Centre for Animal Biotechnology, Faculty of Veterinary Science, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, 3052, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,['EC 3.4.22.1 (Cathepsin B)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cathepsin B/*genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Parasitic Sensitivity Tests', '*RNA Interference', 'Schistosoma mansoni/*genetics/physiology', 'Schistosomiasis mansoni/therapy']",,2010/03/27 06:00,2010/11/17 06:00,['2010/03/27 06:00'],"['2009/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00018-010-0345-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2010 Nov;67(21):3739-48. doi: 10.1007/s00018-010-0345-3.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 9,995/15,449 tumor patients of the Radiation Oncology Department in Ulm, Germany, treated between 1981 and 2003, survived at least 1 year after radiotherapy. By long-term follow-up and review of treatment documentation, 100 of them were identified who developed an independent second cancer in or near the irradiated first tumor site. RESULTS: Major primary malignancies were breast cancer (27%), lymphoma (24%), and pelvic gynecologic tumors (17%). Main second tumors were carcinomas of the upper (18%) and lower (12%) gastrointestinal tract, head and neck tumors (10%), lymphoma (10%), breast cancer (9%), sarcoma (9%), and lung cancer (8%). Overall median second tumor latency was 7.4 years (1-42 years). For colorectal cancer it was 3.5 and for leukemia 4.3 years, but for sarcoma 11.7 and for breast cancer 17.1 years. The relatively frequent second tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract were associated with median radiation doses of 24 Gy. By contrast, second colorectal cancer and sarcoma developed after median doses of 50 Gy. CONCLUSION: The 5- and 15-year probability to develop a histopathologically independent second tumor in or near the irradiated first tumor site, i.e., after intermediate or high radiation doses, was 0.5% and 2.2%, respectively. To identify potentially radiogenic second malignancies, a follow-up far beyond 5 years is mandatory. The incidence and potential dose-response relationship intermediate will be analyzed by a case-case and a case-control study of the Ulm data.","['Welte, Birgitta', 'Suhr, Peter', 'Bottke, Dirk', 'Bartkowiak, Detlef', 'Dorr, Wolfgang', 'Trott, Klaus Rudiger', 'Wiegel, Thomas']","['Welte B', 'Suhr P', 'Bottke D', 'Bartkowiak D', 'Dorr W', 'Trott KR', 'Wiegel T']","['Department of Radiotherapy and Radiation Oncology, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

One of the most frequent is NUP98-DDX10 that fuses a portion of NUP98 to a portion of DDX10, a putative DEAD-box RNA helicase. Here, we show that NUP98-DDX10 dramatically increases proliferation and self-renewal of primary human CD34+ cells, and disrupts their erythroid and myeloid differentiation. It localizes to their nuclei and extensively deregulates gene expression. Comparison to another leukemogenic NUP98 fusion, NUP98-HOXA9, reveals a number of genes deregulated by both oncoproteins, including HOX genes, COX-2, MYCN, ANGPT1, REN, HEY1, SOX4 and others. These genes may account for the similar leukemogenic properties of NUP98 fusion oncogenes. The YIHRAGRTAR sequence in the DDX10 portion of NUP98-DDX10 represents a major motif shared by DEAD-box RNA helicases that is required for ATP binding, RNA-binding and helicase functions. Mutating this motif diminished the in vitro transforming ability of NUP98-DDX10, indicating that it has a role in leukemogenesis. These data show for the first time the in vitro transforming ability of NUP98-DDX10 and show that it is partially dependent on one of the consensus helicase motifs of DDX10. They also point to common pathways that may underlie leukemogenesis by different NUP98 fusions.","['Yassin, E R', 'Abdul-Nabi, A M', 'Takeda, A', 'Yaseen, N R']","['Yassin ER', 'Abdul-Nabi AM', 'Takeda A', 'Yaseen NR']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nup98 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (DDX10 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2010/03/27 06:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2010/03/27 06:00'],"['2010/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201042 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.42 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 May;24(5):1001-11. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.42.

Benzene, an established human leukemogen, is known to induce cytogenetic changes through its active metabolites including hydroquinone (HQ), but the specific alterations have not been fully characterized. Global DNA hypomethylation was reported in a population exposed to benzene, but has not been confirmed in vitro. In this study, we examined cytogenetic changes in chromosomes 5, 7, 8, 11 and 21, and global DNA methylation in human TK6 lymphoblastoid cells treated with HQ for 48 h, and compared the HQ-induced alterations with those induced by two well-known leukemogens, melphalan, an alkylating agent, and etoposide, a DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor. We found that rather than inducing cytogenetic alterations distinct from those induced by melphalan and etoposide, HQ induced alterations characteristic of each agent. HQ induced global DNA hypomethylation at a level intermediate to melphalan (no effect) and etoposide (potent effect). These results suggest that HQ may act similar to an alkylating agent and also similar to a DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor in living cells, both of which may be potential mechanisms of benzene toxicity. In addition to cytogenetic changes, global DNA hypomethylation may be another mechanism underlying the leukemogenicity of benzene.","['Ji, Z', 'Zhang, L', 'Peng, V', 'Ren, X', 'McHale, C M', 'Smith, M T']","['Ji Z', 'Zhang L', 'Peng V', 'Ren X', 'McHale CM', 'Smith MT']","['Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720-7360, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Mutagens)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Human/drug effects/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*pharmacology', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Melphalan/*pharmacology', 'Mutagens/pharmacology']",,2010/03/27 06:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2010/03/27 06:00'],"['2010/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201043 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2010.43 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 May;24(5):986-91. doi: 10.1038/leu.2010.43.

Drug efficiency was assessed by an increase of lifespan (ILS) of treated leukemia-bearing animals as compared with untreated leukemia-bearing animals. Different doses of the drugs and length of the treatment were tested. CY and VCR demonstrated therapeutic effect which was dose- and time course-dependent. The maximal increase of ILS reached 61.1% after CY (400 mg/L, 72 h) treatment and 44.4%-in VCR (4 mg/L, 72 h) treated animals. None of the tumor-bearing larvae showed complete recovery from leukemia as a result of any VCR and CY monotherapy schedule. PRE was inefficient for treatment of leukemia in zebrafish in a dose range between 1 and 50 mg/L and a treatment length between 24 and 72 h due to it toxicity exclusively towards leukemia-bearing larvae. These data demonstrate that, in addition to morphological and genetic similarities with mammalian leukemia, zebrafish T-ALL is also sensitive to the same chemotherapeutic drugs in vivo as mammals.

Here we show that human B-CLL cells selectively express high levels of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) mRNA and proteins. Treating B-CLL cells with TLR9 agonists, type B CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-B ODNs), induces significant morphologic and phenotypic activation, altered cytokine production, reversal of signal transducer, and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation state, followed by profound apoptosis of B-CLL cells that is CpG-B ODN treatment time- and dose-dependent. TLR9-CpG ODN ligation-induced apoptosis of B-CLL cells is confirmed by viable cell counts, annexin V/propidium iodide and tetramethyl-rhodamine ethylester staining, Western blots of the activation, and cleaved caspases and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Triggering TLR9 by CpG-B ODN leads to nuclear factor-kappaB-dependent production of autocrine interleukin-10, which activates JAK/STAT pathway-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 proteins and thereby provokes an apoptosis pathway in B-CLL cells. Treating B-CLL cells in vitro or in vivo with CpG-B ODN reduces the number of leukemia cells that engraft in NOD-scid mice. These findings provide new understanding of CpG ODN-mediated antitumor effects and support for the development of TLR9-targeted therapy for human CLL.","['Liang, Xueqing', 'Moseman, E Ashley', 'Farrar, Michael A', 'Bachanova, Veronika', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Blazar, Bruce R', 'Chen, Wei']","['Liang X', 'Moseman EA', 'Farrar MA', 'Bachanova V', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Blazar BR', 'Chen W']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (CPG-oligonucleotide)', '0 (IL10 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (TLR9 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2010/03/27 06:00,2010/07/10 06:00,['2010/03/27 06:00'],"['2010/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34861-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-03-213363 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jun 17;115(24):5041-52. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-03-213363.

Developing a predictive model for determining children at increased risk would be beneficial in targeting interventional studies to high-risk groups (HRGs). Predictive variables were incorporated into a risk assessment model, which was evaluated in 456 children and then validated in 339 patients. VTE risk by score was no greater than 2.5 for low-risk group (LRG) and greater than 2.5 for HRG. VTE rates at 3.5 months (validation cohorts) were 2.5% in LRG and 64.7% in HRG. In multivariate analysis adjusted for age, duration of asparaginase administration, enoxaparin prophylaxis, and T-immunophenotype, the HRG was significantly associated with VTE compared with the LRG (hazard/95% confidence interval [CI], 8.22/1.85-36.53). Model specificity was 96.2% and sensitivity was 63.2%. As secondary objective we investigated the use of enoxaparin for VTE prophylaxis in the HRG. HRG patients without enoxaparin prophylaxis showed a significantly reduced thrombosis-free survival compared with children on low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). On the basis of the high specificity, the model may identify children with leukemia at risk of VTE. LMWH may help prevent VTE in the HRG; this warrants assessment in larger cooperative clinical trials.","['Mitchell, Lesley', 'Lambers, Moritz', 'Flege, Silke', 'Kenet, Gili', 'Li-Thiao-Te, Valerie', 'Holzhauer, Susanne', 'Bidlingmaier, Christoph', 'Fruhwald, Michael C', 'Heller, Christine', 'Schmidt, Wolfgang', 'Pautard, Brigitte', 'Nowak-Gottl, Ulrike']","['Mitchell L', 'Lambers M', 'Flege S', 'Kenet G', 'Li-Thiao-Te V', 'Holzhauer S', 'Bidlingmaier C', 'Fruhwald MC', 'Heller C', 'Schmidt W', 'Pautard B', 'Nowak-Gottl U']","[""Stollery Children's Hospital, Edmonton, AB.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Validation Study']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Enoxaparin)', '0 (Steroids)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anticoagulants/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Databases, Factual', 'Enoxaparin/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Models, Statistical', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Steroids/therapeutic use', 'Thromboembolism/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/prevention & control']",,2010/03/27 06:00,2010/07/10 06:00,['2010/03/27 06:00'],"['2010/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34855-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-01-263012 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jun 17;115(24):4999-5004. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-01-263012.

Because selective eradication of LSCs could offer substantial therapeutic benefit, there is interest in identifying the signaling pathways that control their development. We studied LSCs in mouse models of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) induced either by coexpression of the Hoxa9 and Meis1a oncogenes or by the fusion oncoprotein MLL-AF9. We show that the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is required for self-renewal of LSCs that are derived from either hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) or more differentiated granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP). Because the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is normally active in HSCs but not in GMP, these results suggest that reactivation of beta-catenin signaling is required for the transformation of progenitor cells by certain oncogenes. beta-catenin is not absolutely required for self-renewal of adult HSCs; thus, targeting the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway may represent a new therapeutic opportunity in AML.","['Wang, Yingzi', 'Krivtsov, Andrei V', 'Sinha, Amit U', 'North, Trista E', 'Goessling, Wolfram', 'Feng, Zhaohui', 'Zon, Leonard I', 'Armstrong, Scott A']","['Wang Y', 'Krivtsov AV', 'Sinha AU', 'North TE', 'Goessling W', 'Feng Z', 'Zon LI', 'Armstrong SA']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Progenitor Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Wnt Proteins/*metabolism', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",,2010/03/27 06:00,2010/04/14 06:00,['2010/03/27 06:00'],"['2010/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['327/5973/1650 [pii]', '10.1126/science.1186624 [doi]']",ppublish,Science. 2010 Mar 26;327(5973):1650-3. doi: 10.1126/science.1186624.,,,"['5P01CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01HL048801/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL048801/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA066996-11A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R01 HL048801-16/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC3084586,['NIHMS284045'],,,['GEO/GSE20377'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Presently, it is unknown whether BIO can influence the derivation of porcine embryonic germ (EG) cells. In this study, porcine primordial germ cells (PGCs) were isolated from gonads of 24- and 28-day embryos, and were then treated with BIO either individually or in combination with other cytokines (stem cell factor (SCF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF); abbreviated as '3F'), and the effects of the treatment on the proliferation ability of porcine PGCs at early stage were examined using 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (Brdu) immunostaining assay. After continuous culture, the effects on the efficiency of porcine undifferentiated EG cells in the third passage and differentiated EG cells from embryoid bodies were examined as well. The results obtained through the observation of the Brdu-labeled PGCs indicated that BIO in combination with 3F resulted in a significant increase in the mitosis index, and also indicated that the BIO in combination with 3F had a higher efficiency in promoting the formation of porcine EG colony derived from porcine day 24 PGCs than BIO used either individually or in combination with LIF. In addition, BIO in combination with 3F exhibited the apparent anti-differentiation activity by reversing the differentiated EG cells to the undifferentiated status. Our results demonstrate that BIO in combination with SCF, LIF, and FGF could significantly contribute to the establishment of a porcine EG cell colony and maintain the undifferentiated status.","['Wen, Jiang', 'Liu, Juan', 'Song, Guangqi', 'Liu, Limei', 'Tang, Bo', 'Li, Ziyi']","['Wen J', 'Liu J', 'Song G', 'Liu L', 'Tang B', 'Li Z']","[""Jilin Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Embryo Engineering, College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, Jilin University, 5333 Xi An Da Lu, Changchun, Jilin 130062, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Reproduction,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",100966036,"[""0 (6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime)"", '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Oximes)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Germ Cells/chemistry/cytology/*drug effects', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Gonads/cytology/embryology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mitotic Index', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/genetics', 'Oximes/*pharmacology', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology', 'Swine/*embryology']",,2010/03/27 06:00,2010/08/21 06:00,['2010/03/27 06:00'],"['2010/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['REP-09-0539 [pii]', '10.1530/REP-09-0539 [doi]']",ppublish,Reproduction. 2010 Jun;139(6):1039-46. doi: 10.1530/REP-09-0539.

Current results indicate that only the -2 and -4 RNA nucleotides (-1 hybridized to the 3' recessed DNA base) are required for stable binding to RNA-DNA, and even a single RNA nucleotide conferred significantly greater stability than DNA-DNA. Replacing 2'- hydroxyls on pivotal RNA bases with 2'-O-methyls did not affect stability, indicating that interactions between hydroxyls and RT amino acids do not stabilize binding. RT's K(d) (k(off)/k(on)) for DNA-DNA and RNA-DNA were similar, although k(off) differed almost 40-fold, suggesting a faster k(on) for DNA-DNA. Avian myeloblastosis and Moloney murine leukemia virus RTs also bound more stably to RNA-DNA, but the difference was less pronounced than with HIV-RT. We propose that the H- versus B-form structures of RNA-DNA and DNA-DNA, respectively, allow the former to conform more easily to HIV-RT's binding cleft, leading to more stable binding. Biologically, the ability of RT to form a more stable complex on RNA-DNA may aid in degradation of RNA fragments that remain after DNA synthesis.","['Olimpo, Jeffrey T', 'DeStefano, Jeffrey J']","['Olimpo JT', 'DeStefano JJ']","['Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Nucleotides)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/enzymology', 'DNA/*chemistry/metabolism', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology', 'Nucleotides/chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Uridine/chemistry']",,2010/03/27 06:00,2010/08/25 06:00,['2010/03/27 06:00'],"['2010/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['gkq169 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkq169 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2010 Jul;38(13):4426-35. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkq169.

Based on the quantification of nitrogen contents in different cheese samples, a positive correlation between the ripeness of various cheeses and their antiproliferative activity tested in HL-60 cells was displayed. Four varieties of Blue cheese ripened for 0, 1, 2, or 3 mo demonstrated that the Blue cheese ripened for a long term was capable of causing the strong suppression of the cell growth and the induction of apoptotic DNA damage as well as nucleic morphological change in HL-60 cells.

We have previously shown that the synthetic triterpenoid 2-cyano-3, 12-dioxooleana-1, 9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) can inhibit murine early aGVHD, but antitumor effects were not assessed. In the current study, we found that a new derivative of CDDO, CDDO-Me, had an increased ability to inhibit allogeneic T cell responses and induce cell death of alloreactive T cells in vitro. Administration of CDDO-Me to mice following allogeneic BMT resulted in significant and increased protection from lethal aGVHD compared to CDDO. This correlated with reduced TNF-alpha production, reduced donor T cell proliferation, and decreased adhesion molecule (alpha(4)beta(7) integrin) expression on the donor T cells. CDDO-Me was also superior to CDDO in inhibiting leukemia growth in vitro. When CDDO-Me was administered following an allogeneic BMT to leukemia-bearing mice, significant increases in survival were observed. These findings suggest that CDDO-Me is superior to CDDO in delaying aGVHD, while preserving or possibly even augmenting GVT effects.","['Li, Minghui', 'Sun, Kai', 'Redelman, Doug', 'Welniak, Lisbeth A', 'Murphy, William J']","['Li M', 'Sun K', 'Redelman D', 'Welniak LA', 'Murphy WJ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Nevada School of Medicine, Reno, Nevada, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (integrin alpha4beta7)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'CEG1Q6OGU1 (bardoxolone methyl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colon/pathology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect/drug effects/*immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Integrins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/therapy', 'Liver/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oleanolic Acid/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/blood']",,2010/03/27 06:00,2011/01/14 06:00,['2010/03/27 06:00'],"['2009/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00120-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.01.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2010 Jun;16(6):739-50. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.01.020.

It contains a BTB/POZ domain that mediates epigenetic transcriptional repression. PLZF is essential for proper skeleton patterning and male germ cell renewal. Two alleles have been reported that display similar phenotypes: a targeted knock-out, and the spontaneous nonsense mutation luxoid. RESULTS: We describe a new ENU induced missense allele of Plzf called seven toes (Plzf7t). Homozygous animals exhibit hindlimb and axial skeleton abnormalities. Whereas the skeletal abnormalities are similar to those of the other alleles, Plzf7t differs in that it does not cause spermatogonial depletion and infertility. Positional cloning revealed a point mutation changing the evolutionarily conserved amino acid Glu44 to Gly, possibly altering the BTB domain's activity. CONCLUSIONS: Plzf7t is a separation-of-function allele that reveals differential requirements for domains of PLZF in different developmental milieus.","['Ching, Yung-Hao', 'Wilson, Lawriston A', 'Schimenti, John C']","['Ching YH', 'Wilson LA', 'Schimenti JC']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,BMC Dev Biol,BMC developmental biology,100966973,"['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', '*Body Patterning/genetics', 'Bone and Bones/abnormalities', 'Infertility, Male/genetics', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*genetics/physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Point Mutation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', '*Skeleton', 'Spermatozoa/*physiology']",,2010/03/27 06:00,2010/08/14 06:00,['2010/03/27 06:00'],"['2009/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-213X-10-33 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-213X-10-33 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Dev Biol. 2010 Mar 25;10:33. doi: 10.1186/1471-213X-10-33.,,,['R01 HD035984/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],20100325,PMC2859375,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 are frequently overexpressed, contributing to melanoma's well-documented chemoresistance. Recently, it was reported that the combination of MAPK pathway inhibition by specific MEK inhibitors and Bcl-2 family inhibition by BH3-mimetic ABT-737 synergistically induces apoptotic cell death in melanoma cell lines. Here we provide the first evidence that inhibition of another key MAPK, p38, synergistically induces apoptosis in melanoma cells in combination with ABT-737. We also provide novel mechanistic data demonstrating that inhibition of p38 increases expression of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein PUMA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PUMA can be cleaved by a caspase-dependent mechanism during apoptosis and identify what appears to be the PUMA cleavage product. Thus, our findings suggest that the combination of ABT-737 and inhibition of p38 is a promising, new treatment strategy that acts through a novel PUMA-dependent mechanism.","['Keuling, Angela M', 'Andrew, Susan E', 'Tron, Victor A']","['Keuling AM', 'Andrew SE', 'Tron VA']","['Department of Medical Genetics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pigment Cell Melanoma Res,Pigment cell & melanoma research,101318927,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'PVX798P8GI (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole)']",IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Melanoma/enzymology/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Skin Neoplasms/enzymology/*pathology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,2010/03/27 06:00,2010/09/21 06:00,['2010/03/27 06:00'],"['2010/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['PCR698 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1755-148X.2010.00698.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pigment Cell Melanoma Res. 2010 Jun;23(3):430-40. doi: 10.1111/j.1755-148X.2010.00698.x.

It has been described that posaconazole, a triazole antifungal drug, is active against a variety of Candida and Aspergillus species in vitro. Moreover, large clinical trials using posaconazole in severely immunosuppressed patients provided data on efficacy against Aspergillus in vivo. As patients with ALL are also affected by difficult-to-treat Aspergillus infections, we conducted a pilot study to prove the safety of posaconazole in patients undergoing intensified induction phase treatment. We report on eight patients receiving prophylactic (200 mg t.i.d.) dose of posaconazole and demonstrate good tolerability of the drug. The most obvious side effect was liver toxicity as defined by abnormal serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and bilirubin levels (<CTC grade 3) documented in three of eight patients.

However, no systematic review of this infection has been undertaken in this high-risk patient group. The aim of this study was to review all reported cases of Rhodotorula infection to determine the epidemiology and outcome of this infection in this high-risk population. The 29 reported cases were fungaemias. The most common underlying haematological disorder was the presence of acute leukaemia (65.5%). Rhodotorula mucilaginosa was the species found more frequently (79.3%). Most cases (58.6%) had several risk factors (>/= 3) simultaneously. The most common predisposing factors were the presence of central venous catheter (CVC, 100%) and neutropenia (62.1%). A substantial number of patients (81.5%) received antifungal treatment with amphotericin B. The overall mortality was higher (13.8%) than that described in non-haematological patients (5.8% in solid-organ neoplasms and 9% in AIDS or other chronic diseases). Patients with acute leukaemia had a higher mortality rate (15.7%) than patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (0%). Our data suggest that patients with acute leukaemia might be managed as high-risk patients and intensive measures might be taken. In addition, it appears that the subgroup of patients without acute leukaemia have a good outcome and might be managed as low-risk patients with a less intensive approach.","['Garcia-Suarez, J', 'Gomez-Herruz, P', 'Cuadros, J A', 'Burgaleta, C']","['Garcia-Suarez J', 'Gomez-Herruz P', 'Cuadros JA', 'Burgaleta C']","['Haematology Department, Principe Asturias Teaching Hospital, Medical Department, University of Alcala, Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain. jgarciasu.hupa@salud.madrid.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",Germany,Mycoses,Mycoses,8805008,,IM,"['Critical Care/methods', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Mycoses/*epidemiology/microbiology/mortality', 'Rhodotorula/*isolation & purification', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis/*epidemiology/microbiology/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2010/03/27 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2010/03/27 06:00'],"['2010/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['MYC1868 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1439-0507.2010.01868.x [doi]']",ppublish,Mycoses. 2011 Jul;54(4):318-24. doi: 10.1111/j.1439-0507.2010.01868.x.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene expression levels were investigated using Affymetrix hybridization technology and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Affymetrix technology showed that the expression of 1,038 genes with a biological process description well known in gene ontology was modulated. Fifteen genes were related to kinases or phosphatases, 20 genes were involved in the cell cycle regulation, and 23 genes were involved in apoptosis. A network of 15 correlated genes was obtained showing a primordial role for the myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC).

In their postfusion forms, the three fusion subunits form trimers of hairpins consisting of a central coiled coil (formed by the N-terminal helices), an intervening sequence, and a region containing the C helix (and flanking strands) that runs antiparallel to and packs in the grooves of the N-terminal coiled coil. For filoviruses and most retroviruses, the intervening sequence includes a ""chain reversal region"" consisting of a short stretch of hydrophobic residues, a Gly-Gly pair, a CX(6)CC motif, and a bulky hydrophobic residue. Maerz and coworkers (A. L. Maerz, R. J. Center, B. E. Kemp, B. Kobe, and P. Poumbourios, J. Virol. 74:6614-6621, 2000) proposed a model for this region of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Env in which expulsion of the final bulky hydrophobic residue is important for early conformational changes and specific residues in the chain reversal region are important for forming the final, stable trimer of hairpins. Here, we used mutagenesis and pseudovirus entry assays to test this model for the avian retrovirus avian sarcoma/leukosis virus (ASLV) and the filovirus ebolavirus Zaire. Our results are generally consistent with the model proposed for HTLV-1 Env. In addition, we show with ASLV EnvA that the bulky hydrophobic residue following the CX(6)CC motif is required for the step of prehairpin target membrane insertion, whereas other residues are required for the foldback step of fusion. We further found that a His residue that is unique to the chain reversal region of ASLV EnvA controls the pH at which ASLV entry occurs.","['Delos, Sue E', 'La, Bonnie', 'Gilmartin, Allissia', 'White, Judith M']","['Delos SE', 'La B', 'Gilmartin A', 'White JM']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22908, USA. sed7a@virginia.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)']",IM,"['Alpharetrovirus/*chemistry/pathogenicity', 'Ebolavirus/*chemistry/pathogenicity', 'Histidine', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Protein Conformation', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/*chemistry', '*Virus Internalization']",,2010/03/26 06:00,2010/06/09 06:00,['2010/03/26 06:00'],"['2010/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02583-09 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02583-09 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Jun;84(11):5687-94. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02583-09.

We found that expression of A3G, A3F, or murine A3 in virus-producing cells resulted in their virion incorporation, inhibition of XMRV replication, and G-to-A hypermutation of the viral DNA with all three APOBEC3 proteins. Quantitation of A3G and A3F mRNAs indicated that, compared to the human T-cell lines CEM and H9, prostate cell lines LNCaP and DU145 exhibited 50% lower A3F mRNA levels, whereas A3G expression in 22Rv1, LNCaP, and DU145 cells was nearly undetectable.

XMRV proviral genomes were extensively hypermutated upon replication in A3G/A3F-positive T cells (CEM and H9), but not in A3G/A3F-negative cells (CEM-SS). We also observed that XMRV replication was susceptible to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors zidovudine (AZT) and tenofovir and the integrase inhibitor raltegravir. In summary, the establishment of XMRV infection in patients may be dependent on infection of A3G/A3F-deficient cells, and cells expressing low levels of A3G/A3F, such as prostate cancer cells, may be ideal producers of infectious XMRV. Furthermore, the anti-HIV-1 drugs AZT, tenofovir, and raltegravir may be useful for treatment of XMRV infection.","['Paprotka, Tobias', 'Venkatachari, Narasimhan J', 'Chaipan, Chawaree', 'Burdick, Ryan', 'Delviks-Frankenberry, Krista A', 'Hu, Wei-Shau', 'Pathak, Vinay K']","['Paprotka T', 'Venkatachari NJ', 'Chaipan C', 'Burdick R', 'Delviks-Frankenberry KA', 'Hu WS', 'Pathak VK']","['Viral Mutation Section, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, P.O.

The identification of viral and cellular determinants of latency is the first step toward developing antiviral treatments that target and might clear or control the reservoir of latent virus. HCMV latency is established in CD34(+) cells when expression of viral immediate early (IE) proteins that initiate lytic infection is silenced. Viral IE gene expression during lytic infection is controlled by a cellular intrinsic immune defense mediated by promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body (PML-NB) proteins such as Daxx and histone deacetylases (HDACs). This defense is inactivated at the start of lytic infection by the HCMV virion tegument protein pp71, which upon viral entry traffics to the nucleus and induces Daxx degradation. Here we show that a similar defense is present, active, and not neutralized during experimental latency in CD34(+) cells infected in vitro because tegument-delivered pp71 remains in the cytoplasm. Artificial inactivation of this defense by HDAC inhibition or Daxx knockdown rescues viral IE gene expression upon infection of CD34(+) cells with a laboratory-adapted viral strain but not with clinical strains. Interestingly, coinfection of CD34(+) cells with clinical viral strains blocked the ability of an HDAC inhibitor to activate IE1 and early protein expression during infection with a laboratory-adapted strain. This suggests that in addition to the intrinsic defense, HCMV clinical strains contribute an HDAC-independent, trans-acting dominant means of control over viral gene expression during the early stages of experimental HCMV latency modeled in vitro in CD34(+) cells.","['Saffert, Ryan T', 'Penkert, Rhiannon R', 'Kalejta, Robert F']","['Saffert RT', 'Penkert RR', 'Kalejta RF']","['Institute for Molecular Virology, McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1525 Linden Drive, Madison, WI 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/immunology', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Cytomegalovirus/*physiology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/virology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*virology', 'Histone Deacetylases/immunology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Nuclear Proteins/immunology', '*Virus Latency']",,2010/03/26 06:00,2010/06/09 06:00,['2010/03/26 06:00'],"['2010/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00348-10 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00348-10 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Jun;84(11):5594-604. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00348-10.

A total of 500 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated according to the common Nordic treatment protocols were included, and we found that the RFC AA variant was associated with a 50% better chance of staying in remission compared with GG or GA variants (P = .046). Increased copy numbers of chromosome 21 appear to improve outcome also in children with GA or GG variant. In a subset of 182 children receiving 608 high-dose MTX courses, we observed higher degree of bone marrow toxicity in patients with the RFC AA variant compared with GA/GG variants (platelet 73 vs 99/105 x 10(9)/L, P = .004, hemoglobin 5.6 vs 5.9/6.0 mmol/L, P = .004) and a higher degree of liver toxicity in patients with RFC GG variant (alanine aminotransferase 167 vs 127/124 U/L, P = .05).

Pharmacologic inhibition of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), a key mediator of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, induces apoptosis in primary CLL cells and prevents stroma contact-mediated cell survival. This report demonstrates a role of SYK in molecularly defined pathways that mediate the CLL-microenvironmental crosstalk independent from the BCR. Chemokine and integrin stimulation induced SYK phosphorylation, SYK-dependent Akt phosphorylation, and F-actin formation in primary CLL cells. Inhibition of SYK by 2 pharmacologic inhibitors and siRNA-knockdown abrogated downstream SYK signaling and morphologic changes induced by these stimuli. CLL cell migration toward CXCL12, the major homing attractor, and CLL cell adhesion to VCAM-1, a major integrin ligand expressed on stromal cells, were markedly reduced by SYK inhibition. In combination with fludarabine, the SYK inhibitor R406 abrogated stroma-mediated drug resistance by preventing up-regulation of the antiapoptotic factor Mcl-1 in CLL cells. SYK blockade in CLL is a promising therapeutic principle not only for its inhibition of the BCR signaling pathway, but also by inhibiting protective stroma signals in a manner entirely independent of BCR signaling.","['Buchner, Maike', 'Baer, Constance', 'Prinz, Gabriele', 'Dierks, Christine', 'Burger, Meike', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Jumaa, Hassan', 'Veelken, Hendrik', 'Zirlik, Katja']","['Buchner M', 'Baer C', 'Prinz G', 'Dierks C', 'Burger M', 'Zenz T', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Jumaa H', 'Veelken H', 'Zirlik K']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0', '(N4-(2,2-dimethyl-3-oxo-4H-pyrid(1,4)oxazin-6-yl)-5-fluoro-N2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyph', 'enyl)-2,4-pyrimidinediamine)', '0 (Oxazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '143198-26-9 (Integrin alpha4)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Chemokines/metabolism', 'Chemotaxis', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4/metabolism', 'Integrins/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Oxazines/*pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Syk Kinase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism']",,2010/03/26 06:00,2010/06/24 06:00,['2010/03/26 06:00'],"['2010/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34948-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-07-233692 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jun 3;115(22):4497-506. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-07-233692.

Two consecutive serological tests using ELISA were conducted for cattle at four beef breeding farms and nine dairy farms with an interval of 5 months. Assuming that sero-converted animals were newly infected, transmission parameters were estimated using a hierarchical Bayesian Poisson model. All tested herds had at least one positive animal at the first testing, but sero-prevalence considerably varied between herds. It is estimated that 0.62 animals were infected by one infected animal introduced into a fully susceptible population for both beef breeding and dairy farms during the 5-month interval. The 95% credible interval of the transmission parameter for the combined herds was 0.37-0.89 over this period. Asymptomatically infected animals with BLV can become the source of lifelong infection in herds. These estimated transmission parameters indicated that the early removal of infected animals with periodical tests could reduce the dissemination of BLV infection within herds.","['Tsutsui, Toshiyuki', 'Kobayashi, Sota', 'Hayama, Yoko', 'Nishiguchi, Akiko', 'Kameyama, Ken-ichiro', 'Konishi, Misako', 'Murakami, Kenji']","['Tsutsui T', 'Kobayashi S', 'Hayama Y', 'Nishiguchi A', 'Kameyama K', 'Konishi M', 'Murakami K']","['National Institute of Animal Health, 3-1-5 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0856, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Prev Vet Med,Preventive veterinary medicine,8217463,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/blood/epidemiology/prevention & control/*transmission', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Male', 'Markov Chains', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",,2010/03/26 06:00,2010/07/14 06:00,['2010/03/26 06:00'],"['2009/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/16 00:00 [revised]', '2010/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0167-5877(10)00059-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.prevetmed.2010.02.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Prev Vet Med. 2010 Jun 1;95(1-2):158-62. doi: 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2010.02.008.

This reaction is believed to be the result of exposure to ultraviolet light during the subsiding phase of an acute inflammatory reaction. It affects areas of the body that have been previously sunburned. We describe a 16-year-old girl who was receiving treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and experienced a second-degree solar burn reactivation reaction to methotrexate. The patient had a mild sunburn on her face and shoulders the day she went to the oncology clinic for her interim maintenance chemotherapy with vincristine 1.5 mg/m(2)/dose and methotrexate 100 mg/m(2)/dose. Three days later, she returned to the clinic with a 2-day history of fever (<or= 100.2 degrees F), nausea, vomiting, and malaise; the sunburn on her face and shoulders also had become severe, without further sun exposure. Laboratory results revealed elevated blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine concentrations, and her methotrexate level was elevated at 0.9 mM. The patient was diagnosed with acute renal failure, dehydration, methotrexate toxicity, and second-degree solar burn reactivation reaction. She was admitted to the children's hospital and treated with sodium bicarbonate, acetaminophen with codeine, ondansetron, and silvadene cream. On hospital day 3, the patient's methotrexate level decreased to less than 0.1 mM. The sunburn continued to heal, and after a 14-day hospital stay, complicated by a streptococcal infection, grade 3 mucositis, bacteremia, and mild gastritis and duodenitis, the patient recovered and was discharged. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a probable relationship (score of 6) between the patient's solar burn reactivation and methotrexate. Although methotrexate-induced solar burn reactivation is rare, clinicians should be aware of this potential adverse reaction and consider delaying administration of methotrexate by 5-7 days if a patient reports ultraviolet-related erythema in the past 2-4 days or presents with a notable sunburn.","['DeVore, Kelli J']",['DeVore KJ'],"['Pharmacy Department, Iowa Methodist Medical Center, Des Moines, Iowa 50309, USA. devorekj@ihs.org']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Acute Kidney Injury/chemically induced/*complications/drug therapy', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/therapeutic use', 'Blood Urea Nitrogen', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Sunburn/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ultraviolet Rays/*adverse effects', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",,2010/03/26 06:00,2010/06/25 06:00,['2010/03/26 06:00'],"['2010/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1592/phco.30.4.419 [doi]', '10.1592/phco.30.4.419 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2010 Apr;30(4):123e-6e. doi: 10.1592/phco.30.4.419.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, it is thought that trichomonal lysates and excretory-secretory products (ESP), as well as live T. vaginalis, could possibly interact with neutrophils in local tissues, including areas of inflammation induced by T. vaginalis in humans. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of T. vaginalis lysate on the fate of neutrophils. We found that T. vaginalis lysate inhibits apoptosis of human neutrophils as revealed by Giemsa stain. Less altered mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and surface CD16 receptor expression also supported the idea that neutrophil apoptosis is delayed after T. vaginalis lysate stimulation. In contrast, ESP stimulated-neutrophils were similar in apoptotic features of untreated neutrophils. Maintained caspase-3 and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) in neutrophils co-cultured with trichomonad lysate suggest that an intrinsic mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis was involved in T. vaginalis lysate-induced delayed neutrophil apoptosis; this phenomenon may contribute to local inflammation in trichomoniasis.","['Song, Hyun-Ouk', 'Lim, Young-Su', 'Moon, Sun-Joo', 'Ahn, Myoung-Hee', 'Ryu, Jae-Sook']","['Song HO', 'Lim YS', 'Moon SJ', 'Ahn MH', 'Ryu JS']","['Department of Environmental Biology & Medical Parasitology, Hanyang University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),Korean J Parasitol,The Korean journal of parasitology,9435800,"['0 (FCGR3B protein, human)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/physiology', 'Neutrophils/chemistry/*immunology', 'Receptors, IgG/analysis', 'Trichomonas vaginalis/*immunology']",,2010/03/25 06:00,2010/06/02 06:00,['2010/03/25 06:00'],"['2009/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2010/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3347/kjp.2010.48.1.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Parasitol. 2010 Mar;48(1):1-7. doi: 10.3347/kjp.2010.48.1.1.

To elucidate the mechanisms underlying microRNA-mediated antiviral activity, we modified the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of Coxsackievirus A21 to incorporate targets with varying degrees of homology to endogenous microRNAs. We show that microRNAs can interrupt the picornavirus life-cycle at multiple levels, including catalytic degradation of the viral RNA genome, suppression of cap-independent mRNA translation, and interference with genome encapsidation. In addition, we have examined the extent to which endogenous microRNAs can suppress viral replication in vivo and how viruses can overcome this inhibition by microRNA saturation in mouse cancer models.","['Kelly, Elizabeth J', 'Hadac, Elizabeth M', 'Cullen, Bryan R', 'Russell, Stephen J']","['Kelly EJ', 'Hadac EM', 'Cullen BR', 'Russell SJ']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn142 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cancer Vaccines/*genetics', 'Coxsackievirus Infections/*virology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enterovirus/*genetics/growth & development', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy/virology', 'Melanoma/*therapy/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Protein Biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,2010/03/25 06:00,2010/06/25 06:00,['2010/03/25 06:00'],"['2009/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.ppat.1000820 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2010 Mar 19;6(3):e1000820. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000820.,,,,20100319,PMC2841627,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to obtain a reliable estimate of the risk of EIC in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) by performing a meta-analysis of population-based cohort studies. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed using MEDLINE (1966-2009) and abstracts from recent international conferences. Eight population-based cohort studies comprising a total of 17,052 patients with IBD were available. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of EICs were pooled in a meta-analysis approach using STATA software. RESULTS: Overall, IBD patients were not at increased risk of EIC (SIR, 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96-1.27). However, site-specific analyses revealed that CD patients had an increased risk of cancer of the upper gastrointestinal tract (SIR 2.87, 95% CI 1.66-4.96), lung (SIR 1.82, 95% CI 1.18-2.81), urinary bladder (SIR 2.03, 95% CI 1.14-3.63), and skin (SIR 2.35, 95% CI 1.43-3.86). Patients with UC had a significantly increased risk of liver-biliary cancer (SIR 2.58, 95% CI 1.58-4.22) and leukemia (SIR 2.00, 95% CI 1.31-3.06) but a decreased risk of pulmonary cancer (SIR 0.39, 95% CI 0.20-0.74). CONCLUSIONS: Although the overall risk of EIC was not significantly increased among patients with IBD, the risk of individual cancer types differed from that of the background population as well as between CD and UC patients. These findings may primarily be explained by smoking habits, extra-intestinal manifestations of IBD, and involvement of the upper gastrointestinal tract in CD.","['Pedersen, Natalia', 'Duricova, Dana', 'Elkjaer, Margarita', 'Gamborg, Michael', 'Munkholm, Pia', 'Jess, Tine']","['Pedersen N', 'Duricova D', 'Elkjaer M', 'Gamborg M', 'Munkholm P', 'Jess T']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Herlev University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",United States,Am J Gastroenterol,The American journal of gastroenterology,0421030,,IM,"['Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colitis, Ulcerative/*complications/*epidemiology', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Crohn Disease/*complications/*epidemiology', 'Digestive System Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Risk', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/epidemiology']",34,2010/03/25 06:00,2010/08/14 06:00,['2010/03/25 06:00'],"['2010/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/14 06:00 [medline]']","['ajg2009760 [pii]', '10.1038/ajg.2009.760 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Gastroenterol. 2010 Jul;105(7):1480-7. doi: 10.1038/ajg.2009.760.

Ten eyes developed fluorescein-negative punctate keratopathy, and were examined by slit lamp and in vivo confocal biomicroscopy at days 1, 3-4 and 9-14 after the beginning of ocular symptoms. RESULTS: In vivo confocal microscopy revealed disseminated highly reflective granular irregular intraepithelial elements in the central cornea, which affected about 3% of epithelial cells. At day 1 of symptoms, these elements were present only in the basal epithelial layer (median 275.5/mm(2)), at days 3-4 they were mainly found in the basal (187.5/mm(2)) but also in the apical layers (96/mm(2)), at days 9-14 they mainly presented in more superficial layers (115/mm(2) apically vs. 15.5/mm(2) in the basal layers). DISCUSSION: The intraepithelial distribution of cells with a granular cytosolic signal evolved over time, reflecting the migration of the necrotic basal cells to the wing cell layer and finally to apical epithelial layers. The desquamation of the necrotic cells is related to the resolution of symptoms, according to the period of the epithelial cell turnover. By confocal microscopy, we could follow the intraepithelial route of cells damaged by Ara-C in vivo.","['Guthoff, Tanja', 'Tietze, Bettina', 'Meinhardt, Berit', 'Becher, Jan', 'Guthoff, Rainer']","['Guthoff T', 'Tietze B', 'Meinhardt B', 'Becher J', 'Guthoff R']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University of Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Ophthalmologica,Ophthalmologica.

SUMMARY: MDS are a variety of hematological disorders with differing time courses. Disease morbidities are primarily due to cytopenias and evolution to acute myeloid leukemia. Iron overload is a serious complication in patients with MDS due to the long-term use of red blood cell transfusions in patients with symptomatic anemia. Clinical consequences of iron overload include end-organ damage and dysfunction, an increased frequency of transplant-related complications, and reduced survival rates. To prevent these complications, recommendations for initiating and maintaining ICT should be followed by clinicians caring for patients with MDS and iron overload. CONCLUSION: As current therapeutic options for patients with MDS do not always reduce the transfusion burden, many patients will still need long-term transfusion therapy. Strategies for the management of iron overload in MDS should be considered early in the disease course and in appropriate patients in order to prevent negative clinical outcomes associated with excessive iron accumulation.","['Harvey, R Donald']",['Harvey RD'],"['Department of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. donald.harvey@emory.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,"['0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iron/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Iron Chelating Agents/administration & dosage', 'Iron Overload/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/epidemiology/mortality/*therapy', 'United States/epidemiology']",,2010/04/02 06:00,2010/06/22 06:00,['2010/03/25 06:00'],"['2010/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['67/7_Supplement_2/S3 [pii]', '10.2146/ajhp090645 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2010 Apr;67(7 Suppl 2):S3-9. doi: 10.2146/ajhp090645.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms by which such extracts work are largely unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Murine bone marrow (BM)-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and human monocyte U937 cells were treated in vitro with an extract prepared from pine cones (termed poly-phenylpropanoid polysaccharide complex, PPC). RESULTS: The components of the PPC were separated into different molecular weight fractions with distinct biological activities. One fraction, consisting of relatively high molecular weight material, was found to induce the differentiation of murine BM cells into immature DC, as well as the maturation of immature DCs into mature DCs. A second fraction, consisting of low molecular weight material, was found to inhibit the in vitro growth of the U937 cells and two other human cancer cell lines. The inhibition of tumor cell growth was found to be associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the induction of a mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway. CONCLUSION: The effects on dendritic cells and the inhibition of tumor growth, if they occur to a significant level in vivo, could help explain the apparent usefulness of PPC in the treatment of cancer.","['An, Wei-Wei', 'Kanazawa, Yasuko', 'Ozawa, Mutsumi', 'Nakaya, Kazuyasu', 'Saito, Takashi', 'Tanaka, Akiko', 'Bradley, William Guy']","['An WW', 'Kanazawa Y', 'Ozawa M', 'Nakaya K', 'Saito T', 'Tanaka A', 'Bradley WG']","['Department of Applied Life Sciences, Niigata University of Pharmacy and Applied Life Sciences, Niigata 956-8603, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Pinus/chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",,2010/03/25 06:00,2010/05/05 06:00,['2010/03/25 06:00'],"['2010/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [medline]']",['30/2/613 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2010 Feb;30(2):613-22.,,,['AT002883/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Main of study: To analyze the distribution of Ph chromosome-positive ALL patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Conventional cytogenetic analysis was performed on bone marrow cells at the time of diagnosis and/or relapse of 208 patients shown to have B-cell ALL. Fluorescent in situ hybridization studies using probe LSI BCR-ABL dual ES color (Abbott, Rungis, France) and other types of probes were performed on the available cytogenetic pellets. RESULTS: Thirty-three Ph chromosome-positive ALL patients were identified between 1981 and 2008. The Ph chromosome was present in 39.7% of the patients older than 25 years, but in only 4.3% of the patients younger than 15 years. A pseudodiploid karyotype was found in 68.75% of the patients and hypodiploidy in a further 15.6% of the patients. FISH studies revealed the breakpoint to be located in the major breakpoint cluster region in 20% of the patients and in the minor in the remaining 80% of the patients. Complex rearrangements of the derivative chromosomes 9 or 22 were identified in four patients, including a complex Ph translocation, t(9;22;X).

XRCC4 is important in maintaining the overall genome stability, and it is also thought to play a key role in human carcinogenesis. We investigated some novel polymorphic variants of XRCC4, including C-1622T (rs7727691), G-1394T (rs6869366), G-652T (rs2075685), C-571T (rs2075686), intron3 DIP (rs28360071), S247A (rs3734091) and intron7 DIP (rs28360317), and analyzed the association of specific genotype with susceptibility to childhood leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 266 children with leukemia and 266 age-matched healthy controls recruited from the China Medical Hospital in Central Taiwan were genotyped investigating the association of these polymorphisms with childhood leukemia. RESULTS: We found differences in frequency of the XRCC4 G-1394T and intron 3 genotype, but not the XRCC4 codon 247, or intron 7, between the childhood leukemia and control groups. Our data indicated the G allele of G-1394T and deletion of intron 3 are clear risk factors of susceptibility to childhood leukemia (p=0.0022 and 0.0075). As for XRCC4 C-1622T and C-571T, there was no difference in the distribution between the two groups. The analysis of joint effect for XRCC4 G-1394T and intron 3 showed that individuals with GT at G-1394T and DD at intron 3 present the highest potential for developing childhood leukemia than other groups (odds ratio=4.94, 95% confidence interval=1.01-24.27, p=0.0404). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the G allele of XRCC4 G-1394T and deletion of intron 3 may be responsible for childhood leukemia and may be useful in early detection of child leukemia.","['Wu, Kang-Hsi', 'Wang, Chung-Hsing', 'Yang, Yung-Li', 'Peng, Ching-Tien', 'Lin, Wei-De', 'Tsai, Fuu-Jen', 'Lin, Dong-Tsamn', 'Bau, Da-Tian']","['Wu KH', 'Wang CH', 'Yang YL', 'Peng CT', 'Lin WD', 'Tsai FJ', 'Lin DT', 'Bau DT']","['Department of Pediatrics, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (XRCC4 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Taiwan']",,2010/03/25 06:00,2010/05/05 06:00,['2010/03/25 06:00'],"['2010/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [medline]']",['30/2/529 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2010 Feb;30(2):529-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The effects of GSI were diverse depending upon the combination of cells and GSI. GSI treatment suppressed the growth of most of the cell lines examined. Conversely, the growth of some cell lines were promoted by GSI-XXI. GSI-XXI treatment reduced the amount of cleaved Notch1 protein and HES1 mRNA in the cells, which means that it suppressed Notch activity. The treatment up-regulated mRNA of nuclear factor kappa-B1 (NFKB1) and v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (RELA), which can be a cause of growth promotion.

The present investigation was, therefore, undertaken to examine whether addition of curcumin to FOLFOX is a superior therapeutic strategy for chemo-surviving cells. Forty-eight-hour treatment of colon cancer HCT-116 and HT-29 cells with FOLFOX resulted in 60-70% survival, accompanied by a marked activation of insulin like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and minor to moderate increase in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (HER-2) as well as v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and cyclin-D1. However, inclusion of curcumin to continued FOLFOX treatment for another 48 h greatly reduced the survival of these cells, accompanied by a concomitant reduction in activation of EGFR, HER-2, IGF-1R and AKT, as well as expression of COX-2 and cyclin-D1. More importantly, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib or attenuation of IGF-1R expression by the corresponding si-RNA caused a 30-60% growth inhibition of chemo-surviving HCT-116 cells. However, curcumin alone was found to be more effective than both gefitinib and IGF-1R si-RNA mediated growth inhibition of chemo-surviving HCT-116 cells and addition of FOLFOX to curcumin did not increase the growth inhibitory effect of curcumin. Our data suggest that inclusion of curcumin in conventional chemotherapeutic regimens could be an effective strategy to prevent the emergence of chemoresistant colon cancer cells.","['Patel, Bhaumik B', 'Gupta, Deepshika', 'Elliott, Althea A', 'Sengupta, Vivek', 'Yu, Yingjie', 'Majumdar, Adhip P N']","['Patel BB', 'Gupta D', 'Elliott AA', 'Sengupta V', 'Yu Y', 'Majumdar AP']","['Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Karmanos Cancer Center, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '04ZR38536J (Oxaliplatin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Curcumin/administration & dosage', 'ErbB Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/administration & dosage', 'Oxaliplatin', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",,2010/03/25 06:00,2010/05/05 06:00,['2010/03/25 06:00'],"['2010/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/05 06:00 [medline]']",['30/2/319 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2010 Feb;30(2):319-25.,,,['R01 AG014343/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC3836443,['NIHMS521056'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE SUMMARY: A 26-year-old man with CML who had taken imatinib 400 mg daily for 7 years with no complications presented with right upper quadrant pain. Laboratory test results included alanine aminotransferase 1069 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 481 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 124 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, albumin 4.0 g/dL, and international normalized ratio 1.08. Liver biopsy showed acute lobular hepatitis favoring a drug-induced etiology, and a diagnosis of imatinib-induced hepatotoxicity was made. The patient's only lifestyle modification prior to the diagnosis of hepatotoxicity was daily ingestion of Panax ginseng via energy drinks for the past 3 months. Both imatinib and ginseng were discontinued, and the patient was treated with a short course of corticosteroids. Imatinib was later restarted at the same dose with no recurrent elevations in his liver enzyme levels. DISCUSSION: Imatinib-associated hepatotoxicity usually presents within 1-2 years of therapy initiation, with the median time to hepatotoxicity being 100 days. Ginseng is an herb that is not known to be hepatotoxic. In vivo, ginseng is known to inhibit CYP3A4, the primary enzyme involved in the metabolism of imatinib. We propose that our patient's late-onset imatinib-associated hepatotoxicity was due to an interaction between ginseng and imatinib through CYP3A4. Based on the Naranjo probability scale, it is probable that imatinib caused this patient's hepatotoxicity, and the Horn drug interaction probability scale also indicates a probable interaction between imatinib and ginseng.

Multiple MLL fusion partners have been identified, complicating the diagnostic evaluation of MLL rearrangements. We analyzed molecular markers of MLL rearrangement for use in rapid diagnostic assays and found the immunomodulatory protein, Galectin-1 (Gal-1), to be selectively expressed in MLL-rearranged B-ALL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Transcriptional profiling of ALL subtypes revealed selective overexpression of Gal-1 in MLL-rearranged ALLs. For this reason, we analyzed Gal-1 protein expression in MLL-germline and MLL-rearranged adult and infant pediatric B-ALLs and cell lines by immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and intracellular flow cytometry of viable tumor cell suspensions. Because deregulated gene expression in MLL-rearranged leukemias may be related to the altered histone methyltransferase activity of the MLL fusion protein complex, we also analyzed histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) dimethylation in the LGALS1 promoter region using chromatin immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: Gal-1 transcripts were significantly more abundant in MLL-rearranged B-ALLs. All 32 primary MLL-rearranged B-ALLs exhibited abundant Gal-1 immunostaining, regardless of the translocation partner, whereas only 2 of 81 germline-MLL B-ALLs expressed Gal-1. In addition, Gal-1 was selectively detected in newly diagnosed MLL-rearranged B-ALLs by intracellular flow cytometry. The LGALS1 promoter H3K79 was significantly hypermethylated in MLL-rearranged B-ALLs compared with MLL-germline B-ALLs and normal pre-B cells. CONCLUSION: In B-ALL, Gal-1 is a highly sensitive and specific biomarker of MLL rearrangement that is likely induced by a MLL-dependent epigenetic modification.","['Juszczynski, Przemyslaw', 'Rodig, Scott J', 'Ouyang, Jing', ""O'Donnell, Evan"", 'Takeyama, Kunihiko', 'Mlynarski, Wojciech', 'Mycko, Katarzyna', 'Szczepanski, Tomasz', 'Gaworczyk, Anna', 'Krivtsov, Andrei', 'Faber, Joerg', 'Sinha, Amit U', 'Rabinovich, Gabriel A', 'Armstrong, Scott A', 'Kutok, Jeffery L', 'Shipp, Margaret A']","['Juszczynski P', 'Rodig SJ', 'Ouyang J', ""O'Donnell E"", 'Takeyama K', 'Mlynarski W', 'Mycko K', 'Szczepanski T', 'Gaworczyk A', 'Krivtsov A', 'Faber J', 'Sinha AU', 'Rabinovich GA', 'Armstrong SA', 'Kutok JL', 'Shipp MA']","[""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; Department of Pathology, Brigham & Women's Hospital,75 Francis Street, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Galectin 1)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (LGALS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (saccharide-binding proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Galectin 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Infant', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic/physiology']",,2010/03/25 06:00,2010/08/07 06:00,['2010/03/25 06:00'],"['2010/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-09-2765 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-2765 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Apr 1;16(7):2122-30. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-2765.

However, the majority of cases do not harbor mutations in these genes. We hypothesized that additional drivers of tumor behavior would be contained within areas of consistent genomic copy number change, especially those associated with the WT risk groups defined by the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed high-resolution (Affymetrix 250K single nucleotide polymorphism array) genomic copy number profiles of over 100 tumors from selected risk groups treated under the SIOP protocols, further characterizing genes of interest by sequencing, Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification, or fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULTS: We identified FBXW7, an E3 ubiquitin ligase component, as a novel Wilms' tumor gene, mutated or deleted in approximately 4% of tumors examined. Strikingly, 3 of 14 (21%) of tumors with epithelial type histology after neoadjuvant chemotherapy had FBXW7 aberrations, whereas a fourth WT patient had germline mutations in both FBXW7 and WT1. We also showed that MYCN copy number gain, detected in 9 of 104 (8.7%) of cases, is relatively common in WT and significantly more so in tumors of the high risk diffuse anaplastic subtype (6 of 19, 32%). CONCLUSIONS: Because MYCN is itself a target of FBXW7-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, these results suggest that a common pathway is dysregulated by different mechanisms in various WT subtypes. Emerging therapies that target MYCN, which is amplified in several other pediatric cancers, may therefore be of value in high risk Wilms' tumor.","['Williams, Richard D', 'Al-Saadi, Reem', 'Chagtai, Tasnim', 'Popov, Sergey', 'Messahel, Boo', 'Sebire, Neil', 'Gessler, Manfred', 'Wegert, Jenny', 'Graf, Norbert', 'Leuschner, Ivo', 'Hubank, Mike', 'Jones, Chris', 'Vujanic, Gordan', 'Pritchard-Jones, Kathy']","['Williams RD', 'Al-Saadi R', 'Chagtai T', 'Popov S', 'Messahel B', 'Sebire N', 'Gessler M', 'Wegert J', 'Graf N', 'Leuschner I', 'Hubank M', 'Jones C', 'Vujanic G', 'Pritchard-Jones K']","['Section of Paediatric Oncology, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (MYCN protein, human)', '0 (N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'F-Box Proteins/*genetics', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Dosage/physiology', 'Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Mothers', 'Mutation', 'N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics', 'Wilms Tumor/classification/*genetics/pathology']",,2010/03/25 06:00,2010/08/07 06:00,['2010/03/25 06:00'],"['2010/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-09-2890 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-2890 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2010 Apr 1;16(7):2036-45. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-2890.

A recent genome-wide association study of CLL identified seven genetic variants that increased the risk of CLL within a European population. METHODS: We evaluated the association of these variants, or variants in linkage disequilibrium with these variants, with CLL risk in an independent sample of 438 CLL cases and 328 controls. RESULTS: Of these seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), six had P trend < 0.05 and had estimated odds ratios (OR) that were strikingly comparable to those of the previous study. Associations were seen for rs9378805 [OR, 1.47; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.19-1.80; P trend = 0.0003] near IRF4 and rs735665 near GRAMD1B (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.14-1.89; P trend = 0.003). However, no associations (P > 0.05) were found for rs11083846, nor were any found for any SNP in linkage disequilibrium with rs11083846. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the previous findings and further support the role of a genetic basis in the etiology of CLL; however, more research is needed to elucidate the causal SNP(s) and the potential manner in which these SNPs or linked SNPs function in CLL pathogenesis.","['Slager, Susan L', 'Goldin, Lynn R', 'Strom, Sara S', 'Lanasa, Mark C', 'Spector, Logan G', 'Rassenti, Laura', 'Leis, Jose F', 'Camp, Nicola J', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Vachon, Celine M', 'Glenn, Martha', 'Weinberg, J Brice', 'Rabe, Kari G', 'Cunningham, Julie M', 'Achenbach, Sara J', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Marti, Gerald E', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Caporaso, Neil E', 'Cerhan, James R']","['Slager SL', 'Goldin LR', 'Strom SS', 'Lanasa MC', 'Spector LG', 'Rassenti L', 'Leis JF', 'Camp NJ', 'Kay NE', 'Vachon CM', 'Glenn M', 'Weinberg JB', 'Rabe KG', 'Cunningham JM', 'Achenbach SJ', 'Hanson CA', 'Marti GE', 'Call TG', 'Caporaso NE', 'Cerhan JR']","['Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, 200 1st Street Southwest, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. slager@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",,2010/03/25 06:00,2010/07/10 06:00,['2010/03/25 06:00'],"['2010/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-09-1217 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-09-1217 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2010 Apr;19(4):1098-102. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-09-1217.

However, no common biological abnormalities have been identified to date. We profiled 615 microRNAs (miRNA) in pediatric malignant GCTs, controls, and GCT cell lines (48 samples in total) and re-analyzed available miRNA expression data in adult gonadal malignant GCTs. We applied the bioinformatic algorithm Sylamer to identify miRNAs that are of biological importance by inducing global shifts in mRNA levels. The most significant differentially expressed miRNAs in malignant GCTs were all from the miR-371-373 and miR-302 clusters (adjusted P < 0.00005), which were overexpressed regardless of histologic subtype [yolk sac tumor (YST)/seminoma/embryonal carcinoma (EC)], site (gonadal/extragonadal), or patient age (pediatric/adult). Sylamer revealed that the hexamer GCACTT, complementary to the 2- to 7-nucleotide miRNA seed AAGUGC shared by six members of the miR-371-373 and miR-302 clusters, was the only sequence significantly enriched in the 3'-untranslated region of mRNAs downregulated in pediatric malignant GCTs (as a group), YSTs and ECs, and in adult YSTs (all versus nonmalignant tissue controls; P < 0.05). For the pediatric samples, downregulated genes containing the 3'-untranslated region GCACTT showed significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms related to cancer-associated processes, whereas for downregulated genes lacking GCACTT, Gene Ontology terms generally represented metabolic processes only, with few genes per term (adjusted P < 0.05). We conclude that the miR-371-373 and miR-302 clusters are universally overexpressed in malignant GCTs and coordinately downregulate mRNAs involved in biologically significant pathways.","['Palmer, Roger D', 'Murray, Matthew J', 'Saini, Harpreet K', 'van Dongen, Stijn', 'Abreu-Goodger, Cei', 'Muralidhar, Balaji', 'Pett, Mark R', 'Thornton, Claire M', 'Nicholson, James C', 'Enright, Anton J', 'Coleman, Nicholas']","['Palmer RD', 'Murray MJ', 'Saini HK', 'van Dongen S', 'Abreu-Goodger C', 'Muralidhar B', 'Pett MR', 'Thornton CM', 'Nicholson JC', 'Enright AJ', 'Coleman N']","['Medical Research Council Cancer Cell Unit, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 0XZ, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Seminoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Testicular Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,2010/03/25 06:00,2010/05/04 06:00,['2010/03/25 06:00'],"['2010/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-3301 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-3301 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2010 Apr 1;70(7):2911-23. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-3301.

We previously showed that heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) underlies this resistance of AML to tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis. Here, we describe a mechanism by which HO-1 is a silent antiapoptotic factor only revealed when NF-kappaB is inhibited, thus providing a secondary antiapoptotic mechanism to ensure AML cell survival and chemoresistance. We show that inhibition of NF-kappaB increased HO-1 expression in primary AML cells compared with that of nonmalignant cells. In addition, we observed this suppressed HO-1 level in AML cells compared with CD34(+) nonmalignant control cells. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and small interfering RNA knockdown, we showed that the NF-kappaB subunits p50 and p65 control this suppression of HO-1 in AML cells. Finally, we showed that inhibition of HO-1 and NF-kappaB in combination significantly induced apoptosis in AML cells but not in noncancerous control cells.

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate and characterize the outcomes of patients receiving low dose rasburicase for treatment or prophylaxis of hyperuricemia secondary to TLS. PATIENTS/METHODS: A retrospective chart review between April 1, 2007 and September 31, 2008 was completed. All adult patients who received a dose of 0.05mg/kg with either a leukemia or lymphoma diagnosis in addition to at least two TLS risk factors: WBC >/= 50 x 109/L, LDH 2 x ULN, uric acid >/= 8 mg/dl, SCr >/= 1.5 mg/dl were included. Forty-eight patients received rasburicase for prophylaxis (n = 18) or treatment (n = 30) of TLS. RESULTS: Forty patients achieved and maintained a uric acid less than 8 mg/dL, 24 h after receipt of a single dose of rasburicase without the requirement for renal replacement therapy. A statistically significant decrease in UA was achieved in all patients when compared to baseline (p < 0.001). Cost analysis revealed a $ 1.96 million (96%) direct cost savings for the 48 patients in this study when compared to the cost of manufacturer's dosing recommendation. CONCLUSIONS: Low dose rasburicase was efficacious and cost effective for both prophylaxis and treatment of TLS.

While most infected individuals remain asymptomatic, 3-5% will eventually develop adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) or tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM) after a clinical latency that can span years (TSP/HAM) to decades (ATLL). The major oncogenic determinant among HTLV-1 proteins is the Tax transactivator, which influences the expression and function of a great number of cellular proteins, drives cell proliferation, reduces cell death, and induces genetic instability. The present review is focused on the current knowledge of p13, an HTLV-1 accessory protein targeted to the inner mitochondrial membrane and, under certain conditions, to the nucleus. In mitochondria, p13 produces an inward K+current that results in an increased production of ROS by mitochondria. These effects are linked to the protein's effects on cell turnover which include activation of primary T-cells and reduced proliferation/sensitization to death of tumor cells. Recent findings suggest that in the presence of Tax, p13 is subjected to ubiquitylation and partly targeted to the nucleus. Nuclear p13 binds Tax and inhibits its transcriptional activity. These findings suggest that the protein might exert distinct functions depending on its intracellular localization and influence both the turnover of infected cells and the balance between viral latency and productive infection.","['Silic-Benussi, Micol', 'Biasiotto, Roberta', 'Andresen, Vibeke', 'Franchini, Genoveffa', ""D'Agostino, Donna M"", 'Ciminale, Vincenzo']","['Silic-Benussi M', 'Biasiotto R', 'Andresen V', 'Franchini G', ""D'Agostino DM"", 'Ciminale V']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Mol Aspects Med,Molecular aspects of medicine,7603128,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism']",,2010/03/25 06:00,2011/03/15 06:00,['2010/03/25 06:00'],"['2010/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0098-2997(10)00020-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mam.2010.03.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Aspects Med. 2010 Oct;31(5):350-8. doi: 10.1016/j.mam.2010.03.001.

Intrathecal administration of the folate antagonist methotrexate (MTX) is necessary to prevent leukemic relapse within the central nervous system, but is suspected to contribute to treatment-induced cognitive dysfunction. To better elucidate the underlying pathophysiology, we sought to establish a rodent model of the cognitive and neurotoxic effects resulting from direct administration of MTX into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). MTX or artificial CSF was injected via transcutaneous puncture at the level of the cisterna magna. Subsequent behavioral tests were designed to assess cognitive domains frequently impaired among children treated for ALL. MTX administration produced both recognition and spatial memory deficits, without altering general activity or motor coordination. In addition, MTX significantly reduced folate levels in both CSF and serum and increased CSF homocysteine. Thus, we have established an animal model that mimics the clinical effects of prophylactic intrathecal MTX on cognitive function. Using this model we can further study the pathophysiology of MTX-induced cognitive dysfunction and test protective interventions.","['Li, Yan', 'Vijayanathan, Veena', 'Gulinello, Maria', 'Cole, Peter D']","['Li Y', 'Vijayanathan V', 'Gulinello M', 'Cole PD']","['Department of Pediatrics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pharmacol Biochem Behav,"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",0367050,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Behavior, Animal/drug effects', 'Cisterna Magna', 'Cognition Disorders/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Folic Acid/blood/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Homocysteine/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Inflammation Mediators/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Memory Disorders/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/chemically induced', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Motor Activity/drug effects', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Psychomotor Performance/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Long-Evans', 'Recognition, Psychology/drug effects', 'Time Factors']",,2010/03/25 06:00,2010/08/19 06:00,['2010/03/25 06:00'],"['2010/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2010/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0091-3057(10)00072-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.pbb.2010.03.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Biochem Behav. 2010 Jun;95(4):428-33. doi: 10.1016/j.pbb.2010.03.003.

Chitotriosidase (CHIT) and mannose-binding lectin (MBL) are part of the innate immune system. Polymorphism in the CHIT-coding gene (CHIT1) may be associated with Gram-negative sepsis in children with AML, and polymorphism in the MBL-coding gene (MBL2) seems to modify the risk of infections in several patient groups. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible associations between polymorphisms in CHIT1, MBL2 and sepsis in adult patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy for AML. We included 190 patients treated with 526 cycles of chemotherapy. The follow-up period was 6 months from the diagnosis of AML. Prophylactic antibiotics were not used. We identified 604 febrile episodes with 246 episodes of sepsis. Thirty-two patients (17%) either died from infection or infection was a major concomitant factor for death. No significant associations between CHIT1 polymorphism and sepsis (P = 0.85) or death caused by sepsis (P = 0.14) were found. Furthermore, no significant associations between MBL2 polymorphism and sepsis (P = 0.76) or death caused by sepsis (P = 0.24) were observed. The severe and long-lasting neutropenia and mucositis after chemotherapy may explain why the MBL system does not protect against sepsis in patients with AML. Replacement therapy with recombinant MBL is not likely to decrease the risk of sepsis in patients with AML.","['Klostergaard, Anja', 'Steffensen, Rudi', 'Moller, Jens K', 'Peterslund, Niels', 'Juhl-Christensen, Caroline', 'Molle, Ingolf']","['Klostergaard A', 'Steffensen R', 'Moller JK', 'Peterslund N', 'Juhl-Christensen C', 'Molle I']","['Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus C, Denmark. anja.klostergaard@jubii.dk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (MBL2 protein, human)', '0 (Mannose-Binding Lectin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Hexosaminidases)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (chitotriosidase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/etiology/genetics/immunology', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/etiology/genetics/immunology', 'Hexosaminidases/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Mannose-Binding Lectin/*genetics/pharmacology', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis/*etiology/*genetics/immunology/prevention & control', 'Young Adult']",,2010/03/25 06:00,2010/08/21 06:00,['2010/03/25 06:00'],"['2010/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1443 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01443.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 Jul;85(1):58-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01443.x.

The current study was designed to provide additional data in this regard. METHODS: The Mayo Clinic cytogenetics database spanning the years 1989-2008 was screened for chromosome 9p24 abnormalities. Bone marrow (BM) morphology was re-reviewed and relevant clinical information retrospectively obtained. Structural abnormalities of JAK2 were examined by FISH and JAK2V617F mutation analysis. RESULTS: Among 24 262 unique patient cytogenetic studies, chromosome 9p24 abnormalities were identified in 25 patients ( approximately 0.06%): 12 with myeloid and 13 with lymphoid neoplasms. The associated karyotype was complex in 12 of the 13 lymphoid but in only four of the 12 myeloid cases. Archived BM was available in 23 cases that allowed additional FISH studies and JAK2V617F mutation analysis. FISH analysis disclosed JAK2 involvement in 10 patients including five myeloid and five lymphoid cases; the associated karyotype was complex in all the lymphoid but in none of the myeloid cases. Five patients displayed previously undescribed JAK2 translocations: t(8;9)(q22;p24), t(9;17)(p24;q23), t(4;9)(q25;p24), t(2;9)(p21;p24) and t(8;9)(q13;p24). JAK2-associated chromosomal translocations, in a non-complex karyotype setting, were documented in four patients, all of whom carried a diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and harbored JAK2V617F. Two patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma displayed complex karyotype and JAK2 amplification by FISH. CONCLUSIONS: Chromosome 9p24 abnormalities are rare and do not always involve JAK2. The subset with JAK2 translocations are usually associated with MPN and harbor JAK2V617F, suggesting a cause-effect relationship. The current study also describes five novel translocations involving JAK2.","['Patnaik, Mrinal M', 'Knudson, Ryan A', 'Gangat, Naseema', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Pardanani, Animesh', 'Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Ketterling, Rhett P']","['Patnaik MM', 'Knudson RA', 'Gangat N', 'Hanson CA', 'Pardanani A', 'Tefferi A', 'Ketterling RP']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Amino Acid Substitution', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/enzymology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Polycythemia Vera/enzymology/genetics', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/enzymology/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2010/03/25 06:00,2010/07/16 06:00,['2010/03/25 06:00'],"['2010/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1428 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01428.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 Jun;84(6):518-24. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2010.01428.x.

Despite the genetically heterogeneous nature of these alterations, available data indicate that CML patients displaying complex variant translocations (CVTs) do not exhibit a less favorable outcome as compared to individuals presenting conventional Ph-positive CML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report our experience with 10 CML patients carrying CVTs among 153 newly diagnosed cases followed at our Institution. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Unlike previously published reports, in our series only two CML patients exhibiting CVTs achieved an optimal response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) treatment. The remaining eight patients obtained either a suboptimal response or failed drug therapy. Our data suggest that the presence of CVTs at diagnosis might confer an unfavorable clinical outcome, as these genetic alterations might be markers of genomic instability and indicate a higher likelihood of disease progression.","['Stagno, Fabio', 'Vigneri, Paolo', 'Del Fabro, Vittorio', 'Stella, Stefania', 'Cupri, Alessandra', 'Massimino, Michele', 'Consoli, Carla', 'Tambe, Loredana', 'Consoli, Maria Letizia', 'Antolino, Agostino', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco']","['Stagno F', 'Vigneri P', 'Del Fabro V', 'Stella S', 'Cupri A', 'Massimino M', 'Consoli C', 'Tambe L', 'Consoli ML', 'Antolino A', 'Di Raimondo F']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Sections of Hematology, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Risk Factors', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2010/03/25 06:00,2010/06/05 06:00,['2010/03/25 06:00'],"['2010/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/02841861003660031 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2010 May;49(4):506-8. doi: 10.3109/02841861003660031.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study the possible in vitro antitumor activity and immunomodulatory effects of five species of Euphorbia, an important genus of Euphorbiaceae, including E. petiolata, E. hebecarpa, E. osyridea, E. microciadia, and E. heteradenia were investigated using cytotoxicity and cell proliferation assays. Among different tumor cell lines, the most sensitive cell line to methanolic extracts of the plants was determined as follows. Hela cervical cancer cells to E. hebecarpa and E. microciadia, K562 leukemia cells to E. petiolata and E. heteradenia, and Fen bladder cancer cells to E. osyridea. The methanolic extracts were then fractionated into hexane, n-butanol, ethyl acetate, and water and the effect of these fractions was tested for cytotoxic activity on the selected cell lines. The results indicated the significant stronger antiproliferatory effect of the hexane factions in all the plants when compared with other ones. The methanolic extracts of the plants were also studied for their effects on the activation of the lymphocytes. All of the extracts showed stimulatory effects on the proliferation of the lymphocytes at lower concentrations. After further fractionation of the extracts, the butanolic and hexane fractions showed the highest activity on the lymphocyte activation. In conclusion, all the plants studied had the capacity to inhibit proliferation of tumor cells with beneficial immunomodulatory effects on the lymphocytes. This dual effect of the plants indicates their value for further investigations as antitumor agents.","['Amirghofran, Zahra', 'Malek-hosseini, Saeed', 'Gholmoghaddam, Hossein', 'Kalalinia, Fatemeh']","['Amirghofran Z', 'Malek-hosseini S', 'Gholmoghaddam H', 'Kalalinia F']","['Department of Immunology, Medical School, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. amirghz@sums.ac.ir']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,8800150,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Euphorbia/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Male', 'Plant Components, Aerial/chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Species Specificity']",,2010/03/25 06:00,2011/05/27 06:00,['2010/03/25 06:00'],"['2010/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08923971003699018 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol. 2011 Mar;33(1):34-42. doi: 10.3109/08923971003699018.

Several breakpoint cluster region (Bcr)-Abl kinase domain mutations are sensitive to INNO-406 in vitro, including mutations that involve a phenylalanine-to-leucine or phenylalanine-to-valine substitution at codon 317 (F317L and F317V, respectively). In the current study, the authors evaluated the use of INNO-406 in patients with Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) after imatinib resistance or intolerance. METHODS: : A dose-escalation study was conducted at a starting dose of oral INNO-406 30 mg once daily. Cohorts of at least 3 patients were treated at each dose level until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached. Twice-daily dosing also was evaluated. Therapy was allowed to continue for a maximum of 24 months. RESULTS: : INNO-406 was administered to 56 patients with imatinib resistance (n = 40) or intolerance (n = 16). Other previous treatments included nilotinib (n = 20 patients), dasatinib (n = 26 patients), and dasatinib/nilotinib (n = 9 patients). Common mutations at the time of study entry included a tyrosine-to-histidine substitution at codon 253 (Y253H) (n = 6 patients), a glycine-to-glutamic acid substitution at codon 250 (G250E) (n = 4 patients), a threonine-to-isoleucine substitution at codon 315 (T315I) (n = 4 patients), and F317L (n = 3 patients). Of 31 patients with CML in chronic phase who received INNO-406, the major cytogenetic response rate was 19%. No responses were observed in patients who had CML in accelerated phase, CML in blastic phase, or Ph-positive ALL. The dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) at an INNO-406 dose of 480 mg twice daily were liver function abnormalities and thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS: : INNO-406 had anti-CML efficacy in a heavily pretreated study population. On the basis of the classic determinations of both DLT and MTD, the recommended phase 2 dose of oral INNO-406 was 240 mg twice daily. Lower doses of INNO-406 may be equally effective and should be explored.","['Kantarjian, Hagop', 'le Coutre, Phillipp', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Kimura, Shinya', 'Ottmann, Oliver']","['Kantarjian H', 'le Coutre P', 'Cortes J', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J', 'Nagler A', 'Hochhaus A', 'Kimura S', 'Ottmann O']","['Leukemia Department, The University of Texas M.

The effects of FSS were determined in different cell culture models. With respect to stimulation of blood circulation, FSS inhibited ADP-mediated platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner. In order to reveal the hematopoietic effect of this decoction, FSS was applied onto cultured K562 human leukemia cells and Hep3B human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Application of FSS in cultured K562 cells inhibited cell proliferation and subsequently induced the production of hemoglobin. Additionally, the mRNA expression of erythropoietin (EPO) was induced in a dose-dependent manner when FSS was applied to Hep3B cells.

Traditionally, such a selection problem has been formulated as a multiple testing problem. When the genes of interest are genes with unequal distribution of gene expression under different conditions, multiple testing methods provide an appropriate framework for addressing the selection problems. However, when the genes of interest are a set of genes with the largest difference in gene expression under different conditions, multiple testing methods do not directly address the selection goal and sometimes lead to biased conclusions. For such cases, we propose two methods based on the statistical ranking and selection framework to directly address the selection goal. The proposed methods have an inherent optimization nature in that the selection is optimized according to either a prespecified minimum correct selection ratio (r* selection) or probability of making a correct selection (P* selection). These methods are compared with the multiple testing method that controls the tail probability of the proportion of false positives. Both simulation studies and real data applications provide insight into the fundamental difference between the multiple testing methods and the proposed methods in the way of addressing different selection goals. It has been shown that the proposed methods provide a clear advantage over the multiple testing methods when the goal is to select the most significant genes (not all the significant genes). When the goal is to select all the significant genes, the proposed methods perform equally well as the current multiple testing methods. Another advantage provided by the proposed methods is their ability to detect noisy data and therefore suggest no sensible selection can be made.","['Cui, Xinping', 'Zhao, Haibing', 'Wilson, Jason']","['Cui X', 'Zhao H', 'Wilson J']","['Department of Statistics, University of California, Riverside, California, USA. xinping.cui@ucr.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biopharm Stat,Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics,9200436,['0 (Apolipoprotein A-I)'],IM,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Apolipoprotein A-I/deficiency/genetics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*statistics & numerical data', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', '*Models, Statistical', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*statistics & numerical data', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,2010/03/24 06:00,2010/06/18 06:00,['2010/03/24 06:00'],"['2010/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['920113449 [pii]', '10.1080/10543400903572720 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biopharm Stat. 2010 Mar;20(2):223-39. doi: 10.1080/10543400903572720.,,,"['R01 AI078885/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI078885-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI078885/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2909494,['NIHMS179474'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has led to speculation that the risk of childhood leukaemia arising from internal exposure to radiation following the intake of radioactive material released from nuclear facilities has been substantially underestimated. The radionuclides discharged from many nuclear installations are similar to those released into the global environment by atmospheric nuclear weapons testing, which was at its height in the late-1950s and early-1960s. Measurements of anthropogenic radionuclides in members of the general public resident in the vicinity of Sellafield and Dounreay have found levels that do not differ greatly from those in persons living remote from nuclear installations that are due to ubiquitous exposure to the radioactive debris of nuclear weapons testing. Therefore, if the leukaemia risk to children resulting from deposition within the body of radioactive material discharged from nuclear facilities has been grossly underestimated, then a pronounced excess of childhood leukaemia would have been expected as a consequence of the short period of intense atmospheric weapons testing. We have examined childhood leukaemia incidence in 11 large-scale cancer registries in three continents for which data were available at least as early as 1962. We found no evidence of a wave of excess cases corresponding to the peak of radioactive fallout from atmospheric weapons testing. The absence of a discernible increase in the incidence of childhood leukaemia following the period of maximum exposure to the radioactive debris of this testing weighs heavily against the suggestion that conventional methods are seriously in error when assessing the risk of childhood leukaemia from exposure to man-made radionuclides released from nuclear installations.","['Wakeford, Richard', 'Darby, Sarah C', 'Murphy, Michael F G']","['Wakeford R', 'Darby SC', 'Murphy MF']","['Dalton Nuclear Institute, The University of Manchester, Pariser Building, G Floor, Sackville Street, PO Box 88, Manchester, M60 1QD, UK.

Lymphomas may clinically, radiologically, and morphologically mimic both benign and neoplastic conditions. We describe two cases of lymphoid malignancies predominantly involving the breast, both presenting diagnostic dilemmas. The first case, ALK-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphoma involving a seroma associated with a breast implant, is an emerging clinicopathologic entity. Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma has been identified in association with breast implants and seroma formation relatively recently. The second case, hairy cell leukemia involving the breast and ipsilateral axillary sentinel lymph node, is, to our knowledge, the first reported case of hairy cell leukemia involving the breast at the time of diagnosis. While a localized bone lesion was present at time of diagnosis, bone marrow involvement was relatively mild in comparison to that seen in the breast and lymph node. In the first case, lymphoma occurred in a clinical setting where malignancy was unsuspected, highlighting the importance of careful morphologic evaluation of paucicellular samples, as well as awareness of rare clinicopathologic entities, in avoiding a misdiagnosis of a benign inflammatory infiltrate. In the second case, the lymphoid neoplasm exhibited classic morphologic and immunophenotypic features, but presented at an unusual site of involvement. Knowledge of the patient's concurrent diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia involving the bone marrow and bone helped avoid a misdiagnosis of carcinoma rather than lymphoma.","['Farkash, Evan A', 'Ferry, Judith A', 'Harris, Nancy Lee', 'Hochberg, Ephraim P', 'Takvorian, Ronald W', 'Zuckerman, Dan S', 'Sohani, Aliyah R']","['Farkash EA', 'Ferry JA', 'Harris NL', 'Hochberg EP', 'Takvorian RW', 'Zuckerman DS', 'Sohani AR']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Hematop,Journal of hematopathology,101491976,,,,,2009/01/01 00:00,2009/01/01 00:01,['2010/03/24 06:00'],"['2009/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12308-009-0043-y [doi]'],epublish,J Hematop. 2009 Aug 20;2(4):237-44. doi: 10.1007/s12308-009-0043-y.,,,,20090820,PMC2798933,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anaplastic large cell lymphoma', 'Anaplastic lymphoma kinase', 'Breast', 'Breast implant', 'Hairy cell leukemia', 'Primary breast lymphoma', 'Seroma', 'T-cell neoplasm']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific mutations or rearrangements leading to constitutive activation of growth factor receptors or cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases are now recognised as recurrent genetic events characterising the group of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). A newly introduced subgroup consists of patients with persistent eosinophilia and myeloid or lymphoid proliferations harbouring specific genetic changes involving platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta (PDGFRA and PDGFRB) or fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). The clinical relevance of recognising myeloid neoplasms with aberrant tyrosine kinase activity is based in novel treatment options with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) without increased blasts are further divided into subtypes of refractory cytopaenias with unilineage dysplasia. A new provisional entity is refractory cytopaenia of childhood. Down syndrome- and therapy-related myeloid neoplasms, including MDS, were moved to the section of acute myeloid leukaemia and related precursor neoplasms.","['Hebeda, Konnie M', 'Fend, F']","['Hebeda KM', 'Fend F']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Hematop,Journal of hematopathology,101491976,,,,,2009/01/01 00:00,2009/01/01 00:01,['2010/03/24 06:00'],"['2009/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12308-009-0048-6 [doi]'],epublish,J Hematop. 2009 Sep 26;2(4):205-10. doi: 10.1007/s12308-009-0048-6.,,,,20090926,PMC2798935,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Classification', 'Myelodysplastic syndrome', 'Myeloproliferative neoplasm', 'Review', 'Updated WHO classification']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The underlying molecular mechanisms are beginning to become unraveled and an overview of the current knowledge on BMI1 signaling in normal and leukemic stem cells will be presented here. RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to a role in bypassing senescence and the orchestration of the symmetry of hematopoietic stem cell divisions, it has recently become clear that BMI1 also functions in the protection against oxidative stress. In the absence of BMI1, reactive oxygen species accumulate, associating with activation of DNA damage response pathways and increased apoptosis. BMI1-mediated control over reactive oxygen species levels might occur independently of the INK4a/ARF pathway, but rather involves impaired mitochondrial functions. In human hematopoietic malignancies, BMI1 is frequently overexpressed, which associates with poor prognosis. Down modulation of BMI1 impairs self-renewal and long-term expansion of leukemic stem cells. SUMMARY: Understanding molecular mechanisms by which BMI1 affects stem cell fate will increase our insights into the biology of hematopoietic stem cells and will also aid in understanding the process of leukemic transformation and ultimately in the identification of drugable targets that might facilitate the eradication of leukemic stem cells.","['Schuringa, Jan J', 'Vellenga, Edo']","['Schuringa JJ', 'Vellenga E']","['Department of Hematology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. j.schuringa@int.umcg.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'DNA Damage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/*physiology']",72,2010/03/24 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2010/03/24 06:00'],"['2010/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e328338c439 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2010 Jul;17(4):294-9. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e328338c439.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS A diagnostic assay detecting multiple EVI1 splice variants was developed to determine the relative EVI1 expression by single real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 1,382 newly diagnosed adult patients with AML younger than 60 years. Patients were treated on four Dutch-Belgian HOVON (n = 458) and two German-Austrian AML Study Group protocols (n = 924). Results The EVI1 assay was tested in the HOVON cohort and validated in the AMLSG cohort. High EVI1 levels (EVI1(+)) were found with similar frequencies in both cohorts combined, with a 10.7% incidence (148 of 1,382). EVI1(+) independently predicted low complete remission (CR) rate (odds ratio, 0.54; P = .002), adverse relapse-free survival (RFS; hazard ratio [HR], 1.32; P = .05), and event-free survival (EFS; HR, 1.46; P < .001). This adverse prognostic impact was more pronounced in the intermediate cytogenetic risk group (EFS; HR, 1.64; P < .001; and RFS; HR, 1.55; P = .02), and was also apparent in cytogenetically normal AML (EFS; HR, 1.67; P = .008). Besides inv(3)/t(3;3), EVI1(+) was significantly associated with chromosome abnormalities monosomy 7 and t(11q23), conferring prognostic impact within these two cytogenetic subsets. EVI1(+) was virtually absent in favorable-risk AML and AML with NPM1 mutations. Patients with EVI1(+) AML (n = 28) who received allogeneic stem cell transplantation in first CR had significantly better 5-year RFS (33% +/- 10% v 0%). CONCLUSION EVI1 expression in AML is unequally distributed in cytogenetic subtypes. It predicts poor outcome, particularly among intermediate cytogenetic risk AML. Patients with EVI1(+) AML may benefit from allogeneic transplantation in first CR. Pretreatment EVI1 screening should be included in risk stratification.","['Groschel, Stefan', 'Lugthart, Sanne', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Eiwen, Karina', 'Goudswaard, Chantal', 'van Putten, Wim J L', 'Kayser, Sabine', 'Verdonck, Leo F', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert-Jan', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Schmidt-Wolf, Ingo', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Delwel, Ruud']","['Groschel S', 'Lugthart S', 'Schlenk RF', 'Valk PJ', 'Eiwen K', 'Goudswaard C', 'van Putten WJ', 'Kayser S', 'Verdonck LF', 'Lubbert M', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Germing U', 'Schmidt-Wolf I', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Krauter J', 'Ganser A', 'Dohner H', 'Lowenberg B', 'Dohner K', 'Delwel R']","['Erasmus University Medical Center, Department of Hematology, Dr Molewaterplein 50, 3015 GE Rotterdam, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Logistic Models', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monosomy', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Odds Ratio', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Up-Regulation', 'Young Adult']",,2010/03/24 06:00,2010/05/01 06:00,['2010/03/24 06:00'],"['2010/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.26.0646 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.26.0646 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Apr 20;28(12):2101-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.26.0646.

Because identification of high-risk patients might use information collected during the clinical course, we assessed the prognostic value of time-dependent covariates for 2 competing risks (death and BP) in a series of 172 patients. Significant (P < .01) adverse time-dependent prognostic factors for the risk of death were the time to onset of anemia (hemoglobin < 100 g/L [10 g/dL]), leukocytosis (leukocyte count > 30 x 10(9)/L), thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 150 x 10(9)/L), presence of circulating blasts, intermediate-high or high International Working Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment score, and time to splenectomy. The first 3 dependent covariates and the time to chemotherapy initiation (P = .05) were prognostic factors for the risk of BP. The prognostic effect of onset of leukocytosis was significantly more pronounced for BP than for death.

However, signaling from death receptors requires amplification via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (type II) in the majority of tumor cells. Thus, TRAIL-induced cell death entirely depends on the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax, which is often lost as a result of epigenetic inactivation or mutations. Consequently, Bax deficiency confers resistance against TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Despite expression of Bak, Bax-deficient cells are resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In this study, we show that the Bax dependency of TRAIL-induced apoptosis is determined by Mcl-1 but not Bcl-xL. Both are antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins that keep Bak in check. Nevertheless, knockdown of Mcl-1 but not Bcl-xL overcame resistance to TRAIL, CD95/FasL and tumor necrosis factor (alpha) death receptor ligation in Bax-deficient cells, and enabled TRAIL to activate Bak, indicating that Mcl-1 rather than Bcl-xL is a major target for sensitization of Bax-deficient tumors for death receptor-induced apoptosis via the Bak pathway.","['Gillissen, Bernhard', 'Wendt, Jana', 'Richter, Antje', 'Richter, Anja', 'Muer, Annika', 'Overkamp, Tim', 'Gebhardt, Nina', 'Preissner, Robert', 'Belka, Claus', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'Daniel, Peter T']","['Gillissen B', 'Wendt J', 'Richter A', 'Richter A', 'Muer A', 'Overkamp T', 'Gebhardt N', 'Preissner R', 'Belka C', 'Dorken B', 'Daniel PT']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology, University Medical Center Charite, Humboldt University, 13125 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/*metabolism']",,2010/03/24 06:00,2010/04/23 06:00,['2010/03/24 06:00'],"['2010/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['jcb.200912070 [pii]', '10.1083/jcb.200912070 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2010 Mar 22;188(6):851-62. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200912070.,,,,,PMC2845080,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we sought to examine the effects of an extract of Andrographis paniculata leaves on inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced [nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), interleukin-1beta (IL-1 beta), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)] and calcimycin (A23187) induced [leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)), thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)) and histamine] mediators in diverse cell based models.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: AP illustrated significant alleviation of pro-inflammatory, inflammatory, and allergic mediators. However, no inhibition was observed against histamine release.

When human clinical trials are initiated to determine the ability of omega 3 fatty acids to alter growth or response to chemotherapeutic interventions of cancers, it will be essential to determine the omega 3 intake of individuals in the trial to determine compliance with consumption of the supplement and to correlate with endpoints of efficacy. We wondered if the fatty acid composition of RBCs might accurately indicate incorporation of omega 3 fatty acids in the WBCs. In this report we determine and compare the changes in fatty acid compositions of red blood cells and white blood cells in response to consumption of three doses of an omega 3 fatty acid supplement. RESULTS: We found that the fraction of omega 3 fatty acids in both red blood cells and white blood cells increased following consumption of the supplement. There was a linear, dose responsive increase in the fraction of omega 3 fatty acids in red blood cells but the increase in omega 3 in white blood cells was not linear. The magnitude of increase in omega 3 fatty acids was different between the two cell types. CONCLUSIONS: Fatty acid analysis of red blood cells is a good measure of compliance with supplement consumption. However, fatty acid analysis of white blood cells is needed to correlate changes in fatty acid composition of white blood cells with other biochemical changes in the white blood cells.

As a summary, the results of this study strongly suggest that combination of imatinib and fludarabine induced cell death synergistically comparing to only imatinib or fludarabine in human K562 CML cells.","['Baran, Yusuf', 'Oztekin, Coskun', 'Bassoy, Esen Yonca']","['Baran Y', 'Oztekin C', 'Bassoy EY']","['Izmir Institute of Technology, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Urla, Izmir, Turkey. yusufbaran@iyte.edu.tr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/*drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,2010/03/24 06:00,2010/06/18 06:00,['2010/03/24 06:00'],"['2010/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/07357901003631056 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Invest. 2010 Jul;28(6):623-8. doi: 10.3109/07357901003631056.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 2002 to December 2004, 50 VATS procedures were performed under general anaesthesia on 48 patients for malignant pleural effusion. There were 45 women and 3 men with a median age of 57 years. The most common primary neoplasms were breast cancer (68%), ovarian cancer (6%), colon cancer (4%) and lung cancer (4%). Five patients had other types of tumour, including malignant lymphoma, fibrosarcoma, renal cell carcinoma, malignant pleural mesothelioma, acute myeloblastic leukaemia. RESULTS: The average duration of the operation was 46 min (range 20-120). Median duration of postoperative drainage was 5 days (range 2-13) and postoperative hospitalisation was 8 days (range 2-13). Four patients had postoperative complications. Thirty-day mortality was 1/48. One patient died from myocardial infarction. Three postoperative complications were noted (one non-septic febrile episode, one bilateral pneumopathy and one transitory hypoxaemia, treated by non invasive ventilation). Patients were relieved from dyspnoea in 34/48 of the cases (71%). Median survival was 6 months (ranging from 14 days to 2 years).

Newly diagnosed 30 ALL pediatric patients were examined for sCD44 by ELISA and CD44 expression by flowcytometry and their levels after induction of remission. We correlated them to age, sex, TLC, Hb, platelet count, blast % in PB and BM, Immunophenotyping, and LDH. CD44 expression in ALL patients at the time of diagnosis ranged from 0 - 98% with a mean +/- SD of (41.23 +/- 23.99) and in the control group (range 0 - 11 with a mean +/- SD of 5.5 +/- 6.58), the % of expression was significantly higher in ALL patients than control group (P = 0.001). CD44 expression was significantly decreased by induction of remission (P = 0.001). sCD44 concentration in ALL patients at the time of diagnosis ranged from 105- 449 ng/dl with a mean +/- SD of (246.5 +/- 99.51) and in the control group (range 103 -243 ng/dl with a mean +/- SD of 160.65 +/- 37.12), sCD44 was significantly higher in ALL patients than control group (P = 0.001). sCD44 was significantly decreased after induction of remission (P = 0.001). LDH was elevated in the patients group than the control, (P = 0.001). In conclusion, LDH level at time of ALL diagnosis is an important risk determinant and correlate with degree of anemia, high TLC and high PB absolute blast count. High sCD44 level at the time of diagnosis and rapid decline in its level after treatment suggesting that sCD44 may be a good marker for prognosis and a marker for monitoring response to therapy, a second elevation of sCD44 level after its decline by therapy may suggest ALL relapse. Elevated CD44 expression in ALL patients may mediate lymphoblast metastatic migration.","['Ahmed, Mohammed Ibrahim Sayed', 'Hassab, Hoda Mohammed Abo El Fotoh']","['Ahmed MI', 'Hassab HM']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Alexandria, Alexandria, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Egypt,Egypt J Immunol,The Egyptian journal of immunology,9816016,['0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/biosynthesis/*blood', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Solubility', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2008/01/01 00:00,2010/05/01 06:00,['2010/03/24 06:00'],"['2010/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Egypt J Immunol. 2008;15(2):101-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different reports emphasize the interaction between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and integrin alphavbeta3 as a key control system of angiogenesis, oncogenesis and metatasis. The current study was undertaken to investigate leukocytic-VEGF and integrin alphavbeta3 as correlated with clinical outcome in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The study groups included 10 newly diagnosed AML patients before the start of any chemotherapeutic medication and 10 normal healthy control subjects. The level of VEGF was estimated in culture supernatant of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMN) of both groups using commercially available ELISA kit. The degree of integrin alphavbeta3 expression on PBMN was estimated by indirect immunoflourescence. Obtained results showed that the level of VEGF and degree of expression of integrin alphavbeta3 were significantly higher in AML patients than in normal healthy subjects. However, no significant correlation was observed between the levels of VEGF and the degree of expression of integrin alphavbeta3. When clinical findings were concerned, there was a significant positive correlation between VEGF and the percentage of blasts, both in peripheral blood & bone marrow. On the other hand, such correlations were not observed in case of integrin alphavbeta3. In addition no significant correlation was observed between either VEGF or integrin alphavbeta3 and clinical staging, age, and sex. In conclusion, our results proved the importance of VEGF and integrin alphavbeta3 in the pathogenesis of AML. However, the per se increased production or/and secretion of VEGF and integrin alphavbeta3 by leukemic PBMN cells, respectively can not be used as independent predictor (s) for clinical outcome in AML patients.

Thus, IGF-system may play a role in tumor proliferation. In the present study, we investigated IGF-I and IGFBP-2 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) for their predictive value to identify patients who could be responsive to conventional induction chemotherapy. Serum levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-2 were measured (using commercial ELISA kits) in 22 patients with AML. Following treatment, patients were followed up 14 days after the induction cycle to determine if they achieved hematological remission or not. Accordingly, patients were divided into two groups: Responders (10 patients) and Non-Responders (12 patients). No significant difference was observed in IGF-1 between Responders and Non-Responders, neither before (79.26 +/- 4.568 pg/ml vs 72.225 +/- 3.62 pg/ml, respectively) nor after induction cycle (74.87 +/- 3.669 pg/ml vs 69.783 +/- 4.329 pg/ml, respectively). However, IGFBP-2 was significantly lower in Responders than in Non-Responders both at diagnosis (4250 +/- 155.099 pg/ml vs 6866.67 +/- 352.122 pg/ml, respectively) as well as after induction cycle of chemotherapy (4130 +/- 324.225 pg/ml vs 7150.00 +/- 265.290 pg/ml, respectively). It is concluded that, serum IGFBP-2 is considered as an independent factor that adds additional information for the prediction of relapse or treatment failure and patients with concentration > or = 4900 pg/ml at diagnosis are suspected to be nonresponders to conventional induction chemotherapy.","['El-Naggar, Amel A', 'Mahmoud, Bothaina F', 'Abou Shamaa, Lobna A', 'Salama, Mona A']","['El-Naggar AA', 'Mahmoud BF', 'Abou Shamaa LA', 'Salama MA']","['Department of Hematology, Medical Research Institute, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Egypt,Egypt J Immunol,The Egyptian journal of immunology,9816016,"['0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2/*blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2008/01/01 00:00,2010/05/01 06:00,['2010/03/24 06:00'],"['2010/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Egypt J Immunol. 2008;15(2):73-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin-4 (IL-4) has been proved to be involved in the survival mechanisms of B-cells as well as protection of B-CLL cells against spontaneous or drug induced apoptosis. Fludarabine is one of purine analogs and the current standard treatment for B-CLL, which has been proved to induce apoptosis in normal and malignant lymphocytes. We investigated the effect of ex vivo treatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) with Fludarabine on apoptosis and IL-4 production in untreated patients with B-CLL. The study was conducted on 15 recently diagnosed B-CLL patients and 15 normal healthy control subjects. PBLs were isolated and cultured in complete culture media without and with the addition of 1 microM/ml Fludarabine for 48 hrs. Harvested cells were assessed by flowcytometry for apoptosis and IL-4 production using staining with Annexin-V/PI and specific monoclonal IL-4 antibody, respectively. RESULTS: Fludarabine significantly increased the rate of in vitro PBLs' apoptosis in both B-CLL patients and normal subjects (3.81 +/- 1.98% and 4.11 +/- 2.14% without Fludarabine vs 14.78 +/- 7.83% and 9.99 +/- 5.60% with Fludarabine, respectively). However, the cytotoxic effect of Fludarabine was significantly higher in B-CLL patients than normal control subjects. Cytolasmic IL-4 content, as reflected by mean flouresence intensity (MFI), as well as percentage of IL-4+ve PBLs in absence Fludarabine were nearly the same both in B-CLL patients (20.28 +/- 14.34 & 2.97 +/- 1.48%, respectively) and normal subjects (27.75 +/- 14.44 & 2.58 +/- 1.27% respectively), with no significant difference. Corresponding values were significantly increased in both B-CLL patients (34.46 +/- 22.95 & 15.08 +/- 8.17%, respectively) and normal subjects (40.15 +/- 17.11 & 17.05 +/- 8.74%, respectively) when PBLs were co-cultured with Fludarabine. However, no significant difference was observed when studied groups were compared to each other. No correlation was observed between the intracellular IL-4 content or percentage of IL-4+ve PBLs and Fludarabine-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, Floudarabine could induce apoptosis and IL-4 production in B-CLL patients.

However, about 50% of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases have normal karyotype. These patients are very heterogenous with respect to acquired gene mutations and gene expression changes. The identification of these genetic alterations may lead to improved prognostification and generation of novel risk-adapted therapies. The aim of this work was to study the prognostic impact of mutations in the myeloid transcription factor gene CEBPA (for CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha) and expression of the BAALC gene (for brain and acute leukemia, cytoplasmic), a novel gene involved in leukemia, in 38 adults with AML and normal cytogenetics. Screening for mutations of CEBPA gene was assessed using PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), and BAALC expression was determined by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in blood or bone marrow samples. CEBPA mutations were found in 7 (18.4%) of 38 patients, 36.8 % (14 of 38) had low BAALC expression and 63.2 % (24 of 38) had high BAALC expression. Patients with CEBPA mutations had favorable course of their disease. They had higher rate of complete remission (CR) (85.7 % vs 51.6 %; P = 0.108), lower incidence of relapse (0% vs. 41.9%; P = 0.038). Disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly longer for patients with CEBPA mutations compared with patients without mutations (mean 13.65 +/- 5.41 vs. 7.32 +/- 4.33 months, P = 0.047; mean 15.32 +/- 6.5 vs 8.5 +/- 3.21 months, P = 0.039; respectively). Compared to low BAALC expressers, high BAALC expressers had lower incidence of CR (50% vs 71.4%; P = 0.171), higher incidence of relapse (50% vs. 14.3%; P = 0.029), and showed significantly shorter DFS (mean 7.5 +/- 2.12 vs. 11.67 +/- 4.6 months, P = 0.038) and inferior overall survival (mean 9.1 +/- 3.52 vs. 13.22 +/- 4.21 months, P = 0.024). On multivariable analysis, wild-type CEBPA as well as high BAALC expression were confirmed as independent risk factors predicting inferior DFS (CEBPA, hazard ratio 0.066, P = 0.001; BAALC, hazard ratio 3.98, P = 0.003) and inferior OS (CEBPA, hazard ratio 0.125, P = 0.002; BAALC, hazard ratio 4.215, P = 0.001). Data obtained in this study suggest that CEBPA mutation status and BAALC expression are important prognostic factors in AML patients with normal cytogenetics and their incorporation into novel risk-adapted therapeutic strategies may improve the currently disappointing cure rate of this group of patients.","['El-Sharnouby, Jehan A', 'Ahmed, Laila M Sayed', 'Taha, Atef M', 'Kamal, Oqasha']","['El-Sharnouby JA', 'Ahmed LM', 'Taha AM', 'Kamal O']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Tanta University, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Egypt,Egypt J Immunol,The Egyptian journal of immunology,9816016,"['0 (BAALC protein, human)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Egypt', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/*genetics', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Platelet Count', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",,2008/01/01 00:00,2010/04/22 06:00,['2010/03/24 06:00'],"['2010/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Egypt J Immunol. 2008;15(1):131-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of MDM-2 on these processes depend, in part, on its ability to inactivate the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Our goal was to determine whether MDM-2 protein overexpressions or p53 gene mutations are a frequent event in poor outcome pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This work was conducted on 46 children with ALL (31 males and 15 females) with age range 2-18 years, 18 children with matched age and sex were enrolled in the study as a control group. The MDM-2 expression by flowcytometry and p53 gene status by PCR were determined in peripheral blood or bone marrow of ALL children (at initial diagnosis) and also of control group. The ALL children were treated by the modified BFM 76179 protocol of therapy, 29 patients (63%) achieved complete remission, while 17 patients (37%) were subsequently failed to achieve complete remission or relapsed within 6 months of achieving complete remission (CR). MDM-2 was significantly overexpressed in 15 ALL patients (32.6%), compared to that of healthy controls, 4 of them (4/15), were out of 29 cases of CR (13.8%), and the other 11 cases were out of 17 relapsed cases (64.7%). In contrast to overexpression of MDM-2, the mutation of p53 was detected in 6 (13%) out of 46 ALL patients at the initial time of diagnosis, 3 of them (10.3%) were out of 29 cases of CR and the other 3 cases (17.6%) were out of 17 of relapsed group, which is significantly higher than CR group (P < 0.05). In relapsed group, 2 patients out of 3 cases with p53 mutation were MDM-2 negative, also, all 3 cases of mutant P53 among patients in CR were negative MDM2. A positive correlation was found between the MDM-2 overexpression and initial WBCs count, blast cell counts in peripheral blood and presence of CNS blasts (p < 0.05, p < 0.05 and p < 0.05 respectively). These results indicate that MDM-2 is overexpressed in a significant number of childhood ALL, it is more frequent in relapsed cases and its frequency is not related to p53 status. Thus measuring of MDM-2 as a bad prognostic marker even in cases with non mutant P53 is very important. Moreover, MDM-2 may be a potential molecular target for production of new cancer therapy.","['Hendy, Olfat M', 'Elghannam, Doaa M', 'El-Sharnouby, Jehan A', 'Goda, Enas F', 'El-Ashry, Rasha', 'Al-Tonbary, Youssef']","['Hendy OM', 'Elghannam DM', 'El-Sharnouby JA', 'Goda EF', 'El-Ashry R', 'Al-Tonbary Y']","['Clinical Pathology Department, National Liver Institute, Menoufiya University, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Egypt,Egypt J Immunol,The Egyptian journal of immunology,9816016,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blood Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Platelet Count', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",,2008/01/01 00:00,2010/04/22 06:00,['2010/03/24 06:00'],"['2010/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Egypt J Immunol. 2008;15(1):93-100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytokines whose primary function is to act as signaling molecules of the immune system have recently also been implicated in the pathogenesis of depression. The aim of present study was to investigate the relation between pro-infammatory cytokines [Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)], depression and stressful life events in patients with acute leukemia. Twenty eight patients (18 males and 10 females) suffering from acute leukemia participated in this study. Their mean age was 33.3 +/- 12.1 years. They were subjected to psychiatric assessment using The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Holmes and Rahe Social Readjustment Scale, The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). Measurement of IL-6 and TNF-a genes expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was done using real-time PCR. Results revealed statistically significant elevation in the level of IL-6 gene expression, fatigue and perceived stress among depressed patients compared to none depressed group. The same results were obtained when comparing patients exposed to moderate or severe stressful life events compared to those exposed to none or mild stressful life events. Although, TNF-a gene expression was not associated with depression or stressful life events, it was associated with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). IL-6 gene expression was much higher among patients with AML than acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. These findings support the hypothesis that IL-6 might be involved in the etiology and symptomatology of depression in cancer patients. The development of biologic therapies targeting IL-6 may raise the possibility of simultaneously countering the severe effects of depression.","['El-Gohary, Ghada M', 'Azzam, Hanan M E', 'Ahmed, Ola I', 'El-Shokry, Mona Hamed']","['El-Gohary GM', 'Azzam HM', 'Ahmed OI', 'El-Shokry MH']","['Internal Medicine Department, Hematology/Oncology unit, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Egypt,Egypt J Immunol,The Egyptian journal of immunology,9816016,"['0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Depression/*blood/*complications/diagnosis', 'Egypt', 'Fatigue/blood/complications/diagnosis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/blood/*genetics', 'Leukemia/*blood/*complications/diagnosis/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/complications/diagnosis/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/complications/diagnosis/pathology', 'Stress, Psychological/blood/complications/diagnosis', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/blood/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,2008/01/01 00:00,2010/04/22 06:00,['2010/03/24 06:00'],"['2010/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Egypt J Immunol. 2008;15(1):13-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study included 50 CML patients (24 females and 26 males) and 10 healthy individuals (4 female and 6 male) as a control group. The studied groups were classified into group (I), 10 healthy individuals as a control group, group (II), 20 CML patients in chronic phase, Group (III), 15 CML patients in accelerated phase and Group (IV), 15 CML patients in blastic phase. The groups were subjected to clinical history and examination, CBC, ESR, BM aspiration (only patients), determination of serum survivin, IL-6 and beta2M levels by ELISA and survivin gene expression by quantitative real time PCR. There was a significant increase of survivin expression in patients as compared to controls (p < 0.001). The accelerated and blastic phases of the disease showed the highest significance (p < 0.001) than the chronic phase. Serum markers; survivin, IL6 and beta2M showed significant increase in the blastic phase, accelerated phase and chronic phase (p < 0.001, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001) respectively.

This leukemia has attracted considerable interest in recent years, being the first in which therapies that specifically target the underlying molecular lesion, i.e., all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO), leading to induction of differentiation and apoptosis have been successfully used in clinical practice. The advent of ATRA therapy has transformed APL from being a disease with a poor outlook to one of the most prognostically favorable subsets of acute myeloid leukemia. Further improvements in outcome may be achieved with the use of ATO, which achieves high rates of remission in the relatively small proportion of patients now relapsing following standard first-line therapy with ATRA and anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Moreover, recent studies have suggested that ATO and ATRA, or even ATO alone, used as front-line treatment of PML-RARA- associated APL can induce long-term remissions. This raises the possibility that some patients can be cured using differentiation therapies alone, without the need for chemotherapy, thereby potentially reducing treatment-related toxicity. It is clear that the success of such an approach is critically dependent upon molecular diagnostics and monitoring for minimal residual disease (MRD) to distinguish those patients who can potentially be cured with differentiation therapy from those requiring additional myelosuppressive agents. This represents an exciting new phase in the treatment of acute leukemia, highlighting the potential of molecularly targeted and MRD-directed therapies to achieve an individualized approach to patient management.","['Grimwade, David', 'Mistry, Anita R', 'Solomon, Ellen', 'Guidez, Fabien']","['Grimwade D', 'Mistry AR', 'Solomon E', 'Guidez F']","[""Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King's College London School of Medicine, London, UK. david.grimwade@genetics.kcl.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Treat Res,Cancer treatment and research,8008541,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dyspnea/chemically induced', 'Fever/chemically induced', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytosis/chemically induced', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/physiology', 'Oxides/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",77,2009/01/01 00:00,2010/10/06 06:00,['2010/03/23 06:00'],"['2010/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-0-387-69259-3_13 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Treat Res. 2010;145:219-35. doi: 10.1007/978-0-387-69259-3_13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hematopoietic systems of both zebrafish ( Danio rerio) and Drosophila have been well characterized ( reviewed in [5, 31]) . Both organisms are well suited to forward genetics mutagenesis screens. Although this approach has been useful for identification of mutants with hematopoietic phenotypes ( e.g., cloche), the impact on cancer biology and hematopoietic malignancies in particular has been limited. A zebrafish model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia has been generated [37] and Drosophila models have shed light on the biology of epithelial tumors ( reviewed in [60]). Nonetheless, in vivo modeling of human AML relies most heavily on mice. Most cellular, molecular, and developmental features of the hematopoietic system are well conserved across mammalian species. The availability of the human and mouse genome sequences and the capability of manipulating the mouse genome make mice the most valuable model organism for AML research.

Nowhere is this more true than in the study of leukemogenesis, where research has converged upon a critical group of genes involved in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell self-renewal and fate specification. Prominent among these is the heterodimeric transcriptional regulator, RUNX1/CBFbeta. RUNX1 is a site-specific DNA-binding protein whose consensus response element is found in the promoters of many hematopoietically relevant genes. CBFbeta interacts with RUNX1, stabilizing its interaction with DNA to promote the actions of RUNX1/CBFbeta in transcriptional control. Both the RUNX1 and the CBFbeta genes participate in proleukemic chromosomal alterations. Together they contribute to approximately one-third of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and one-quarter of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases, making RUNX1 and CBFbeta the most frequently affected genes known in the pathogenesis of acute leukemia. Investigating the mechanisms by which RUNX1, CBFbeta, and their proleukemic fusion proteins influence leukemogenesis has contributed greatly to our understanding of both normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Here we present an overview of the structural features of RUNX1/CBFbeta and their derivatives, their roles in transcriptional control, and their contributions to normal and malignant hematopoiesis.","['Engel, Michael E', 'Hiebert, Scott W']","['Engel ME', 'Hiebert SW']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital, Nashville, TN, USA. mike.engel@vanderbilt.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Treat Res,Cancer treatment and research,8008541,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/chemistry/*genetics/physiology', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/chemistry/*genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",120,2009/01/01 00:00,2010/10/06 06:00,['2010/03/23 06:00'],"['2010/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-0-387-69259-3_8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Treat Res. 2010;145:127-47. doi: 10.1007/978-0-387-69259-3_8.,,,['R01 CA064140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, although the WHO defines important biologically and clinically relevant entities, the prognostic value of some of the well-defined cytogenetic subgroups is partially masked in the WHO classification. Moreover, in the recent past a number of novel molecular aberrations with marked prognostic value, which are not yet incorporated in the WHO classifications have been identified. These molecular abnormalities include mutations (e.g., in FLT3, c-KIT, and NPM1), partial duplications (e.g., of MLL and FLT3), and abnormal expression of pathogenetic genes (e.g., EVI1, WT1, BCL2, MDR1, BAALC, and ERG). In addition, novel molecular approaches in genomics, like monitoring the expression levels of thousands of genes in parallel using DNA microarray technology, open possibilities for further refinement of prognostication of AML.

Furthermore, chromosomal deletions are achieved frequently by unbalanced translocations between two and more chromosomes resulting loss of candidate leukemia suppressor loci from the affected chromosomes. Most deletions occurring as sole anomalies are associated with good-intermediate clinical outcome, but complex cytogenetic anomalies signify an aggressive clinical course. Thanks to the exciting development in microarray, siRNA technologies, a number of candidate AML suppressor genes localizing to the critical regions of overlap within the deletions have been identified recently. Most of the candidate genes do not function by the classical ""two hits,"" namely loss of an allele unmasking inactivating mutations in the remaining allele. Gene dosage, epigenetic silencing, and uniparental disomy appear to be common mechanisms of gene inactivation in AML. While several of the newly discovered candidate genes lead to new pathways, a few of them affect previously known leukemogenic targets.

Epigenetic mechanism include DNA methylation and histone tail modifications. Epigenetic regulation is part of physiologic development and becomes abnormal in neoplasia, where silencing of critical genes by DNA methylation or histone deacetylation can contribute to leukemogenesis as an alternative to deletion or loss-of-function mutation. In acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), aberrant DNA methylation can be observed in multiple functionally relevant genes such as p15, p 73, E-cadherin, ID 4, RARbeta2. Abnormal activities of histone tail-modifying enzymes have also been seen in AML, frequently as a direct result of chromosomal translocations. It is now clear that these epigenetic changes play a significant role in development and progression of AML, and thus constitute important targets of therapy. The aim of targeting epigenetic effector protein or ""epigenetic therapy"" is to reverse epigenetic silencing and reactive various genes to induce a therapeutic effect such as differentiation, growth arrest, or apoptosis. Recent clinical studies have shown the relative safety and efficacy of such epigenetic therapies.","['Oki, Yasuhiro', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Oki Y', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Treat Res,Cancer treatment and research,8008541,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', '*Drug Delivery Systems', '*Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Methylation/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects']",174,2009/01/01 00:00,2010/10/06 06:00,['2010/03/23 06:00'],"['2010/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-0-387-69259-3_2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Treat Res. 2010;145:19-40. doi: 10.1007/978-0-387-69259-3_2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effects of various cytokines on the marrow microenvironment of patients with MDS have been studied. Autoimmunity, i.e. a reaction of autologous T lymphocytes against components of the marrow is also operative in a proportion of patients with MDS. The negative feed-back loop that controls tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha levels in healthy individuals is apparently disrupted in MDS due to auto-amplification signals involving TNFalpha and interleukin (IL-32). IL-32 mRNA levels in primary adherent cells from patients with MDS are 14- to 17-fold higher than in controls. In contrast, cells from patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), a myeloproliferative disorder with low TNFalpha levels, express IL-32 at only 1/10 the level observed in controls. Damage in the microenvironment may occur secondary to oxidative stress, which may also lead to accelerated shortening of telomeres. This is, indeed, true for hematopoietic cells in MDS marrow, but telomere length in marrow stroma does not differ from that in age-matched healthy individuals. Nevertheless, the stroma shows functional aberrancies. Stroma-derived signals facilitate apoptosis in clonal hematopoietic cells but not in normal CD34+ cells. Thus while stroma dysfunction is likely due to signals derived from the hematopoietic clone rather than being intrinsic, it does affect clonal death or survival, respectively. Therefore, signals exchanged between both compartments could serve as targets for therapeutic interventions.","['Marcondes, A Mario', 'Ramakrishnan, Aravind', 'Deeg, H Joachim']","['Marcondes AM', 'Ramakrishnan A', 'Deeg HJ']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United Arab Emirates,Curr Cancer Ther Rev,Current cancer therapy reviews,101253264,,,,,2010/03/23 06:00,2010/03/23 06:01,['2010/03/23 06:00'],"['2010/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.2174/157339409789712681 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Cancer Ther Rev. 2009 Nov 1;5(4):310-314. doi: 10.2174/157339409789712681.,,,"['R01 HL082941/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL082941-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL036444-29/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL036444-290016/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL036444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2840261,['NIHMS183815'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results show that cells that express Bcr-Abl1 are more sensitive to the inhibition of the proteasome with Bortezomib (Btz) than control cells. This treatment reduces the proliferation of Bcr-Abl1-expressing cells, by inactivating NF-kappaB2 and decreasing the phosphorylation of Rb, eventually leading to an increase in caspase-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that Btz also induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in cells expressing Bcr-Abl1 mutants that are resistant to IM. These results unravel a new molecular target of Btz, that is the Rb pathway, and open new possibilities in the treatment of CML especially for patients that become resistant to IM because of the presence of the T315I mutation.","['Albero, M P', 'Vaquer, J M', 'Andreu, E J', 'Villanueva, J J', 'Franch, L', 'Ivorra, C', 'Poch, E', 'Agirre, X', 'Prosper, F', 'Perez-Roger, I']","['Albero MP', 'Vaquer JM', 'Andreu EJ', 'Villanueva JJ', 'Franch L', 'Ivorra C', 'Poch E', 'Agirre X', 'Prosper F', 'Perez-Roger I']","['Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Cardenal Herrera-CEU University, Moncada, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism']",,2010/03/23 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2010/03/23 06:00'],"['2010/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201081 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2010.81 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Jun 3;29(22):3276-86. doi: 10.1038/onc.2010.81.

Myelodysplasia resulted and acute myelogenous leukaemia emerged that had acquired several genetic abnormalities while having intact Dicer1. Examining gene expression altered in osteoprogenitors as a result of Dicer1 deletion showed reduced expression of Sbds, the gene mutated in Schwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome-a human bone marrow failure and leukaemia pre-disposition condition. Deletion of Sbds in mouse osteoprogenitors induced bone marrow dysfunction with myelodysplasia. Therefore, perturbation of specific mesenchymal subsets of stromal cells can disorder differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis of heterologous cells, and disrupt tissue homeostasis.

Results were derived from heterogeneous, small populations and their value remains a matter of debate. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, we assessed the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes for interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN), interleukin 4 (IL4), interleukin 6 (IL6), interleukin 10 (IL10), interferon (IFNG), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the cell surface receptors tumor necrosis factor receptor II (TNFRSFIB), vitamin D receptor (VDR) and estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) in a homogeneous cohort of 228 HLA identical sibling transplants for chronic myeloid leukemia. Three good predictors of overall survival, identified via statistical methods including Cox regression analysis, were investigated for their effects on transplant-related mortality and relapse. Predictive power was assessed after integration into the established European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) risk score. RESULTS: Absence of patient TNFRSFIB 196R, absence of donor IL10 ATA/ACC and presence of donor IL1RN allele 2 genotypes were associated with increased transplantation-related mortality and decreased survival. Application of prediction error and concordance index statistics gave evidence that integration improved the EBMT risk score. CONCLUSIONS: Non-HLA genotypes were associated with survival after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. When three genetic polymorphisms were added into the EBMT risk model they improved the goodness of fit. Non-HLA genotyping could, therefore, be used to improve donor selection algorithms and risk assessment prior to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Dickinson, Anne M', 'Pearce, Kim F', 'Norden, Jean', ""O'Brien, Stephen G"", 'Holler, Ernst', 'Bickeboller, Heike', 'Balavarca, Yesilda', 'Rocha, Vanderson', 'Kolb, Hans-Jochem', 'Hromadnikova, Ilona', 'Sedlacek, Petr', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Brand, Ronald', 'Ruutu, Tapani', 'Apperley, Jane', 'Szydlo, Richard', 'Goulmy, Els', 'Siegert, Wolfgang', 'de Witte, Theo', 'Gratwohl, Alois']","['Dickinson AM', 'Pearce KF', 'Norden J', ""O'Brien SG"", 'Holler E', 'Bickeboller H', 'Balavarca Y', 'Rocha V', 'Kolb HJ', 'Hromadnikova I', 'Sedlacek P', 'Niederwieser D', 'Brand R', 'Ruutu T', 'Apperley J', 'Szydlo R', 'Goulmy E', 'Siegert W', 'de Witte T', 'Gratwohl A']","['Haematological Sciences, Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University, UK. a.m.dickinson@ncl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Female', '*Genomic Instability', 'Genotype', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/mortality', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2010/03/23 06:00,2011/08/09 06:00,['2010/03/23 06:00'],"['2010/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.016220 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.016220 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Jun;95(6):922-7. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.016220.

The combination of IFN-alpha with imatinib is currently being investigated in at least two large clinical trials, the German CML Study IV and the French SPIRIT trial. We reviewed the cytogenetic and molecular responses of 76 early chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients who were treated with imatinib and interferon-alpha and of 419 early chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with imatinib alone front-line. The complete cytogenetic response rate was higher in the IM+IFN-alpha group than in the imatinib group at six months (60% vs. 42%; P=0.003), but not at 48 months (88% vs. 88%). The durability of the complete cytogenetic response was similar in the two groups with 94% and 91% of complete cytogenetic responders in continuous complete cytogenetic response at 48 months (P=0.56). The major molecular response rate was higher in the IM+IFN-alpha group at six months (58% vs. 34%; P=0.0001) and 12 months (67% vs. 47%; P=0.001) but not later on (65% vs. 57% at 48 months; P=0.25). Overall and progression free survival were comparable in the two groups; a significant trend to a better event free survival was observed in patients treated with PegIFNalpha (91% vs. 78%; P=0.02). These data suggest that the response to the combination treatment is more rapid. It is not yet known how much a rapid reduction will influence the longer-term overall and progression free survival, and the cure rate.","['Palandri, Francesca', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Amabile, Marilina', 'Gugliotta, Gabriele', 'Poerio, Angela', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Bocchia, Monica', 'Crugnola, Monica', 'Rege-Cambrin, Giovanna', 'Martino, Bruno', 'Pierri, Ivana', 'Radaelli, Franca', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Baccarani, Michele']","['Palandri F', 'Castagnetti F', 'Iacobucci I', 'Martinelli G', 'Amabile M', 'Gugliotta G', 'Poerio A', 'Testoni N', 'Breccia M', 'Bocchia M', 'Crugnola M', 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Martino B', 'Pierri I', 'Radaelli F', 'Specchia G', 'Pane F', 'Saglio G', 'Rosti G', 'Baccarani M']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology L and A Seragnoli, University of Bologna, S Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, Bologna, Italy. francesca.palandri@libero.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2010/03/23 06:00,2011/03/09 06:00,['2010/03/23 06:00'],"['2010/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/09 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.021246 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.021246 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Aug;95(8):1415-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.021246.

Here, we establish a mammalian affinity purification and lentiviral expression (MAPLE) system for characterizing the subunit compositions of protein complexes. The system is flexible (i.e. multiple N- and C-terminal tags and multiple promoters), is compatible with Gateway cloning, and incorporates a reference peptide. Its major advantage is that it permits efficient and stable delivery of affinity-tagged open reading frames into most mammalian cell types. We benchmarked MAPLE with a number of human protein complexes involved in transcription, including the RNA polymerase II-associated factor, negative elongation factor, positive transcription elongation factor b, SWI/SNF, and mixed lineage leukemia complexes. In addition, MAPLE was used to identify an interaction between the reprogramming factor Klf4 and the Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complex in mouse embryonic stem cells. We show that the SWI/SNF catalytic subunit Smarca2/Brm is up-regulated during the process of induced pluripotency and demonstrate a role for the catalytic subunits of the SWI/SNF complex during somatic cell reprogramming. Our data suggest that the transcription factor Klf4 facilitates chromatin remodeling during reprogramming.","['Mak, Anthony B', 'Ni, Zuyao', 'Hewel, Johannes A', 'Chen, Ginny I', 'Zhong, Guoqing', 'Karamboulas, Konstantina', 'Blakely, Kim', 'Smiley, Sandra', 'Marcon, Edyta', 'Roudeva, Denitza', 'Li, Joyce', 'Olsen, Jonathan B', 'Wan, Cuihong', 'Punna, Thanuja', 'Isserlin, Ruth', 'Chetyrkin, Sergei', 'Gingras, Anne-Claude', 'Emili, Andrew', 'Greenblatt, Jack', 'Moffat, Jason']","['Mak AB', 'Ni Z', 'Hewel JA', 'Chen GI', 'Zhong G', 'Karamboulas K', 'Blakely K', 'Smiley S', 'Marcon E', 'Roudeva D', 'Li J', 'Olsen JB', 'Wan C', 'Punna T', 'Isserlin R', 'Chetyrkin S', 'Gingras AC', 'Emili A', 'Greenblatt J', 'Moffat J']","['Banting and Best Department of Medical Research, Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto M5S3E1, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (SWI-SNF-B chromatin-remodeling complex)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cellular Reprogramming/genetics', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Lentivirus/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,2010/03/23 06:00,2010/08/06 06:00,['2010/03/23 06:00'],"['2010/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-9476(20)34419-4 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M000002-MCP201 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2010 May;9(5):811-23. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M000002-MCP201.

We examined the clinical significance of levels below the usual threshold value for MRD positivity (0.01%) in 455 children with B-lineage ALL, using polymerase chain reaction amplification of antigen-receptor genes capable of detecting at least 1 leukemic cell per 100 000 normal mononucleated cells (0.001%). Of the 455 clinical samples studied on day 46 of therapy, 139 (30.5%) had MRD 0.001% or more with 63 of these (45.3%) showing levels of 0.001% to less than 0.01%, whereas 316 (69.5%) had levels that were either less than 0.001% or undetectable. MRD measurements of 0.001% to less than 0.01% were not significantly related to presenting characteristics but were associated with a poorer leukemia cell clearance on day 19 of remission induction therapy. Patients with this low level of MRD had a 12.7% (+/- 5.1%; SE) cumulative risk of relapse at 5 years, compared with 5.0% (+/- 1.5%) for those with lower or undetectable MRD (P < .047). Thus, low levels of MRD (0.001%-< 0.01%) at the end of remission induction therapy have prognostic significance in childhood ALL, suggesting that patients with this finding should be monitored closely for adverse events.","['Stow, Patricia', 'Key, Laura', 'Chen, Xiaohua', 'Pan, Qiulu', 'Neale, Geoffrey A', 'Coustan-Smith, Elaine', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Zhou, Yinmei', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Campana, Dario']","['Stow P', 'Key L', 'Chen X', 'Pan Q', 'Neale GA', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Mullighan CG', 'Zhou Y', 'Pui CH', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",,2010/03/23 06:00,2010/07/20 06:00,['2010/03/23 06:00'],"['2010/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34883-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-11-253435 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jun 10;115(23):4657-63. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-11-253435.

However, approximately 35% of patients will not obtain long-term benefit with this approach. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is a valuable second- and third-line therapy for appropriately selected patients. To identify useful prognostic indicators of transplantation outcome in postimatinib therapeutic interventions, we investigated the role of the HCT comorbidity index (HCT-CI) together with levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) before HCT in 271 patients who underwent myeloablative HCT for CML in first chronic phase. Multivariate analysis showed both an HCT-CI score higher than 0 and CRP levels higher than 9 mg/L independently predict inferior survival and increased nonrelapse mortality at 100 days after HCT. CML patients without comorbidities (HCT-CI score 0) with normal CRP levels (0-9 mg/L) may therefore be candidates for early allogeneic HCT after failing imatinib.","['Pavlu, Jiri', 'Kew, Andrea K', 'Taylor-Roberts, Beatrice', 'Auner, Holger W', 'Marin, David', 'Olavarria, Eduardo', 'Kanfer, Edward J', 'MacDonald, Donald H', 'Milojkovic, Dragana', 'Rahemtulla, Amin', 'Rezvani, Katayoun', 'Goldman, John M', 'Apperley, Jane F', 'Szydlo, Richard M']","['Pavlu J', 'Kew AK', 'Taylor-Roberts B', 'Auner HW', 'Marin D', 'Olavarria E', 'Kanfer EJ', 'MacDonald DH', 'Milojkovic D', 'Rahemtulla A', 'Rezvani K', 'Goldman JM', 'Apperley JF', 'Szydlo RM']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College at Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom. jiri.pavlu@imperial.nhs.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'C-Reactive Protein/metabolism', 'Child', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/mortality/pathology', '*Patient Selection', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2010/03/23 06:00,2010/06/11 06:00,['2010/03/23 06:00'],"['2010/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34998-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-01-263624 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 May 20;115(20):4018-20. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-01-263624.

A key technology in this effort, single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, has been applied in hematologic malignancies to detect deletions, amplifications, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at high resolution. An inherent challenge of such studies lies in correctly distinguishing somatically acquired, cancer-specific lesions from patient-specific inherited copy number variations or segments of homozygosity. Failure to include appropriate normal DNA reference samples for each patient in retrospective or prospective studies makes it difficult to identify small somatic deletions not evident by standard cytogenetic analysis. In addition, the lack of proper controls can also lead to vastly overestimated frequencies of LOH without accompanying loss of DNA copies, so-called copy-neutral LOH. Here we use examples from patients with myeloid malignancies to demonstrate the superiority of matched tumor and normal DNA samples (paired studies) over multiple unpaired samples with respect to reducing false discovery rates in high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis. Comparisons between matched tumor and normal samples will continue to be critical as the field moves from high resolution array analysis to deep sequencing to detect abnormalities in the cancer genome.","['Heinrichs, Stefan', 'Li, Cheng', 'Look, A Thomas']","['Heinrichs S', 'Li C', 'Look AT']","['Departmentsof Pediatric Oncology, Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Sequence Deletion']",25,2010/03/23 06:00,2010/06/18 06:00,['2010/03/23 06:00'],"['2010/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34967-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-11-203182 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 May 27;115(21):4157-61. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-11-203182.

Eldecalcitol has potent biological effects on bone and is now in preparation for approval as a promising medicine for the treatment of osteoporosis in Japan. To explore chemical structure-biological activity relationships between eldecalcitol and related analogs, we have already synthesized 1-epi-eldecalcitol, 3-epi-eldecalcitol, and 1,3-diepi-eldecalcitol with inherent biological interests of each targeted analog and evaluated their biological responses. It has been reported that 20-epi-1,25(OH)2D3, a diastereomer of 1,25(OH)2D3 that possesses an inverted methyl substituent at the 20-position of the side chain, shows remarkably enhanced biological activities compared to parental compound, 1,25(OH)2D3. As a continuation of our modification studies on eldecalcitol, we took great interest in 20-epi-eldecalcitol and its biological responses. In this paper, the synthesis of 20-epi-eldecalcitol by the Trost coupling reaction between the A-ring fragment and the C/D-ring fragment as well as in vitro preliminary biological evaluation of 20-epi-eldecalcitol are described.

Furthermore, the expression of several CD44 proteins correlates with aggressive stages of various human cancers. Because of the frequent and homogeneous expression of CD44v6 isoforms in squamous cell carcinoma, antibodies recognising these proteins were used in clinical trials for patients suffering from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Although the phase I clinical trials looked promising, the studies were abruptly ended after the death of a patient. Despite the termination of the trials, CD44 certainly remains a valid target for anti-cancer therapy. In this review, alternative strategies targeting CD44 functions are presented. These functions include the binding to hyaluronan (HA), the collaboration with osteopontin and the contribution of CD44 isoforms to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTKs) activation. These new attempts led to the development of peptides that interfere for example with HA binding and that might be used to induce apoptosis in mammary carcinoma or to prevent homing of leukaemia stem cells. Other peptides block RTK activation and thereby inhibit tumour angiogenesis and metastatic spread.","['Orian-Rousseau, Veronique']",['Orian-Rousseau V'],"['Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Institute for Toxicology and Genetics, Hermann von Helmholtzplatz 1, 76344 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany. veronique.orian-rousseau@kit.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chemotaxis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*physiology', 'Hyaluronic Acid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Osteopontin/physiology', 'Protein Isoforms/physiology', 'Rats']",49,2010/03/23 06:00,2010/06/15 06:00,['2010/03/23 06:00'],"['2010/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(10)00151-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2010.02.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2010 May;46(7):1271-7. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2010.02.024.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We analyzed a case-control study that investigated the risk of secondary leukemia and myelodysplasia after a solid tumor in childhood; it included 61 patients with leukemia matched with 196 controls. Complete clinical, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy histories were recorded for each patient in the study. Average radiation dose to each of seven bone marrow components for each patient was incorporated into the models, and corresponding risks were summed up. Conditional maximum likelihood methods were used to estimate risk parameters. RESULTS: Whatever the model, we failed to evidence a role for the radiation dose to active bone marrow in the risk of later leukemia, myelodysplasia, or myeloproliferative syndrome, when adjusting for epipodophyllotoxin and anthracycline doses. This result was confirmed when fitting models that included total dose of radiation delivered during radiotherapy, when fitting models taking into account dose per fraction, and when restricting the analysis to acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to results found in similar studies that included children treated before the use of epipodophyllotoxins, this study failed to show a role for radiotherapy in the risk of secondary leukemia after childhood cancer in children treated between 1980 and 1999. This discrepancy was probably due to a competitive mechanism between these two carcinogens.","['Allard, Aurore', 'Haddy, Nadia', 'Le Deley, Marie-Cecile', 'Rubino, Carole', 'Lassalle, Mathilde', 'Samsaldin, Akthar', 'Quiniou, Eric', 'Chompret, Agnes', 'Lefkopoulos, Dimitri', 'Diallo, Ibrahima', 'de Vathaire, Florent']","['Allard A', 'Haddy N', 'Le Deley MC', 'Rubino C', 'Lassalle M', 'Samsaldin A', 'Quiniou E', 'Chompret A', 'Lefkopoulos D', 'Diallo I', 'de Vathaire F']","['INSERM Unit 605, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/*radiation effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'France', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/etiology', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Podophyllotoxin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Risk Assessment']",,2010/03/23 06:00,2010/12/18 06:00,['2010/03/23 06:00'],"['2009/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0360-3016(09)03274-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.09.032 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Dec 1;78(5):1474-82. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.09.032.

Given this definition, we exclude the retinoblastomas, which are the most frequent tumors of this anatomical area in the pediatric population. Although these tumors are rare, there is a great variety of etiologies. Among them, the most frequent OTs in childhood are rhabdomyosarcomas and metastatic tumors: metastatic neuroblastomas and leukemias (chloromas). Moreover, adult and pediatric varieties of OT are made up of two clusters of distinctive histological entities. Examination must be careful: measurement, direction of proptosis, impairment of ocular motility, compressive optic neuropathy, strabismus, etc. Age at onset as well as unilateral or bilateral proptosis are important features. Benign tumors such as dermoid cysts or hemangiomas grow slowly, whereas rapid growth suggests a malignant tumor. Fundi and visual acuity should be checked. The general examination focuses especially on cutaneous abnormalities such as cafe au lait spots and subcutaneous nodules in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a hemangioma that often involves the cutaneous portion of the eyelid. When a metastatic tumor is suspected, abdominal palpation and ultrasonography must be performed. Ultrasonography leaves the posterior third of the orbit inaccessible to exploration. The depth to which it can penetrate the orbit is limited (20mm). Most of the time, standard x-rays, CT, and MR imaging allow for an adequate assessment and usually provide a diagnosis. In children, CT and MRI sometimes require anesthesia to be properly performed.","['George, J-L', 'Marchal, J-C']","['George JL', 'Marchal JC']","[""Service d'ophtalmologie B, 54500 Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France.""]",['fre'],['Journal Article'],France,Neurochirurgie,Neuro-Chirurgie,0401057,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Disease Progression', 'Emotions', 'Exophthalmos/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/pathology', 'Neuroblastoma/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Orbital Neoplasms/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology/psychology', 'Palpation', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Ultrasonography']",,2010/03/23 06:00,2010/08/11 06:00,['2010/03/23 06:00'],"['2009/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0028-3770(10)00037-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neuchi.2010.02.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurochirurgie. 2010 Apr-Jun;56(2-3):244-8. doi: 10.1016/j.neuchi.2010.02.014.

Exposure of military staff and local populations to uranium metal and to its ionizing radiation were feared as potential causes for leukemia and other diseases in that region. In January 2001 a scientific mission was carried out by Portugal to evaluate those issues. A large number of environmental and food samples collected in Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina, such as soils, water, aerosols, vegetables, bread, and meat were analyzed by radiochemistry and alpha spectrometry. Results of the analyses for total uranium and individual uranium isotopes are presented. Uranium in agriculture soils in Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina averaged 1.8+/-0.8mgkg(-)(1) and 3+/-1mgkg(-)(1), while concentrations in drinking water from public supplies averaged 0.5+/-0.2microgL(-)(1) and 0.4+/-0.3microgL(-)(1), respectively. Results on soils indicated also that environmental contamination by DU was much localized and confined to the areas of ammunition impact. Concentrations of uranium in most of the environmental and food samples were comparable to concentrations of uranium measured in other European regions, such as Portugal and United Kingdom, and uranium isotopic ratios were in general compatible with isotopic ratios typical of natural uranium. However, a few samples displayed modified uranium isotopic ratios and could have been contaminated by DU. Implications of DU in radiation exposure of the population and in environmental contamination are discussed.","['Carvalho, Fernando P', 'Oliveira, Joao M']","['Carvalho FP', 'Oliveira JM']","['Nuclear and Technological Institute (ITN), Department of Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, E.N. 10, 2686-953 Sacavem, Portugal.

We first used Rasch methods to identify the items on the FS-C that distinguished children with high cancer-related fatigue from other children; our findings indicated that the FS-C needed to be reduced from 14 items to 10 items. We then assessed the 10-item FS-C for its psychometric properties and applied the receiver operating characteristics curve analysis to the FS-C responses from 221 children (aged 7-12 years) receiving anticancer treatment.

Nonetheless, several chromosome abnormalities have not yet been completely determined, because of the low mitotic in vitro activity of B-CLL cells. Now, novel technologies such as stimulation of CLL cells with new B-cell mitogens have helped to overcome this problem. We present here a novel conventional and molecular cytogenetic study of a CLL patient with t(6;13)(p21;q14.1), a rare chromosomal aberration. The findings contribute to the identification of rare recurrent aberrations and of any prognostic effect in CLL that could be used for prognostic and therapeutic purposes. The present study demonstrates that t(6;13)(p21;q14.1) as a secondary event to the interstitial deletion in 13q14 region, resulting in the loss of RB1, is a rare but nonrandom abnormality in CLL, resistant to the current treatment CLL protocols with a rather favorable or intermediate prognosis but definitely not an adverse prognosis. Further studies in more CLL patients are required to delineate the prognostic value of t(6;13)(p21;q14.1) and to identify any candidate genes with potential role in the pathogenesis of the disease.","['Karakosta, Maria', 'Voulgarelis, Michael', 'Vlachadami, Ioanna', 'Manola, Kalliopi N']","['Karakosta M', 'Voulgarelis M', 'Vlachadami I', 'Manola KN']","['Laboratory of Cytogenetics, National Center for Scientific Research (NCSR) Demokritos, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2010/03/23 06:00,2010/04/03 06:00,['2010/03/23 06:00'],"['2009/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/30 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-4608(09)00699-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2009.12.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2010 Apr 1;198(1):66-70. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2009.12.009.,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, molecular analyses showed a high expression of AURKA and AURKB genes. It is already known that overexpression of Aurora kinases is associated with chromosomal instability and poor prognosis. The formation of jumping translocations is a rare cytogenetic event and there is evidence pointing toward preferential involvement of the heterochromatin region of donor chromosomes and the telomere ends of recipient chromosomes.

To address whether this is a feasible approach for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we evaluated transplant outcomes in 38 recipients transplanted from 1995-2005 for whom this was their first transplant. The median age at transplant was 12 years, and 47% had performance scores <90%. Disease status was first complete remission (CR) in 13%, > or =CR2 in 60% of patients, and 22% had active disease at transplantation. Matched related donors were available for a third of patients, about half of whom received bone marrow (BM) and the others, peripheral blood progenitor cells. Sixty percent of unrelated donor transplant recipients received peripheral blood progenitor cells. The day-100 probability of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease was 37% and the 3-year probability of chronic graft-versus-host disease, 26%. At 3 years, the probability of treatment-related mortality was 40%, relapse 37%, and disease-free survival 30%. These data indicate long-term DFS can be achieved using reduced-intensity conditioning regimens in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Given the relatively small cohort, these findings must be validated in a larger population.","['Verneris, Michael R', 'Eapen, Mary', 'Duerst, Reggie', 'Carpenter, Paul A', 'Burke, Michael J', 'Afanasyev, B V', 'Cowan, Morton J', 'He, Wensheng', 'Krance, Robert', 'Li, Chi-Kong', 'Tan, Poh-Lin', 'Wagner, John E', 'Davies, Stella M']","['Verneris MR', 'Eapen M', 'Duerst R', 'Carpenter PA', 'Burke MJ', 'Afanasyev BV', 'Cowan MJ', 'He W', 'Krance R', 'Li CK', 'Tan PL', 'Wagner JE', 'Davies SM']","['University of Minnesota Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2010/03/23 06:00,2011/01/05 06:00,['2010/03/23 06:00'],"['2010/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00114-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.03.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2010 Sep;16(9):1237-44. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.03.009.

As the overall number of survivors continues to increase, studies systematically examining outcomes in long-term survivors are needed. We studied the clinical and quality-of-life outcomes in HSCT recipients surviving 5 or more years from HSCT. Since 1993, 262 patients with hematologic malignancies received a T cell-depleted myeloablative HSCT from an HLA-identical sibling at a single center. Ninety-two survived beyond 5 years from HSCT (median follow-up 9.4 years, range: 5.1-15.3). Median age at transplantation was 35 years (range: 10-56). Twenty-two (24%) received a bone marrow transplant, and 70 (76%) received a peripheral blood HSCT. Of the 92 survivors, 60 completed quality-of-life measures. The main outcomes examined were chronic graft-versus-host-disease, disease relapse, survival, health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General), physical and mental health (SF-36), and symptom experience (Rotterdam Symptom Checklist). Seventy-five (82%) of 92 survivors no longer required systemic immunosuppressive treatment. Four (4.3%) relapsed with leukemia at a median of 8.5 years (range: 6.2-14.0) after HSCT. Four (4.3%) died between 7.4 and 13.4 years post-HSCT (1 relapse, 1 lung cancer, 1 pneumonia, 1 brain hemorrhage). Most survivors beyond 5 years had an excellent performance status with no difference in physical and mental health and higher HRQL scores (P = .02) compared with population norms. Although physical and psychologic symptom distress was low, those with higher symptom distress experienced inferior HRQL. These results show that 5 or more years after T cell-depleted HSCT for hematologic malignancy most individuals survive disease free with an excellent performance status, preserved physical and psychological health, and excellent HRQL.","['Le, Robert Quan', 'Bevans, Margaret', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Mitchell, Sandra A', 'Stringaris, Kate', 'Koklanaris, Eleftheria', 'Barrett, A John']","['Le RQ', 'Bevans M', 'Savani BN', 'Mitchell SA', 'Stringaris K', 'Koklanaris E', 'Barrett AJ']","['Stem Cell Allotransplantation Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality of Life', 'Survivors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2010/03/23 06:00,2011/01/05 06:00,['2010/03/23 06:00'],"['2009/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00110-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.03.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2010 Aug;16(8):1162-70. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.03.005.

Elimination of malignant cells through a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect involves donor T and natural killer (NK) cells, but their relative contribution to this process is poorly defined. NK cell alloreactivity and GVL effects are controlled by the nature of the interaction of NK activation receptors and killer-immunoglobulin-like-receptors (KIR) with major histocompatibility locus class I antigens on the target cell. We performed KIR-genotyping of HLA-identical sibling donors in 246 T cell-depleted SCTs to identify genetic factors affecting transplant outcome (treatment-related mortality [TRM], leukemic relapse, and survival). Univariate and multivariate analysis of transplant-related risk factors and KIR genotyping was performed to identify independent variables predictive of outcome for different forms of leukemia. Further to confirming known predictive factors for TRM and survival (CD34 cell dose, patient age, disease stage), statistical analysis revealed that 3 donor B haplotype KIR genes, 2DL5A, 2DS1, and 3DS1, were associated with significantly less relapse in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (13% versus 57%) but not in patients with other myelogenous or lymphoid malignancies. AML patients receiving SCT from donors with these KIR genes relapsed 4 times less frequently than patients transplanted from donors with other KIR genotypes. These findings suggest specific, genetically determined, interactions between NK cells and AML cells that facilitate the GVL effect, and have implications for donor selection for AML patients.","['Stringaris, Kate', 'Adams, Sharon', 'Uribe, Marcela', 'Eniafe, Rhoda', 'Wu, Colin O', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Barrett, A John']","['Stringaris K', 'Adams S', 'Uribe M', 'Eniafe R', 'Wu CO', 'Savani BN', 'Barrett AJ']","['Hematology Branch National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Receptors, KIR/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Siblings', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2010/03/23 06:00,2011/01/05 06:00,['2010/03/23 06:00'],"['2010/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(10)00109-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.03.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2010 Sep;16(9):1257-64. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.03.004.

RESULTS: Total CR rate was 66.5%, median survival time was 18 months and estimated survival at 3 year was 30.8%. The 3-year relapse rate was 55.1%. The CR rate was similar to that in developed countries, but long-term survival was worse. The CR rate and survival were increased markedly compared with data collected from 1984 to 1994 in Shanghai. Induction regimens based on idarubicin, daunorubicin or homoharringtonine had similar CR rates and survivals. Karyotype was the most important prognostic factor.

Multilineage dysplasia in de novo AML was not an independent prognostic factor after adjusted by cytogenetics, age and WBC count. Poor karyotype, old age and high WBC count were the most important prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: The CR rate and survival of AML were improved in the past 20 years.

RESULTS: The median duration of nilotinib therapy was 11 (1 - 23) months, with a median follow-up of 19 months. Nonhematologic adverse events were mostly of grade 1-2. The most common ones possibly related to nilotinib were increase of bilirubin (76%) and rash (46%). Grade 3-4 hematologic adverse events includes thrombocytopenia (37%), neutropenia (26%) and anemia (26%). Nilotinib was proved to be well-tolerated in this study. Grade 3-4 hematologic adverse events happened more frequently in advanced phase CML. The rate of major cytogenetic response in chronic phase (CP) CML was much higher than those in advanced CML (38.5% vs 22.2%). The median time to major cytogenetic response was 3 months. The estimated overall survival at 18 months was (93.5 +/- 1.0)%.

However, some patients may experience resistance or intolerance to imatinib over time. For these patients, two excellent therapeutic options are available. Dasatinib, approved in 2006 for the treatment of patients with CML in all phases who experience imatinib resistance or intolerance, has displayed significant efficacy, with a 2-year follow-up showing durable hematologic and cytogenetic responses, as well as prolonged progression-free and overall survival. Nilotinib was approved in 2007 for the treatment of patients with CML in chronic phase or CML in accelerated phase, resistant or intolerant to prior therapy including imatinib, based on strong efficacy as well as a favorable safety profile. Several factors, including mutation status, patient history, and existing comorbidities can impact the decision to use dasatinib or nilotinib, or pursue other options such as allogeneic stem cell transplant. The purpose of this review article is to shed light on a further consideration when deciding which agent to use, based on the efficacy and safety of dasatinib and nilotinib.

We retrospectively reclassified, according to WHO, low-risk MDS from our database and found 126 subjects with these features at diagnosis: 79 patients were categorized as refractory anemia (RA), 23 patients as refractory neutropenia (RN), and 24 as refractory thrombocytopenia (RT). We did not find differences between the three subgroups as regards sex, median age, and cytogenetic aberrations. Lower PMN count (0.8 x 10(9)/L) was observed in the RN category, as well as lower platelet count in the RT category (51 x 10(9)/L). Moreover, we found a lower rate of patients requiring RBC transfusions, during the disease course, in the RT category (45.8%) as compared to RA (62%) and RN (69%) groups (p = 0.05); a lower incidence of infections at diagnosis in the RT category (20.8%) compared to RA (32%) and RN (43%) categories (p = 0.03); and a higher incidence of hemorrhagic symptoms at diagnosis in the RT category (41.6%) and RN category (26%) as compared to the RA group (5%) (p = 0.001). Application of different scoring systems (Bournemouth and Spanish scores, WPSS) revealed a low OS in high-risk patients within the RT category, compared to RA and RN categories, although unlikely to reflect the consequences of low OS found in the former category. Statistically significant differences were also evidenced in the incidence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) evolution and overall survival: 7/79 (8%) patients with the RA category evolved to AML in a median time of 89 months, whereas 4/23 (17%) of the RN category and 1/24 (4%) of the RT category experienced disease progression, in a median time of 33.8 and 12.8 months, respectively (p = 0.03). The RT category had a lower overall survival (15.9 months) as compared to RA (48.2 months) and RN (35.9 months) categories (p < 0.001). In conclusion, in our study, application of the revised 2008 WHO classification confirmed the importance of separating patients with unilineage dysplasia for prognostic disease assessment; from our results it seems that the RT category has a worse outcome.","['Breccia, Massimo', 'Latagliata, Roberto', 'Cannella, Laura', 'Carmosino, Ida', 'Santopietro, Michelina', 'Loglisci, Giuseppina', 'Federico, Vincenzo', 'Alimena, Giuliana']","['Breccia M', 'Latagliata R', 'Cannella L', 'Carmosino I', 'Santopietro M', 'Loglisci G', 'Federico V', 'Alimena G']","['Department of Biotechnologies and Hematology, Via Benevento 6, 00161 Rome, Italy. breccia@bce.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory/classification/*etiology/mortality', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Cell Lineage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/mortality/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neutropenia/classification/*etiology/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Thrombocytopenia/classification/*etiology/mortality', 'Young Adult']",,2010/03/23 06:00,2010/08/20 06:00,['2010/03/23 06:00'],"['2010/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428191003682759 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 May;51(5):783-8. doi: 10.3109/10428191003682759.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

20301790,,Publisher,,,,,,1993,Ataxia-Telangiectasia,,,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Classic ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia beginning between ages one and four years, oculomotor apraxia, choreoathetosis, telangiectasias of the conjunctivae, immunodeficiency, frequent infections, and an increased risk for malignancy, particularly leukemia and lymphoma. Individuals with A-T are unusually sensitive to ionizing radiation. Non-classic forms of A-T have included adult-onset A-T and A-T with early-onset dystonia. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of A-T is suspected based on suggestive clinical and preliminary laboratory findings and - in some instances - neuroimaging and family history. The diagnosis is established in a proband either by molecular genetic testing to document the presence of biallelic (homozygous or compound heterozygous) ATM pathogenic variants or (when available) by immunoblotting to test for absent or reduced ATM protein. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Neurologic: supportive therapy and medications (when possible) as well as early and continued physical therapy to reduce the risk for contractures and scoliosis. Immunodeficiency: IVIG replacement therapy as needed for (a) frequent and severe infections and (b) low IgG levels. Pulmonary: multidisciplinary management that emphasizes monitoring of recurrent infection, pulmonary function, swallowing, nutrition, scoliosis, and immune function. Cancer: because of the increased sensitivity of A-T cells, use of ionizing radiation and some chemotherapeutic agents requires careful monitoring. Prevention of secondary complications: Gastrostomy tube feedings are occasionally needed to prevent pulmonary and nutritional complications of dysphagia. Attention to potential risks of anesthesia including impaired swallowing, increased risk of aspiration, reduced pulmonary function, and infection. Surveillance: In those with severe recurrent infections or undergoing immunomodulatory therapy: monitoring of pulmonary function and other signs of pulmonary disease and early signs of malignancy (e.g., weight loss, bruising, localized pain or swelling). GENETIC COUNSELING: A-T is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, the sibs of an affected individual have a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being asymptomatic carriers, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not carriers. ATM heterozygotes (carriers) are at increased risk of developing cancer. Once the ATM pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.","['Gatti, Richard', 'Perlman, Susan']","['Gatti R', 'Perlman S']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",Seattle (WA),,,,,,,,2016/10/27 06:00,2016/10/27 06:00,,,['NBK26468 [bookaccession]'],,,,,['HHSN276201400262U/NLM NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 1993-2022, University of Washington, Seattle.

20301779,,Publisher,,,,,,1993,Dyskeratosis Congenita,,,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Dyskeratosis congenita (DC), a telomere biology disorder, is characterized by a classic triad of dysplastic nails, lacy reticular pigmentation of the upper chest and/or neck, and oral leukoplakia. The classic triad may not be present in all individuals. People with DC are at increased risk for progressive bone marrow failure (BMF), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), solid tumors (usually squamous cell carcinoma of the head/neck or anogenital cancer), and pulmonary fibrosis. Other findings can include: abnormal pigmentation changes not restricted to the upper chest and neck, eye abnormalities (epiphora, blepharitis, sparse eyelashes, ectropion, entropion, trichiasis), and dental abnormalities (caries, periodontal disease, taurodauntism). Although most persons with DC have normal psychomotor development and normal neurologic function, significant developmental delay is present in the two variants in which additional findings include cerebellar hypoplasia (Hoyeraal Hreidarsson syndrome) and bilateral exudative retinopathy and intracranial calcifications (Revesz syndrome). Onset and progression of manifestations of DC vary: at the mild end of the spectrum are those who have only minimal physical findings with normal bone marrow function, and at the severe end are those who have the diagnostic triad and early-onset BMF. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: All individuals with DC have abnormally short telomeres for their age, as determined by multicolor flow cytometry fluorescence in situ hybridization (flow-FISH) on white blood cell (WBC) subsets. To date, ACD, CTC1, DKC1, NHP2, NOP10, PARN, RTEL1, TERC, TERT, TINF2, and WRAP53 are the genes in which pathogenic variants are known to cause DC and result in very short telomeres. Pathogenic variants in one of these 11 genes have been identified in approximately 70% of individuals who meet clinical diagnostic criteria for DC. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is tailored to the individual. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative treatment for BMF and leukemia but historically has had poor long-term efficacy; if a suitable donor is not available, androgen therapy may be considered for BMF. Treatment of other cancers is tailored to the type of cancer. Of note, cancer therapy may pose an increased risk for prolonged cytopenias as well as pulmonary and hepatic toxicity. Treatment of pulmonary fibrosis is primarily supportive, although lung transplantation may be considered. Surveillance: For BMF: complete blood count (CBC) annually if normal and more often if abnormal; consider annual bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. For those on androgen therapy: routine monitoring of liver function. For cancer risk: monthly self-examination for oral, head, and neck cancer; annual cancer screening by an otolaryngologist and dermatologist; annual gynecologic examination. For pulmonary fibrosis: annual pulmonary function tests starting either at diagnosis or when the individual can perform the test (often around age eight years). Routine dental screening every six months and good oral hygiene are recommended. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Blood donation by family members if HCT is being considered; non-leukodepleted and non-irradiated blood products; the combination of androgens and G-CSF in treatment of BMF (has been associated with splenic rupture); toxic agents implicated in tumorigenesis (e.g., smoking). Evaluation of relatives at risk: If a relative has signs or symptoms suggestive of DC or is being evaluated as a potential HCT donor, telomere length testing is warranted or molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known. GENETIC COUNSELING: The mode of inheritance of DC varies by gene: X-linked: DKC1. Autosomal dominant: TERC and TINF2. Autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive: ACD, RTEL1, and TERT. Autosomal recessive: CTC1, NHP2, NOP10, PARN, and WRAP53. Genetic counseling regarding risk to family members depends on accurate diagnosis, determination of the mode of inheritance in each family, and results of molecular genetic testing. Once the DC-related pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.","['Savage, Sharon A']",['Savage SA'],,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",Seattle (WA),,,,,,,,2019/11/21 06:00,2019/11/21 06:00,,,['NBK22301 [bookaccession]'],,,,,['HHSN276201400262U/NLM NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 1993-2022, University of Washington, Seattle.

20301769,,Publisher,,,,,,1993,Diamond-Blackfan Anemia,,,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is characterized by a profound normochromic and usually macrocytic anemia with normal leukocytes and platelets, congenital malformations in up to 50%, and growth deficiency in 30% of affected individuals. The hematologic complications occur in 90% of affected individuals during the first year of life. The phenotypic spectrum ranges from a mild form (e.g., mild anemia or no anemia with only subtle erythroid abnormalities, physical malformations without anemia) to a severe form of fetal anemia resulting in nonimmune hydrops fetalis. DBA is associated with an increased risk for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and solid tumors including osteogenic sarcoma. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The clinical diagnosis can be established in a proband with macrocytic anemia with onset prior to age one year, no other significant cytopenias, reticulocytopenia, normal marrow cellularity with a paucity of erythroid precursors, and no evidence of another acquired or inherited disorder of bone marrow function. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a female proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in one of the 22 genes associated with DBA. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a male proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in a gene associated with autosomal dominant DBA or identification of a hemizygous pathogenic variant in GATA1 or TSR2 (associated with X-linked inheritance). MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Corticosteroid treatment, recommended in children older than age 12 months, improves the red blood cell count in approximately 80% of affected individuals. Chronic transfusion with packed red blood cells is necessary during the first year of life to avoid steroid-induced toxicity in those not responsive to a trial of corticosteroids at age 12 months and in individuals who relapse. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the only curative therapy for the hematologic manifestations of DBA, is often recommended for those who are transfusion dependent or develop other cytopenias. Ocular, skeletal, genitourinary, cardiac, and endocrine complications are best managed in collaboration with appropriate subspecialists. Treatment of malignancies should be coordinated by an oncologist. Chemotherapy must be given cautiously as it may lead to prolonged cytopenia and subsequent toxicities. Prevention of secondary complications: Transfusion-related iron overload is the most common complication in transfusion-dependent individuals. Iron chelation therapy with deferasirox orally or desferrioxamine subcutaneously is recommended after ten to 12 transfusions. Corticosteroid-related side effects must also be closely monitored, especially as related to risk for infection, growth deficiency, and loss of bone density in growing children. Often individuals will be placed on transfusion therapy if these side effects are intolerable. Surveillance: Complete blood counts several times a year; bone marrow aspirate/biopsy to evaluate morphology and cellularity only in the event of another cytopenia or a change in response to treatment. In steroid-dependent individuals: monitor blood pressure and (in children) growth. Evaluation by an endocrinologist for those who are steroid dependent and those at risk for transfusion iron overload. Cancer surveillance includes history, physical examination, and blood counts every four to six months. If red blood cell, white blood cell, or platelet counts fall rapidly, bone marrow aspirate with biopsy and cytogenetic studies (including karyotype and FISH analysis) to look for acquired abnormalities in chromosomes 5, 7, and 8 that are associated with myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Deferiprone for the treatment of iron overload (which can cause neutropenia); infection (especially in individuals on corticosteroids). Evaluation of relatives at risk: Molecular genetic testing of at-risk relatives of a proband with a known pathogenic variant allows for early diagnosis and appropriate monitoring for bone marrow failure, physical abnormalities, and related cancers. Pregnancy management: Management by an obstetrician with expertise in high-risk pregnancies and hematologists with experience in bone marrow failure syndromes. During pregnancy the maternal hemoglobin level must be monitored. Use of low-dose aspirin up to 37 weeks' gestation may help prevent vasculo-placental complications in women with a history of a problematic pregnancy. GENETIC COUNSELING: DBA is most often inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; GATA1-related and TSR2-related DBA are inherited in an X-linked manner. Autosomal dominant. Approximately 40%-45% of individuals with autosomal dominant DBA have inherited the pathogenic variant from a parent; approximately 55%-60% have a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with autosomal dominant DBA has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. X-linked. Males with GATA1- or TSR2-related DBA pass the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Women heterozygous for a GATA1 or TSR2 pathogenic variant have a 50% chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant in each pregnancy: males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be carriers and will usually not be affected. Carrier testing of at-risk female relatives is possible if the GATA1 or TSR2 pathogenic variant has been identified in the family. Once the DBA-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.","['Sieff, Colin']",['Sieff C'],,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",Seattle (WA),,,,,,,,2021/06/17 06:00,2021/06/17 06:00,,,['NBK7047 [bookaccession]'],,,,,['HHSN276201400262U/NLM NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 1993-2022, University of Washington, Seattle.

20301722,,Publisher,,,,,,1993,Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome,,,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is characterized by: exocrine pancreatic dysfunction with malabsorption, malnutrition, and growth failure; hematologic abnormalities with single- or multilineage cytopenias and susceptibility to myelodysplasia syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogeneous leukemia (AML); and bone abnormalities. In almost all affected children, persistent or intermittent neutropenia is a common presenting finding, often before the diagnosis of SDS is made. Short stature and recurrent infections are common. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of SDS is established in a proband with the classic clinical findings of exocrine pancreatic dysfunction and bone marrow dysfunction and/or by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in DNAJC21, EFL1, or SBDS, or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SRP54. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Care by a multidisciplinary team is recommended. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is treated with oral pancreatic enzymes and fat-soluble vitamin supplementation. Blood and/or platelet transfusions may be considered for anemia and/or thrombocytopenia associated with bi- or trilineage cytopenia. If recurrent infections are severe and absolute neutrophil counts are persistently </=500/mm(3), treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulation factor (G-CSF) can be considered. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) should be considered for treatment of severe pancytopenia, MDS, or AML. Prevention of secondary complications: Aggressive dental hygiene should be pursued to promote oral health. Consider prophylactic antibiotics and G-CSF to reduce risk of infection during complex dental procedures or orthopedic surgery. Surveillance: Complete blood counts at least every three to six months; assessment of development, growth, and nutritional status every six months. Following baseline examination, repeat bone marrow examination every one to three years or more frequently if bone marrow changes are observed. Monitor for orthopedic complications with x-rays of hips and knees during the most rapid growth stages. Perform bone densitometry before puberty, during puberty, and thereafter based on individual findings. Perform neuropsychological screening in children age 6-8 years, 11-13 years, and 15-17 years. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Prolonged use of cytokine and hematopoietic growth factors (e.g., G-CSF) should be considered with caution. Some drugs used in standard HSCT preparative regimens (e.g., cyclophosphamide and busulfan) may not be suitable because of possible cardiac toxicity. GENETIC COUNSELING: SDS is inherited in an autosomal recessive (most commonly) or an autosomal dominant manner. Autosomal recessive SDS. SDS caused by pathogenic variants in DNAJC21, EFL1, or SBDS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Most parents of children with autosomal recessive SDS are heterozygotes (carriers of one pathogenic variant); however, de novo pathogenic variants have been reported. When both parents are known to be carriers, the sibs of a proband have a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an unaffected carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for relatives at risk is possible if both pathogenic variants in a family are known. Autosomal dominant SDS. SDS caused by pathogenic variants in SRP54 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; most such affected individuals reported to date have resulted from a de novo SRP54 pathogenic variant. If the pathogenic variant(s) in a family are known, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.","['Nelson, Adam', 'Myers, Kasiani']","['Nelson A', 'Myers K']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",Seattle (WA),,,,,,,,2018/10/18 06:00,2018/10/18 06:00,,,['NBK1756 [bookaccession]'],,,,,['HHSN276201400262U/NLM NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 1993-2022, University of Washington, Seattle.

20301705,,Publisher,,,,,,1993,ELANE-Related Neutropenia,,,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: ELANE-related neutropenia includes congenital neutropenia and cyclic neutropenia, both of which are primary hematologic disorders characterized by recurrent fever, skin and oropharyngeal inflammation (i.e., mouth ulcers, gingivitis, sinusitis, and pharyngitis), and cervical adenopathy. Infectious complications are generally more severe in congenital neutropenia than in cyclic neutropenia. In congenital neutropenia, omphalitis immediately after birth may be the first sign; in untreated children diarrhea, pneumonia, and deep abscesses in the liver, lungs, and subcutaneous tissues are common in the first year of life. After 15 years with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor treatment, the risk of developing myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is approximately 15%-25%. Cyclic neutropenia is usually diagnosed within the first year of life based on approximately three-week intervals of fever and oral ulcerations and regular oscillations of blood cell counts. Cellulitis, especially perianal cellulitis, is common during neutropenic periods. Between neutropenic periods, affected individuals are generally healthy. Symptoms improve in adulthood. Cyclic neutropenia is not associated with risk of malignancy or conversion to leukemia. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of ELANE-related neutropenia is established in a proband with suggestive clinical findings and the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ELANE through molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: All fevers and infections require prompt evaluation and treatment. Abdominal pain requires evaluation for the potentially lethal complications of peritonitis and bacteremia. Immediate treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and broad-spectrum antibiotics is important, even lifesaving, when an affected individual has signs of serious infection, which may be caused by both aerobic and anaerobic pathogens. Prevention of primary manifestations: Treatment with G-CSF ameliorates symptoms and reduces infections in almost all affected individuals. Once absolute neutrophil count (ANC) levels normalize, resistance to infection greatly improves, such that affected individuals should be able to attend school, work, and recreational activities without specific concern. For affected individuals with a well-matched donor, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) may be the preferred treatment option. HSCT is the only alternative therapy for individuals with congenital neutropenia who are refractory to high-dose G-CSF or who undergo malignant transformation. Prevention of secondary complications: Good dental hygiene; routine immunizations. Surveillance: Those with congenital neutropenia not undergoing HSCT require surveillance for malignant transformation to MDS/AML. Agents/circumstances to avoid: There is no need to avoid public places, as most infections are due to common organisms that occur on body surfaces. Pregnancy management: Pregnancies in women with severe chronic neutropenia are at substantial risk for miscarriage; treatment with G-CSF may reduce this risk. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Evaluate sibs and other at-risk relatives by molecular genetic testing for the ELANE pathogenic variant found in the proband to identify those with previously unrecognized mild or moderately severe disease who may benefit from treatment. Serial ANCs can also be used for evaluation of family members. GENETIC COUNSELING: ELANE-related neutropenia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. One parent of a proband is usually affected. De novo pathogenic variants have been identified; their frequency is unknown. Each child of an individual with an ELANE pathogenic variant has a 50% chance of inheriting the variant. Prenatal testing for a pregnanciy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the family-specific pathogenic variant is known.","['Dale, David C', 'Makaryan, Vahagn']","['Dale DC', 'Makaryan V']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",Seattle (WA),,,,,,,,2018/08/23 06:00,2018/08/23 06:00,,,['NBK1533 [bookaccession]'],,,,,['HHSN276201400262U/NLM NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 1993-2022, University of Washington, Seattle.

20301679,,Publisher,,,,,,1993,Fumarate Hydratase Deficiency,,,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Fumarate hydratase (FH) deficiency results in severe neonatal and early infantile encephalopathy that is characterized by poor feeding, failure to thrive, hypotonia, lethargy, and seizures. Dysmorphic facial features include frontal bossing, depressed nasal bridge, and widely spaced eyes. Many affected individuals are microcephalic. A spectrum of brain abnormalities are seen on magnetic resonance imaging, including cerebral atrophy, enlarged ventricles and generous extra-axial cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) spaces, delayed myelination for age, thinning of the corpus callosum, and an abnormally small brain stem. Brain malformations including bilateral polymicrogyria and absence of the corpus callosum can also be observed. Development is severely affected: most affected individuals are nonverbal and nonambulatory, and many die during early childhood. Less severely affected individuals with moderate cognitive impairment and long-term survival have been reported. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Isolated increased fumaric acid and alpha-ketoglutarate on urine organic acid analysis, combined with increased succinyladenosine on urine purines and pyrimidines is highly suggestive of FH deficiency. The diagnosis of FH deficiency is established in a proband with reduced fumarate hydratase enzyme activity in fibroblasts or leukocytes and/or biallelic pathogenic variants in FH identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Evaluation and management by a pediatric neurologist to treat seizures; gastrostomy tube to optimize nutrition and prevent aspiration in hypotonic or lethargic children; feeding therapy as needed; special needs services to address developmental deficits; physical therapy to minimize contractures; wheelchair and/or other mobility devices; management of scoliosis by orthopedist. Prevention of primary manifestations: To date, there is limited information regarding use of a high-fat/low-carbohydrate diet with 60% of the dietary energy goals coming from fat, 30% from carbohydrate, and 10% from protein. Surveillance: At least annual evaluations by pediatric neurology and physical medicine; periodic evaluation by orthopedist to monitor contractures and scoliosis; assessment of visual acuity by ophthalmologist. Agents/circumstances to avoid: The ketogenic diet is usually considered to be contraindicated for treating epilepsy associated with FH deficiency or other enzymatic defects within the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the FH pathogenic variants in the family are known, it is appropriate to consider offering molecular genetic testing to relatives who may be at risk for hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer. GENETIC COUNSELING: FH deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. When both parents are known to be heterozygous for an FH pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of having FH deficiency, a 50% chance of being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial FH pathogenic variants. Heterozygotes are at risk of developing hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer. Once the FH pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, heterozygote detection for at-risk relatives and molecular genetic prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing are possible. Biochemical prenatal testing by measurement of fumarate hydratase enzyme activity is also possible but may be problematic as some affected fetuses have considerable residual fumarate hydratase enzyme activity.","['Coman, David', 'Kranc, Kamil R', 'Christodoulou, John']","['Coman D', 'Kranc KR', 'Christodoulou J']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",Seattle (WA),,,,,,,,2020/04/23 06:00,2020/04/23 06:00,,,['NBK1506 [bookaccession]'],,,,,['HHSN276201400262U/NLM NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 1993-2022, University of Washington, Seattle.

20301575,,Publisher,,,,,,1993,Fanconi Anemia,,,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Fanconi anemia (FA) is characterized by physical abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and increased risk for malignancy. Physical abnormalities, present in approximately 75% of affected individuals, include one or more of the following: short stature, abnormal skin pigmentation, skeletal malformations of the upper and/or lower limbs, microcephaly, and ophthalmic and genitourinary tract anomalies. Progressive bone marrow failure with pancytopenia typically presents in the first decade, often initially with thrombocytopenia or leukopenia. The incidence of acute myeloid leukemia is 13% by age 50 years. Solid tumors - particularly of the head and neck, skin, and genitourinary tract - are more common in individuals with FA. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of FA is established in a proband with increased chromosome breakage and radial forms on cytogenetic testing of lymphocytes with diepoxybutane (DEB) and mitomycin C (MMC) and/or one of the following identified on molecular genetic testing: biallelic pathogenic variants in one of the 21 genes known to cause autosomal recessive FA; a heterozygous pathogenic variant in RAD51 known to cause autosomal dominant FA; or a hemizygous pathogenic variant in FANCB known to cause X-linked FA. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Administration of oral androgens (e.g., oxymetholone) improves blood counts (red cell and platelets) in approximately 50% of individuals with FA; granulocyte colony-stimulating factor improves the neutrophil count in some individuals; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative therapy for the hematologic manifestations of FA, but the high risk for solid tumors remains and may even be increased in those undergoing HSCT. All these treatments have potential significant toxicity. early detection and surgical removal remains the mainstay of therapy for solid tumors. Treatment of growth deficiency, limb anomalies, ocular anomalies, renal malformations, genital anomalies, hypothyroidism, cardiac anomalies, and dermatologic manifestations as recommended by the subspecialty care provider. Hearing aids may be helpful for hearing loss as per otolaryngologist; supplemental feeding as needed by nasogastric tube or gastrostomy; vitamin D supplementation; early intervention for developmental delays; individualized education plan for school-age children; speech, occupational, and physical therapy as needed; liberal use of sunscreen and rash guards; social work and care coordination as needed. Prevention of primary manifestations: Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination to reduce the risk for gynecologic cancer in females, and possibly reduce the risk of oral cancer in all individuals. Prevention of secondary complications: T-cell depletion of the donor graft to minimize the risk of graft-vs-host disease; conditioning regimen without radiation prior to HSCT to reduce the subsequent risk of developing solid tumors. Surveillance: Clinical assessment of growth, feeding, nutrition, spine, and ocular issues at each visit throughout childhood. Annual ophthalmology examination; annual evaluation with endocrinologist including TSH, free T4, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, two-hour glucose tolerance testing, and insulin levels; assessment of pubertal stage and hormone levels at puberty and every two years until puberty is complete; follow up hearing evaluation if exposed to ototoxic drugs; annual developmental assessment; blood counts every three to four months or as needed; bone marrow aspirate and biopsy to evaluate morphology and cellularity, FISH and cytogenetics to evaluate for emergence of a malignant clone at least annually after age two years; liver function tests every three to six months and liver ultrasound examination every six to twelve months in those receiving androgen therapy; gynecologic assessment for genital lesions annually beginning at age 13 years; vulvo-vaginal examinations and Pap smear annually beginning at age 18 years; oral examinations for tumors every six months beginning at age nine to ten years; annual nasolaryngoscopy beginning at age ten years; dermatology evaluation every six to 12 months; annual abdominal ultrasound and brain MRI in those with BRCA2-related FA. Additional cancer surveillance for individuals with BRCA1-, BRCA2-, PALB2-, BRIP1-, and RAD51C-related FA. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Transfusions of red cells or platelets for persons who are candidates for HSCT; family members as blood donors if HSCT is being considered; blood products that are not filtered (leukodepleted) or irradiated; toxic agents that have been implicated in tumorigenesis; unsafe sex practices, which increase the risk of HPV-associated malignancy; excessive sun exposure. Radiographic studies solely for the purpose of surveillance (i.e., in the absence of clinical indications) should be minimized. Evaluation of relatives at risk: DEB/MMC testing or molecular genetic testing (if the family-specific pathogenic variants are known) of all sibs of a proband for early diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring for physical abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and related cancers. GENETIC COUNSELING: Fanconi anemia (FA) can be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, an autosomal dominant manner (RAD51-related FA), or an X-linked manner (FANCB-related FA). Autosomal recessive FA: Each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of inheriting both pathogenic variants and being affected, a 50% chance of inheriting one pathogenic variant and being a heterozygote, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial FA-related pathogenic variants. Heterozygotes are not at risk for autosomal recessive FA. However, heterozygous mutation of a subset of FA-related genes (e.g., BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, BRIP1, and RAD51C) is associated with an increased risk for breast and other cancers. Autosomal dominant FA: Given that all affected individuals with RAD51-related FA reported to date have the disorder as a result of a de novo RAD51 pathogenic variant, the risk to other family members is presumed to be low. X-linked FA: For carrier females the chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant in each pregnancy is 50%; males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be carriers and will usually not be affected.

20301572,,Publisher,,,,,,1993,Bloom Syndrome,,,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Bloom syndrome (BSyn) is characterized by severe pre- and postnatal growth deficiency, immune abnormalities, sensitivity to sunlight, insulin resistance, and a high risk for many cancers that occur at an early age. Despite their very small head circumference, most affected individuals have normal intellectual ability. Women may be fertile but often have early menopause, and men tend to be infertile, with only one confirmed case of paternity. Serious medical complications that are more common than in the general population and that also appear at unusually early ages include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus as a result of insulin resistance, and cancer of a wide variety of types and anatomic sites. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of BSyn is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features and/or biallelic pathogenic variants in BLM identified on molecular genetic testing. Identification of increased frequency of sister-chromatid exchanges on specialized cytogenetic studies and exclusion of RMI1, RMI2, and TOP3A-related disorders may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis in those with characteristic clinical features who do not have biallelic pathogenic variants in BLM. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Skin protection, including coverage of exposed skin and use of broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF of at least 30 to reduce the sun-sensitive rash. Increased-calorie-density formulas and foods may promote weight gain. Although growth hormone treatment may improve linear growth, many clinicians caution against its use because of reports of early onset of cancer in some treated children. Developmental services and therapies as needed. Hyperglycemia from insulin resistance is treated as in type 2 diabetes. In persons with BSyn who have cancer, reduced chemotherapy dosage and duration to reduce risks of severe complications; caution should be exercised with use of ionizing radiation or alkylating agents, particularly busulfan, cyclophosphamide, or melphalan. Individuals with recurrent infections and defects in humoral immunity may be treated with gamma globulin infusions to decrease frequency and severity of infections. Surveillance: Abdominal ultrasound examination every three months until age eight years for Wilms tumor. Screening and family education regarding signs/symptoms of leukemia and lymphoma at every health visit. Whole-body MRI every one to two years beginning at age 12-13 years for risk of lymphoma. Annual colonoscopy beginning at age 10-12 years. Fecal immunochemical testing every six months beginning at age 10-12 years. Annual breast MRI in women beginning at age 18 years. Annual fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1C beginning at age ten years. Annual serum TSH with reflex to T4 beginning at age ten years. Annual lipid profile beginning at age ten years. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sun exposure may provoke an erythematous rash, especially on the face. Exposure to ionizing radiation should be minimized. GENETIC COUNSELING: BSyn is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Identification of both pathogenic BLM variants in the proband is required for carrier (heterozygote) testing in at-risk families. BLM is included in expanded carrier screening panels, and most pathogenic variants can be identified through sequencing. Preimplantation and prenatal diagnosis are possible if the BLM pathogenic variants have been identified in the at-risk couple.","['Flanagan, Maeve', 'Cunniff, Christopher M']","['Flanagan M', 'Cunniff CM']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",Seattle (WA),,,,,,,,2019/02/14 06:00,2019/02/14 06:00,,,['NBK1398 [bookaccession]'],,,,,['HHSN276201400262U/NLM NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 1993-2022, University of Washington, Seattle.

20301488,,Publisher,,,,,,1993,Li-Fraumeni Syndrome,,,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a cancer predisposition syndrome associated with high risks for a diverse spectrum of childhood- and adult-onset malignancies. The lifetime risk of cancer in individuals with LFS is >/=70% for men and >/=90% for women. Five cancer types account for the majority of LFS tumors: adrenocortical carcinomas, breast cancer, central nervous system tumors, osteosarcomas, and soft-tissue sarcomas. LFS is associated with an increased risk of several additional cancers including leukemia, lymphoma, gastrointestinal cancers, cancers of head and neck, kidney, larynx, lung, skin (e.g., melanoma), ovary, pancreas, prostate, testis, and thyroid. Individuals with LFS are at increased risk for cancer in childhood and young adulthood; survivors are at increased risk for multiple primary cancers. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of LFS is established in a proband who meets ALL THREE classic clinical criteria and/or has a heterozygous germline pathogenic variant in TP53. Classic clinical criteria: A proband with a sarcoma diagnosed before age 45 years. A first-degree relative with any cancer diagnosed before age 45 years. A first- or second-degree relative with any cancer diagnosed before age 45 years or a sarcoma diagnosed at any age. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Routine oncologic management is recommended for malignancies, with the exception of breast cancer, in which bilateral mastectomy rather than lumpectomy is recommended in order to reduce the risks of a second primary breast cancer and avoid radiation therapy. Concerns about increased risk for radiation-induced second primary tumors has led to more cautious use of therapeutic radiation in general, but most experts recommend that treatment efficacy be prioritized above concerns about late effects after careful analysis of risks and benefits. Prevention of primary manifestations: Prophylactic bilateral mastectomy to reduce the risk for breast cancer is an option for women with a germline TP53 pathogenic variant. Colonoscopy may be considered surveillance as well as primary prevention of colorectal cancer. Avoidance of sun exposure, tobacco use, and exposure to other known or suspected carcinogens is encouraged. Surveillance: Comprehensive physical examination and ultrasound of abdomen and pelvis every 3-4 months from birth to age 18 years, annual neurologic exam and whole-body MRI including brain MRI from the time of diagnosis. In individuals 18 years or older, complete physical exam every 6 months, ultrasound of abdomen and pelvis and dermatologic exam annually. Women should have a clinical breast examination every 6-12 months beginning at age 20-25 years, annual breast MRI beginning at age 20-30 years, annual mammogram and breast MRI from age 30 to age 75 years. Upper endoscopy and colonoscopy are recommended every 2-5 years in individuals from age 25 years. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Minimize exposure to diagnostic and therapeutic radiation; avoid known carcinogens including sun exposure, tobacco use, occupational exposures, and excessive alcohol use. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to offer genetic counseling and testing to all relatives who are at risk of having a familial TP53 pathogenic variant. GENETIC COUNSELING: LFS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with LFS inherited a TP53 pathogenic variant from a parent. The proportion of individuals with a de novo germline TP53 pathogenic variant is estimated to be between 7% and 20%. Offspring of an individual with an established diagnosis of LFS (i.e., an individual who meets classic LFS criteria and/or has a heterozygous germline TP53 pathogenic variant) have a 50% risk of inheriting an LFS-causative pathogenic variant and having the cancer risks associated with LFS. Predictive testing for at-risk family members, prenatal testing, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if a TP53 germline pathogenic variant in the family has been identified.","['Schneider, Katherine', 'Zelley, Kristin', 'Nichols, Kim E', 'Garber, Judy']","['Schneider K', 'Zelley K', 'Nichols KE', 'Garber J']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",Seattle (WA),,,,,,,,2019/11/21 06:00,2019/11/21 06:00,,,['NBK1311 [bookaccession]'],,,,,['HHSN276201400262U/NLM NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 1993-2022, University of Washington, Seattle.

20301365,,Publisher,,,,,,1993,Cardiofaciocutaneous Syndrome,,,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome is characterized by cardiac abnormalities (pulmonic stenosis and other valve dysplasias, septal defects, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, rhythm disturbances), distinctive craniofacial appearance, and cutaneous abnormalities (including xerosis, hyperkeratosis, ichthyosis, keratosis pilaris, ulerythema ophryogenes, eczema, pigmented moles, hemangiomas, and palmoplantar hyperkeratosis). The hair is typically sparse, curly, fine or thick, woolly or brittle; eyelashes and eyebrows may be absent or sparse. Nails may be dystrophic or fast growing. Some form of neurologic and/or cognitive delay (ranging from mild to severe) is seen in all affected individuals. Neoplasia, mostly acute lymphoblastic leukemia, has been reported in some individuals. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Diagnosis is based on clinical findings and molecular genetic testing. The four genes known to be associated with CFC syndrome are: BRAF (~75%), MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 (~25%), and KRAS (<2%). MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Care by a multidisciplinary team; management of cardiac structural defects, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmias as in the general population; increased ambient humidity or hydrating lotions for xerosis and pruritus; increased caloric intake and a nasogastric tube or gastrostomy for severe feeding problems; surgical intervention for severe gastroesophageal reflux; routine management of growth hormone deficiency, ocular abnormalities; management of seizures may require polytherapy; occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech therapy as needed. Consensus medical management guidelines have been published. Prevention of secondary complications: Antibiotic prophylaxis for subacute bacterial endocarditis primarily for those with valve dysplasias; evaluation for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or a predisposition to cardiac rhythm disturbances prior to anesthesia. Surveillance: Periodic echocardiogram (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), electrocardiogram (rhythm disturbances), neurologic and eye examination, scoliosis check, and assessment of growth and cognitive development. GENETIC COUNSELING: Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most affected individuals have CFC as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. The offspring of an affected individual are at a 50% risk of inheriting a CFC-related pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at risk is possible if the BRAF, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, or KRAS pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member.","['Rauen, Katherine A']",['Rauen KA'],,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",Seattle (WA),,,,,,,,2016/03/03 06:00,2016/03/03 06:00,,,['NBK1186 [bookaccession]'],,,,,['HHSN276201400262U/NLM NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 1993-2022, University of Washington, Seattle.

20301303,,Publisher,,,,,,1993,Noonan Syndrome,,,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Noonan syndrome (NS) is characterized by characteristic facies, short stature, congenital heart defect, and developmental delay of variable degree. Other findings can include broad or webbed neck, unusual chest shape with superior pectus carinatum and inferior pectus excavatum, cryptorchidism, varied coagulation defects, lymphatic dysplasias, and ocular abnormalities. Although birth length is usually normal, final adult height approaches the lower limit of normal. Congenital heart disease occurs in 50%-80% of individuals. Pulmonary valve stenosis, often with dysplasia, is the most common heart defect and is found in 20%-50% of individuals. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, found in 20%-30% of individuals, may be present at birth or develop in infancy or childhood. Other structural defects include atrial and ventricular septal defects, branch pulmonary artery stenosis, and tetralogy of Fallot. Up to one fourth of affected individuals have mild intellectual disability, and language impairments in general are more common in NS than in the general population. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of Noonan is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in BRAF, KRAS, MAP2K1, MRAS, NRAS, PTPN11, RAF1, RASA2, RIT1, RRAS2, SOS1, or SOS2 or either a heterozygous variant or biallelic pathogenic variants in LZTR1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Several additional genes associated with a Noonan syndrome-like phenotype in fewer than ten individuals have been identified. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Cardiovascular anomalies in NS are usually treated as in the general population. Developmental disabilities are addressed by early intervention programs and individualized education strategies. Treatment for serious bleeding is guided by knowledge of the specific factor deficiency or platelet aggregation anomaly. Growth hormone (GH) treatment increases growth velocity. Standard treatment for juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and other malignancies, feeding difficulties, ADHD, behavioral problems, cryptorchidism in males, renal anomalies/hydronephrosis, strabismus, hearing loss, and Chiari malformation. Surveillance: At each visit: measurement of growth parameters; evaluation of nutritional status in infants and toddlers; monitor for evidence of new neurologic manifestations (chronic headache, neck pain, changes in tone, dizziness, or obstructive sleep apnea); monitor developmental progress; assessment of behavioral issues, as age appropriate; skin examination. Annually in childhood or as clinically indicated: ophthalmology and audiology evaluations. In children <5 years: if initial cardiac evaluation is normal, at least annual cardiac evaluations until age 5 years. In children >5 years through adulthood, cardiac evaluation at least every 5 years, or as clinically indicated. Prior to any surgical procedure or in those with clinical bleeding: assessment of bleeding history, CBC with differential, and consideration of measurement of coagulation factors. For those with pathogenic PTPN11 or KRAS variants: consider physical examination with assessment of spleen size & CBC every 3-6 months until age 5 years to assess for concerns about JMML/malignancy. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Aspirin therapy should be avoided because it may exacerbate a bleeding diathesis. Pregnancy management: Consider referral to an adult congenital heart program for peripartum evaluation and management; consider a hematology referral if the affected pregnant woman has a history of bleeding abnormalities and/or has not undergone previous screening for coagulopathy. GENETIC COUNSELING: NS is most often inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. While many individuals with autosomal dominant NS have a de novo pathogenic variant, an affected parent is recognized in 30%-75% of families. The risk to sibs of a proband with autosomal dominant NS depends on the genetic status of the parents: if a parent is affected, the risk is 50%; when the parents are clinically unaffected, the risk to the sibs of a proband appears to be low (<1%). Each child of an individual with autosomal dominant NS has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. NS caused by pathogenic variants in LZTR1 can be inherited in either an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive manner. The parents of an individual with autosomal recessive NS are typically heterozygotes (i.e., have one LZTR1 pathogenic variant), and may either be asymptomatic or have mild features of NS. If both parents are heterozygous for one LZTR1 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of having one LZTR1 pathogenic variant (which can be associated with mild NS features), and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the NS-related pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member.","['Roberts, Amy E']",['Roberts AE'],,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",Seattle (WA),,,,,,,,2021/12/16 06:00,2021/12/16 06:00,,,['NBK1124 [bookaccession]'],,,,,['HHSN276201400262U/NLM NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 1993-2022, University of Washington, Seattle.

By gene targeting, we have recently generated mice expressing a functionally inactive mutant vitamin D receptor (VDR). After a change in environmental conditions from specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions to a modified barrier system, a high percentage of aged mutant, but not wild-type, mice developed a haematological disorder characterized by splenomegaly, granulocytosis, thrombocytosis and dysplastic changes with displacement of erythropoiesis in bone marrow during the following months. All cases were associated with very high serum levels of the acute phase reaction protein serum amyloid A (SAA). Serological testing of affected mice revealed antibodies against murine hepatitis virus (MHV). However, electron microscopy of spleen and bone marrow cells did not reveal virus particles, and clinical signs of infectious diseases were absent. We hypothesize that a non-functioning VDR is associated with a latent defect in the regulation of myeloid cell differentiation and proliferation. Under the conditions of environmental stress, this latent defect may predispose to a deregulation of myelopoiesis in the form of a leukaemoid reaction accompanied by dysplastic changes. Thus, 1,25(OH)(2) D(3) may be an important inhibitory factor in the onset and progression of myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic diseases.","['Erben, Reinhold G', 'Zeitz, Ute', 'Weber, Karin', 'Stierstorfer, Birgit', 'Wolf, Georg', 'Schmahl, Wolfgang', 'Balling, Rudi', 'Quintanilla-Martinez, Leticia']","['Erben RG', 'Zeitz U', 'Weber K', 'Stierstorfer B', 'Wolf G', 'Schmahl W', 'Balling R', 'Quintanilla-Martinez L']","['Institute of Animal Physiology, Ludwig Maximilians University, Veterinarstrasse, Munich, Germany.

This method is fast, extremely sensitive, and accurate, requires only very small amounts of input RNA, and is relatively simple to perform. These characteristics have made it the method of choice for minimal residual disease monitoring such as in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). CML comprises approximately 20% of all leukemias and is characterized by a balanced (9;22) chromosomal translocation that results in the formation of a chimeric gene comprised of the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene and the ABL oncogene (BCR-ABL fusion gene). The chimeric gene encodes a fusion protein with constitutively increased tyrosine kinase activity, resulting in growth factor-independent proliferation. This kinase is the target for current CML therapy, and BCR-ABL fusion gene levels are monitored to determine the effectiveness of this therapy. This chapter uses BCR-ABL transcript detection to illustrate an example for the RQ-PCR and describes a RQ-PCR method to detect the most common form of the BCR-ABL fusion transcript in CML, known as p210 BCR-ABL.","['Fan, Hongxin', 'Robetorye, Ryan S']","['Fan H', 'Robetorye RS']","['Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Department of Pathology, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Reference Standards', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",,2010/03/20 06:00,2010/06/09 06:00,['2010/03/20 06:00'],"['2010/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-60761-629-0_13 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2010;630:199-213. doi: 10.1007/978-1-60761-629-0_13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In clinical studies of HLA-mismatched HSCT, strong GVL effects have been reported. In the present study, we addressed the mechanism of the GVL and GVH response using MHC-haploidentical murine bone marrow transplantation (BMT) models. Recipient BDF1 (H-2(b/d)) mice received T cell-depleted bone marrow and spleen cells from B6C3F1 (H-2(b/k)) or C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) mice with or without P815 mastocytoma cells (H-2(d)) after receiving lethal total body irradiation. B6C3F1 --> BDF1 (hetero-to-hetero type) recipients showed more powerful antileukemic effects with less severe GVHD than C57BL/6 --> BDF1 (parent-to-F1 type) recipients. Compared with C57BL/6 --> BDF1 recipients, significantly higher in vitro cytotoxic activity against P815 cells was observed in B6C3F1 --> BDF1 recipients. Significantly lower CXCR3 expression on donor T cells and higher interferon (IFN)-gamma expression were considered to be associated with strong antileukemic effects with less severe GVHD in B6C3F1 --> BDF1 recipients. Furthermore, host immune cells, especially natural killer cells and CD8(+) T cells, were found to contribute remarkably to high IFN-gamma production in B6C3F1 --> BDF1 recipients.

IDO inhibitors as 1-methyl tryptophan (1MT) can abrogate IDO enzymatic activity and may result in an effective immune response. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were separated from peripheral blood of 25 AML patients and 25 normal adults. IDO expression was detected by RT-PCR and its enzymatic activity by a colorimetric method. MNCs were cultured and the effects of Adriamycin, 1MT and a mixture of both on blast and lymphocyte cell counts after 24 and 72 h were detected. IDO mRNA and activity were detected in 52% of patients and absent in normal subjects. There was a significant correlation between IDO mRNA expression and its enzymatic activity in AML. IDO activity was correlated positively with patient's ages and negatively with hemoglobin levels. There was a significant inhibition of blast cells proliferation with Adriamycin and more inhibition when combined with 1MT. The inhibition was more after 72 h more than 24 h of culture. However, using 1MT alone showed no significant inhibitory effect on blast cells, with a significant increase in lymphocyte counts.

Yet, in T cells, glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis is readily inhibited by lymphocyte activation and signaling. We have previously shown that the Src family kinase, Lck (lymphocyte cell-specific tyrosine kinase), which is predominantly expressed in T cells, interacts with IP3 receptors to facilitate calcium signaling. Here, we discovered that dexamethasone downregulates Lck, which, in turn, suppresses lymphocyte activation by inhibiting pro-survival calcium oscillations. Moreover, stable expression of shRNAs that selectively targeted Lck or treatment with the Src inhibitor dasatinib (BMS-354825) enhanced apoptosis induction by dexamethasone. To investigate the effect of Lck inhibition in a primary leukemia model, we employed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells that aberrantly expressed Lck and were relatively insensitive to dexamethasone. Lck expression was correlated with resistance to dexamethasone in CLL cells, and its inhibition by dasatinib or other inhibitors markedly enhanced glucocorticoid sensitivity. Collectively, these data indicate that Lck protects cells from glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and its inhibition enhances sensitivity to dexamethasone. Small-molecule inhibitors of Lck, such as dasatinib, may function to reverse glucocorticoid resistance in some lymphoid malignancies.","['Harr, M W', 'Caimi, P F', 'McColl, K S', 'Zhong, F', 'Patel, S N', 'Barr, P M', 'Distelhorst, C W']","['Harr MW', 'Caimi PF', 'McColl KS', 'Zhong F', 'Patel SN', 'Barr PM', 'Distelhorst CW']","['Department of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106-7285, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dasatinib', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/agonists', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2010/03/20 06:00,2011/01/14 06:00,['2010/03/20 06:00'],"['2010/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201025 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2010.25 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2010 Sep;17(9):1381-91. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2010.25.

METHODS: Minor-allele enrichment and detection were performed with snapback primers in the presence of a saturating DNA dye within a closed tube. A 5' tail of nucleotides on 1 PCR primer hybridizes to the variable locus of its extension product to produce a hairpin that selectively enriches mismatched alleles. Genotyping performed after rapid-cycle PCR by melting of the secondary structure identifies different variants by the hairpin melting temperature (T(m)). Needle aspirates of thyroid tissue (n = 47) and paraffin-embedded biopsy samples (n = 44) were analyzed for BRAF (v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1) variant p.V600E, and the results were compared with those for dual hybridization probe analysis. Needle aspirates of lung tumors (n = 8) were analyzed for EGFR [epidermal growth factor receptor (erythroblastic leukemia viral (v-erb-b) oncogene homolog, avian)] exon 19 in-frame deletions. RESULTS: Use of 18-s cycles and momentary extension times of ""0 s"" with rapid-cycle PCR increased the selective amplification of mismatched alleles. A low Mg(2+) concentration and a higher hairpin T(m) relative to the extension temperature also improved the detection limit of mismatched alleles. The detection limit was 0.1% for BRAF p.V600E and 0.02% for EGFR exon 19 in-frame deletions. Snapback and dual hybridization probe methods for allele quantification of the thyroid samples correlated well (R(2) = 0.93) with 2 more BRAF mutations (45 and 43, respectively, of 91 samples) detected after snapback enrichment. Different EGFR in-frame deletions in the lung samples produced different hairpin T(m)s. CONCLUSIONS: Use of snapback primers for enrichment and detection of minority alleles is simple, is inexpensive to perform, and can be completed in a closed tube in <25 min.","['Zhou, Luming', 'Palais, Robert A', 'Smith, G Denice', 'Anderson, Daniel', 'Rowe, Leslie R', 'Wittwer, Carl T']","['Zhou L', 'Palais RA', 'Smith GD', 'Anderson D', 'Rowe LR', 'Wittwer CT']","['Department of Pathology, University of Utah Health Sciences Center, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, USA. luming.zhou@path.utah.edu']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers/*genetics', 'ErbB Receptors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Limit of Detection', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/economics/*methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/*genetics', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/genetics']",,2010/03/20 06:00,2010/05/19 06:00,['2010/03/20 06:00'],"['2010/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['clinchem.2009.142034 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2009.142034 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2010 May;56(5):814-22. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2009.142034.

In mice, it is believed that a homogeneous stem cell population of single spermatogonia supports spermatogenesis, and that differentiation, which is accompanied by the formation of connected cells (cysts) of increasing length, is linear and nonreversible. We evaluated this model with the use of lineage analysis and live imaging, and found that this putative stem cell population is not homogeneous. Instead, the stem cell pool that supports steady-state spermatogenesis is contained within a subpopulation of single spermatogonia. We also found that cysts are not committed to differentiation and appear to recover stem cell potential by fragmentation, and that the fate of individual spermatogonial populations was markedly altered during regeneration after damage. Thus, there are multiple and reversible paths from stem cells to differentiation, and these may also occur in other systems.","['Nakagawa, Toshinori', 'Sharma, Manju', 'Nabeshima, Yo-ichi', 'Braun, Robert E', 'Yoshida, Shosei']","['Nakagawa T', 'Sharma M', 'Nabeshima Y', 'Braun RE', 'Yoshida S']","['Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Gfra1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neurog3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cadherins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Receptors/genetics/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Biological', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Regeneration', '*Spermatogenesis', 'Spermatogonia/*cytology/*physiology', 'Stem Cell Niche', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology']",,2010/03/20 06:00,2010/04/17 06:00,['2010/03/20 06:00'],"['2010/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['science.1182868 [pii]', '10.1126/science.1182868 [doi]']",ppublish,Science. 2010 Apr 2;328(5974):62-7. doi: 10.1126/science.1182868.

We examined the potential regulatory role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in this process. Genome-wide expression profiling identified 21 miRNAs (miRs) that were induced by the treatment of K562 cells with PMA. Among them, the expression of miR-34a, miR-221, and miR-222 was induced in the early stages and maintained throughout the late stages of differentiation. Cell signaling analysis showed that the activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) in response to PMA strongly induced miR-34a expression by transactivation via the activator protein-1 binding site in the upstream region of the miR-34a gene. Reporter gene assays identified mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) as a direct target of miR-34a and c-fos as a direct target of miR-221/222. Although overexpression of the three miRNAs had little effect on cell differentiation, overexpression of miR-34a significantly repressed the proliferation of K562 cells with a concomitant reduction in MEK1 protein expression. Conversely, a locked nucleic acid probe against miR-34a significantly enhanced the proliferation of PMA-treated K562 cells. Taken together, the results show that PMA activates the MEK-ERK pathway and strongly induces miRNA-34a expression, which in turn inhibits cell proliferation by repressing the expression of MEK1. Thus, the results highlight an important regulatory role for miR-34a in the process of megakaryocytic differentiation, especially in the arrest of cell growth, which is a prerequisite for cells to enter differentiation.","['Ichimura, Atsuhiko', 'Ruike, Yoshinao', 'Terasawa, Kazuya', 'Shimizu, Kazuharu', 'Tsujimoto, Gozoh']","['Ichimura A', 'Ruike Y', 'Terasawa K', 'Shimizu K', 'Tsujimoto G']","['Department of Genomic Drug Discovery Science, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto University, 46-29 Yoshida Shimoadachi-cho Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (MIRN34 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",,2010/03/20 06:00,2010/06/02 06:00,['2010/03/20 06:00'],"['2010/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.109.063321 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.109.063321 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2010 Jun;77(6):1016-24. doi: 10.1124/mol.109.063321.

A modified comet assay was used as a sensitive method for the detection of FA-induced DNA-protein cross links (DPX) because DPX are the most relevant type of FA-induced DNA damage. Our results clearly indicate that co-cultivation of lymphocytes with HNEC exposed to FA for 1 h causes a concentration-related induction of DPX in lymphocytes when co-cultivation takes place in the exposure medium. However, when the exposure medium is changed after FA treatment of HNEC and before lymphocytes are added, no induction of DPX is measured in lymphocytes even after exposure of HNEC to high FA concentrations (300 microM) and extended co-cultivation (4 h). Direct measurement of FA in the cell culture medium by a sensitive fluorescent detection kit indicated that FA is actually not released even from highly exposed cells into the cell culture medium. These results suggest that FA that has entered nasal epithelial cells is not released and does not damage other cells in close proximity to the epithelial cells. If these results also apply to the in vivo situation, FA would only be genotoxic towards directly exposed cells (site of first contact) and there should be no significant delivery of inhaled FA to other cells and distant sites. Our results do not support a recently proposed hypothetic mechanism for FA-induced leukaemia by damaging circulating haematopoietic stem cells or haematopoietic progenitor cells in nasal passages, which then travel to the bone marrow and become initiated leukaemic stem cells.","['Neuss, Simone', 'Moepps, Barbara', 'Speit, Gunter']","['Neuss S', 'Moepps B', 'Speit G']","['Institut fur Humangenetik, Universitat Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,"['0 (Mutagens)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Comet Assay', '*DNA Damage', 'Epithelial Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Formaldehyde/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Nasal Mucosa/*cytology/drug effects']",,2010/03/20 06:00,2010/10/22 06:00,['2010/03/20 06:00'],"['2010/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['geq013 [pii]', '10.1093/mutage/geq013 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutagenesis. 2010 Jul;25(4):359-64. doi: 10.1093/mutage/geq013.

We examined the overall and specific cancer risks among Swedish subjects following hospitalization for these diseases. METHODS: PMR and GCA patients were identified from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register and by linking them with the Cancer Registry. Follow-up of patients was carried out from the last hospitalization through year 2006. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated in these patients compared with subjects without the diseases. RESULTS: A total of 35 918 patients were hospitalized for PMR and GCA during the years 1965-2006; the hospitalization rate increased towards late age. A total of 3941 patients developed subsequent cancer, giving an overall SIR of 1.19; and for cancer diagnosed later than 1 year of follow-up, the SIR was 1.06. A significant excess was noted for skin (squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma), stomach, lung, prostate, kidney, nervous system and endocrine gland tumours, and additionally for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, myeloma and leukaemia. Decreased risk was noted for endometrial cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Patients hospitalized for PMR and GCA had a marginally increased risk of cancer, with the highest risk noted for the first year after hospitalization. However, for specific cancers, such as skin cancer and leukaemia, the increases were still significant for patients diagnosed later than 1 year after hospitalization, suggesting that these could be true associations, but the mechanisms remain to be established.","['Ji, Jianguang', 'Liu, Xiangdong', 'Sundquist, Kristina', 'Sundquist, Jan', 'Hemminki, Kari']","['Ji J', 'Liu X', 'Sundquist K', 'Sundquist J', 'Hemminki K']","['Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, CRC, hus 28, plan 11, ing 72, UMAS, 205 02 Malmo, Sweden.

In addition, a series of AraU monophosphate prodrugs in the form of triester phosphoramidates (ProTides) were also synthesized and tested against a range of viruses, leukaemia and solid tumour cell lines. Unfortunately, neither the parent compound (AraU) nor any of its ProTides showed antiviral activity, nor potent inhibitory activity against any of the cancer cell lines. Therefore, the metabolism of AraU phosphoramidates to release AraU monophosphate was investigated. The results showed carboxypeptidase Y, hog liver esterase and crude CEM tumor cell extracts to hydrolyse the ester motif of phosphoramidates with subsequent loss of the aryl group, while molecular modelling studies suggested that the AraU l-alanine aminoacyl phosphate derivative might not be a good substrate for the phosphoramidase enzyme Hint-1. These findings are in agreement with the observed disappearance of intact prodrug and concomitant appearance of the corresponding phosphoramidate intermediate derivative in CEM cell extracts without measurable formation of araU monophosphate.

AIM OF THE STUDY: To summarise ethnomedicinal uses of Cussonia and to find scientific evidence in support of selected main uses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method, leaves of 13 Cussonia species, Schefflera umbellifera and Seemannaralia gerrardii were tested against pathogens associated with diarrhoea (Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli), sexually transmitted infections (Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Trichomonas vaginalis) and general infectious diseases (Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Antimalarial sensitivity was studied using Plasmodium falciparum and the [(3)H]-hypoxanthine incorporation assay. Cytotoxic effects on a T-cell leukaemia (Jurkat) cell line were determined using the tetrazolium-based cellular toxicity assay. RESULTS: Methanolic extracts were active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC of 1.0-1.5 mg/mL), Trichomonas vaginalis (MIC of 0.8-1.3 mg/mL) and Staphylococcus aureus (Cussonia arborea, 1.8 mg/mL). All samples were active against Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC of 0.02-0.7 mg/mL). The methanol extract of Cussonia arborea was the most active against Plasmodium falciparum (13.68 microg/mL) and showed anticancer properties (5.60 microg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: The traditional use of Cussonia species to treat sexually transmitted diseases and Plasmodium infections appears to have a scientific basis.","['De Villiers, B J', 'Van Vuuren, S F', 'Van Zyl, R L', 'Van Wyk, B-E']","['De Villiers BJ', 'Van Vuuren SF', 'Van Zyl RL', 'Van Wyk BE']","['Department of Botany and Plant Biotechnology, University of Johannesburg, Gauteng, Johannesburg, South Africa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antimalarials)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Antimalarials/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Araliaceae/*chemistry', 'Bacteria/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine/metabolism', 'Medicine, African Traditional', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves', 'Plasmodium falciparum/drug effects']",,2010/03/20 06:00,2010/10/29 06:00,['2010/03/20 06:00'],"['2009/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2010/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(10)00129-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2010.02.014 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2010 May 27;129(2):189-96. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2010.02.014.

The authors present a novel case of mucositis-related pain that is effectively treated with sublingual methadone. Sublingual methadone is an alternative to standard treatment options for mucositis-related pain and has unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that make methadone a suitable agent for this pathology.
